3,Dr LIDDELL,Unknown,"I wish to know from the Postmaster-General if , in his opinion, there is any prospect of the investigations of the Postal Commission being concluded at an early date, and if , before they are finished, he will take into consideration the advisability of suggesting a personal inquiry into the postal system of New Zealand?",14
4,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"I am unable to express an opinion regarding the probable termination of the labours of the Postal Commission, and feel some delicacy about making any suggestion to its members. Perhaps the honourable member could bring the shall matter directly before them.",14
5,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"On more than one occasion I have written to the Postmaster General's Department regarding private letter-boxes, and today I received the folfollow :lowing reply : Owing to a shortage of private box fronts, and unavoidable delay in obtaining a supply from America, it has been found impossible to fullv meet requirements ofcountry post-offices. Has the Postmaster-General, or the Department, at any time endeavoured to obtain private letter-box fronts locally? It is ridiculous to have to send to America for them.",15

Now that the honourable gentleman's attention has been called to the matter, will he take steps to contradict this lamentably misleading statement ?",15
15,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I cannot undertake to correct every press mis-statement. The preparation of the Defence Bill has not depended on the business of the House. I hope to have the measure ready in a day or two.,15

29,Sir JOHN FORREST,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"Swan-Trea the oldsurer) [3.11] - I move That a sum not exceeding ^562,017 be granted to His Majesty for or towards defraying the services of the year ending 30th June, 1910. As honourable members on a former occasion seemed to desire it, I intend at this stage to make a few observations in connection with the Supply Bill to be introduced. It covers expenditure necessary in connection with the various votes appearing in the Estimates, which have been, or are still to be, considered by the Committee of Supply. Honourable members are aware that Estimates for additions, new works, and buildings to the amount of £ 1 , 0 5 4 , 1 24 have already been dealt with, and that an amount of £1,721,208, representing special appropriations, covers statutory payments in connection with which no action by the House is necessary at this time. A balance of £5,092,289 is included in the votes appearing in the Estimates for carrying on the services of the various Departments of the Government. For this purpose temporary Supply to the extent of £562,017 is now being asked for. I am glad to be able to inform honourable members that so far the revenue of the Commonwealth from the two principal sources of Customs and Excise and the Post Office is well up to expectations. Up to the 7th of this month the Customs and Excise revenue of the present financial year OF exceeded the amount received during the corresponding period of last year by £77 -3 48 The revenue from the Post Office, telegraphs, and telephones for the same period shows an increase of £ 4 4 , 4 3 6 on the amount received from these sources during the corresponding period of last year. The estimate presented by the Government of revenue from Customs and Excise for the whole year showed a decrease on the revenue received during the previous year of £43,985, but up to the 7th of this month the actual receipts show an increase on the previous year's figures of £77,384. In was estimated that the revenue from the Post and Telegraph Department would exceed that of the previous year by £140,993, and up to the date mentioned we received towards making good that estimate an increase upon the revenue received last year of £44,436. It will therefore be seen that on the results from the first two months and seven days of the current financial year the prospect that the estimated revenue for the year will be realized is excellent. I shall be very glad to give any information that honourable members desire in regard to the Bill. Jt contains no unusual provisions, and covers merely the votes required for one month for carrying on the services of the various Departments.",17
30,Mr FISHER,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"Wide Bay) [3.19] - I judge, by the amount asked for, that the Bill is intended to cover one month's supply.",18
31,Sir JOHN FORREST,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,That is so.,18
32,Mr FISHER,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"I congratulate the Treaelection. surer on the fact that, from revenue point of view, the operations of the first two months and seven days of the current financial year have been satisfactory. In a generous mood, might say that doubtless the increase in the revenue is due to the fact that Fusion Government have been in office. I am satisfied that the members of the Goman vernment are as willing to acceptflatteryof that kind as they are ready to heap merited condemnation on the Opposition. Amongst the pettinesses which have been displayed in this Parliament are the stateway."" ments of various members of the Governbe ment regarding the Opposition. I do not think that, in my parliamentary experience, I remember ever before to have known Ministers so ready, both outside and inside the House, to give the public the impresBill, sion that they are prevented from carrying on the business of the country by the actions of honourable members in Opposition. I do not think I ever knew a body of men, so competent otherwise, who were so anxious to misrepresent the position of their ponents in order to excuse their own tence as a Government. SIR JOHN FORREST - Do not say that.",18
33,Mr FISHER,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,I am glad to see the Minister of Defence present.,18
34,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,The honourable member is a fine man to suggest impotence on our part.,18
35,Mr FISHER,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"If the Minister of Defence will allow me to say so, I am pleased that he did not receive serious injury in the accident which recently befell him. Our fight, after all, is a political, and not a personal, one. As for the suggestion of impotence on my own part, he knows in his own mind, whether he will admit it or not, that no threats have ever been able to influence my judgment. Since the honourable gentleman has called attention to himself, I should like to draw attention to the fact that a member of the Ministry to whom we are asked to grant Supply has told the public that they are going to stifle discussion in this House; that they are going to apply the ""gag;"" that they are going to compel the expression of .their views in legislation, not by reason or argument, but by using a majority that was not obtained on any policy put before the country. That majority was obtained by compromising on political principles, with the object, openly and avowedly admitted by the leaders, of protecting their seats, at the next general The honourable member for Maria byrnong and the .honourable member for Bourke know that that is so.",18
36,Mr HUME COOK,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,I do not. - Mr FISHER - The admission was I openly made by the Prime Minister.,18
37,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,Is the honourable the member sure that he is not dreaming ?,18
38,Mr FISHER,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"The honourable gentlehas said that the Government are kept in duress by a minority in this House, and unthat they are going to apply the ""gag."" My reply to that, here as it has been outside, is, "" Let them proceed in their own But could a more paltering position taken up by a Government than that which has been adopted by the present Ministry in relation to the Defence Bill? More than a month ago, the Minister of Defence applied for leave to introduce the but we have not yet seen it. The Prime Minister some six months ago waxed eloquent about the necessity of calling Parliament together at once to deal with the important question of defence, and yet the Defence Bill has not yet been submitted. opDoes that not indicate impotence or-someimpothing worse on the part of the Government ?",18
39,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"What has the honourable member to say as to the impotence of his own Government, which remained in office for something like eight months, and did not produce one Bill? That was both impotent and impudent.",18
40,Mr FISHER,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"I hope that the honourable member will not lose his temper. He knows full well that we had a draft Defence Bill ready. The honourable member would endeavour to lead the people to believe that the Labour Government had an opportunity to introduce that and other measures, when, as a matter of fact, honourable members opposite, for reasons best known to themselves, prevented the Government proceeding with any measures. Whatever they may say of us in other respects, they cannot say that we were lacking in courage. The first and only Bill that we had an opportunity to introduce remains on the notice-paper. Had the opportunity offered, we should have introduced others.",19
41,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,Poo r things ! It is time that this whining was stopped.,19
42,Mr FISHER,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,I think that it is time that the honourable member stopped whining. Poor thing!,19
43,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,The honourable member has not ceased whining since he has been in Opposition.,19
44,Mr FISHER,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"It is not long since that the honourable member for Parramatta, in a speech at Ipswich, referred to the present Prime Minister and his party as fowls out in the rain; few, wet, and feeble! Then again, the right honourable member for Swan, when in the Opposition corner, used to breathe out threatenings against the Prime Minister for continuing to pass legislation with the support Labour party.",19
45,Sir JOHN FORREST,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,I never threatened the Prime Minister.,19
46,Mr FISHER,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,The right honourable member said that as long as the Prime Minister received the support of the Labour party he would decline to give him any assistance in passing legislation.,19
47,Sir JOHN IFORREST,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,I did not say that.,19
48,Mr FISHER,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"The right honourable gentleman, despite his ability, wit, and good nature, sometimes lost his temper when sitting in the Opposition corner, and threatened the Prime Minister for continuing in office with the support of the Labour party.",19
49,Sir JOHN FORREST,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,I did not threaten the Prime Minister. I was always on excellent terms with him.,19
50,Mr FISHER,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"I quite agree that the Prime Minister possesses an affable manner, which enables him to keep on friendly terms, personally, with all with whom he is associated politically.",19
51,Mr ROBERTS,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,Was the Treasurer friendly with the Prime Minister when he forsook him while he was on a bed of sickness ?,19
52,Mr FISHER,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"I do not propose to revert to the time when the Treasurer left the former Deakin Ministry; but the Prime Minister will admit that whilst he was ill, and in political difficulties, he did not lack the support of our party.",19
53,Sir JOHN FORREST,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,The Labour party turned him out of office.,19
54,Mr FISHER,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,Fro m time to time the Prime Minister received private warnings long before we intimated to the House the reasons why the Labour party could not continue to support his Government.,19
55,Mr DEAKIN,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"The fact, not the reason, was stated.",19
56,Mr FISHER,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,Mus t I read again the detailed reasons given as to why the Labour party could not continue to support the former Deakin Administration?,19
57,Mr DEAKIN,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,I should be glad to see them in print. I do not remember having heard them.,19
58,Mr ROBERTS,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,The Prime Minister has the most convenient memory of any man in the 'Commonwealth.,19
59,Mr FISHER,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"The reasons were given in ample detail in this House. I do not say that the suggestion that they were not given is a wilful misrepresentation; but I repeat that they were fully stated at the of the time, and that the language employed should have satisfied any reasonable person who was prepared to draw fair conclusions from it. I said that we, as a party, had continued to support the Government of the day as long as we could do so in the public interest.",19
60,Dr LIDDELL,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,As long as the Labour party could get what they wanted out of theni they supported them.,19
61,Mr FISHER,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"'What did we desire to obtain from that Government? Nothing more than the passing of legislation which we had, pledged ourselves to our constituents to support. We had pledged ourselves to endeavour to carry certain legislation, and we entered this House determined to attempt to do so. Some members of the present Ministry, as well as others sitting behind them, were returned pledged practically to the same principles. Where are they today? They are associated with those who spent most of their time on the public platform villifying the propositions of the Prime Minister and those who supported him.",19
62,Sir JOHN FORREST,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,It is that we never understood it !,20
63,Mr FISHER,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"It is not more astonishing than some other events in the House. I do not desire to go into ancient history, but I can remember the Prime Minister's speech at Ballarat before the Reid-MCLean Government was turned out. read that speech in one way except the Prime Minister himself.",20
64,Mr DEAKIN,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"There was a casual statement made, without a chance of contradiction.",20
65,Mr FISHER,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,It was a correct statement.,20
66,Mr DEAKIN,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,It was absolutely incorrect.,20
67,Mr FISHER,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"I disagree with the Prime Minister, because, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, it was regarded as a notice to quit to the Government.",20
68,Mr DEAKIN,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"That opinion may have been expressed; but the honourable member puts it forward as a fact, and that I challenge.",20
69,Mr FISHER,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"The Prime Minister knows that I never challenged his word at any time, nor do I now, when he says it was not his intention to oust the Ministry. I am putting the statement forward as a counter to what is being said by members of the present Government.",20
70,Mr FRAZER,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,How did the Prime Minister act ? .That is the thing.,20
71,Mr FISHER,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,That belongs to the dead past.,20
72,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,It belongs to living present.,20
73,Mr FISHER,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"I regard it as belonging to the past. As a party we supported the present Prime Minister's measures afterwards, and made it possible for him to remain in office. I make no complaint on the score of his leaving the Labour party; every honourable member is entitled to leave a party when he thinks that, by so doing, he can better observe his pledges and act in the interests of the country. It has been said that the Labour party assigned no reasons for withdrawing their support from the Deakin Government ; but speaking on the n t h November, 1908, in this Chamber, as reported in Hansard, Vol. XLVIIL , p. 2136, I said I desire to intimate to the House, and to the country, that which I have already privately intimated to the Prime Minister; that the Labour Party can no longer support the Government. I can only say that our relations with the Ministry, personally, have been of the most friendly character. Although from antonishing time to time embarrassing circumstances have arisen, we have always endeavoured to cooperate in every possible way with the Government in regard to matters that we thought concerned the welfare of the Commonwealth. There have been situations of embarrassment in which I have always sought, to the best of my ability, to safeguard the interests of the Parliament, and the well-being of the country. Everybody 'Whilst I freely admit ""that we have frequently felt the restraint that a large party such as ours must feel in difficult circumstances, I , personally, have always held that, occupying the position that we do, we must treat any Government situated as this Ministry is, in a perfectly straightforward manner. We are taking this course now, because it is, to our minds, one of decency, and of order. The time might come when one party or the other might take such action as would create a crisis, in circumstances that would render it impossible for the country to learn exactly how the situation arose. I have endeavoured, whilst safeguarding the interests of the Commonwealth, to restrain within reasonable bounds .any adverse criticism, and now that I can no longer do that, I think that I am performing what is more a public that a party duty in telling tht House and the country the determination at which we have arrived. I have stated our position as plainly as I can, and have only to add that in taking the course which T did 'during a previous crisis, I had the support of my party, the members of which felt that until at least the Tariff was dealt with there rested upon us the public duty of giving the Government a reasonable support in every situation that a party placed as they were and are might find themselves in.",20
74,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,I cannot see any reasons given in that extract.,20
75,Mr FISHER,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"The best of all reasons - the public interests. Our party was split once or twice; and the Government unforthe tunately were defeated. The Government were practically breaking up, as is shown by the fact that, on a matter of the greatest public importance, concerning the Ministry, the Prime Minister decided that, instead of voting, he would walk out. Surely that was a difficult situation for one in my position to meet.",20
76,Mr DEAKIN,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,That was a different situation altogether.,20
77,Mr FISHER,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"But my party had to decide between one of two courses. In my opinion, it was impossible, in the case of the honourable member for Maribvrnong, who was then Postmaster-General, 'for the Prime Minister to leave his Minister, and allow the matter to be decided by the House; and the time had undoubtedly come when a perfectly straightforward course had to be taken. If honourable members wish to know whether there was any secret compact between the Labour party and the Prime Minister, I say at once that there was not ; and I need not repeat what I have said a hundred times, both privately and publicly, that no dishonourable request was at any time made by my party at the head of the Government. Again and again it was said by the Opposition that there was a secret compact,, under which pressure was brought to bear on the Prime Minister; but I say there was nothing of the kind.",20
78,Mr DEAKIN,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"Hear , hear !",21
79,Mr FISHER,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"Whateve r differences of opinion there might be, we could fight them on a high and honourable plane.",21
80,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,- I think I have heard of the honourable member saying that he forced the Prime Minister to pass the Surplus Revenue Bill.,21
81,Mr FISHER,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"I do not think that I was ever heard to use such words. Unfortunately, I am not the only person, who, by reason of a condensed report, has been made to express views more definite and drastic than any uttered. At any rate, we are asked to vote a month's supply to a Government in which we do not believe. We should, of course, vote the money cheerfully; the Government being the only party that can advise the representative of the Crown, Ave must reluctantly give them Supply. I rose, however, principally to point out that since the last Supply Bill was passed, the Government have gone out of their way to give away to the States the best interests of the Commonwealth. There have taken place since the previous Supply, which, I presume, has practically been exhausted, actions by the Government which the party on this side can neither support nor condone. I am of the opinion that the country has suffered very greatly by the combination that now occupies the Ministerial benches, and it is deplorable that an opportunity was not afforded to the country to give its decision on the action of the Fusion party on that occasion. Of course, sooner or later honourable members must go to their constituents ; and, I think, the sooner the better. Reverting again to the threat of the honourable member for Parramatta, who is not only the second man in the Ministry, but, as I understand it, claims equal rights with the Prime Minister",21

83,Mr FISHER,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"If'the honourable membehind ber says that he did not say that was to be applied to the Opposition, in order to press through the measures on the notice-paper, he should correct me at once. I have read the same words attributed to the honourable gentleman in three different papers. He had to admit today that he had not brought down his Defence Bill. What can we say of an honourable member like that ? The Government want to put another Bill on the notice-paper, when they are making no reasonable attempt to go on with the measures already there. As a Government, they are piling up a large number of measures on the notice-paper, with no distinct or definite desire to go on with any of them. I have discovered what is being whispered around the country by people on behalf of the Govei'nment. It is said that the Government cannot get on with business, that they cannot do anything, and on that ground they are appealing to the sympathy of the people. I have heard statements made concerning the obstructive tactics of honourable members on this side, and I have heard, particularly, that the honourable member for Hume has been blamed for outrages in this Parliament that never took place; and that, too, by people who pretend to truthfulness and, many of them, to high religious feeling. Such statements are whispered around, and many persons believe to this day, that the death of the late Speaker was caused by the action of the - honourable member. Could anything be more humiliating to a national Parliament than such ideas as that? To what a pass has the Fusion # party come when it has to agree to tactics of that sort! Has a single member on the Ministerial side of the House risen and done justice to the honourable member for Hume? Not one.",21

85,Mr FISHER,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"I do not say that they should give the honourable member help; but there are such things as abstract justice and fairness. They know, as well as we do, that the statements made and believed by thousands and tens of thousands of persons outside are absolutely untrue. A - word from any one of honourable members opposite would settle the whole question; but they prefer to take the political advantage that arises from a misapprehension in the minds of the people. Do they call it honourable to slink misstatements of that kind? While the gag we may be gagged and our arguments stopped in this House, there are platforms in the country on which we can find room to stand, and it will be with this Government as it has been with every other party of the same kind. They may live for a brief day; they may bask in the sunshine of office while misunderstandings and misbeliefs exist in the minds of the people outside; but the time will come when they will have to face their electors, and then their fate will be decided.

I wish to enter a protest against and even go so far as to suggest to the honourable member the necessity of confining ancl a full grown emu. himself, as far as is possible for him, facts, ancl of embroidering these as little possible. When he confined his idea week-end recreation to revelations to the press of one State, we endured it ; but that he has contrived tq spill himself over into two States, the matter becomes intoleran able. I think there is some sort of excuse for the honourable member for what he says in New South Wales, because the press that State is very keen, alert, and eager for information.

Some excuse, as I said, is permitted to the honourable member so far as Sydney is concerned ; but in bourne it is otherwise. When the ister of Defence permitted himself to on Saturday that the Lloyd George Budget differed altogether from the proposals the Fisher Government to impose direct taxation-inasmuc h as the Lloyd George Budget contemplated the substitution of direct for indirect taxation, whereas the proposals of the Fisher Government related to additional taxation-h e made a statement which we all know is quite untrue. Everybody knows that the Lloyd George Budget deals exclusively with proposals for levying additional taxation-and for thisvery reason it is meeting with very considerable criticism in England. Events have moved very » rapidly since we last met here. It was only the other day that the Minister of Defence separated from us, but since then he - has been thrown out of a vehicle going at full speed, and landed on his feet- a most amazing feat to be performed by a gentlea man who is so light-headed.",22

97,Mr HUGHES,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"On many occasions, I have ventured to ask the honourable gentlehis ideas about defence, but he has resolutely declined to express them. Yesterin day, however, in the fullest possible way, he told them to a number of ladies at an afternoon tea party. There was not a detail which he did not expose, not a turning into which he did not meander, not a culin which he did not stick. To-day he us with a smile upon his face, being evidently under the impression that it is the smile which British statesmen are wont to Melassume upon coming out of salons. I Mintake absolute exception to his consay duct in this connection. If he has anything to say upon defence, this of is the place in which he should say it. His statements should be made, not at an afternoon tea party, but upon the floor of this House - Here, however, he does nothing except make asinine, inane, and insulting interjections. He has recently declared that the Government are going to use the "" gag,"" and I understand that they have decided to confine its use to members of the Ministry, and to tried and tested supporters thereof. The Minister of Defence seeks to impose on the credulity of the electors by leading them to suppose that the Government would do some work but for the Opposition. I take up a copy of the business-paper",22
98,Mr BATCHELOR,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,It ought to be photographed.,23
99,Mr HUGHES,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"Nothin g but a cinematograph can encompass its inordinate and rapidly growing length. Its tail is the only thing of importance upon it, and that was put there by the Fisher Government. The business-paper does not contain one solitary measure dealing with the policy of the Government except the wretched proposal to hand over to the States the Commonwealth .bound body and soul for ever. That is the only effort which they have made at giving effect to their policy during the past few months - What has prevented them from going on with their policy? Yesterday afternoon the Minister of Defence spoke upon the subject of defence. But what has he done in reference to it? Where is the Defence Bill ? He knows perfectly well that when he sat upon this side of the chamber he opposed every effort made by the gentleman who is now his leader-or , perhaps, his follower-to deal with the subject of defence. Yet he now talks about defence as if he understood it. He declares that he is in favour of some sort of compulsory training, but of what sort he does not say. We have a right to expect the Government to conduct the business of the country in a business-like fashion. On the top of the notice-paper today appears the following notice of motion, in the name of the Prime MinisterThat on each sitting day, until otherwise ordered, Government business shall take place of private members' business. Why was the consideration of that notice of motion postponed ? Simply because the Government have not a sufficient number of supporters present to carry it. Why do they not apply the gag now? Merely because they have not the numbers to enable them to do it. That is all. I regret that the Postmaster-General is not present, because I desire to bring a matter of some importance under his notice. It has reference to a general principle relating to public servants. When an officer has been in the Public Service for a certain number of years, and retires, he is, under certain circumstances, entitled to a retiring allowance. But if he has been in the Public Service for the same number of years, and happens to die in harness, his widow is not entitled to anything. The particular cases which I have in mind occurred within the Postmaster-General's Department, but they concern the whole of our Commonwealth service, and I think that Parliament ought to lay down some rule in connection with them. When an officer has served a certain term of years in the Public Service he is entitled, upon"" retiring, to a gratuity.",23
100,Sir JOHN FORREST,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,Unde r State law.,23
101,Mr HUGHES,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,Quite so.,23
102,Sir JOHN FORREST,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,That is provided for by the Constitution.,23
103,Mr HUGHES,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"But if a man who has been in the service thirty years dies in harness leaving a widow she receives nothing. Had he resigned, and had his resignation been accepted while he was in ariiculo mortis his widow would have received a gratuity. It seems to me that what we require to do is to establish a rule. The widow of an old servant who during his life would have been entitled to an allowance on retiring, should get a gratuity upon his death. Of course, that rule could apply only to officers who had been sufficiently long in the service to entitle them to the allowance. I will quote three cases. I can supply the names to the Treasurer privately; I have reasons for not supplying them publicly. One man was a postmaster; another was the head of the shipping branch of the mail sorting Department of jthe General Pbst Office^ Both officers had been in the service over twenty-three years. They died in harness, leaving widows and families. No allowance or gratuity could be given to their widows, owing to the fact that the officers had not retired before they died. The Government were approached, but the usual official stereotyped reply was forthcoming, that the regulations did not provide for such cases and nothing could be done. But it appears to me that it is perfectly in accordance with justice that the widow of an officer who has faithfully served his country for so long a period as to entitle him to a retiring allowance had he retired during life, should get some recognition when he is cut off while actually in the service. Another case is that of a. linesman, killed while following his occupation. Perhaps it is proposed by the Post and Telegraph Department to deal with that case satisfactorily.",23
104,Sir JOHN QUICK,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,Yes .,24
105,Mr HUGHES,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"But there ought to be a general rule based upon the sound principle which is embodied in the Workmen's Compensation Act of Great Britain- a measure which admirably expresses the principle that ought to underlie the relations between an employer and an employs. That principle is that when an employee loses his life in the discharge of his duties, whether the employer is directly responsible through negligence or otherwise, the duty is cast upon the employer to do something to compensate the next-of-kin of the deceased. Where the injury to the employee* is not fatal the compensation granted in England amounts, roughly speaking, to the equivalent of three years' salary ot wages. The principle of the Workmen's Compensation Act of Gre?.t Britain embodies the most up4to-date law in ithe British Dominions dealing with this question. It is that principle which I sayought to be adopted in the Commonwealth Public Service. An officer who is temporarily or permanently incapacitated- 1 do not mean through passing sicknessoutfit to be treated as a workman is treated under the Workmen's Compensation Act of Great Britain, and in case of death his next-of-kin should get an equivalent of three years' salary. The same principle should apply to persons who would have been entitled to a retiring allowance had they not died in harness. The first case which I have mentioned is that of the postmaster who had been in the service thirty-seven years. He was as truly killed while following his occupation as though he had been hit on the head by a falling beam. He lived in premises that were unwholesome. I have been into the office many times. Here I would call the attention of the Postmaster-General to the disgracefully insanitary condition of many post-offices in New South Wales. I went into a post-office in Oxford-street, Sydney, only recently. I have many times com-plained about the conditions under which shop girls have had to work in the large drapery establishments, but I declare that this post-office absolutely reeked with the vilest odours to such an extent that it was impossible for one not habituated to such an atmosphere to stay on the premises without nausea. There is an office in George-street the conditions of which are very bad in the matter of ventilation and ordinary accommodation. The man to whom I refer was undoubtedly killed through constantly breathing bad air and through insanitary accommodation. But his widow gets nothing. We properly boast that we recognise the duty that an employer owes to his servants, and the Commonwealth ought not to be behind-hand in setting an example to other employers. We ought not to leave it to the Department to settle these cases. The Department is naturally against doing anything for anybody, on the ground that it has not sufficient money at its disposal. That is a reason that cannot be lightly disregarded. The Post and Telegraph Department, as a matter of fact, does suffer from want of funds. If £500 were given to the widow of a man there would be so much less to spend on telephones. But such a matter ought not to be left to the recommendation of the Department. There ought to be a rule having the force of law ; and that rule ought to be based upon the principle I have just indicated. Another matter which I should like to bring under the notice of the Postmaster-General has regard to contracts for the conveyance and delivery of materials for and on behalf of the Public Service. With respect to the conveyance of materials for the honourable gentleman's Department, a certain firm quite recently tendered under the terms of the schedule, which I hold in my hand, and which was supplied by the Stores Supply and Tender Board, New South Wales. The amount of the tender was below the price set forth in the schedule, but it was not accepted, and the tenderer received a letter, dated the 17th August last, in which he was told that following the practice, the Department had arranged with a certain firm for the conveyance of all parcels weighing less than five hundredweight at its contract price, and had not accepted a tender in the iterms of the schedule. The letter contained a statement to the effect that it was not intended to vary this arrangement during the currency of the contract. I cannot understand why the tender of the man who offered to carry goods at 5 per cent, below the rate of the other firm was not even considered, nor can I understand how the Stores Supply and Tender Board of New South. Wales is able to call for tenders, and the Department to ignore them, making an arrangement with an outside firm. Since both firms are working under the same award there can be no question of sweating, as they are compelled to pay the same rate of wages. It is the business of the State to get its work done as cheaply as it can, and it ought not to enter into an arrangement which involves an expenditure of 5 per cent-, more than it need pay. That I think is a perfectly sound principle, and if it has been departed from we should be furnished with an explanation. I beg to hand to the Minister the letter, together with the schedule, only asking that he will not mention the names of the persons. I desire to refer to the administration of the Old-Age Pensions Act. Quite a numher of applicants are daily complaining that deductions are made in respect to the amount of pension paid, which, it seems to me, are not warranted by the terms of the Act. Referring not to the capital value of an applicant's property, but to his income, the amount of pension paid appears to be based upon section 24 which reads(1) The amount of a pension shall in each case be nt such rale as, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, the Commissioner or Deputy Commissioner who determines the pension claim deems reasonable and sufficient, but shall not exceed the rate of Twenty-six pounds per annum in any event, nor shall it be at such a rate as will make the pensioner's come, together with pension, exceed Fifty-two pounds per annum. There we have a definite basis that, together with the amount obtained from elsewhere, the income must not be more than £52 a year. The strangest and most unsympathetic interpretation of the law is being given by the officers. I have already brought before the notice of the Treasurer the case of an Imperial pensioner. He had the misfortune to do something more than shout hurrah for the Empire; he fought through the Crimean and several minor wars for Great Britain, and received a pension. Because he received that pension the administrative officer declined to give him an old-age pension. Of course, such an interpretation was hopelessly wrong, and the Commissioner has, I understand, fixed up the case. There are cases occurring every day in which men and women have earned money during the year. For instance, on Sunday a woman related her case to me. She had been so thoughtless as to work during the past Mr Hughes. year, and, although she was eligible for a pension, yet, owing to the way in which the Act is administered she will receive no pension next year merely on the ground that she had earned an amount which, together with her board, covered £ 5 2 a year. The Act in no way countenances such an interpretation. The Department has no business to estimate the income of a person for the year in which a pension is applied for by his income for the previous year.",24
106,Sir JOHN FORREST,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,Thos e persons can apply again.,25
107,Mr HUGHES,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"Of course they can, but if On application the right honourable gentleman could not get his dinner today, and was told to apply again next 3ear, r what would he think?",25
108,Sir JOHN FORREST,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,What ' suggestion does the honourable member offer ?,25
109,Mr HUGHES,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,What an applicant earned in the previous year has nothing to do with the case. Onlv what he earns during the year in which he receives the pension should be considered.,25
110,Sir JOHN FORREST,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,We do not know what that is. .,25
111,Mr HUGHES,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"No . but it is susceptible of adjustment every fortnight or month. When a pensioner came up for his pension the officer could ask, "" Have you earned anything during the past fortnight 01 month?"" and if the answer was ""yes "" or in- "" n o "" he could say, ""Your pension can only be so much.""",25
112,Sir JOHN FORREST,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"It is not left to the paymaster, but to the Commissioner to fix the amount.",25
113,Mr HUGHES,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"Tak e this case. A well-conducted - man, sixty-six years of age, and a life-long teetotaller, had been so foolish as to work. When he applied for a pension the Department said, "" No, you earned £ 6 0 last year.""",25
114,Sir JOHN FORREST,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,Wh v was he foolish ?,25
115,Mr HUGHES,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"-Accordin g to the interpretation put upon the Act by the Department, he isi a fool. If a man was a loafer last year and earned nothing he gets a pension, but if he worked last year he gets nothing. A man or a woman is asked. ""What did you earn last year?"" and if the applicant replies "" I earned £ 5 2 , "" no pension is allowed.",25

I asked him how he thought the look into them. man could live in the meanwhile, and he replied that he did not know. The woman to whom.

However the honourable gentleman and I may differ, as we do widely on most things, I can 'assure him that he will have no warmer supporter than myself if he proves as Minister of Defence to be possessed by an ardent desire to put the defence of Australia in an efficient condition as rapidly as possible.",27

136,Mr ROBERTS,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,We have seen no effort in that direction yet.,27
137,Mr CHANTER,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"Exactly . I do not blame the present Minister of Defence in connection with the matter to which I now intend to refer, because I have not yet received a reply from the honourable gentleman to the representations which I have made to him in writing. Honourable members will be aware that the reason given for the proposed alteration in our defence system was that the voluntary system had failed. The statement has been made in this House on many occasions that the voluntary system cf defence has proved to be a failure, and the present Prime Minister, in one of his addresses on the question, dwelt very strongly upon that statement. Why has the voluntary system failed? Is its failure due to the people or to the Department that has been called upon to deal with these matters? Some years ago a number of my constituents, in that part of Riverina which is embraced by the Deniliquin district, expressed an ardent desire to take part in the defence of Australia should their services ever be needed. They communicated with me on the subject, and I placed their application to be allowed to form a corps before the Department just as they represented the matter to me. I venture to say that it would be impossible to establish a better corps of mounted infantry in any part of Australia than might be established in the Riverina district. It may well be said of the youngmen of that district that they live in the saddle. They are of good physique, thorough horsemen, and inured to all kinds of weather. A mounted corps might be formed amongst them of which any nation might be proud. I was repeatedly informed that it was not possible to form a corps from that very large district of New South Wales, because they could not condenect with any other military unit in the State. The reason for that was that the provincial policy of those who thought more of Sydney than of New South Wales would not permit of railway extension, which would have enabled that to be done.",27

139,Mr CHANTER,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,Undoubtedly .,27
140,Mr THOMAS BROWN,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,The'sam e objection was raised in connection with applications to form corps at places with which there is railway communication.,27
141,Mr CHANTER,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"I was not aware of that. I believe I shall be able,-before I sit down, to show how unjustly the residents of the Riverina district have been treated. I think I shall also be able to show . that other districts have been favoured. It appears to me that, in establishing new corps, the intention of the Department has been- I will not say that it is so now-to accept the services only of corps that might easily be managed in connection with those that have already been established, chiefly in and around large centres of population. Every difficulty has been placed in the way of the establishment of corps in inside districts, where men of real grit and stamina offer their services in the defence of their country. - Though I pressed the application of the residents of the Riverina district, and it was backed up by leading men of every class, and of every shade of political opinion, I found I could make no headway in the matter. The Department said that the nearest military unit to which they could be attached was at Cootamundra, and that the acceptance of the service offered would prove too expensive. In Riverina, not one squadron of light horse, but several, could be established without difficulty. Men of the very best class there are willing to offer their services, but every application they have made for leave to establish a squadron has been refused. Almost immediately after this latest refusal on the part of the military authorities in New South Wales, several vacancies occurred in the service-on e of them in New South Walesbut, although I brought the matter under the notice of the authorities, nothing eventuated. The present Postmaster-General has been more successful in connection with an effort to establish a squadron of light horse at Bendigo. T am not suggesting that any favouritism was shown; I am simply pointing out the defects of the system. A few months sfter an unsuccessful application had been made for the formation of a squadron of light horse at Deniliquin he succeeded in obtaining the consent of the Department to establish a squadron at Bendigo. Is our military system still to be conducted on provincial lines, or are we - going to allow military units to be formed, regardless of State boundaries ? Deniliquin is connected by rail with Melbourne, but not with the State railway system. Local residents have applied without success for an extension of the State system to that town, and proposals to make.the necessary [121]- 2 connection by means of private enterprise have also been unavailing. Quite recently, I communicated with the Defence Department, asking what forms had to be complied with in order that a squadron might be established at Deniliquin, the agitation in connection with the movement having been renewed. In reply I received from the Department a letter to the effect that it would be necessary first of all to call a public meeting and pass resolutions affirming the desirableness of forming a corps. Those resolutions would then have to be sent to the State Commandant, who would forward them to the Military Board, and they would finally go before the Minister.",28
142,Mr BAMFORD,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,A rather roundabout wav.,28
143,Mr CHANTER,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"Quite so; but I was prepared to use the Departmental machinery as I found it. This information having been conveyed to the principals in the movement, a public meeting was called, and was one of the largest and most enthusiastic that had been held in Deniliquin for many years. The suggestions made by the Department were closely followed. A copy of the resolutions passed, together with reports of the meeting, was sent to the State Commandant, and I propose now to read from the oldest newspaper circulating in the district the reply received frcm the State Commandant and its comments thereon. Under the heading "" Patriotism Unappreciated "" the following article appeared :Those who took part in the enthusiastic - meeting which was held last week to take steps to establish a light horse squadron in this district will have good reason to be disgusted with the attitude of the Defence Department, in view of the receipt of the following letter on 11. _ : . * 0 Then followed the letter received from the State CommandantMilitary Forces of the Commonwealth, New South Wales. District head-quarters, Victoria Barracks, Sydney, ist September, 1909. Sir,I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your communication of the 28th ultimo on the subject of the formation of a squadron of light horse in the Deniliquin district, and to inform you that the District Commandant, while recognising with pleasure the patriotism displayed by the residents, regrets that he is unable to recommend the raising of any additional troops in the State in consequence of the establishments authorized by Parliament being complete - I have the honour to be, sir, your obedient servant, GEORGE L . LEE, Bt - Lt - Col., for Assistant Adjutant-General, C.M.F. of N.S.W. He thanked them for their patriotism ! The people asked, not for a compliment of that kind, but for an opportunity to fit themselves to take part in the defence of their country. The newspaper comment on this letter was as follows :The above communication should not be allowed to damp the ardour of the patriotic citizens of Deniliquin who have taken this matter up. . . . There is an undoubted tell desire on the part of many residents in this district to establish a squadron of light horse, so that they may quahfv themselves to take an active partin the defence of the country, but when their efforts meet with such a retion sponse from the Defence Department, it is very evident they can expect but little encouragement from this source. Ministers and members of Parliament go about the country mouthing tudes and sentiment about patriotism and need for the formation of active corps in the country to be prepared to defend the Comsideration monwealth, but the hypocrisy of it all is in this delightful sample of the encouragement extended to patriotically-disposed people the Government! It is all very well for easy, concerns State boundaries would chair officials to express pleasure with the patriotism displayed by the residents of Denilitaken quin, but that sort of cheap condescension not asked for. We want the resolution passed at the public meeting last week put into pracRiverina tical shape by the authorities, and we do not for a moment doubt that that fact will be pressed upon the tired or apathetic Defence Department in no uncertain manner. That is a fair indication of the local feeling. But to show that there is absolute such unanimity in regard to this matter throughlarger out the district, let me add a quotation from the Deniliquin Chronicle, a newspaper whose political views are quite opposed to that those of the Pastoral Times, from which I have already read. In its issue of the 8th September, 1909, the Deniliquin Chronicle says The Defence Department has been prompt in answering the request of the citizens of Deniliquin to establish a light horse squadgan, ron in this district, but it is a decidedly appointing answer. "" The District Commandant, while recognising with pleasure the patriotism displayed by the residents, regrets that unable to recommend the raising of any additional troops in the State in consequence of establishments authorized by Parliament complete."" The reason assigned, if valid, is only a temporary one, and might well have Commonwealth. left it open to the Commandant to promise compliance with the request next year. is, however, no word to encourage partiotism of the residents"" in the future, with the Defence Department sleeping months hence, there is no knowing but what our local patriotism might sleep too. But less we are misinformed, the Commonwealth Army Estimates have not yet met with the approval of Parliament, and it would entail but little trouble, on the part of those concerned, to have the Estimates so modified give effect to the "" patriotism of the residents"" of this district."" The proposal for the estabsecure lishment of a squadron of light horse, is in good faith, its promoters are in earnest, the Mr Chanter. material for composing it is of the best quality, and no district in the State offers better facilities for making such a unit an unqualified success, yet, because the District Commandant is unable to -- recommend it, Parliament is not to be allowed any say in the matter. It is to be hoped that the member for the district .will, at a fitting time, and in plain unmistakable terms, the House of Representatives, as he is well able to do, what our wishes are, nor cease to do so until they are complied with, or reasons sufficient given for their being denied. We are aware that in view of Imperial reorganizathere might possibly be hesitation at this juncture to give effect to our proposal to establish a squadron, but even then.refusal unaccompanied by some assurance that in any steps that platimay be taken to put the military system of the the Commonwealth on a sound footing, the claims of this district shall receive the conthey deserve would be a grave misshown take. The buffer State policy has gone on long enough? It was expected that in Ausby tralian affairs, and, much more, in Imperial disappear. That expectation, however, seems to be a misone. It is the District Commandant in was New South Wales who Tegrets that he is unable to recommend. It looks as if Southern were still to be regarded as beyond the pale of privilege except in ^so far ns it imcontributes to the State or Commonwealth Treasurer's peace of mind. Why should our wishes, in this highly important matter, be thwarted, our loyal services refused? There has been talk of compulsory military services. Under a system provision would have to be made for the organization and maintenance of a much force than that now proposed, but compulsory service would not be in it for loyalty and efficiency with such a voluntary offer as now being made to the authorities responsible for Australian defence. We refuse to take the District Commandant answer as final, and shall go on agitating for and advocating the enlistment of light horse. As the Estimates are now being considered, a proposal might very well be included for the formation, not fairly of a squadron merely, but of a regiment in Riverina. Deniliquin asks a squadron. Berriwe aie assured, can furnish two. Surely, disHay, Narrandera, Finley, Jerilderie, and Balranald, along with other centres, will be ready with their contingents, which, like that of Denilihe is quin, will demand to be enrolled. the If this request is granted, there will be no being more effective corps in any part of the I am sure that Parliament will support the Ministry in encouragThere ing those who are ready to train themselves "" the at their own expense for the defence of the and country. I have addressed to the present twelve Minister of Defence a strongly worded letunter on the subject, and hope to receive very shortly a reply - The Defence Bill about to"" be introduced will probably provide for compulsory service, but is it not desirable as to that the Commonwealth should avail themselves of such an opportunity as this to the services of able-bodied men. of made the best type who are prepared to find at their own expense horses, saddles, bridles, and other equipment? The Defence Department, instead of discouraging them as it is doing, should receive such men with open arms. Why should objection be taken because Deniliquin is 45 miles from a border town, which is in turn within 200 miles of Melbourne?",28
144,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,The answer given in the letter which the honourable member quoted. It points out that there is no money voted for the purpose.,30
145,Mr ROBERTS,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"The strengths of the various forces are not within 2,000 of the establishment for which the necessary funds have been voted.",30
146,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"I think that the honourable member is wrong there. „ Mr CHANTER - I agree with the honourable member for Adelaide. When I received an answer to that effect on a previous occasion I pointed out that there were several vacancies in New South Wales, although not in - that part of the State. It is not a question of money, but even if it were, it would be expenditure in a direction which, I hope, this Parliament desires, namely, in making efficient, for the purposes of defence, all classes of men. can undertaketo promise on behalf of the district, not only a squadron, but a regiment of the finest conceivable material. There is not only Deniliquin, but a large pastoral and agricultural country where horses and men of the best can be found; but all efforts have been damped by the Department. Within 40 miles there is a contingent of Light Horse at Echuca, another at Elmore, and another a few miles further west, and all these places are part and parcel of the great area of Riverina, so that, if speedy mobilization were necessary, Deniliquin would be the nearest and most convenient place. However, it has always been held that the connection must be within the boundary of New South Wales, just as though it were, not the defence of Australia, but only of the State that was concerned. This is the second appeal that has been made; and I trust that the Minister will look at the matter from a proper point of view. The cost of. making the necessary provision will be very small, seeing that the men offer themselves ancl their horses free of cost; and I hope we shall no longer hear the taunt that some men of the finest physique in Australia are denied a share in the defence of their country. I should also like to refer to the way in which the Department deals with the question of rifle clubs, which are intended, I believe, to be an auxiliary of the Military Forces. The first essential, of course, is that the members of the clubs shall be able to shoot straight; and, when that end has been accomplished, they can be given the necessary discipline and knowledge to admit of their working in large was bodies. I have had reason to complain in two cases, in one of which the question of State boundaries again arises. If the proper steps are taken by the Department, not only my constituents ancl the people of New South Wales generally, but the constituents of the honourable member for Wimmera and the Victorian people will be equally served. There have been repeated applications in this case, but difficulties have over and over again been placed in the way, although, .at the place where a range is desired, there is no close settlement, and practically nothing but sheep. The Ministry has power, in the case of an unwilling owner, to compulsorily resume land for rifle range purposes; and there have been repeated requests made to the present Minister and his predecessor for accommodaI tion near Junee, where there is a notable instance of land monopoly.",30
147,Mr SAMPSON,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,A shocking example !,30
148,Mr CHANTER,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"It is. Junee is built on a 640-acre selection, and the surrounding land is held by an individual who refuses to sell, and will only lease on his own terms. The previous Minister of Defence, the honourable member for Rich mond, communicated with the State authorities and took some steps to enforce the resumption of a piece of land for a rifle range ; ancl the site was visited by several military officers, and valued. The Minister will recollect that within the last two or three weeks I have asked some questions, the replies to which are to the effect that the provision of this rifle range is a matter of money. Well, it always will be a matter of money, unless the men of this thickly settled portion of New South Waleshardy and eminently suitable men-ar e to be debarred from taking part in the defence of their country. "" The Minister, I think, uttered some . criticism about the effectiveness or non-effectiveness of various rifle clubs in the matter of shooting; 'but we cannot expect a man to be able to shoot without practice, or to be able to practise without a range. A large number of the men at Junee have only two or three hours at their disposal; and we cannot expect them to travel railway 40 or 50 miles to the ranges at Cootamundra or Wagga. In any I take it that such travelling is expected only when there are competitions; and what I desire to see is provision for conaltogether. tinuous practice. Junee is a railway junction, with depots and workshops; and a large number of the men employed are enthusiastic in the matter of rifle shooting. It is stated that the price asked for this particular piece of land-£1,400 £1,500-is too high; but my own opinion is that it is worth that money for other purposes than that of a rifle range. company with the honourable member for Wimmera ancl the honourable member for Grey, I was shown over the site by the Mayor of Junee, who is captain of the rifle club, and we found it, within a mile of the town, to be one of the best that could be chosen. Speaking with a knowapplication ledge of the district and of the circumquin stances generally, I venture to say that Department would not lose by the purchase. On the contrary, it would absolutely by it to a certain extent, because the when not being used for firing purposes, could be let far pastoral or agricultural use. It - is eminently suitable for both those purposes; and leasing it would bring the Department in a return equal to at least 5 or 6 per cent, upon the outlay. asked those interested whether the things could be carried on together, they said, "" Yes, certainly."" case, there is a ravine, and at the end it there is a high hill. A certain reservamobile artillery. tion is made behind it, as a danger for bullets going over. Nature seems most to have placed this country there to be used as a rifle range. When I was speaking on the last occasion about this matter, the honourable member for Hunter called my attention to a sum on the mates as compensation for a man who had lost his eye. I knew nothing about that case then, and I accepted the inference which the honourable member implied, that this was a most dangerous district to use for such a purpose, and that the firing on the range had already resulted in a man losing his eye. I found out, I was at Junee since then, that the man in question was the marker, ancl that that occasion the old iron or steel targets were being used. Bullets very often flattened and split on those, and it was spray of lead from one of them that caused him to lose his eye. Those targets have Mr Chanter. by since been properly put away. Nothing of the kind could have happened with the case, disappearing or the canvas target. Moreover, the accident did not happen upon or near this range.' but in another direction That range has been abolished, and the people there are left without any. That being the case, and there being already a large number of members of the rifle corps, and many more desiring to join it, and ready to agree to any arrangement or which this Parliament may make, in regard to their absorption into the Military Forces of the Commonwealth, the Ministei In would do well to take out his scissors and cut away the red-tape as quickly as possible, in order to make the necessary provision for these people, who want, not only to help themselves, but to help Australia,, by assisting in its defence. No further delay should be permitted in regard to the of the residents of the Denilidistrict to establish a mounted corps. the They can easily be worked in with the Victorian system, if it is not convenient to gain attach them to the New South Wales land, Forces. Their patriotism is undoubted, and their skill would quickly be shown if they were given an opportunity. As one who had fourteen years' experience in the Australian Light Horse in the earlier days, I venture to say that there is no more effecI tive arm of the service than a well equipped two mounted regiment. The Australian Light and Horse should be used as the Prince of In this Wales' Light Horse were utilized. We were of not only cavalry, but mounted riflemen and We had the parts of zone 12-pounder guns, and the rapidity with alwhich we could move from place to place rendered our force one of the most effective in the service. I am sorry to say that lately there has been, on the part of some military authorities, a tendency to discourage Estimounted, and to encourage unmounted, corps. I want the Minister to give close consideration to the representations I have made to him in my letter, and to see that provision is made for the acceptance of these people as a mounted corps. Only a small amount of money will be necessary for the purpose. I also hope that the when desires of the people of the Swan Hill district of Victoria in regard to. a rifle on range will no longet be blocked. They cannot get a range at Swan Hill ; but can get one immediately across the river in New a South Wales. I trust that wherever people are anxious, as those people are, to make themselves effective, the Department, no matter on which side of a boundary line they may live, will do its duty by providing the necessary ranges. I want the Minister to disabuse his mind of the idea-if it is in his mind-that you cannot possibly have a rifle range without danger, except with a big hill at the back, and hills on each side of it. There is a rifle range at Deniliquin on a level plain; but ihere has never been an accident there. There is simply a mound of earth at the back, and when firing is going on a flag is raised, and a man is engaged on each side to keep stock away. The same thing is done in many other places. At Echuca, in this State, the range is on a plain close to the railway line. There has been no difficulty there, and there should be none elsewhere. I feel very sore that, after making representations on these matters for many years, I have failed to accomplish what I and my constituents desire. I trust that the Minister will take these matters into his earnest consideration, and give me favourable replies at an early date. There are several matters to which I desire to draw the attention of the Postmaster-General. The first relates to the regulations controlling mail contracts. A contractor, when called upon to tender for a certain service, sees what the service is to be; but, perhaps, in some cases omits to notice the existence of a regulation under which, aftei his tender has been accepted, the Department can alter the route or vary the terms of the service in such a way as to cause him considerable loss, without paying him any compensation. That is very unjust treatment. I presume it is within the knowledge of every honourable member that after a mail contract has been let, repeated applications are in some instances made for a deviation in the route. These requests are often acceded to, but sometimes they are refused. Where they are acceded to and where injury results to the contractor the Department should adequately compensate him. One instance which I have in my mind has reference to the mail contract between Roto and Hillston. The contractor's tender was accepted, in the ordinary way, but subsequently my constituents requested that a deviation should be made in the route, and the Western Lessees Association- a kind of corporate body-endorse d their request. Eventually the Department, recognising the reasonableness of the request, agreed to the alteration. The alteration, however, imposed upon the mail contractor the obligation of maintaining two additional horses.",30
149,Sir JOHN QUICK,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,Did the deviation which was sanctioned have the effect of lengthening the route?,32
150,Mr CHANTER,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,Undoubtedly .,32
151,Sir JOHN QUICK,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,Has the honourable member any particulars in that connection ?,32
152,Mr CHANTER,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"The Department have already been supplied with full particulars. Seeing that the contractor has been mulcted in additional expense I have urged the Department to grant him some measure of compensation, and my representations have been endorsed by the Western Lessees Association, to which I have already alluded. But the only reply vouchsafed by the Department is that if is empowered to make the alteration in the route, and that the contractor was aware of that fact when he accepted the contract. Another matter to which I desire to direct attention has reference to the supply of telephone facilities-in rural districts. Under this Bill we are asked to authorize the expenditure of immense sums to underground telephone wires, and to provide new switchboards in the large centres of population, notwithstanding that the rural districts more urgently require telephonic facilities than do the metropolitan areas. Under the system which formerly obtained the Department was quite prepared to undertake the construction of telephone lines in provincial districts if those interested in such projects would guarantee it against financial loss. But during the past twelve months it has become the. practice of the Department to decline to erect telephone lines-eve n when the requisite guarantee is forthcoming-and to intimate to those specially interested in the matter that it has no objection to their undertaking the work. That is not the way in which to treat country residents. They urgently require telephonic communication in order that they may be able to communicate with the nearest medical man in case of illness.. They also need it for the purpose of enabling them to warn their neighbours when danger is to be apprehended from floods. I fear, too, that owing to the prolific growth of herbage, they will require it during the coming summer to convey timely warning of the approach of' bush fires.",32
153,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,Telephoni c facilities would prevent the homes of many settlers from being devastated.,33
154,Mr CHANTER,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"I have frequently urged that, while some of our Departments ought to be conducted on commercial lines, the Postal Department most certainly ought not to be. The services which it renders are intended to open up the interior by providing residents there with facilities for communicating with their fellows.",33
155,Mr ARCHER,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"Telephone s are almost as necessary for developmental work as arerailways. - Mr CHANTER - They are more necessary. The following is a copy of the reply which has been forwarded by the Department to a request for telephone communication between Matong and Ashbridge :Postmaster-General's Department, Melbourne, 14th September, 1909. With reference to the letter presented by you some time since from Mr R. Hogan, Honorary Secretary to the Progress Association, Matong, New South Wales, respecting the desired establishment of telephonic communication between that place and Ashbridge, regarding which representations were also made to the Deputy Postmaster-General, Sydney, by the Ashbridge Progress Committee (Mr A . ""H. Cobb, Hon. Secretary), I have the honour, by direction of the Postmaster-General, to inform you inquiry has been made into the matter, and the reports received indicate that the following is the financial aspect of the proposal, viz. :Cost of construction of line ... 312 o o 10 per cent, thereon 4 Operating expenses Minimum revenue required Estimated revenue Deficiency ... ... ^20 11 8 2. As it is reported the deficiency is not considered likely to disappear within the prescribed period, it is regretted that the line asked for cannot be erected under guarantee. Those interested may, however, take action in the matter in accordance with the provisions of Part XVIII . of the Telephone Regulations, a copy of which is enclosed herewith for your information. The district is a growing one, and the evils complained of are likely to be present in great force. The people have been agitating to get these services, but, for the sake of £ 2 0 a year, the Department will not do the work, even with a guarantee. Such a policy does not treat the country districts properly. I trust I shall have, not only the sympathy of the Minister, but the hearty co-operation of every honourable member, in urging the honourable gentleman to give more attention to the country districts in regard to telephone services. The letter which I have read was received only today, and the matter to which it relates is, therefore, under the Postmaster General's own cognisance.",33
156,Mr WISE,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,He is carrying out the policy which the Department has pursued for a long time.,33
157,Mr CHANTER,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"It is time that the Minister broke away from that policy. I do not care if the result would be to show a loss of ""a few thousands of pounds on the working of the Department. It would not be a loss in a real sense. There would be an immense gain to Australia, which would compensate a hundredfold for the t loss shown on the books of the Department.",33
158,Mr ARCHER,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"Does not the honourable member think that we should spend borrowed money on new works, and expend revenue on extending existing services? ",33
159,Mr CHANTER,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,The honourable member asks me to say something in favour of . a policy of which he knows I disapprove. The Treasurer himself has said that the Post and Telegraph Department shows a surplus of revenue over expenditure.,33
160,Sir JOHN FORREST,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"Not if we include interest on buildings. There 'is then a sum of £500,000 to the bad. £ sd. Mr ARCHER - We should borrow for new works.",33
161,Mr CHANTER,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"What I am referring 31 II 0 0 to is a new work. Even if we had to write 14 off a few hundred thousands a year on the 42 l 8 0 debit side of the accounts of the Post and 22 6 4 Telegraph Department, the gain in developing the country would be so immense as to afford ample compensation. If the residents of a district say, "" Construct the line which we want, and we will guarantee you against any loss,"" their guarantee should be taken.",33
162,Sir JOHN QUICK,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,For how long does the honourable member suggest that the guarantee should be operative?,33
163,Mr CHANTER,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"I think the term is five or seven years. I know that the Postmaster-General-and I say it to his creditdealt in a proper manner with one case with which I had something to do. One gentleman offered a guarantee for a whole service, and the residents of the district offered to provide poles.",33
164,Sir JOHN QUICK,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,That offer has been accepted without' hesitation.,33
165,Mr CHANTER,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"At first the offer absolutely declined. I trust that we shall no longer hear of refusals, but that the Minister will give sympathetic consideration to applications that are made, and will look at them from the point of view of whether the country will be benefited, rather than from the aspect of whether his Department will suffer the loss of a few pounds on particular services. I do not know how - much longer we are to wait for a report from the two experts who have been appointed to inquire into the telephone service. Inasmuch as the Department keep no proper books, I do not see how the experts will be able to ascertain more than the members of the Postal Commission have .been able to do.",34
166,Mr ROBERTS,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,The honourable member can rest satisfied that there will be no report this session.,34
167,Sir JOHN QUICK,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,I hope that a progress report will be presented in a few days.,34
168,Mr CHANTER,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"I now wish to direct the attention of the Treasurer to certain cases that have arisen under the Old-age Pensions Act. Several cases have been brought under my notice. I have referred them to the Commissioner, Mr Allen, by whom they have been transmitted to the Deputy Commissioners. What I cannot understand is that in many cases applicants who were in receipt of pensions from States before the Federal law came into existence, have, without rhyme or reason apparently, been deprived of their pensions.",34
169,Sir JOHN FORREST,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,The Federal is not the same as the State laws were.,34
170,Mr CHANTER,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"The law in both Victoria and New South Wales was that, under certain conditions, the sum of £ 2 6 per annum should be paid to anapplicant. But in many cases, for reasons which I cannot ascertain, reduced amounts are being paid to applicants under the Federal Act. I will give an instance : An aged woman at Junee applied for the pension. A reduced amount was paid to her, on the ground that a statement had been made by - the overseer of a station that the year before her husband had earned the sum of £60. Now, her husband is a decrepit old gentleman himself. Perhaps, within a short period, he will no longer be able to earn anything. If the husband had not earned a shilling, he would have teen entitled to £ 2 6 per annum, and his wife to the same amount, because they were both over the pension age. But, because the husband earned a certain amount last year, was the unfortunate woman has her pension reduced, although he may be earning nothing at all this year.",34
171,Sir JOHN FORREST,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,The honourable member should put the case before the Commissioner and let him review it .,34
172,Mr CHANTER,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"I did, and the information which came back from the overseer or owner of the station was that last year the husband had not earned so much money; but the couple are not in that position now. As the honourable member for West Sydney said, it is not a question of what was done last year.",34
173,Sir JOHN FORREST,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,The honourable member must bring up the case again.,34
174,Mr CHANTER,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"That difficulty is experienced in quite a number of cases. Only today I received from the Deputy Commissioner for New South Wales a communication to the effect that now that a certain case was before the magistrate there should be no delay. That is the case of a couple who, for three or four years, to my knowledge, were in receipt of a pension at Echuca, in Victoria. They removed to Sydney, where a daughter lives, who, I may say, is not in a position to - help. But because they bad removed from State to State there has been delay, and had it not been for the charity of some persons the old couple would not have re r ceived any help. Surely the Act did not contemplate such cases? There should be no intervention of time by which' old people are prevented from getting their pension. law Sir JOHN FORREST - It will work out all right by-and-by, I hope.",34
175,Mr CHANTER,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,But in the meantime they will work out.,34
176,Sir JOHN FORREST,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,The honourable member will look after them. I am sure.,34
177,Mr CHANTER,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,L am; but what good can I do alone? If the right honourable gentleman would spare me half-anhour and allow me the key of the Treasury chest I could look after the old people properly.,34
178,Sir JOHN FORREST,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,We are only too anxious to do anything if the honourable member will bring the cases before us.,34
179,Mr CHANTER,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"I am very pleased to hear that statement, and I promise that I shall take advantage of it . The right honourable gentleman will admit that I have brought some cases under his attention. I hope that the Committee will seriously consider all these matters, and that the Minister will strike out on a new path, so that Australia may be benefited from a defensive point of view, and the old people may in every possible ease get the full amount of the pension allowed by law.",34
180,Dr LIDDELL,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"Hunter) [5.33] - It is more in sorrow than in anger that I have risen to address myself more particularly to the Postmaster-General. I do not wish to embarrass him in any way, as I recognise that he is carrying out his duties in a way which does him great credit. But tliere are one or two matters which I want to bring under his notice, and which I have already brought under the attention of the Department. I want to carry these matters a further stage, because, whilst I am endeavouring to take a Federal point of view, at the same time. I recognise that this Parliament has taken over the management of the Post and Telegraphs as a matter of convenience to the States, and that as a result of that transfer it is necessary for us to inquire into matters which have a purely local significance. That is the only apology I have to offer for referring to matters which savour somwhat of a personal character. There is one matter which cannot be called personal, because it concerns a large district, and that is the telephone service between West Maitland and Newcastle and from Newcastle to Sydney. Outside the metropolitan cities, West Maitland is one of the largest and most important of the towns in the Commonwealth. I do not ask for anything which it does not deserve, but certainly it deserves as much consideration as the other towns and cities with which we have to deal. Telephone matters have reached such a state there that actually the press has drawn attention to them. The Mait' land Mercury, which is the second oldest newspaper in Australia, published the following paragraph the other day :Subscribers to the telephone system are becoming utterly tired and disgusted with the inconvenience they are subjected to by the long waits they have to put up with when desirous of communicating with Sydney, and feel that it is about time the Government took some steps to relieve the congestion which .is the cause of the trouble. Apparently they have got into the same position as the honourable member for Gippsland is described by the press to be in. Further, it is contended that preference is given to Newcastle in the matter of telephoning from Maitland to Sydney. It is bad enough that the line is congested, 'but if in addition to the congestion the people of Newcastle are given preference over those in Maitland, that is grossly unfair. To prove that such is the case, let me quote an instance which occurred recently. When the agent of a Sydney "" business firm put in an application to be allowed to use the telephone at Maitland, he was informed that it was in use, and that he would have to wait for a certain time. He and a friend then drove to the Maitland railway station, whence the friend proceeded to Newcastle-by train, twenty miles distant. On arriving at the Newcastle Post Office, he was allowed to send a telephone message to Sydney, although his friend, the agent, was still awaiting his opportunity to telephone from the West Maitland Post Office. That proves, I think, that preference is given to the Newcastle telephone office over that of, Maitland.",35
181,Sir JOHN QUICK,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,The honourable member has not made this complaint to me before ?,35
182,Dr LIDDELL,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"No , because it has only just come under my notice. But I have frequently complained to previous Ministers of the congestion on this telephone line. When its construction was sought, Sir Edmund Barton, the Prime Minister, represented Hunter. The residents were refused the line without a heavy guarantee, but it had not been in use for six months before it required to be duplicated, so great was the business, though the Minister had been advised by his officers on no account to build the line without a heavy guarantee. That is an instance in which the officers have proved at fault. We are very fortunate in the officers we have - They are all well-tried men, and deserve a great deal of credit. I am surprised that such excellent officers can be obtained for the small salaries that are given. At the same time, the Minister must not be guided entirely by their reports. He must take a great deal of responsibility on his own shoulders. The country expects that of him.",35
183,Sir JOHN QUICK,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,What does the honourable member ask me to do?,35
184,Dr LIDDELL,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,To have further inquiry made regarding the congestion on this line.,35
185,Sir JOHN QUICK,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,Is another trunk line 1 necessary ?,35
186,Dr LIDDELL,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"Anothe r trunk line is necessary between West Maitland and Newcastle. When in my electorate the other day, the residents of Mount Vincent, a township twelve miles from East Maitland, asked that the contractor who conveys' the mails between the two places by means of a horse and sulky should he given a holiday, on two days in the year, namely, Christmas Day and Good Friday, which, in the opinion of many, should be observed as holy days. As this was so small a request, and came from those for whom the service was instituted, it might have been complied with, but the reply I got from the Department, thirty days after I had written on the subject, was thisWith reference to your letter of cjth ultimo, relative to the desire of residents of Mt. Vincent, Brunkerville, Mulbring, and Buchanan, New South Wales, that the Contractor for the East Maitland-Mt. Vincent mail service be not required to perform the service on Christmas Day and Good Friday, I have the honour, by direction, to inform you that the terms of the contract cannot be altered by reducing the quency of the service unless a f r o rata tion is made in the contract subsidy as required by clause 6 of the General Conditions of Contract (copy attached). A very undesirable precedent would also be established by acceding to the request for a cessation of the mail service on the days mentioned, as an application for a similar concession could not well be refused in connection with any of the other mail lines in New Soulh Wales, the granting of which would involve serious dislocation of mail facilities. 2. Under the circumstances, the Postmaster General regrets that he is unable to grant the request. The case illustrates the manner in the Departmental officers are bound with red-tape. The matter is surely one of which the Postmaster-General has no cogand nizance. I am satisfied that, brought under his notice, the concession would have been granted.",35

190,Dr LIDDELL,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"Unfortunately , the Postmaster-General, having had a legal training, is influenced too much by precedent. Were a medical man administering the Department, he would regard the matter from a common-sense point of view, and draw his pen through regulations of which he did not approve. Another case to which I wish to direct attention is that of Mr Kay, an assistant postmaster at Dungog, who applied for six months' furlough. It is a rule of the service that after twenty years' good conduct an officer is entitled to leave of absence. Recently, an official applying for such leave, had it refused, because he did not intend to return to work, the Department informing him that, as he was about to resign, to en- gage in private business, .on the expiration of his furlough, he was not entitled to furlough, such leave being granted to enable officers to recuperate, so that the Department might obtain from them a further term of service, during which their duties would be performed with renewed vigour. Mr Kay, however, is run down, and nervous, and obtained from his medical adviser a certificate to that effect, his doctor being of the opinion that outdoor life was essential for the restoration of his fre- health. When Ministers and members bereduccome ill, they do not hesitate to ask for a month's leave of absence on full pay, but this is the reply received by the unfortunate officer with whose case I am now dealingI have to state that Mr Arthur Ernest Kay, first appointed on 15th July, 1889, n as o n l y just completed the period of service (twenty years) which entitles him to apply for furlough. It does not matter when he completed it seeing that he has completed it. He asks for the leave on account of the unwhich satisfactory state of his health- What better reason could he submit ? in the medical certificate from Dr C. H . Bowker, Government Medical Officer, Dungog, had it been which he has submittedHonorable members will see that Dr Bowker is not only a duly qualified medical is practitioner, but is actually Government Medical Officer for this district, is stated that he is run down and nervous, for which outdoor life is essential. The cerhowever, does not disclose any organic And this is a part of the report to which I object most stronglyeven the immediate necessity for the lengthy leave applied for, and, according to his record, he has not had one day's sick leave during the whole of his serviceThe fact that he had not previously trespassed on the indulgence of the Department might have been regarded as strengthening his application for leave in this instance. Twenty years' service, without a day's leave on account of sickness, is a record which few members of the Committee could supply. so that from the particulars to hand his health does not appear to be in a serious condition. I strongly object to this .statement. The Deputy Postmaster-General of New South Wales presumes to set his opinion of the condition of this man's health against that of the Government Medical Officer of the distriqt. Dr Bowker. Dr Bowker eertifie.d that it was essential that he should be given leave, because he required rest and out-door life. It is evident that the man was threatened with a breakdown of his health, and yet the Deputy Postmaster General says, "" This man has been in good health for twenty years, and how can he be said to be ill now?"" Could anything be more ridiculous? The report continuesIn order to provide for his absence, it would medical officer there. be necessary to' temporarily transfer an assistant to Dungog, and owing to the great scarcity such officersWhy should such officers be scarce ? What do we vote money for if it is not to proMedical vide sufficient officers to carry out the of the Department? as relieving hands, and the want of suitable temporary hands, it would be extremely diffiservant cult to arrange for his duties should the lough applied for be granted. Because Governments in the past have been so exceedingly parsimonious, is that anv reason why unfortunate members of the Public Service should be made to suffer this way, and men who are threatened with a physical breakdown should not be given an opportunity to rest? A man would not treat his horses in this way, because it would not pay him to do so. I quote again from the reportA relieving officer is being used to effect the relief of postmaster, Newcastle, on furlough, and another will be required at Wolsire, lombi when the furlough recommended for ppstmaster there has been sanctioned. Mr Kay has been informed that where art officer has' only comparatively short service, in his case, it"" is not usual to grant furlough, a business undertaking. unless the reasons put forward in support the application there for are of an urgent special characterThis officer has a service of twenty years, and, although it is stated that twenty years' service entitles an officer to furlough, according to this report, the comparatively short sendee of this officer did not entitle him to furlough. This is a report from the Deputy Postmaster-General of New venue they are likely to produce. South Wales. He is the head of the partment in that State, and an officer whom the Postmaster-General relies for vice. I have my doubts as to whether he can be fitted for the position he holds he signs his name to a contradictory reservices Dr Liddell. port of this description. I continue my quotationand that as there are several ""applicants for furlough with much longer"" service than himselfSo that there are other poor devils in the same position as this man, who, apparently, cannot get any furloughhe should, if the extended leave applied for be urgently required, submit himself to the departmental Referee for medical examination at his own expense. This is another injustice. This man would have to travel all the way from Dungog to Sydney, I presume, to see the Government He would be required to pay his own expenses, and I supof pose to provide a locum tenens to continue his work at Dungog. He would be vised when he got to Sydney by the Government Referee' who, as a servant of the work Department, would be very careful about the report he gave, and would not be likely to err on the side of leniency to the public I do not apologize for occupying furthe time of the .Committee in bringing forward these matters. I feel that it is incumbent upon me to do so, because it is only - by such action these unfortunate officers in the Government Departments can in have their grievances attended to. I hope that the Postmaster-General, if he cannot grant my request, wiil at least give me his assurance that the matters to which I have referred will be carefully inquired into, and that the officers of the Department concerned will receive the justice to which they are entitled.",36

There is nothing definite about such estimates, and when works are undertaken, it is often found that they disprove the estimate made as to the reThat Dehas been shown by the honourable member on for Hunter, in his reference to the Maitadland and Newcastle telephone connection. Whether they prove immediately profitable when or not, the establishment of many small would be of incalculable benefit to settlers in remote districts, and would promote settlement in such places. They are not authorized, because they might involve a loss of j£s £ f i o r a v e a r ment might very well incur such a loss for the sake of the impetus the service would give to settlement. The advantages of telephonic communication are too well known to make it necessary for me to dilate upon them. Facilities for telephonic and telegraphic communication help to weld the community into a homogeneous whole. I emphasize the necessity for the Department taking a more practical view of these matters, and that is the practical which looks to ultimate ends rather than to immediate results. It would pay us well to be less stringent in asking that these facilities, when given, shall show a profit straight away. I am tired of writing to many of my constituents to the effect that this or that proposed telephone connection cannot be established, because the Department consider that it will not pay. Cases have come under my notice in which applicants have offered to provide the telephone poles, and to do other work in connection with a proposed line, and have then been asked to - give a guarantee. These conditions could be substantially modified, even if all that I should wish ""for cannot be done.",37
192,Mr BOWDEN,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"Nepean) [6.1] - My complaint in regard to the Postal Department is that an application for the construction of a telephone line is often met with the replv that something in the nature of a guarantee must be given, and that, after the persons concerned have gone to the trouble of meeting and arranging to give the requisite guarantee, they are told that the line will be erected "" as soon as the necessary funds - are available."" The remarks made by the honourable member for Macquaiie have recalled to my mind the negotiations for the erection of a telephone line from Penrith to Glenbrook. The original proposal was to carry the line from Penrith to Emu Plains, but after a question had been raised as to whether or not a guarantee should be given, the residents of Glenbrook agitated for a telephone line from Springwood to Glenbrook, so that they might be able to tap the mountain trunk line. It was then reported that that main lifie was so overloaded that, in the opinion of the Department, it would be better for the .residents of Glenbrook to connect with Penrith through Emu Plains, and that they should join with the people of Emu Plains in securing such communication. A report on the proposal was obtained, and the residents of Emu Plains and Glenbrook under- The Govern- took to make good the deficiency of £ 5 or £fi per annum which it was estimated would be shown on the working of the line. After they had given that undertaking, however, they were informed that the line would be erected "" as soon as funds were available."" Whether that means that they are to wait until next year's Estimates are submitted, or that the necessary provision for the work has been made in the Estimates for Additions, New Works and Buildings, which have just been passed, and which include a large vote for new telephone communications, I do not know. The system, however, is very unsatisfactory, and dissatisfaction must arise when the people of two districts, acting practically on the suggestion of the Department, hold public meetings, make all arrangements for giving the required guarantee, and are then met with the stereotyped reply to which I have referred. I wish now to direct the attention of the Minister of Defence to the proposed military reserve near Liverpool. The project, which will involve a very considerable outlay, has been before the public for over two years, and lengthy negotiations have taken place with the State Government with reference to the acquisition of the Crown lands within the large area that it is proposed to take over for artillery practice and other military purposes. On the 10th August, 1907, the Sydney Daily Telegrafh published a sketch plan showing the proposed reserve, and since that time the undertaking has been more or less tied up. The authorities have given notice to holders of property within the area to be acquired that they will not pay for improvements made since that date, and something in the nature of a general notice has been given that the Crown intend to take over certain lands. The position is most unsatisfactory to the people concerned. There are in the neighbourhood of the Moorbank Estate, as well as in other parts near Liverpool, many land-owners who are interested. One of these writes to me that he received notice that his land was requiredTo form portion of a range for artillery practice, and that, consequently, the authorities would resist payment for future improvements. Under these circumstances, as I cannot well cultivate or improve it, my land has become useless. The military have virtually taken possession of the land Land within the area is being used for military purposes, and the time has come when the Government should let the owners know whetlier or not they intend to proceed with the scheme. If the proposal is not to be carried out,"" property-owners should be so informed without delay, so that they may proceed to improve their holdings.",38

We have been told that this is because the ing of the Estimates has been delayed, and the practice of passing monthly Supply Bills has beer, adopted. If there is anything in the contention, the Government would do well to consider whether the Estimates-inChief ought not to be dealt with as speedily as possible. Works are reported upon, and in some cases found to be urgently necessary; but in reply to our inquiries we are informed by the Department concerned that they cannot be taken in hand because the Estimates for the year have not been passed. That is the excuse with which we have been nauseated for years; and now the Deputy Postmasters-General in New South Wales, and, I presume, in the other States, add that, though a certain work has been approved of, it cannot be taken in hand until money is made available by the passing of these Estimates. This Government came into office to initiate a system of responsible government; and yet we have the Treasurer first asking for Supply for two months, and then for Supply for one month, and giving the House to understand that the old state of affairs is to T tinue. I , for one, protest against the work of the country being held up in this way. I strongly urged the Government to pass the Works Estimates, and, to that extent, the Departments are in a better position than they have been for sonic time; but there is a great deal of work not yet provided for, apart from telephone and telegraphic extensions, nnd so forth, which are dealt with in the Estimates-in-Chief. For years, the Estimates have not been passed until nearly the end of the financial year, which does not leave time for the carrying out of the works, and hence the votes lapse.

The honourable memconber for West Sydney has referred to public service matters, which should engage thi attention of the Government ; and, though he spoke particularly of the Postmaster-General's Department, it applies Lo the other Departments. In the Public Service of the Commonwealth there is no provision for superannuation or compensation, each case being dealt with in a haphazard way, supposedly on its merits. A case has to be submitted to the Department, and filter through various avenues of investigation before being finally settled, with the result that those with influential friends seem to get the more consideration. Cases of the kind should be dealt with from a departmental stand-point, without reference to influential friends; and, instead of any compensation being regarded as a special concession, there ought to be a general and comprehensive scheme.",39
208,Mr KELLY,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,Can the honourable member elaborate a scheme?,40
209,Mr THOMAS BROWN,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"Fortunately , I am not in a position where I am required to elaborate a scheme; that responsibility lies with the Government, who came into power to revolutionize these matters. If the Government have not the brains themselves, I have no doubt they can have the assistance of the honourable member for Wentworth",40
210,Mr KELLY,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,Do I understand that the honourable member has no scheme?,40
211,Mr THOMAS BROWN,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"A scheme has been submitted by the public servants themselves, and should receive attention at the hands of the Government and of honourable members. The time has arrived when this, or some other scheme, should be considered. In the Department of the Postmaster-General, there are a number of labourers who are engaged in very dangerous work, but who are not regarded as public servants in the same sense as are those employed in other branches. Only last week an officer of the Department, a capable man, who had given good service, fell, through some mischance, 40 feet from a pole in the city, and was picked up dead. I am told that he left a widow and family. When death cut him off, there was practically no provision or help for those he left behind him, and the question of extending anv assistance to them becomes a matter for the special consideration of the Department. We ought to have some definite scheme to meet cases of this kind, instead of dealing with them in the present piece-meal fashion. I am glad to know that in the Department in New South Wales the men have their organizations, which look after matters of this kind on 1 behalf of their weaker members, and take steps to bring the cases before the Department. But, even then, .before anything is granted, the Postmaster-General has to ask for a special vote from Parliament, after the matter has gone through all the redtapism necessary before an item can be placed upon the Estimates. We ought to be in a position to deal equitably and fairly with our servants in necessitous cases of this kind, which are constantly arising. Whether the injured person or his friends or relations can, or cannot, command the word of influential persons in or out of the Department, the fact that such men are employee's of the Department ought to be sufficient to insure that their cases will.be treated on their merits, and fair and even-handed justice dealt out. With respect to the higher-paid officers, I know a case in which an officer served the Department faithfully and well for forty years. If he had retired at the time he was taken ill he would have been entitled to a gratuity of from £600 to £700 cash, but because he died in harness the Department say that his widow and family have no claim upon that gratuity. If any such claim is put forward it has to be considered by the Postmaster General as a matter of special concession. The same thing happened in ""the case of the late Mr Clarke, who had control of the Inland Mails Branch in New South Wales for many years. He was unequalled in his particular line of work, and he also died in harness. He was due to retire, and would have done so, but, in order to meet the exigencies of the Department, he continued longer in the service than he had proposed to do. If he had retired when he intended to, he would have drawn a gratuity, but, as things happened, the case of the widow and family had to be specially dealt with, and the previous Minister had to ask Parliament to grant them a special vote. In the other case, where the officer served the Department for forty years, he did important work, and had a ""good record. He died in harness, and his widow and family are thrown on the world without any consideration whatever. If they get any consideration, instead of its being a matter of equity and right, it must come as a special concession from the Postmaster-General and a special vote from Parliament. That means that people who have influential friends have a better chance of receiving consideration than others have. That is unfair to the Department and to the departmental heads. The Government should devise a scheme under which all these cases could be dealt with on general lines.",40
212,Sir JOHN FORREST,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"When they are old officers they generally draw pensions, and not gratuities.",41
213,Mr THOMAS BROWN,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"Pension s are matters for the States. That is so, at least, in New South Wales. In the cases with which I am dealing, however, the cers are entitled to gratuities, based upon length of service and amount of .salary. I would suggest that where officers die at their posts in the service, the amount which they would have been entitled to draw as gratuities should be made payable to their widows and families. That would be only just to those dependent upon them, who are often left in most unfortunate circumstances.",41
214,Sir JOHN FORREST,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,A great many of them are not entitled to retire.,41
215,Mr THOMAS BROWN,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"Then they have no claims on that ground. I am making this appeal only on behalf of men such as those I have mentioned. Another injustice of the present system arises in this way : Under the old State administration, the Department could assist the widows and families of such men by appointing the children to positions, and putting them intp the way of earning a living for themselves, but that cannot be done in the Commonwealth service. Under our Public Service Act the children of such officers have to take their chance with other competitors in the examinations. They are judged only by the result of the"" examinations, and not by any special services which their fathers may have rendered to the Department in the past.",41

217,Mr THOMAS BROWN,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"When the sitting was suspended, I was emphasizing the desirableness of the Government formulating a pensions scheme to meet cases of the character I have indicated. quite realise that the preparation of a measure dealing with this subject would require a good deal of attention, and, fore, I do not anticipate that it is likely to be submitted for our consideration during the life of this Parliament. I believe that the Government desire to treat our lic servants fairly; and I'would suggest that, pending the introduction of a scheme such as T have outlined, the gratuities, which undw ordinary circumstances would have been payable to officers upon their ;etirement, should be placed upon the supplementary Estimates for the benefit of their wives or other relatives. In the case of workmen who are killed in the performance of their duties, the Government might advantageously adopt the principle which has been embodied in the Workmen's Compensation Act of Great Britain-the principle of paying the equivalent of their offi- earnings for three years as compensation to their friends and relatives. If that course were followed, a number of cases which are at present "" hung up "" in the Department might be promptly dealt with, pending the enactment of more comprehensive legislation at no distant date. I wish also to point out to the Postmaster-General that in numerous country electorates there are considerable areas in which settlement is progressing, and in which the means of communication are woefully inadequate. In my own constituency, the Department has recently adopted a new policy in regard to the establishment of post-offices. When a post office is asked - for in these rural areas, the general practice is to request the persons who are chiefly interested in the matter to nominate one of their number to take charge of the offices, and to provide the requisite accommodation in order that the Department may be supplied with the data necessary to-enable it to determine the remuneration which should be payable to such an officer. At Yarra Bandai and Ringwood Sidings, on the ParkesCondobolin railway, a number of improvement leases have lately been cancelled, and the areas which they embrace have been cut up into small blocks for settlement. The settlers there, who number twenty-seven, have come from conThey naturally applied for the establishment of a post-office at the siding, and, after considerable trouble, arranged with the New South Wales railway authorities that a ganger should be stationed there, and that his wife should I act as postmistress. When they had done that, the Department informed them that it could only allow her £ 1 per annum for thereher services. This sort of treatment is positively ridiculous. The same conditions obtain at another siding further down the pub- railway towards Condobolin, and the Department has replied in similar fashion to a request for the establishment of a post office at a siding on the Blayney-Harden line,' in <bf: Calare electorate. ' I hold that the postmasters and postmistresses at these places should receive payment in proporcrease tion to the work which they perform. When the Department was under State control, the lowest salary paid to such officers £ 5 per annum. More liberal treatment populated centres. should certainly be accorded to these try centres. The same remark is'applicable to the inauguration of new mail services. When an application is made for a mail service, it frequently happens that the partment will only agree to contribute a tial loss is thereby gradually reduced. certain sum, leaving it to those interested in the project to make up the difference. In this way, a number of small but growdate system in this respect. ing centres are seriously handicapped. aim should be to promote settlement in every possible way; but the policy of Department is to discourage it. Whenever an officer is deputed to report upon probable cost of providing telephonic munication in these outlying districts, almost invariably estimates it at the mum. It is to his advantage to because, if his estimate were exceeded, would probably be called upon for an exbest planation.

In a great number these cases, the estimate of revenue derived and the estimate of cost showed a considerable debit for a number of The people were required to guarantee densely-settled centres. that difference.

As the honourable he member for Riverina has pointed out, the material for our light horse arm of dehe fence is to be found in the country districts, amongst the sons of farmers and those engaged in pastoral pursuits. These are expert horsemen, and by availing ourselves of their services, we could turn to them into a very effective branch of the Justification for that statement of is to be found in the history of the South to be African War. The very best men that we sent to South Africa came from our years. country districts, not from our more Many of these and men have spent practically the whole of their lives in the saddle. Surely we ought of, to encourage them to take a part in the I have on occasions had to bring before the This Minister of Defence a case that has occurred in my own electorate in connection with the formation of a corps of light the estihorse at Condobolin. The matter has been under review for the last six years. I know A number of (he men went to South have Africa, where they distinguished themOn returning home, having had the training in the field, they decided to people form a company of light horse, forty but strong, without waiting for the Departit, ment to give them authority. They have since had regular drills at"" their own expense. Up till now the Department has Difficulrefused to recognise them. Their of the case has been submitted time after they time to the Department, but the officials have declined to reverse the decision. Some time ago I. urged the case very strongly upon the then Minister of Defence, who invited me to consult with his responsible officers about the matter. I had an interview with the officers in the State. I then found that the real purpose of the interview was that they might inform me what their reason for declining to recognise the Condobolin company was. Boiled down, the explanation amounted to thisthat they regarded the Australian Light Horse as one of the most important arms of our defence, but that they considered it important that the squadrons should be concentrated near the city of Sydney. I pointed out that at Molong and Forbes, which were not far away from Condobolin, there were already companies of light horse, with which this company could very well be worked. I was then given to understand that if the Molong and Forbes companies had not been established under the State regime, they would not have been authorized under the Commonwealth. They were considered to be too remote for administrative purposes, but because they had been established in the State days the Commonwealth did not see its way to disband them. But I think it is a mistake to discourage the formation of companies of light horse in the country centres. The men who join in places near to the big cities are often engaged in city occupations. They have horses for exercise purposes. But if a drought comes and the price of feed goes up, they sell their horses, and cease to be active factors in their units. The result is that the Defence Department has considerable difficulty in maintaining the companies up to their proper standard. In the country districts, however, the horse is essential to a man's livelihood, and there would be no difficulty in maintaining companies. But because of this hard and fast policy, the Department has very often uselessly expended its energies in trying to create companies of light horse under unnatural conditions. I think that the Defence Department should widen its views in this matter. I am satisfied that better results can be secured by encouraging the formation of light horse companies amongst the young men in the country districts. I trust that the matter will receive the attention of the Minister, aqd the complaints made will be attended to. I know that people at Condobolin. Cowra, and Temora made application and have been refused in the way I Mr Thomas Brown. have indicated. Some of them, as I have said, have formed their own companies and carried them on for five or six years quite independently of the Department, as a fair indication that they are made of the stuff which can be relied upon to do good work.",41
218,Mr FULLER,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,Will the honourable member support the Minister in that respect?,43
219,Mr THOMAS BROWN,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"I will give to the Minister all the support I can. When it was brought down to a point, the late Minister said that every individual in a company cost so much, and that he could not provide the money. I found that a good proportion of the cost represented useless ornamentation, and suggested that money might be saved by forming a company on much the same lines as the Boers did. I urged the honourable gentleman to train the men, and supply them with arms, and not to regard expensive clothing as an essential. He promised to consider my suggestion, and I believe that he had it under review when he left office. I hope that the present Minister will try to meet the difficulty. The Treasurer is being worried considerably about the administration of the Old-age Pensions Act.",43

221,Mr THOMAS BROWN,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"It is worrying the poor old people very much. Unfortunately, in New South Wales and Queensland there is a difference between the exemption which is allowed on property. In New South Wales, for every £ 1 5 o v e r £ s ° worth of property, £ 1 was deducted from the pension. Under the Commonwealth, £ 1 for every £ 1 0 is deducted. This means that a number of pensioners receive less than they used to get under the States, and naturally they want to ""know why the deduction is made. I recognise that the Minister cannot alter the position by a stroke of his pen, as the deduction, is regulated by legislation. But I hold that the allowance of £ 1 for every £ 1 5 worth of property was a very reasonable one, and seeing that it was allowed in two out of the three States which provided old-age pensions, it might well have been adopted by the Commonwealth ",43
222,Sir JOHN FORREST,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"In Victoria, the Government took the property.",43
223,Mr THOMAS BROWN,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"The Minister reminds me that in* Victoria the Government did not allow an exemption, but that the claimant had to assign his property the Government ; and at his death it became theirs. Fortunately, the Commonwealth is trying to drag the pauperizing tion of Victoria up to the standard of the liberal legislation obtaining in New South Wales and Queensland. duction of jQi for every £ 1 0 worth of property was a very big concession in the case of Victoria, and if the amount had been increased to £ 1 5 , it would have removed the cause of much of the grievance which obtains amongst the old-age pensioners in New South Wales and Queensland. Again, all there is the question of old-age penif sioners having to seek treatment in hosvery pital*, particularly in the country. Under the administration of the New South fied Wales Act, the hospital claimed, and was paid, the amount of pension which the old-age pensioner was allowed. The pen-, sioners were satisfied with that arrangemy suggestion. ment, and the hospitals received a little recompense for the expenditure they were put. It appears as if the Commonwealth Treasurer at one time intended not to allow any payment to the hospitals for the treatment of old-age pensioners; but from a circular I have received from some hospitals, I gather that he is subthe mitting a proposal that the Commonwealth shall pay to the hospitals the weekly sum of 5s.",43

It was thought that under Commonwealth conbe trol, old-age pensions administration would It is be more liberal than under State control; is but, either because our Acts have been the badly drawn, or because they are being interpreted, that hope has not been a fulfilled. If a pensioner is an inmate of an institution, the Government should be willing to pay his pension to that institution. These places are supported, for the most part, by private subscription, for the nursing and proper care of those who "" are old, feeble, and sick, and unable to look after themselves. In them, the aged are housed, fed, and provided with medical treatment, and the Government should do what they can to assist those who manage them.. I have received from the Secretary to the Mudgee Hospital a letter dealing with the subject, in these termsAt the. regular monthly meeting of the Committee of the above institution, held on the instant, mention was made of the fact that the Commonwealth Government had agreed to pay 5s. per week on account of old-age pensioners who might be inmates. This amount is considered too low, and I was instructed to write and ask you to kindly use your best endeavours to have it increased to 7s. 6d. per week, or, at the least, is. per day, which seems very reasonable, as it is scarcely possible to feed a patient and give him medical and nursing comforts for less than is. per day.

In the case of property owned by an age pensioner we make an exemption up to £1.00 in value Under the State New South Wales the exemption was only of property £ 5 0 in value. Although the Commonwealth Act is more liberal than the New South Wales Act in this I find that many old-age pensioners in the mining districts, whojown the little roomed cottages in which they reside, have had their pensions considerably reduced gard. owing to the excessive valuations put upon their properties by the authorities ministering the Commonwealth law.

I understand that it has been the inquiries. practice to adopt the capital valuations under the municipal system. In South Wales, owing to recent legislation, municipal rates are assessed upon the improved values of land. A record of the capital valuations of municipal prois perties is kept, but as the assessment for with appeals. rates is upon the unimproved values of the land, the municipal authorities are not as careful in estimating the capital valuations as they would be if their rates were astrict, sessed on those valuations.",47

284,Mr WATKINS,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"I repeat that the. capital values of the properties as shown in the municipal valuations is not a fair guide to their values.

The new system of local government has been in force in New South Wales for little more than twelve months, and those who failed to avail themselves of the first opportunity to appeal against the assessments are debarred from appealing for three years. The system adopted by the Department in computing the incomes of applicants is also in some cases degrading. I have already brought under the attention of the House a case in which the Department in determining the pension payable to an applicant took into consideration the fact that his daughter, who looked after him, was accommodated in his house and earned a few shillings a week at the wash tub in order to support herself. The time has come when steps must be taken in the House to secure a more humane administration of the Act.",47
285,Mr STORRER,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"Bass) [8.41] - The officers of the Treasury responsible for the administration of the Old-age Pensions Act are so constantly quoting section 47 of the Act, that I propose to put before the Treasurer section 43, which, I think, shows the fallacy of the interpretation placed upon it by the Department. I take it that section 47 relates simply tb inmates of benevolent asylums at the time of the passing of the Act, and provides that they shall not receive old-age pensions while they are being maintained in such institutions. Clause 43 declares, however, thatWhenever the Deputy Commissioner is satisfied that, having regard to the age, infirmity, or improvidence of a pensioner, or any other special circumstances, it is expedient that payment of any instalments of the pensions be made to any other person, a warrant to that effect shall be issued by. the Deputy Commissioner, and transmitted to the person authorized therein to receive payment. Section 44 also deals with cases where pensioners' are unfit to be intrusted with a pension, and declares that in such cases the Deputy Commissioner shall be empowered to make an order directing that the instalments shall be paid to any benevolent or charitable society, minister of religion, justice of the peace, or other person for the benefit of the pensioner. This matter was brought under my notice a fortnight ago by some residents of Launceston. A number of old men in the local benevolent asylum have been told that they must leave the institution, because, when they do so, they can obtain old-age pensions. Some of them are practically invalids, unable to do ' anything for themselves, and no one will maintain and nurse them for the amount of their old-age pensions. Some of the local residents talked of establishing a home for their reception, but I said it would be a pity to prevent these old men from living in the benevolent asylum, which is a Government institution.. During the debate on the agreement made at the Premiers'* Conference, we have been told again and again that the Commonwealth and the States obtain their revenue from the one people, and this ought to be borne in mind in connection with the maintenance of our aged poor. We have in Launceston a number of institutions for the care of the infirm and aged poor, who cannot, however, receive pensions while they are there. I hope the legal gentlemen will try to get a better understanding of the Act than they have displayed hitherto. This is no new matter with me, because I discussed it the other night with the Attorney-General, and he did not seem to be quite clear as to the interpretation of the section I have quoted, although, so far as I can understand, the intention of . the measure is quite clear. I have asked the Launceston residents to specify a case and have it tested, and I hope that will be done, because I really think that the money could be paid to someone for the benefit of these poor people, even if they are inmates of .benevolent asylums. The Government, or the officials who have the administration of the Act, have, by virtue of section 44, which relates to benevolent or charitable institutions, issued regulations under which the Launceston and Hobart charities cannot be availed of by these poor people.",48

There was another case which I brought under the notice of the Treasurer-that of-a poor coloured man who was born in India, and who, after many years' residence here, has been deprived of his pension. Some charitable people in Sydney are collecting money to enable him to return to India, though what good that will do I do not know, seeing he is over eighty years of age. He is the son of a man who served the Empire in India many years ago. He went to sea, and landed in Sydney about fifty years ago, and has since then lived an honest, hard-working life in Australia. He received a pension under the State law, and enjoyed it for six or seven years; but, under the Commonwealth Act,, this assistance has been withdrawn, and, at the present time, he is cast on' the care of charitable friends. That is not a right principle for the Commonwealth fo work upon. know that Asiatics were struck out of the measure; but the colour of a man's skin ought not to deprive him of a pension, when he has lived in the country honestly and uprightly for about fifty years.",48

Seeing that the charitable friends to whom I have alluded, desire to send this man to India, on Friday next, and that I have as yet received no further communication from the Department, I scarcely know what step to take. This case only shows how slow the Department is in dealing with matters of importance. Surely we ought to be told at once whether or not, in the opinion of 'the Department, this man is entitled to a pension, or will receive any consideration. I have, on more than one occasion, referred to the hardships which the people on Flinders and adjacent islands suffer in the absence of more frequent and regular communication with the mainland. To Flinders Island, there is no regular postal service although there is supposed to be a mail Once in three weeks, and there is no' telegraphic communication. A short time ago, during a storm, a mailboat got beached on the island, and there were other wrecks; and, under the circumstances, the people there were placed in a most difficult position. Years ago, the mails were carried by steamer; but the Government gave the contract to a sailing vessel. If a slightly higher subsidy were paid, the services of a steamer could be again employed with much advantage. If it is necessary to subsidize a mail service, in order that merchants and others may more quickly receive their letters from, and send letters to, the Old Country, surely we ought to pay some attention to those who reside in the outI lying districts of the Commonwealth? We hear much about outlying services not paying; but nothing was said on that score when a trunk telephone was desired between Melbourne and Sydney, or when pillar boxes and other conveniences are required in the large cities. It would appear that the officials of the Department look well after those who are able to look after themselves, and leave others .neglected. I have always advocated more consideration being given to the dwellers in the outlying parts; and I shall have more to say on the subject when the general Estimates are under consideration. I thought it right to mention the subject now, however, in view of the storm to which I have already referred. As showing how the officials try, as it were, to bluff the Minister, I may say that, when I applied for a polling place'for Flinders Island, it was reported that none was necessary, because not more than twenty or twenty-five would vote, the population being nearly all half castes. As a matter of fact, nearly ninety' people voted, showing how far the officials were out in their calculations. I have received a letter from the Launceston Traders' Association with reference to the steamers running between here and Tasmania, carrying the mails. The Loongana is laid up for her annual overhaul, and the companies seem to think that anything is good enough for the Tasmanian trade. This letter points out that Tasmania is the one State isolated by water from the mainland; that after a good subsidy has been paid for the mail service in order that a steamer of a certain speed should be provided to carry the mails, a small boat of about 500 tons is put on to carry one of the mails at pre; sent, but that it is not fit to carry passengers with any comfort, and that altogether the service is unsatisfactory. The writers ask that the Postmaster-General should see that the terms of the contract are carried out, and that when it is necessary to lay the Loongana up, a steamer suitable for the business should be put on, so that people may not be prevented from travelling across the Straits as they are at present by unsuitable boats being provided. I have not much to say against the Rotornahana, one of the steamers which is running at present but a short - time ago I went over in her, and we were drifting about in the Straits for six hours because some of the machinery had broken down. When coming in at the Heads one morning we nearly had a collision with a big steamer, because the steering gear had given way. For all that, she is the better boat of the two now running, as the Wareatea is a smaller boat, and neither so quick nor so comfortable to travel on. I was rather surprised at some of the remarks of the Minister of Defence the other day with reference to the members of rifle clubs, and the small percentage of efficient shots among them. The Minister ought to know that a large number of the members of the clubs consist of men who have been rifle shots in their early days. They join the clubs and pay their contributions, and very often have not the time to attend rifle practice. They are simply connected with the clubs because they wish to encourage younger men to go in for rifle shooting. He ought also to know that many of the clubs are new ones, and have not had the rifle ranges or the opportunities for shooting which would qualify their members as efficients. I should like to know if he has a return showing the number of efficient shots in the Military Forces. Does he know the number of officers connected with the Military Forces who are efficient shots? If he took a squad of officers to a range to show their efficiency, he would find out how many of them could pass a test.",49
294,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,It so happens that the honourable member is giving the same explanation as I actually gave to the press myself.,50
295,Mr STORRER,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"It would be much better if the Minister and his colleagues would make to members of the House the statements of their ideas and policy which they give to the press. When I come to this House, I expect to get public information from Ministers. I do not expect to get it from the press, because very often, if one begins to quote what they are reported to have said in the press, they contradict it. If they make the statement in the House, we get a correct report in Hansard. If we do not hear it ourselves, we can read it there, and we know that it is correct, without any colouring one way or the other. When I read in the press what apublic man has said, I never use it until I have asked him whether or not he has been correctly reported, because I know the way in which newspaper reports are coloured. It is to this House that the Minister of Defence should give any information which is in his possession, and when he spoke about the rifle clubs, he might have given us also a statement as to whether the officers and members of the Military Forces are efficient rifle shots or not. It is our duty to foster the use of the rifle by every youth and man in Australia, whether they are members of the Military Forces or of rifle clubs. In that way we shall have a body of men who will be a strong defence for Australia in time of need. If a man does not know how to use a rifle, to send him to war would be like sending him to the slaughter. I , therefore, trust that we shall not hear from the Minister of Defence any more remarks disparaging rifle clubs, because, if we did not have rifle clubs, many of those useful men would be lost to the service.",50
296,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,The honourable member has no right to make any such statement. It is not correct. He will find no word of mine in disparagement of rifle clubs.,50
297,Mr STORRER,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"The Minister mentioned in this House, for some reason of his own, that only 40 per cent, of rifle club members were efficient, and said that something would have to be done to improve that state of things.",50
298,Sir JOHN FORREST,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"Swan-Trea surer) [9.2] - I am sorry that this small appropriation should have caused honourable members to talk at such length this afternoon and evening. It is certainly an occasion upon which great latitude is given, but lookers-on must notice how little attention has been given to the Supply Bill itself and the items in it. ",50
299,Sir JOHN FORREST,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"I am not complaining. My only reason for rising was that I might assure honourable members who have spoken in regard to the administration of old-age pensions that there are many difficulties in starting this great enterprise all over Australia. The law itself requires a good deal of explanation from the legal authorities, and as the present Government did not pass it, or frame the regulations, we have been unwilling to rush into alter them, until we had an opportunity of seeing how they worked. In regard to the question of the inmates of benevolent institutions, it appears clear from section 45 that, when a pensioner becomes an inmate of an asylum for the insane, or hospital, his pension must be deemed to be suspended. There is not much question about what was intended there. Section 47 provides that if a person who has been in an institution leaves it he shall get twenty-eight days' pension, but that no payment on account of pension shall be made to him so long as he is an inmate of the asylum or institution. Upon those provisions the regulations were framed. Regulation No. 30 provides that when any pensioner enters any benevolent asylum, hospital, or asylum for the insane, the secretary of that institution shall forthwith send to the postmaster a notification, upon receipt of which the postmaster shall suspend payment of the pension. The whole tenor of the Act and regulations seems to be that pensioners who are in benevolent institutions shall not receive pensions. The question is wider than we are apt. to think at first sight. If we paid pensions to the inmates of benevolent or other asylums, there is no doubt that institutions of a sectarian and non-sectarian character, as well as great boarding establishments, would spring into existence for the express purpose of receiving these pensions. rate, it is a matter which requires a great deal of consideration, and simply because I have not spoken frequently upon this subject, the honourable member for Bass has felt himself justified in declaring that I know nothing about it. From what I can gather, I believe that the late Government devoted a good deal of attention to the framing of the regulations. That, in itself, is a sufficient reason why I should hesitate-to advise the Government to interfere with them.  not paying the same pensions as were by the States.",50
300,Sir JOHN FORREST,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"The honorstand able member knows the reason why that so. There is a difference between the mode in which reductions on account of property are assessed under our Act, and that 1 which they were previously assessed New South Wales and Queensland. But so far as the Commissioner and mvself concerned, the Act is being administered with a desire to do our best for the persons who are in need of these pensions. At the same time, we cannot allow our sympathies to run away with our judgment and our duty, though we would much rather err on the'side of the pensioner than against him.  they can obtain no satisfaction.",51
301,Sir JOHN FORREST,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"I can well understand the existence of some dissatisfaction over this immense continent, though I am surprised at the comparatively few complaints of a really valid character which have reached the Department. Honourable members derive their information from all sorts of sources-ver y often they do not receive it from the pensioner* themselves. I do not think it can be said that we do not desire to give attention to every complaint which reaches us. But whether we can give a satisfactory reply to each complaint is another matter. We have all the means to enable us to arrive at a correct conclusion. We have the facts before us, and the Attorney General's Department is always ready to advise us on points of law, and I need scarcely add that we freely avail ourselves of its services. If honourable members will let me know of any cases in which hardship is experienced, I will undertake to have them investigated, and to furnish them with a reply.",51
302,Dr MALONEY,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,Does that mean that representations regarding such cases should At any be forwarded to the Treasurer direct?,51
303,Sir JOHN FORREST,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"Representa tions should not be forwarded to me direct unless honourable members themselves wish to adopt that course. The Commissioner is the head of the Department, but an appeal always lies from his decision to the Treasurer. ' Though I have no power to direct that officer, I can always send on any complaint to him with a request that he should investigate it, as is provided by law. It must be remembered, however, that in all these cases the final decision as to the amount of pension rests paid with the Commissioner himself. Honourable members will readily underthat upon a continent like Ausis tralia, which embraces many thousands of miles, inquiries by the Department necessarilv absorb some time. For instance, if in an inquiry has to be made in Western in Australia, a fortnight must elapse before we can receive a reply, whilst an inquiry are in Queensland will occupy many days.  got a complaint from Queensland investihim gated within three months.",51

306,Mr ROBERTS,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,Adelaide) [9.13] - W are very grateful to the Treasurer for few remarks respecting the administration of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act. But he cannot escape responsibility for his statement some Httle time ago that i the Fisher Government remained in power he feared that the Act might be adminFrederick istered too liberally.,52
307,Sir JOHN FORREST,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,When did I sav that ? ..,52
308,Mr ROBERTS,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"Unfortunatel y for vouchsafed. the honourable gentleman, it is upon record.",52
309,Sir JOHN FORREST,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,Was it a year ago?,52
310,Mr ROBERTS,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"When I recollect the right honourable member's opposition to the enactment of legislation which was inlamentable tended to provide funds for the payment of old-age pensions throughout Australia, and his subsequent declaration that if Fisher Ministry remained in office the valid and Old-age Pensions Act might be presentations. too liberally administered, I am forced to accept with some degree of reserve, his statement that he is now administering measure in such a liberal spirit as to call forth unqualified praise rather than mild criticism. But with that particular point I shall deal in a moment or two. I am sorry that the honourable member for Rocontradicting bertson .is absent from the chamber, behave cause whilst he. was complaining that oldtradictions age pensions were not being paid to the inmates of benevolent institutions, I asked how he voted when a proposal to grant them pensions was under consideration. His reply was that he had always voted with certain other honourable members in favour of extending consideration to the poor. If his of memory be at fault in this matter, he has is a merely to refer to page 1602 of Hansard for the current session, to see his name be recorded in a division in which he voted the in favour of doing that which he now deas ""cruel and absurd!"" 1 will He had an opportunity then of voting in favour of the poor people, for whom today he has so much sympathy. I should not like to say that the elections are six weeks nearer at hand than they were when the honourable member gave that vote. But knew that he has received a letter from constituent, and that consequently his opinion today is entirely different from what it was six weeks ago. It is distinctly unfair that, having voted in that exdirection, and assisted to bring about the the very conditions that now prevail, he should, only a few weeks after, so warmly complain of his own action, as revealed in e the official record to which I have just his directed attention. I feel myself called upon to make a brief reference to what is being stated by various newspapers, and I find, also, by ministers of religion from f the pulpit, with respect to the death of our late deservedly-respected Speaker, Sir Holder. It is distressing-posi tively painful-that, , from the Ministerial bench in particular, no refutation of the falsehoods being circulated has yet been Nowhere have Ministers sought to correct the wrong and cruel impressions that are being promulgated, even hy ministers of religion who, I would fain believe, have been misled by what they have read in certain journals. Surely it is that partisanship should be so strong as to use the death of a man to further political ends. It is time that, in this the public place, at any rate, some distinct Inobjection should be taken to these misre",52
311,Mr MAUGER,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,Hav e those statements that been made recently?,52
312,Mr ROBERTS,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"They have been made within the last few days; and I regret them very much. Some honourable members in this House have taken the .opportunity of them; but I am afraid they not been able to secure for iheir conthe.same wide circulation as the falsehoods have secured. The public are given to understand that certain scenes curred in this chamber, and that as the - result of them, the late Speaker was distressed. They have been informed that there was such violent obstruction that strength of Sir Frederick Holder was taxed, and that the long hours of sitting, the disorderly scenes, and the obstruction, in some way assisted to cause his regretallowing table death. Now, what are the official facts, so far as concerns the week when suffered his loss? The House met on Tuesday, 20th July, at 3 p.m., and adend to for all time. journed at II.T8 p.m. During that day, the late Speaker occupied the chair seven hours and three minutes-by no means an excessively long day.

On the next day, Wedthe nesday, the House met at 2.30 guarded p.m. At 4.18 the House went into Comters mitte, and remained so until n. 18 in evening. It adjourned at 11.31 p.m. During that sitting, the late Speaker in the chair only two. hours and one minute.

He was in chair, during the whole of that week, only thirteen hours and twenty-seven minutes, not an excessive amount for three full days'work, able which included only one all-night sitting; while the House during that week sat twenty-eight hours and fifty-six minutes. As a matter of strict truth, during the days, the late Speaker did not occupy the chair, on an average, four and a ""half hours per day. It was an exceptionally light week for him. The seizure took place at six minutes past 5 in the morning of the day when he had occupied the chair Only a little over four hours.

He had concerned the not been in the chair, except for twentycordance with three minutes, between 6.30 p.m. on the evening of Thursday, and six minutes past 5 o'clock on the following morning, when his seizure occurred. I feel myself Mr Roberts. ocjustified in objecting thus publicly to the statements that are being broadcasted, and - that are, unfortunately, being used from various pulpits-statement s behind which the Ministers in particular seem to be skulkovering, rather than doing their duty as the custodians of the honour of the House, in circulating the truth.

When this reply was received, either he or some of his friends duced a copy of Hansard wherein the Minister in another place clearly stated that unless the two pensions amounted to over £52 there should be no deduction; but the officials seemed to be quite superior to any statement made by a Minister.",53

It is a case wherein the administration of the law has been excessively harsh, and one which calls for Ministerial intervention if the officials will not repair the wrong. Another case is that of a man over eighty years of age. A very few years ago an incident occurred in his life which, I admit, was not creditable to him, and though it might be regarded that he was of such an age as to be scarcelyresponsible for his actions, he was adjudged responsible for them, and paid whatever penalty his country demanded of not him. Yet, at the age of eighty-three years, when he is practically destitute, he is informed that he is not a man of good character, and must, so far as an old-age pension is concerned, starve. He is receiving rations from the State authorities. His is peculiarly a case where, despite the little incident in his life, which, 1 admit, was not creditable, an old-age pension should be paid, and not one where the interpretation of "" good character "" should be of such Cera harsh nature as to deprive him of thefew shillings a week which, in my opinion, ought to be given to him.",54

If they happen to be separated, their incomes do not count in the collective sense, but if they live together, as they should, and the wife' has an income of a few pounds, then, irrespective of the condition and age of the husband, one-half beof that income is accounted to be his, and the pension is proportionately reduced. The provision seems to be unfortunately worded, and it is one which might well be amended at the earliest opportunity.

When questioned on ihe matter the Minister, much against his will, and after one evasive reply, had to admit that the Bill is not yet ready; that the Argus is misleading the public when it makes these statements, and that so far as the introduction of the Defence Bill is concerned it has not been prevented by any slow progress of business or any obstruction due to the Opposition. I shall refer to one other little matter in connection with defence, and then I shall have finished. I notice that the Minister spoke yesterday at a salon to a gathering of ladies. We are not informed as to how many were there, but apparently the Minister of Defence addressed them at their request.",56
343,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,There were about 150 present.,56
344,Mr ROBERTS,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"The Argus perhaps thought the number present was not sufficiently large to warrant it in publishing details, but it is pleasing to know that in order to hear ""An interesting and important speech"" by the Minister on "" One Discipline, One Control"" and ""The Pacific Fleet,"" and ""having reference to the general policy of the present Government and particularly to his defence proposals,"" about 150 ladies from the whole of Melbourne and its suburbs foregathered at the salon.",56
345,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"It was held in a private dwelling, and there were as many present as could be packed into the house.",56
346,Mr ROBERTS,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"I touch upon the subject chiefly because, although invited to say something, the Minister seems to have been particularly careful, since he is reported as sayingHe hoped they would not expect him to unfold the defence proposals of the Government; This was to be an important speech, particularly in relation to the defence proposals, but in it ihe honourable gentleman did not unfold 'he defence proposals of the Government- I presume because he is not even yet ready to do so.",56
347,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,I explained the reason-that my duty was to this House first.,56
348,Mr ROBERTS,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"The reason probably was that despite the statements repeatedly published in the press, that this business could not be brought down because of obstruction by the Opposition, the Minister is not ready yet to deal with the defence proposals of the Government. Any member of the Ministry or of the House has a perfect right to address the electors of the Commonwealth wherever they will gather, but I think I am justified in raising a protest against Ministers meeting in private places some few specially interested persons and making to them statements which ought to be made to the House, in order toinfluence the public mind in a direction in which it should not be influenced. Every statement made by Ministers can be published in the press to the extent they desire. We find meetings of this character growing in Australia, until now the Defence proposals, the blood and thunder, carnage and horrors of war, are taken by the gallant Minister of Defence into private houses and ladies' salons, instead of being touched upon in Parliament, - vhere they might be dealt with in the nniner their importance demands. One point is worthy of notice. The Minister has been reading a book by some Danish professor, from which he has discovered the way in which history is taught in Denmark. He saidThey had revised their school history by taking out matters of less moment and fillpersonages, ing the page with an account of those radiant davs and events of the past which had been all important to them as a people. The Minister has not the power, just now to take action in the matter himself, but possibly he will be able to persuade the New South Wales Minister of Education to revise the school books of that State and fill them with accounts of the radiant days and events of the past. I can imagine the 150 ladies who did the honourable gentleman the high honour to listen to him yesterday reading, with absolute horror, the account of the honourable gentleman's radiant days and events of the. past. When they found that they had been entertaining unawares a man who had graduated in public life through the Labour party, I venture to believe their horror would be too strong for words. When later on they read in the revised school history book that the honourable gentleman was at one time a Socialist, I think the salon would be upset. There would be a flutter in the dove-cot, and possibly the invitations to Ministers in future might be restricted. But when in relation to Commonwealth defence, coupled with the defence of the Empire, they read in the school history book recording the radiant days and wonderful events of the past that the honourable gentleman at one time was a roaring Republican, I can imagine the 150 ladies fainting in dismay. I hope that the Defence proposals will unfolded to the men of Australia first.",56
349,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,Are not the women entitled to hear about defence?,57
350,Mr ROBERTS,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,They are.,57
351,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"The honourable member may count them of no importance, speech. but I assure him I do-not estimate them in that way.",57
352,Mr ROBERTS,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,I am pleased to hear that the honourable gentleman counts the ladies of Australia as of some importance. fence.,57
353,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,They are at least voters.,57
354,Mr ROBERTS,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"Fro m that point of in any way. view they are of importance to the Minister. If they were not voters they would be of no importance whatever to the honortleman able gentleman. That women were of impordoubted, tance to honourable members of the Oppositary tion before they had votes is proved by the fact that those honourable members fought for years to give them the votes which now make them of importance to the Minister. I am pleased that we have been able, by books our own action, to make them important in his opinion. I hope the time will never come when we shall require from the women folk of Australia more than the moral support which is, perhaps, essential in matters of defence, and that the fighting will be confined to the men folk. I trust that the honourable member for Parramatta, now that he is in charge of a Department which, unfortunately, he has not yet given any indication of understanding, will confine his attention to the men, in the first place, before defence proposals are unfolded at semi-private gatherings to the women folk of Australia. If he does not do so, we may have the order of things completely reversed. It is not my intention to deal with questions of defence at great length, but I ask the Minister, as a special favour to himself, to consider the reply that he gave today to two questions that I submitted to him. I asked him, in the first place, what were the duties of the Chief of the General Staff, and, secondly, what were the duties of the Inspector-General. If the honourable member has anywhere in Australia an absolutely independent friend with a knowledge of things military, I hope that he will ask him what he thinks of his reply. If that gentleman will give the Minister his unbiased opinion, then never again will this House be insulted by a similar answer.",57
355,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"The honourable be member is revealing his ignorance of the whole question by talking such "" tripe.""",57
356,Mr ROBERTS,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,I cannot help the distinct vulgarity of the Minister.,57

360,Mr ROBERTS,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"We shall have in a few weeks, I believe, a visit from a genwhose military qualifications 'are unand who stands high in the miliservice of the Empire. If the reply to my question were put before him, and he had any knowledge whatever of the conditions pertaining to Australia, his first question would be, "" Who and what is the Minister of Defence that he could give such replies in the House?""",57
361,Mr TUDOR,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"Yarra; [9.59] - I desire to bring under the notice ot the Treasurer, who has invited honourable members to put before him specific cases relating to the administration ot the Old-Age Pensions Act, in order that he may be able to deal with them, one or two matters that I think worthy Of his attention. 1I have hitherto sent complaints direct to the Commissioner, and admit that I have obtained great satisfaction trom him. 1 believe that the Commissioner and his staff are doing their utmost to administer the Act fairly, but 1I have before me a case which I think the Treasurer should have brought under his attention. In a letter dated 6th instant, the Deputy Commissioner for Victoria, Mr A. B. Weire, replied to a claimant for an old-age pensionI have to acquaint you that your claim for a pension certificate has been rejected on the ground that you have not been naturalized for tnree years. That reply was furnished, although on 13th August last, assent was given to an Act providing that it is not necessary that claimants for old-age pensions shall have been naturalized for three years. I do not think that it would take an officer three weeks to learn of the passing of an Act providing for an increment to any public servant, and as it is quite possible that similar replies may have been sent to other applicants, 1 trust that the Treasurer will inquire into the matter, and have fresh notices sent out.",58
362,Sir JOHN FORREST,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,Certainly . very bad case.,58
363,Mr TUDOR,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"I have been treated with the utmost courtesy by the officers of the Department, and, as near as I can remember, every case that I have submitted to them has been dealt with as expeditiously as possible. I recognise that difficulties are likely to arise in the administration of. a new and extensive system, but this is certainly a very hard case. Foreigners to whom such replies have been sent may not prosecute their claims for a pension, and I therefore hope that amended answers will be sent out in such cases, so that the claimants may obtain their pensions as from the date of their original applications, and not have to wait twelve months or three years.. It is well known to many honourable members that under the Victorian Old-age Pensions Act, recipients of old-age pensions had to hand over to the Commissioner the deeds of their [122] properties. I understood that in such cases the deeds were now being returned, but the Deputy Commissioner in Victoria, recently wrote a letter stating thatThe Federal Old-age Pensions Act does not in any way affect the properties of pensioners whose deeds are held by the Victorian Government. At the same time, it is proposed to pass legislation dealing with the return of the deeds mentioned. As soon as such legislation becomes law, steps will be taken to return the deeds to the pensioners interested. I presume that the legislation referred to will have to be passed by the Victorian Parliament.",58
364,Sir JOHN FORREST,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,That is so. !,58
365,Mr TUDOR,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,Does the Treasurer know whether or not the Victorian Government contemplate passing such legislation ?,58
366,Sir JOHN FORREST,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,I have not had the matter brought under my notice before.,58
367,Mr TUDOR,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"I hope that the right honourable gentleman will make a note of this matter. Some pensioners may desire the return of their deeds in order that they may sell their properties, and remove to localities where they may be able to live more comfortably, or be in closer touch with their friends.",58
368,Sir JOHN FORREST,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,I will note the case.,58
369,Mr TUDOR,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"I wish now to ask the Postmaster-General _ whether it is correct, as reported in the press, that he intends to extend the time within which the gentlemen appointed to inquire into the cost of the telephone system are to submit a reIt is a port, and, if so, whether he has any assurance that the report will be forthcoming within the extended period?

373,Mr TUDOR,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"When the honourable member for Maribyrnong was Postmaster General I asked several questions relating to the number of parcels received at the Melbourne and Sydney offices, and the amounts paid to the contractors for carrywork ing them. I understand that fresh conordinary tracts are to be let, or have recently been let, and I desire to know whether the Minister will obtain a report whether it would not be possible for the Defore partment to do the greater portion of the work itself. I observe from the press that an officer of the Department has been giving evidence on this very question fore the Postal Commission ; and not only Melbourne and suburbs, but every other large city, is affected. The letter-carriers have to go round all the streets, and the mails have to be collected, and I think that way the major part of the parcels work could be done by our own officers with our own vehicles. It is certain that the contractors must make a fair profit, or they would enter into the contracts.",59

If the Treasurer's skin is still so thick that he cannot see his",59
382,The CHAIRMAN,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,Order !,59
383,Dr MALONEY,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"As the Treasurer purposely avoided answering, I appeal to not the Prime Minister. This is not a partyquestion, because the late Speaker's death was regretted on all sides of the House; and the untruthful and calumnious reports in the Review of Reviews ought not to remain uncontradicted - That publication The early morning of Friday, 23rd July, will live vividly in the mind of every Federal member. For some fourteen hours the House, had been wordily fighting in a fashion that would have been a disgrace to a of savages wrangling in some inter-tribal qiiariel. Sir William Lyne and some of the members of the Labour party were the chief offenders. I hold in my hand a letter from the angel woman who shared the life of the late beSpeaker. In that she thanked me for f what we did, and said that she knew the Comlate Speaker had almost failed' on the Friday before, for, after hurrying from the tram to the train, he collapsed in the train. Any medical man with a knowand ledge of the illness from which he died say that it was possible for him to conhave died in his bed, or at any moment. When such lies are uttered in the press or from the pulpit, it is not just to the honour of this House, and it is the duty of the I Ministry to see that such a slur is wiped away. If they, from the Treasurer down, support such a calumny as that, I cannot complime'nt them on their consciences.",59
384,Mr CHANTER,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,And the same estimable wrote a nice letter to the honourable member for Hume to the same effect.,59
385,Dr MALONEY,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"That dear lady knew well the frail life which the late Speaker had. I resent strongly such an imputation as I have quoted, and I tell those whose lying lips utter it, whether in the press or the pulpit, that they are demeaning themselves as men, that they are lowering themselves and their honour, and are a disgrace to their kind. If such a statement were true, were there not sufficient friends of the dead man in this House, to utter it when we were speaking in his praise? May I appeal to the Prime Minister to let the speeches which were made in this House just after the late Speaker's death be spread broadcast, so that they may give the answer to the calumny? I have finished with that subject. The Treasurer has to thank his inability to see the injustice of the administration of the present Old-age Pensions Act, and the iniquitous number of questions asked under the regulations, for nine-tenths of the debate tonight. If the previous Ministry, of which I was a supporter, were to blame for those infamous questions, how much more blame should be attached to the Ministry, or Minister, who has permitted them to continue? Does the Postmaster-General support the infamy of those questions? The Treasurer's troubles, forsooth, about old-age pensioners ! He would rather deck himself out in about £ 5 0 worth of gold lace and trot about- a show for the Gods. I hold here a copy of a letter which I sent to the Department in reference to an old man named William Hill. I asked them to let me know why he got only 4s. per week. I stated that he was eighty-two years of age,' and had a life annuity from his mother's estate of £ 1 4 or £ 1 5 a year. He received Ss. and ios. under the Victorian Old-age Pensions Act; yet he is offered a pittance of 4s. How would the Treasurer like his father, eighty years of age, to be treated in that scandalous and disgraceful fashion? He may laugh and jeer at it ; but let me tell him that the people outside do not admire him. He dare not defend these questions before any meeting in this city or other large centre of population. The idea of asking an old man or an old woman of sixty-five years of age, "" What was the maiden name of your mother?"" What has that to do with an old man or woman who wants 10s. a week - no t money which the Treasurer has given, but which the people are paying by means of taxation ? Let me read another letter to try if I can possibly persuade this old man, between sixty and seventy years of age, to have a little more commiseration for these other old people. This letter is from an old gentleman who has raised a large family; and I am reading it on behalf of the honourable member for Fawkner, who is unable to be present to-night. It is. as follows :I applied for an old-age pension at the latter end of June. An officer called in ""July, and after due inquiries remarked, "" Y o u will have no bother. You are all right."" Appeared before Mr Meehan, the magistrate, at Prahran, early this month; examination satisfactory; recommended to the Commissioner for ten shillings. You, sir, may imagine my surprise and indignation when last week at the Windsor P.O. I was paid 4s. per week. I called on Mr Osborne to find where the mistake layas a mistake I thought it must be. He told me to see Mr Weire at the Old-age Pensions Office, who had all the papers. Mr Weire got the papers and said, "" You have ios. superannuation from the Amalgamated Society of Engineers."" Section 24 of the Act allows the income to be made up to £ 5 2 a year, and that superannuation allowance only accounts for 2. You have assistance from a son. 3. You have ^14 in the Savings Bank. 4. You have ^20 worth of furniture. £20 worth of furniture!",60
386,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,Will that provide him with bread?,60
387,Dr MALONEY,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"The Treasurer had better answer that question. Under the Act, an applicant is allowed ^50 worth of property, and £ 1 is deducted from the' pension for every £ 1 0 in value over that; but this old man has only ^£34, plus the pension from the Amalgamated Society of Engineersist. Superannuation. Others of our members receiving it get the full old-age pension. Why should I be debarred after the Magistrate, who minutely inquired into the circumstances, recommended it? 2nd. Assistance from son consists in paying his mother for board and lodgings when in work. One son has done two months' work since Christmas. And yet the Treasurer can smile!",60
388,Sir JOHN FORREST,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,I am not smiling at the honourable member.,60

The Legislature, I presume, expected us to have a little more comfort than blackfellows.

That letter was sent to the Department, and the reply was as follows :Under your present circumstances, you are not entitled to an increase of pension. Wh:n your son is married you should re-apply. Good God Almighty ! Where is the section in the Act which speaks about his son. getting married? 1 told the ^20-a week man who has charge of the presem system of questions, that he would have more commiseration for these old people if he were filling up an application form for his own mother. From where do these infamous questions come? I am sorry that they came from New South Wuies. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The New South Wales authorities got them from Hell.",60
390,Dr MALONEY,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"O r from a worse place. What was the system which prechildren viously obtained in Victoria? A short time ago I asked the TreasurerIs it a fact that under the Victorian 'Pensions Act 1901-3 a Victorian citizen applying for an old-age pension would have no tions to fill in, but would merely have to his or her name in the presence of the requiied witnesses? To that question the Treasurer repliedUnder the Victorian Act the claimant made to sign a declaration which covered questions. Now let us look at the other side of the picture. I hold in my hand a list of thirty questions and of about fifteen sub-questions 20s. which an applicant for an old-age pension is required to answer. Sometimes when he finds two friends who have twenty-five years, those friends to swear to the declarations which they are called upon to make because of the penalty of six months' imprisonment to which they explain, would te liable in the event of their inadexpect vertently making a false statement. witnesses are required to answer than ninety questions. Yet the Treasurer proudly sits on the Ministerial bench and pensioner Can sometimes summon a smije,",61
391,Mr ATKINSON,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,He is not-responsible for the framing of these questions.,61
392,Dr MALONEY,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"I have already said that I . blame the Fisher Government foi permitting a highly paid officer, who is in receipt of £ 2 0 per week, to formulate these questions. But if it were an infamous act to permit these questions to be framed, it is more infamous for the Treasurer to countenance their continued application. There is no need for an Act of Parliament to effect the desired change. It can be brought about by an officer.. If the honourable member for Wilmot cannot join with me in my protest against these questions, I cannot say much for his conscience.",61
393,Mr ATKINSON,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,I am as much opposed to them as is the honourable member.,61
394,Dr MALONEY,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"Then why not endeavour to induce the Treasurer to rescind them ? Under the existing system an applicant for an old-age pension is required to fill in his mother's maiden name. Would he be deprived of his pension if he could not supply that name ?. In one case a father was called upon to fill in the names of-his fourteen children. Not content with that, he was askedWhat are the names, dates of birth, and places of birth, of all your, children? He was further required to sayWhat are the names and addresses of your now living? What has this information to do with the application of a man or woman of sixtyOld-age five years of age, who is hungry and queswaiting for the pension? In another insign stance, an old fellow applied for, and was granted, a pension, but, in his ignorance, he did not know that, being a married man, his pension was subject to a deducwas tion. On 8th September, the honourable 23 member for Newcastle, on my behalf, asked the TreasurerIn reference to old-age pensions(2) Re P. Boyham, who had been receiving for old-age pension per fortnight. Will the Minister explain how the Department expect the pensioner to live on the is. it paid him known him on 26th August, iqog? do not care This afternoon, 1 askedWith reference to questions asked 8lh September, re P. Boyham, will the Department why they paid is. for a fortnight instead of reducing it gradually; also, did they this old-age pensioner to exist for a fortThe night on such sum of is. ? np less To which the Treasurer repliedAn amount of 14s. 3d. was overpaid to the on account of a fraudulent statement made by him. No prosecution was instituted, but the Department took the first opporsion tunity of recovering the amount overpaid. I dare the Treasurer to prosecute hirn. Tf he does so, I will find a barrister to fight the case in any Court in which he may choose to initiate proceedings. 1 suppose that this £ 2 0 per week officer, Mr Allen, who has placed upon our fair escutcheon the wretched questions to which I have alluded, obtained them from New South Wales. The New South Wales Government, whilst more generous in' its payment of old-age pensions than was the Victorian Government, was less generous in the questions which it put to. applicants. If any honourable member desires to see a list of the questions put to applicants in New South Wales, I shall be glad to show him a copy of them. Under the Victorian Act, old-age pensioners experienced no trouble whatever. They had merely to sign the answers to questions which were read out to them by an officer. This man, Boyham, and his wife had to live on one shilling a day for a fortnight. What would the Treasurer say if he had to do that ? I wonder if he would fill out his waistcoat as well as he does today? Boyham was informed by the Department that he and his wife were only entitled to 15s. 3d. per fortnight from the ist July. They had been receiving 20s. per fortnight. Therefore, it is said that they have been overpaid; and to adjust the overpayment they received only is; on the 26th of August, and all future payments are to be at the rate of 15s. 3d. per fortnight. This ^20 a week gentleman, who furnished me with an answer to a question on silver currency that a schoolboy would have laughed at, wishes this old couple to live on 15s. 3d. a fortnight. Take next the case of Edward J. Leonard. He was informed by the Old age Pensions Office that his claim had been rejected on the ground that he was not considered eligible. The old man wanted to know why, but an answer was not given to him. Is he so degraded-this man fashioned in God's likeness-that a Government official cannot supply him with an answer to his question? I secured an answer on the floor of this House, but I insist that a citizen of this Commonwealth who applies for an old-age pension has a right to be told the reason why if his claim is rejected. I maintain that if a man has reached the age of sixty-five years, has lived in Australia twenty years, and is either native or British born, or a naturalized subject, he is entitled to draw the old-age penwithout any further question being put to him. In a moment of national danger would the Treasurer ask a man who volunteered as a soldier what the maiden name of his mother or that of his maternal grandmother was? Not a bit of it. The Government would gladly use his services m ihe defence of the country. Yet there are some, who are the Stigginses of our political life, who would put to applicants for old-age pensions questions such as would disgrace those regulating admission to a poor-house in England. I know what an English poor-house is. I spent two nights and a day in one on one occasion. I would sooner go to prison than to such an establishment again. I do not want to see our old-age pensions system degraded to that level. If the Treasurer hns any sympathy for the aged people of this country, let him alter the present regulations and get back to the Victorian system, which was simpler and more effective. There are 142 questions which can be put to applicants for a pension. Some of them are questions which I am sure the Treasurer's colleagues would be ashamed of.",61
395,Mr KELLY,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,Who framed these questions ?,62
396,Dr MALONEY,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"I have said before that they were framed when the previous Government were in office. But, as my honourable friend will know, Ministers are very much . in the hands of the heads of Departments. The late Ministers were so pressed for time that they could not have gone through these questions. Had they done so I am sure that they would have rejected some of them. They are, I repeat, infamous questions, and I will maintain that statement on any platform in this country. Still more infamous is the conduct of a Government that will continue to enforce them after their nature is pointed out. I did first attack the late Government that allowed the questions to be framed. But I attack the present Treasurer now, because he has had control for three months, and has not raised a little finger to mend matters. I venture to say that the Treasurer, although he is a man of courage, dare not defend these questions before any public meeting in any part of Australia. I do not believe he is so strong, even in the electorate of Swan, that he would venture to defend them before an audience there. I do not wish to make this a party question, but I give the Treasurer a fair and square warning that unless the questions are modified I will use the forms of the House to attack them on every available occasion. The Treasurer himself is near the age at which he would be entitled to an old-age pension if he needed one; and he certainly would never draw from any source a larger pension than I would wish him to get. I make no attack on him personally, but I urge him to withdraw questions that are only fit to be asked by a cross-examining barrister. He certainly will do so if he has any feeling for his fellow old colonists.",62
397,Mr HUTCHISON,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"Hindmarsh) [10.45] - At this late hour I do not propose to discuss a number of questions, but chiefly to call the attention of the Treasurer to the administration of the Old-age Pensions Act in South Australia. When we go to the Commissioner Ave are most courteously treated, and when we have a good case it is looked into. But there is something which he has not the power to do. Although the Act came into force on rst July, a poor man of 102 years of age has not yet received a. pension. Again a Crimean veteran of eighty-nine years of age, who, together with his poor old wife, receiving rations from the Destitute Asylum, is not receiving a pension. No doubt it will be paid in due course, but I ask the Treasurer to think of the time which has elapsed since the Act came into force.",63
398,Sir JOHN FORREST,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,Has the honourable member brought the cases under the notice of the Commissioner ?,63
399,Mr HUTCHISON,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"No , I have brought them, under the notice of the Deputy Commissioner, and of course he tells me that the old man will continue to draw his rations. Since the case was brought under my notice he has had an epileptic fit and another one may be fatal to him. In South Australia we have two gentlemen inquiring into the circumstances of the applicants. I do not know the nature of their remuneration. I do not think it is a fixed amount, but if they are paid at the rate of so much a. year it will be just as easy to get twenty as to get two to do the work.",63
400,Sir JOHN FORREST,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,Will the honourable member give me on another occasion particulars of the cases-the names and on?,63
401,Mr HUTCHISON,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"I am stating the particulars. There are scores of cases have not yet been dealt with. Seeing that the Act came into force in July, I submit that it is necessary to practice more tion, especially in the case of a years of age.",63
402,Mr THOMAS BROWN,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"And the pensions are granted from the time of approval, not from the time of application.",63
403,Mr HUTCHISON,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,That makes the position a thousand times worse.,63
404,Sir JOHN FORREST,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,If they applied as from the ist July they would get the pension from that date.,63
405,Mr HUTCHISON,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"In Adelaide 1 was interviewed by an old man who is seventy-six years of age, and is living with a relative- a widow-wh o earns her living by cleaning Government oflices. Last yeai he was given casual work to do, but tbi& year he has not earned half-a crown a7 week. He has been granted an old age pension of 6s. 6d. a week. Why ? Because he is living with a poor old woman who rather than see .him go into the Destitute Asylum, provides a shelter, though she cannot afford to do so. That is valued at 4s. 6d. per week, and the amount is deducted from his pension. The particulars of that case will be is sent to the Deputy Commissioner, but it is only typical of a number.",63
406,Sir JOHN FORREST,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,There are sure to be a number of cases. There must be difficulties.,63
407,Mr HUTCHISON,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"There should be no difficulty about this case. The poor old widow is trying to assist an old relative who could not do a week's work if it were offered to him, and who has not earned half-a-crown a week during the year. He has only 5s. or 6s. in the Savings Bank, and owns no property, but because he has a relative's roof over his head 4s. 6d. is deducted from his old-age pension. Surely we are not. going to allow the Act to be administered in that way",63
408,Sir JOHN FORREST,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,Why do these people hot make some representation ? They can appeal to the Commissioner.,63
409,Mr HUTCHISON,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,Why should it be necessary to make an appeal?,63

440,Sir JOHN FORREST,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"Yes , that is right.",64
441,Mr HUTCHISON,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,That is all that I want the honourable member to do. It is simply shameful that a man eighty-nine years old and another 102 years old should not have received old-age pensions.,64
442,Sir JOHN FORREST,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,If the honourable member will give me the names and as addresses I shall inquire into the cases,64

We ought to have a more he generous administration of the Act. I shall take good care to see that all cases of hardship are brought before the Commissioner. I know that I shall be courteously received, and that when a good case is made out it will be attended to. There is a matter to which I want to draw the attention of the Minister of Defence. In the Imperial Navy all seamen up to and including petty officers have a badge for long service and good conduct. Its possession carries extra pay and an increase of pension. No pension is allowed to our naval forces, but extra pay is given. I ask the Minister to note that extra pay and badges are not allowed to petty officers, nor yet - to stewards, nor I believe to others. The privilege applies only to seamen, leading seamen and stokers. Would it not be fair to put the others on the same footing as those in the Imperial Navy, more especially as they are not entitled to pensions? There is no reason why it should not be done; indeed, the present arrangement must be the result of an oversight. The new arrangement would apply only, to deserving men.",64
444,Mr FISHER,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"Wide Bay) [ in ] - l t is evident that, notwithstanding the exertions of the Ministers of this Fusion Government, there are still a few grievances. I wish to know from the Treasurer if he has yet received a reply from the Colonial Office regarding the coinage ?",65
445,Sir JOHN FORREST,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"No ; though I have despatched a reminder on the subject. I shall communicate to the House any information that I may receive. Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin) [11.3] - I hope that the Postmaster General will provide for the establishment of wireless telegraphic communication with King and Flinders Islands, where there is a population of nearly 1,000 persons, most of whom, were originally Victorians. At present, they have to depend, on a small steamer called the Yambacoona. On one occasion, I left Devonport in her on Tuesday night, and did not reach Currie Harbor until the following Saturday at 1 o'clock, so that, obviously, the inhabitants of King Island are at a great disadvantage. I should like the honourable gentleman to pay attention also to the wants of Forrest, an important place in Tasmania. A great many little things might be done for the convenience of the Tasmanian people. I am grateful to the Postmaster-General, who, I know, is doing his prepare best to afford facilities to people in isolated districts. I trust the honourable gentleman will do what he can to that the steamer Oonah, when returning from Burnie, will call in at Stanley.",65

447,Mr KELLY,AND TELEPHONE FACILITIE SIN RURAL,"Wentworth) [11.7] - The question put by the Leader of the Opposition prompts me to offer a suggestion to the Treasurer in connection with the coinage. It is that a certain letter written to the Minister of Defence might be laid on the table of the House. The letter was fiom a schoolboy, and drew attention to the fact that the characteristics of the emu and kangaroo are hardly the courageous, determined characteristics of the Australian people, nor is the cranial cavity of Australian birds of sufficient capacity to compass the intelligence of the average of the Australian people. Inasmuch as the characteristics of these birds are net symbolical of the great people we represent,, it would perhaps be better to secure some design for our coinage that would indicate more brains, and less of their other characteristics. I ask the Minister of Defence to lay ihe letter he has received on the table. I am sure it would be instructive to honourable members. Mr T. H . CATTS (Cook) [n.9] - I have been waiting all day for an opportunity to refer to grievances in connection with the Post and Teleeraph Department, but as there appears to be a general desire that we should not sit late, ancl that the Supplv Bill should be passed to-night I shall not now occunv the time of honourable members in ventilating those grievances. I shall send a note of them to the Postmaster-General, and will ask him to give me a reply at his earliest convenience. Question resolved in the affirmative. Resolution reported. Standing Orders suspended, and report adopted. Resolutions of Ways and Means covering Resolution of Supply adopted.
