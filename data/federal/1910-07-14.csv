Report (No. 1), presented by Sir JOHN QUICK, read by the Clerk, and adopted. SUGAR COMMISSION.",14
1,Mr GROOM,TEMPORARY CHAIRMEN OF,"Is the Prime Minister Minister yet in a position to state what is the intenwere tion of the Government respecting the apby pointment of a Royal Commission to make investigations regarding the sugar industry r""",14
2,Mr FISHER,TEMPORARY CHAIRMEN OF,"The Government has taken action to close the inquiry of theCommission appointed by its predecessors, but the question of appointing a new Commission' to go into the whole subject will be .considered later.",14
3,Mr GB EDWARDS,TEMPORARY CHAIRMEN OF,"In considering, the matter, will the Govermnent haveregard_ to the expediency of placing on theCommission a representative versed in the interests of the manufacturers who usesugar in their business and a representative of the general public, in addition to representatives of those interested in the business of growing, making, and sellingsugar ?",14
4,Mr FISHER,TEMPORARY CHAIRMEN OF,"If a Commission is appointed, its investigation will have a wider range than an inquiry into the technical production of sugar. PUBLIC ACCOUNTS.",14
5,Sir JOHN FORREST,TEMPORARY CHAIRMEN OF,When will the public accounts for the quarter ending 30th June be laid on the table?,14
6,Mr FISHER,TEMPORARY CHAIRMEN OF,"As soon as they have been balanced-whic h the Treasury officialshope will be within a day or two-the y will be available to the public, and to members of Parliament. FEDERAL CAPITAL. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - With ? reference to the reply to my question yesterday concerning the expediency of the building of the Federal Capital, did the Prime Minister intend it to apply to the Yass Canberra area, approved and accepted byParliament, or is it to be accepted in the equivocal sense suggested by a paragraph in this morning's Age, which points out that he "" did not fix the location of the Federal Capital, which, in. the long run, might beeconomically and expeditiously erected at Dalgety "" ?",14
7,Mr FISHER,TEMPORARY CHAIRMEN OF,"I hope that honourable members will not bring newspaper paragraphs of that kind before the Chamber. My reply was definite enough, and had reference to the Capital and Territoryselected. COMMONWEALTH NOTE ISSUE.",14
8,Mr BRUCE SMITH,TEMPORARY CHAIRMEN OF,"Is the Primeaware that certain banks of issuegiven rights respecting their note issue State Acts in the nature of charters which.. have yet many years to run ? Does he propose, in establishing a Commonwealth note issue, to terminate those rights without offering any equivalent? If so, is he able to reconcile an act in the nature of repudiation with the provision of the Constitution as to the full faith and credit to be accorded to the Acts of the States?",14
9,Mr FISHER,TEMPORARY CHAIRMEN OF,"Nothin g in the Government proposals will be in any way a repudiation of the State Acts, and no compensation will be necessary by reason of the exercise by this Parliament of its constitutional powers. When the people gave us the right to deal with currency, they intended us to take advantage of it so soon as it might be convenient to do so.",15
10,Mr MAHON,TEMPORARY CHAIRMEN OF,"Referring to the question put by the honourable member for Parkes, is it not a fact that the banks of Australia consider that they are not making a profit out of their note issue, because in most of the States they have to pay a tax of 2 per cent, on their notes ? If they make no profit out of their note issue they cannot be disadvantaged if we legislate to take from them the right to continue it.",15
11,Mr FISHER,TEMPORARY CHAIRMEN OF,"My own impression is that many statements have been made that the banks do not make sf profit out of the notes. That, however, is their business, and does not affect my position at all. The tax is paid to the State Government where ever it prevails. It is 3 per cent, in Queensland, but I think the general rate is 2 per cent. The banks do not claim that they will suffer any considerable loss if the Commonwealth takes charge of the currency.",15
12,Mr BRUCE SMITH,TEMPORARY CHAIRMEN OF,There seems to be some difference of opinion as to whether the Prime Minister or the bank managers who took part in the conference are most anxious to keep secret what took place there. Will the Prime Minister remove any embargo from publicity on the part of rhe bank managers who advised bim on this question ?,15
13,Mr FISHER,TEMPORARY CHAIRMEN OF,"I cannot' accept the question in the language used by the honourable member, to the effect that the bank managers came there to advise me. The bank managers asked to have an interview. I agreed to that, and preferred to have the meeting public. They preferred to see me privately. I willingly agreed to that, because they might have good reasons for it. I have no objection whatever to their giving their own version of what took place. No particular record was kept of the proceedings ; in fact, I think the only record was a note taken here and there by the secretary to the Prime Minister. There is nothing to conceal, and the representatives of the banks can speak freely if they please. I am quite satisfied with the interview. NA ESTIMATES.",15
14,Mr BAMFORD,WORKS AND BUILDINGS,Can the Treasurer give the House any idea as to when the new Works and Buildings Estimates will be tabled?,15
15,Mr FISHER,WORKS AND BUILDINGS,"As soon as the accounts, are balanced and the Estimates for the current year are approved the Works and Buildings Estimates will be submitted to the House, and the earliest opportunity will be sought to secure their passage through Parliament.  try to arrange for the unexpended balances m connection with Works and Buildings, particularly as regards the Post and Telegraph Department, to be treated in the same way as are the unexpended balances, in connection with defence works?",15
16,Mr FISHER,WORKS AND BUILDINGS,"The same difficulties will not arise in future financial years as. have prevailed during the last nine years. A new set of circumstances will obtain, and the financial difficulties regarding the return of the balances will not be die same as heretofore. Some new method of dealing with them may be inaugurated by legislation this session. KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTARAILWAY.",15
17,Sir JOHN FORREST,WORKS AND BUILDINGS,"Will the Minister of Home Affairs lay 011 the table the plans and specifications of the proposed Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway, prepared by the Governments of South Australia and Western Australia, and submitted by Mr Deane, the engineer who acted for the Government in the matter?I know that the papers are all in the Department, but I do not think they have been laid on the table of the House. If they have been, I have not seen them. Mr KING O'MALLEY - If the papers-are in the Home Affairs Department theywill be laid on the table tomorrow. ELECTORAL ADMINISTRATION. SCRUTINY or LIST OF VOTERS-APPLICA TIONS FOR POLLING PLACES.",15
18,Sir JOHN FORREST,WORKS AND BUILDINGS,"the Minister of Home Affairs, upon noticeWith reference to his reply of Friday last, Sth inst., respecting the non-scrutiny of voting papers so as to discover if .any persons vote more than once1. As section 163 of the Electoral Act only provides for the sealing up of ballot-papers, cloes he think that the regulations, even if legal, should go further and provide for the sealing up of the lists of voters also? 2. Whether he thinks the sealing up of these lists without scrutiny or examination does not encourage unscrupulous persons to vote more than once? 3. Is he aware that a scrutiny and examination of all lists of voters voting at any election, with a view of discovering if any person votes more than once, has been for many years in force under the law in Western Australia, and that no trouble or delay has been experienced in carrying it out? 4. Will he have this matter investigated and considered when the amendment of the Electoral Act is being dealt with? Mr KING O'MALLEY - The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :1. Yes. 2. No. 3. I am aware that such an examination has been made, and that the result does not indicate that electors have voted or attempted to vote more than once at the same election. 4. Investigation is made for administrative poses after each election, and if , as the result of the investigation now proceeding, any further strengthening of the Electoral law is found to be desirable, the matter will receive consideration.",16
19,Mr CHARLTON,WORKS AND BUILDINGS,"the Minister of Home Affairs, upon notice I. Whether it is a fact that, at the recent Federal election for the Hunter, repeated applications were made for polling booths at camps along the North Coast railway and were refused ? 2. If so, will he make inquiry for such refusal? ""3. Will he issue instructions that in future the electoral officer shall ariDoint sufficient polling places to enable workmen engaged in railway construction to record their votes? Mr KING O'MALLEY - The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :1 and a. All applications for the appointment of polling places, received in time to permit of action being taken, were fully investigated and dealt with on their merits. Thirty-three (33) additional polling places were appointed in the division of Hunter for the purposes of the recent elections. 3. Every effort will be made to provide sufficient polling places to enable workmen engaged in railway construction, in common with other electors, to record their votes. POSTMASTER-GENERAL'S DEPARTMENT. EXPEDITION OF WORKS-UNDERGROUNDIN G NA EAGLEHAWK.",16
20,Sir JOHN QUICK,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,"the Postmaster-General, upon notice I. Whether he will take steps to expedite the prosecution of authorized postal and telegraphic construction works during the winter months, in order to render available as much work as possible for the unemployed in the several States? 2. When will the work of undergrounding the telephone lines between Bendigo and Eaglehawk, already recommended and authorized, be commenced ? _ #",16
21,Mr THOMAS,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :1. Steps have already been taken in the direction indicated. 2. It is expected that this work will be commenced in about two weeks. FINANCIAL RELATIONS: COMMONWEALTH AND STATES. TRUST FUNDS.,16
22,Sir JOHN FORREST,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,"the Treasurer, upon notice I. What was the amount of the three-fourths of thenet Customs and Excise revenue for 1909-10, to be paid to the States under section pur- 87 of the Constitution? 2. What amount was paid to the States from Customs and Excise revenue from ist July, 1909, to 30th June, 1910 (1909-10)? 3. Did the ""Commonwealth apply more than one-fourth of the net Customs and Excise revenue towards its expenditure during 1909-10, that is, from ist July, 1909, to 30th June, 1910, and, if so, how much more? 4. Has there ever, previously to 30th June last, since the establishment of the Commonwealth, been any deficit at the end of any financial year? 5. What was the amount of the deficit on 30th as to the reason June, 1910? 6. Is the taking of money from the Trust Fund, without any legal authority, a similar transaction as the ordinary small adjustments that have hitherto annually ""been made by the Treasury officials"" when there has been no deficit whatever? 7. What was the amount taken from the Trust Fund before the ist instant?",16
23,Mr FISHER,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,"Wit h the qualification that only approximate figures can yet be given, as the balances are not complete, the answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :1. /8,4qi,52i (approximate). 2. £8,084,627 (approximate). 3. No. 4. No. 5- £444.541 (approximate). 6. In paying over the balances to the States at the end of each month it has occasionallyhappened that Trust Fund was accidentally overdrawn. The overdraft referred to was of a similar nature, though for a larger amount. 7- £37»647 (approximate). INSPECTION'OF PRODUCE.",16
24,Mr ATKINSON,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,"Wilmot) [2.49] - I move That in the opinion of this House the Commonwealth should forthwith take over the inspection and effective control of produce passing from State to S'tate. I make no apology for submitting this motion, because it deals with matters of great importance not only to a large number of producers, but also to a great many workers in the different States, and'to a large body of consumers. It is important also because this Inter-State trade is of very considerable value and is likely to increase. According to the Commonwealth Year-Booh, the apples, bananas, citrus fruits, pineapples, and other fresh fruits which passed between the States durirg 1908, were of the value of ,£550,000. The Inter-State trade, in onions during the same period amounted to something like £114,000, and that in potatoes to £530,000. The article of produce most prominently before us in this regard at present is potatoes. During last session this matter was frequently discussed. Representatives of Tasmania, and of other States, addressed various questions cn this subject to Ministers, and speeches were frequently made by the honourable member for Darwin, myself and others, with the object of inducing the Commonwealth to intervene, and to prevent New South Wales and other States from excluding sound produce, fit for consumption, which had been shipped from Tasmania. We were told that it was a matter for the States themselves, and that there was no room for Federal intervention. Finally a difficulty arose between Victoria and New South Wales, and I pointed out to the 'Attorney-General of the day, that, on the facts disclosed, it would appear that New South Wales was acting unconstitutionally; that she was not only shutting out produce from other States on the ground that it was diseased, and that, therefore, its importation would be a violation of the Vegetation Diseases Act, but that her chief object seemed to be to preserve the local market to local growers, and that produce far inferior to that sought to be introduced from other States was being grown in New South .Wales and consumed in Sydney. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - I do not believe that.",17
25,Mr ATKINSON,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,"That at all events was the point taken, and the then Attorney General said that if the facts were as stated, New South Wales was acting in an unconstitutional manner. He went on to point out, however, that, even if that were so, the Federation could not intervene; that the remedy was for the individual whose produce was rejected at the port of Sydney to institute an action for damages in the High Court against New South Wales. That was a check to further protests by the honourable member for Darwin and myself. VVe could do no more in the circumstances, but towards the close of the session, I brought up a proposal that the work of inspection snould be taken out of the hands of the State authorities and handed over to the Federal authority. It seems to me that the restriction in regard to the Inter-State trade in produce of various kinds warrants Federal intervention. There is at present no certainty to the grower that even sound, wholesome produce grown in Tasmania will be admitted into Victoria, New South Wales or other parts of the Commonwealth. That state of affairs ought not to continue. Surely a man in any of the States should be able to place on the markets of Australia sound produce raised by him. Unless that can be done no encouragement will be given the small farmer. There is, moreover, no guarantee at the present time that produce, however good, produced in one State will be received in another. New Soudi Wales and Queensland are now admitting producefrom Tasmania on terms that suit themselves. They can shut down on importations of potatoes and other produce from Tasmania whenever they please. Such a condition of uncertainty ought to be removed. At present, if a farmer in Tasmania wishes to introduce potatoes into Victoria, he has to prove not only that they are sound, but that they were grown at least half-a-mile from any infected area. In the case of Western Australia, he has to show that they were produced at least 50 miles from any infected area. It is estimated by those engaged in the trade that farmers on the north-west coast of Tasmania lost last year'£20,000 In respect of the Western Australian market alone. That market used to take something like 2,500 sacks of potatoes per week, and, very often, when the eastern market was over-supplied it relieved the tension, and enabled prices to be kept at something like a fair rate.",17
26,Mr TUDOR,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,Does the honourable memtificate ber allege that Western Australia has fairly shut out Tasmanian produce?,18
27,Mr ATKINSON,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,It seems to me that such a regulation as that to which just referred is unfair.,18
28,Sir JOHN FORREST,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,We wish to keep Western Australia free from insect pests.,18
29,Mr ATKINSON,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,"The contention is that sound produce, and especially potaauthorities. toes, grown within the Commonwealth control should be admitted into any State. of the .chief troubles in connection with potato growing industry is the disease known as Irish blight. That disease, however, exists, 1 believe, in every State, and therefore with a proper Federal tem of inspection not much damage to be done to any State by the adoption of - my proposal. If produce sent from one State to another is properly inspected there will not be very much danger of - ease spreading. In August last the State Ministers of Agriculture and certain cultural experts met in conference in Melshould bourne and framed regulations creating of shipment? what are known as neutral zones. In other words, it was decided that potatoes should :not be sent from one State to another less they were produced in districts a tain distance from any infected area. That was the arrangement made between - the Ministers of Agriculture of the various States, but it was broken within a week two, and became inoperative; and at sent the whole business is in a ""sixes and sevens."" Each State has different regulations, and, altogether, : is a very unsatisfactory certainty and bad feeling between the States which should not, of course, be in any - encouraged. If the Tasmanian inspector passes certain produce as fit for consumppower tion that produce may be condemned at the Constitution. port of entry.' Only last year potatoes from the northern part of Tasmania were demned at Sydney, but, after they had re-shipped to the island State, and put into different bags, they were accepted at ney as of excellent quality. All this, say, only tends to breed the wrong sort feeling between the producers of the various States.",18
30,Mr WEBSTER,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,Does the honourable member propose to abolish inspection?,18
31,Mr ATKINSON,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,"No ; the remedy I suggest is that the work of inspection .should be done, not by State officers, by Federal officers, and that, on the of the latter, the produce, whatunever it may be, should be admitted.",18
32,Mr TUDOR,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,Would tiiat not have the effect of largely taking over the AgriculI have tural Departments of the States?,18
33,Mr ATKINSON,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,"The proposal I make would only affect produce passing between State and State; I am perfectly satisfied to leave all the power as to regulations within the boundary of a State to the State There must, however, be some coupled with the inspection I sugOne gest, in order to prevent produce passed by the the Federal officer being quarantined by a State officer. If the Federal Inspector is satisfied, there should be sufficient control coupled with the inspection to insure that systhe produce shall be admitted into the is likely market of the State.",18
34,Mr WEBSTER,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,Does the honourable member desire to amend the Constitution?,18
35,Mr ATKINSON,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,No amendment of the disthe Constitution is necessary.,18
36,Mr FINLAYSON,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,Where does the honagriorable member suggest the inspection be-at the port of entry or the port,18
37,Mr ATKINSON,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,"At present there, is inspection at both ports, and I have no deunsire to lay down any hard and fast rule, cerpreferring to leave the matter to the Federal authorities. At present the Government inspection is objected to as involving unnecessary expense, and I think that if the or produce were inspected at the port of preentry, the grower taking his chance, that state of might possibly be sufficient.  there not a State Righter? Why does he procondition of unpose this motion?",18
38,Mr ATKINSON,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,"This is not a quesway tion of State rights; all I am asking is that the Commonwealth should exercise a which it already possesses under the  conwishes to make the States take "" spuds "" been even if they do not desire to have them.",18
39,Mr ATKINSON,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,"No one is asking Sydthe States to accept anything but sound as I "" spuds."" At the present time there is no of certainty that sound produce will be admitted to any of the. markets of the Commonwealth. I contend that the Federal Inspector would be just as careful to see that no State was imposed on as is any State officer today, and the people would be satisfied that there, was an impartial tribunal to judge as to the soundness of but their produce. At present the same procerduce may be passed by the inspector of one State and rejected by the inspector of another; and if the State to which it is sent is known to have a good local supply, those forwarding the stuff feel that it is rejected, not because it is unsound, but because there is a desire to exclude it from the markets of the State to which it has been consigned. There is nothing Federal in such a feeling as rhat, and some remedy ought to be applied; and for that reason I am asking the statesmen on the front benches to do the right thing. Section 92 of the Constitution provides for Inter-State Free Trade, but, as things are, I submit that we have not that Free. Trade which we all expected when we entered the Union. Then section 109 of the Constitution says that where a State law conflicts with the Federal law, the Federal law shall prevail ; and, taking these two sections together, I am of opinion that under the Constitution the Commonwealth has power to undertake the work of inspection, and to exercise sufficient control to see that produce that is passed is sound before it is permitted to go on the market for sale. Section 13 of the Quarantine Act of 1908, provides for proclamations on various matters by the Governor General; but that Act does not, I think, cover the groundit does not go far enough. However, the late Attorney-General, the honourable member for Angas, gave an opinion which I am sure will receive the greatest respect from all members of the House; and to that opinion I invite attention. It was given on a question arising out of some proclamation or regulations concerning a vine trouble in South Australia; and, though the main part of the opinion does not concern the question I am dealing with, it shows at the end, if I understand aright, that according to the learned gentleman, the Quarantine Act does not at present give us the power I desire in regard to inspection, but that, under the Constitution, we may take the power by simply amending the Act. That is the. procedure I suggest the Government should adopt. There are very large powers under the Quarantine Act, but they do not represent anything like all the powers we possess.  much power under the Quarantine Act.",18
40,Mr ATKINSON,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,"It hns not as much power regarding the matter of which I am speaking as it should have, ancl, as I hope, soon will have. I clo not wish action to be taken without a consultation with the State authorities. Possibly after such consultation some amicable arrangement may be arrived at; but the matter is of such importance to producers and consumers alike, that, if the States will not meet us, this Parliament should take action in the interests of Australia. If this is done, we shall insure the security and stability of producers who grow good, sound, marketable stuff, in every way fit for human consumption. There would be no risk of the greater dissemination of disease, because Federal inspection will be as rigid and efficient as that of the States, and possibly many of those who are now acting as inspectors for the .States will be engaged to do the same work for the Commonwealth. What I propose will secure a more constant supply of good food for the poor. Last year several members complained that their constituents were suffering because of the high price of potatoes and other nutritious foods of that kind. Owing to the severity of the regulations in force in Western Austhe tralia and in New South Wales, potatoes were then at a very high figure in both Perth and Svdney. The poor of New South Wales had to buy from local growers potatoes inferior to the stocks imported from Tasmania which were being rejected by the inspectors. It is the poor who are least able to help themselves, and we therefore should give consideration to means for supplying them with cheap and good food. We should also regard the interests of those who work on the wharfs, and of the growers of produce and those whom they employ. The action I suggest would tend to remove the bad feeling engendered when the authorities of one State refuse to admit the produce of another. The State whose marketable commodities are rejected feels that it is being unfederally treated, and it should be our object to do all that is possible to ""strengthen the Federal feeling. What I propose will promote the harmonious relations of the States.",19
41,Mr R EDWARDS,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,I second the motion.,19
42,Mr CHARLTON,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,"Hunter) [3.15]- 1 regard this as a very important motion, though the remarks of the mover make it appear that he thinks more of protecting the interests of the Tasmanian growers of too potatoes than of effecting the good of the community. He complains that Tasmanian potatoes imported into New South Wales have been condemned by the inspectors of the latter State, but he also said that if the inspection. of produce passing from State to State were undertaken by the Commonwealth, some of the present inspectors would, in all probability, be appointed to do the Commonwealth work. Now, if the present State inspectors are not efficient, surely they ought not to be. appointed to do Commonwealth work. I believe that the inspection of imported toes has been very rigid in New South Wales, and that the potatoes refused admittance were rejected because found to be suffering from Irish blight. That justified their rejection. The honourable member for Wilmot contends that Irish blight is to be found in all the States.",19
43,Mr ATKINSON,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,I said in most of them.,20
44,Mr CHARLTON,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,"If . it is to be found in them all, that furnishes a stronger reason why action should be taken by the local authorities to reject diseased importations.",20
45,Mr ATKINSON,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,What I propose would not prevent that.,20
46,Mr CHARLTON,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,Unde r the present system one State can prevent another from dumping inferior produce into its markets.,20
47,Mr MCWILLIAMS,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,Does the honourable member think it right that New South Wales should charge five or six times as much for the inspection as it actually costs?,20
48,Mr CHARLTON,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,"The question of charges was not mentioned by the honourable member for Wilmot, to whose speech I am replying.",20
49,Mr ATKINSON,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,I overlooked it.,20
50,Mr CHARLTON,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,The honourable member contended that the inspection of produce passing from State to State should be undertaken by the Commonwealth. I am surprised that a member of the party which is always charging the Labour party with being unificationists should ask us to take a'step towards unification.,20
51,Mr ATKINSON,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,I merely ask that the powers given to this Parliament by the Constitution shall be exercised.,20
52,Mr CHARLTON,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,"The honourable member is asking for the exercise of powers of which we have not yet availed ourselves. He wishes us to take from the States the right to exclude produce which their authorities declare to be unsound. That surely is an interference with the powers of the States, and a step towards unification. In my opinion, we have already enough to do. Let us put our house in order before we take over powers which we have not yet .exercised. At the time to which the honourable member referred, Irish blight was less prevalent in New South Wales than in any of the other States, but it was discovered that it had made its appearance in the Richmond district because the seed potatoes used there had been imported. That in itself was justification for the rigid inspection of all importations. The honourable member said that the New South potaWales inspections were made for the purpose of protecting the local market.",20
53,Mr ATKINSON,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,I said that that was the impression in the mind of the public.,20
54,Mr CHARLTON,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,"Then it is a wrong impression. Does the honourable member think that a Government would prohibit the importation of such things as potatoes to make the price dearer to consumers? The action taken in New South Wales was taken with the desire of preventing the importation of diseased potatoes. If diseased potatoes were imported wholesale, and used for seed, Irish blight would spread throughout the States.",20
55,Mr ATKINSON,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,The inspection which I propose would be as rigid as that which now exists.,20
56,Mr CHARLTON,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,The honourable member has said that the Commonwealth would engage the services of the present inspectors.,20
57,Mr ATKINSON,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,I said that it might do so.,20
58,Mr CHARLTON,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,"The honourable member told us that one consignment rejected in New South Wales was returned to Tasmania, rebagged there, and then sent back again to Sydney, where it was accepted. Are not those facts evidence that some inspector did not know his duty? When produce has been rejected, it should not be possible for it to be sent back again and passed. I cannot see what is to be gained by giving the control of this inspection to the Commonwealth, if the existing inspectors are to be used. Apparently the honourable member desires, not so much to benefit the public, as to extend the market for the producers in Tasmania.",20
59,Mr ATKINSON,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,Are potatoes grown in the honourable member's electorate?,20
60,Mr CHARLTON,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,"Yes . I do not object to the honourable member looking after the interests of his constituents, but otlier honourable members must have regard to the interests of the public at large, and uphold a system which tends to prevent the spreading of disease. The honourable member seems to think that anything grown in Tasmania should be accepted by every other State, but I hold that the inspection of produce passing from State to State cannot be too rigid, because all steps must be taken to prevent the spread of, and, if possible, to eradicate, disease. I know of cases in my own State in which farmers have lost an entire crop by the appearance of disease in it. In the interests of those men it is necessary that we should take every precaution to prevent diseased potatoes being supplied to them for seed purposes. Consequently I do not think the House would be doing right at this juncture in carrying a motion of this kind. The question is a big one, and has received consideration at the hands of the State Premiers or Ministers of Agriculture.",20
61,Mr ATKINSON,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,And they all have different systems.,21
62,Mr CHARLTON,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,"They have made certain arrangements in regard to the matter and have tried to work amicably. I hope they will be able to formulate some system which will be acceptable to all concerned. Whilst there is perhaps something in the honourable member's contention that, with Commonwealth control, there would be no bickerings, I do not think the time is ripe for us to interfere. It is a matter for the States, which have their own systems of inspection. If the States consider it necessary fo prevent the importation of any article of produce that may be detrimental to their own people, they have the right to do so, and, so far as the people in the particular State which takes action are concerned, they are the sufferers. The people of New South Wales suffered considerably and paid considerably more for their produce during the time that the importation of potatoes from Victoria and Tasmania was barred. There was sufficient pressure brought to bear on the Minister of Agriculture for New South Wales by the public at that time to induce the Government to let the potatoes in, and, if they could possibly have admitted them, they would readily have done so, because of the high' price that the people had to pay. I can assure the honourable member for Wilmot that, so far as New South Wales is concerned, there is no foundation for his belief that the importations are shut out for the purpose of keeping the local marRet. New South Wales has a better Federal spirit than that, and the Government took action simply because they had to protect the growers and prevent disease from becoming rampant within their borders. I am against the motion at present, and, if necessary, shall vote against it.",21
63,Sir JOHN QUICK,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,"Bendigo) [3.28] The honourable member for Wilmot has merely exercised his right as the representative of one of the districts of Tasmania in bringing this very important question under the attention of the House, because we are all aware that last year the subject of Inter-State trade, particularly in the matter of potatoes, was frequently brought before the House by the members for Tasmania, who complained that Tasmanian producers and traders were not receiving fair play in some of the Australian markets.  ment of which the honourable member was a member give them that fair play and justice which he says that they demanded?",21
64,Sir JOHN QUICK,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,"I am merely drawing attention to those complaints. I am not at present saying that the method proposed to be. adopted by the honourable member for Wilmot, as embodied in the motion, is the correct one, but any member has a right to bring under the attention of the House complaints of the kind, to see whether the Constitution provides a remedy, or whether there are other legal remedies which ought to be resorted to. Whilst, no doubt, Tasmanian growers have complained of the treatment they have received, the question is still open to argument as to whether they have not a proper legal remedy for the redress of their grievances in the Federal Courts. The honourable member suggests in the motion that the Commonwealth should forthwith take over the inspection and effective control of produce. I do not think, as a matter of constitutional law, that the Commonwealth at present can take over the right of inspection, because, by the Constitution, the right of inspection in Inter-State trade is reserved to the several States. At the same time, even under the Constitution, no State can defeat the principle of Inter-State Free Trade by fraudulently or improperly imposing inspection laws. I think if any State endeavours, under the pretended exercise of the inspection powers, to interfere with the principle of Inter-State Free Trade, a remedy exists at the present time without any amendment of the Constitution. During the controversy last year, I suggested to the honourable member for Darwin, when he brought the matter before the House, that the remedy of the State or the producers of Tasmania lay in challenging, in the Federal Courts, the inspection laws of Victoria or New South Wales, on the ground that they were excessive or unfair, and mere evasions of the principle of Inter-State Free Trade. That is quite clear under the Constitution of the United States, and equally clear under our own. In Prentice and Egan's Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution, at page 157, the following passage occurs :The amount of the charge which a State lawfully impose for inspection is by the stitution limited, in the case of foreign comfalse charge of being diseased. merce, to such sum as is absolutely necessary for execution of its inspection laws; and so long as the charge imposed is of an amount which can reasonably be considered an inspection - fee, a Federal Court will not determine question whether it is excessive. In all matters State legislation is subject to the and control of Congress, by whom alone the question is determined whether an inspection charge is excessive. It is, however, the of any Court, before which the question arise, to determine whether or not a charge posed by the State under the guise of an inspection law is, in its nature, an inspection or a tax. So that, as I told my honourable friend last year, the producers of Tasmania, through the Government of that State, could have tested the question of the legality of the so-called inspection laws of which they complained. At' the same time, in addilenge tion to that legal remedy, this Parliament can annul any inspection laws which are complained of , as invading the principle of Inter-State Free Trade. I not think we can, constitutionally, take - from the State authorities the right to selves inspect in the first instance. There - cannot be such officers as Federal inspectthe ing officers, because that would be pracinvolves tically annulling the Constitution. State authorities have, in the first inIt stance, the right to consider and to chalhas lenge any proposed importations or in the troductions of goods, which they say effective, do not come within the principle of ciple freedom of trade. True, we have the stitution, principle of absolute freedom of trade between the States affirmed by the Constikind. tution ; but that means freedom of trade goods, wares, and merchandise which are capable of going into trade and commerce. There can be no trade or commerce in diseased commodities. I presume that no State asks, or pretends to affirm, the of forcing diseased productions into the markets of another State. I do not think that any State has the right, on the other hand, under the pretence of excluding diseased productions, to exclude producface tions which are honestly healthy commodisham ties, fit to go into trade and commerce. think that, as a matter of practice, as well as constitutional law, if any Tasmanian trader could prove to the High Court that he presents, say, to the State authorities in New South Wales or Victoria, trade and commerce, in the shape of potatoes or fruit, Sir John Quick. which are really and truly healthy, and cannot be suspected of being diseased, he could claim the right of entry for them, can and they could not be kept out by the imConposition of an inspection fee, or by any It is all a question of fact; and the problem is, "" How are you to establish a tribunal to deal with all these importations?"" You the have a number of experts in the port of these Sydney or Melbourne saying that, in revision their opinion, certain potatoes or fruit are diseased, or show signs of disease. function On the other hand, you may have may other experts affirming that those potaimtoes or fruit show no signs of disease. fee It is not a question of legislation, but of fact. How are you to reconcile the conflicting opinions of experts? A regulation passed, say, by Victoria or New South Wales, that no fruit or potatoes coming from any spot in Tasmania within a certain radius of a suspected area shall be admitted, may be well open to chalas to whether it is legal, because that produce may be fairly honest fruit or potatoes, free from disease. The importing State might, however, well say that do if an area is known and established to be diseased, nothing coming from tiiat area themshall come in, because there may be prima facie proof or presumption that it contains bacteria of disease. That, again, a question of the opinion of exThe perts, and no legislation can deal with it. is all a question of the tribunal which to decide. I rose merely to say that motion, if carried, would be quite inbecause it would invade the printhat all the States have, by the Conthe right of inspection, and the right to exclude diseased matter of any At the same time they have no in right, under the pretended exercise of that power, to exclude honest trade. The problem is to reconcile the conflicting rights of the exporting State and the importing State. It may be a matter for negotiation right between the Federal Government and the State Governments to establish a neutral tribunal to deal with all these questions. On the other hand, if any State representative can point to any law that, on the of it, appears tb be unfair, or to be a exercise of the inspecting power, let I him bring it under the attention of the Minister of Trade and Customs, and if he can show that it is an unfair exercise of the inspecting power, that law can be annulled by this Parliament. There are, therefore, two remedies-first , the judicial remedy in the High Court, where you can prove that an inspection law is on the - face of it unfair j and, secondly, the remedy lhat this Parliament can annul any State inspection law interfering with the principle of Inter-State Free Trade. It is unnecessary at this stage to go further than to say that the motion will have the effect of - drawing attention to the matter. It will be far better that a friendly understanding should be arrived at between the various - States upon the subject than that there - should be any suggestion of coercive legislation by the Federal Parliament, or any attempt to stir up strife, or animosity, or jealousy between the States.",21
65,Mr TUDOR,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,The motion is that we - take over the power of inspection.,23
66,Sir JOHN QUICK,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,I do not think that can be legally or constitutionally done.,23
67,Mr TUDOR,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,"The honourable member for Wilmot contends that if we carry the motion, it will mean that we do take that power over.",23
68,Sir JOHN QUICK,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,"It will be quite - ineffective, because we cannot take it over.",23
69,Mr ATKINSON,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,"I submit that we can, by amending the Quarantine Act.",23
70,Sir JOHN QUICK,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,"I do not think that the Quarantine Act can interfere with the principle of Inter-State Free Trade, or the inspection powers of the States. Good, however, will result from the honourable member's action in presenting the case by - drawing the attention of the State authorities to it. It is most desirable that the State authorities should receive a friendly warning that they ought not to push their inspection rights so far as to interfere with the principle of Free Trade.",23
71,Mr TUDOR,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,"Some of the States have in the past, not only by these regulations, but by harbour regulations, limited Ihe effect of the Inter-State Free Trade .section of the Constitution.",23
72,Sir JOHN QUICK,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,"Thos e harbour regulations, if they amount to taxation interfering with the principle of Inter-State Free Trade, will be challengeable by any - trader, and also, I think, by the Federal - Government. No doubt the Federal Government have to exercise a watchful care over the mandates of the Constitution, and that can be done by correspondence with the various State authorities without resort to any unfriendly act on our part. There are - numerous remedies open to us without making such a fundamental and organic alteration as is proposed in this motion.",23
73,Mr LAIRD SMITH,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,"Denison) [3.41]. - As a representative of a little State, much concerned in the export of her products, I wish briefly to address myself to this important question. It was my intention to move in the matter as soon as I became possessed of certain knowledge, which I could not obtain without consulting the legal fraternity, and I was heartily glad when I learned that the honourable member for Wilmot proposed to take action. Tasmania is suffering considerably owing to the restrictions placed upon her produce by the other States of the Union. I wish at this stage to put the House right as to my competency to speak to a question of this kind. When I was addressing the House a few days ago the honourable member for Franklin was good enough to interject, "" What does the honourable member know of the land question?"" From that interjection it might be assumed that it was presumption on my part to deal with this matter. I wish, however, to tell the honourable member for Franklin and the Hobart Mercury that I was brought up on the land, and know the North Coast well. If the honourable member will accompany me to the farm carried on by my uncle at Burnie, he will find in that gentleman a farmer who is also an expert in diseases affecting potatoes. Mr Laird informed me, on the occasion of a visit that I recently paid to him, that he hoped in a very short time to be able to produce a blight-proof potato. He is now conducting experiments, and hopes to bring them to a successful issue. Honourable members wiil recognise, therefore, that I do know a little of the farming industry.",23
74,Mr MCWILLIAMS,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,The fact that the honourable member has an uncle on a farm does not make him an expert.,23
75,Mr LAIRD SMITH,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,"But since I followed the plough, during my school holidays, and engaged in planting potatoes in order to find the money necessary for the purchase of books to complete my education, I think it will be admitted that the honourable member's interjection is quite beside the mark. I make no apology for earning an honest living.",23
76,Mr TUDOR,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,The honourable member for Franklin ought to apologize.,23
77,Mr LAIRD SMITH,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,"I think that he ought to do so. I should like to see how he would get on if he had to follow the plough. The people of Tasmania are of opinion that the products of that State are being excluded from other, States of the Union, not because they are diseased, but because they compete with the produce of local farmers. What we wish to do is to remove the inspection of produce from parochial influences. It would be impossible for local men to influence a Commonwealth officer, as they do influence a State officer. Only the other day a press representative was before a Tasmanian Court for having made, through the press, certain statements to the effect that the then Premier of Tasmania, Captain Evans, had visited the wharfs, and interfered with the inspection of fruit, against the will of the State inspector. Parochial influences are exercised in every State, and we wish to remove them. Tasmania entered into the Federation believing that there would be Free Trade between the States. Can it be said that Inter-State Free Trade exists when the farmers of one State are able, through the State Government, to bring influence to bear upon inspectors to secure the condemnation of certain products from another State? Such a condition of affairs is most unjust. The Commonwealth is better able to secure efficient inspection than the States are. The honourable member for Wilmot has made out a very good case, and I hope that his motion will receive the support that it deserves. I shall certainly vote for it.",23
78,Mr GROOM,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,"Darling Downs) [3.46]. - This question is not new to the House, It arose in the first instance owing to the action taken by New South Wales in regard to produce exported from Queensland to that State. When the Reid-MCLean Administration was in power a regulation was passed in New South Wales precluding from the port of Sydney all agricultural produce from Queensland. That regulation was framed because one or two cases of bubonic plague had occurred in Brisbane, and produce from Queensland, although it never went near Brisbane, or within the infected area, was absolutely excluded. A protest was made against this action, and on behalf of several bodies concerned I addressed a letter on the subject to the Minister of Trade and Customs. It was pointed out in the correspondence that if a State, under the guise of exercising its inspection laws, was really prohibiting far beyond the area necessary for its purposes the importation of produce from another State, it was enforcing to an unreasonable degree the police powers reserved to it, and acting contrary to the principles of the Constitution. Shortly afterwards the State authorities of New South Wales relaxed that rule, and regulations were made to try to meet the specific grievance that had to be faced. Recently we had the same trouble in regard to the export of fruit from Brisbane, bananas sent from Queensland to this State having excessive restrictions placed upon them - I should like to say, in passing, that we ought not too hurriedly to condemn the action of the States in this regard, because the industries of a State represent the livelihood of the people, and some of these insect pests, if allowed to spread, would destroy its primary interests. It therefore becomes absolutely necessary for a State to exercise, in the first instance, perhaps, with excessive zeal, its powers in this regard, in order that its industries may be protected from destruction. There is, however, no justification for the continuous use of the power in such a way as practically to exclude the produce of another State from its legitimate market.",24
79,Mr TUDOR,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,Ver y often a State quarantines whole areas within its own boundaries.,24
80,Mr GROOM,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,"That has to be done. In Queensland, for instance, under the Tick Act, there is power to proclaim different parts of the State as prohibited areas. The honourable member for Brisbane will bear out my statement that one cannot move from place to place within those areas without taking what are certainly proper, but, at the same time, extraordinary, precautions. The question was again raised by the honourable member for Parramatta in connection with the export of fruit from New South Wales to Western Australia. On that occasion the complaint was not as to the actual inspection, but as to the excessive inspection fees charged. The State authorities of Western Australia were not displaying that broad Federal spirit that we should have expected had they been led by the right honourable member for Swan, and they imposed inspection charges that were about the same as the import duties passed by the Commonwealth Parliament. The matter was brought prominently before the House, and the honourable member for Franklin was among those who urged that action ought to be taken . The Common1 wealth Government immediately drew the attention of the Government of Western Australia to these excessive charges, and, although the fact may not have been expressly mentioned, we recognised that we had power under the Constitution to claim all fees that were paid, over and above the amount actually necessary to cover the cost of inspection.",24
81,Mr TUDOR,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,"We have that power under section 112, and we can also annul an inspection law if it is unreasonable.",25
82,Mr GROOM,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,That is so. The position in regard to the export of potatoes from Tasmania to the mainland was brought before the House in a very forcible manner by the honourable member for Wilmot. The whole question was discussed when the Quarantine Bill was before us last session.  gentleman do something ? He was in office at the time.,25
83,Mr GROOM,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,"I have shown what was done. I have already explained that the regulation in force in New South Wales was altered, and the regulation in Western Australia, of which complaint was made, was also modified.  member, as a member of the late Government, take the action which the honourable member for Wilmot now proposes shall be taken ?",25
84,Mr GROOM,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,"I was only one in a House of seventy-five members. the Quarantine Bill was before us there was a general consensus of opinion that the Commonwealth powers in regard to the quarantine, both of animals and goods, should be confined to oversea importations. We acted in accordance with tiiat expression of opinion. It was felt that we had a reserve power to intervene at any time, and that that power should, if necessary, be exercised. It was a moot question, however, as the honourable member for Bendigo has pointed out, as to the extent to which our power to regulate Inter-State Trade would enable us to interfere with the reserve police powers vested in the States; but the balance of opinion was that the Commonwealth had power to take the action I have mentioned, so far as Inter-State trade is concerned. That power is exercised freely, and with advantage, by the United States of America, and I believe that we enjoy it to an exactly similar extent. For the time being, however, if the States are willing, as they appear to be, judging by the result of the recent Conference in regard to diseases affecting potatoes, to bring their regulations into conformity, we should give them an opportunity to do so. If it should appear that they are not prepared to do so, and that they are going to exercise their powers to an unreasonable degree, the Commonwealth power should be brought into operation; but until such an intention on their part is shown, however, I do not think we should take action. The honourable member for Wilmot has done right in bringing this matter before the House, and in endeavouring to secure such rea-sonable inspection laws as will tend, whilst securing Inter-State Free Trade, to pre-: vent the spread of diseases likely to injure the primary industries of Australia.",25
85,Mr TUDOR,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,"Yarra-Minister of Trade ancl Customs) [3.54] - When the honourable member for Wilmot gave notice of his motion, I consulted the Attorney General' as to whether we had the power to do what is proposed without an amendment of the Constitution, and I believe that not only my honourable colleague, but his predecessor, the honourable member for Angas, agreed that it was quite possible that we had that power and could .exercise it, by legislation, without an alteration of the Constitution. I , for one, agree with the remarks of the honourable member for Darling Downs that the Federal Government should be very reluctant to interfere, in cases of this kind. We When should do all in our power to induce the States to carry out the inspection laws and the quarantining of goods in a manner not so harsh as in some cases in the past. In the early days of Federation it was well known that the Western Australian Government imposed such heavy wharfage rates and enacted such inspection laws as to actually amount to a prohibition of goods from the eastern States.",25
86,Sir JOHN FORREST,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,Onl y certain goods - fruit s that were all rotten.,25
87,Mr TUDOR,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,"I heard quite another tale when I was in Western Australia from some orchardists, who happen, by the way, to live in the right honourable member's electorate. These rates and regulations had the effect of shutting out produce from Tasmania, South Australia, New South Wales, Victoria, and, I believe, Queensland, and gave the local orchardists a practical monopoly. Since that time, however, the regulations have been relaxed and the charges reduced.",25
88,Mr MCWILLIAMS,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,The Federal Government intervened.,25
89,Mr TUDOR,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,"Yes ; I think it was at the Hobart Conference of Premiers that a resolution was carried dealing with the matter of the charges made by harbour authorities and others. The honourable member for Wilmot has served a good purpose in showing that the members of this Parliament are alive to the question. On many previous occasions, on the adjournment of the House, the matter has been referred to.",25
90,Mr ATKINSON,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,Not this particular point of inspection.,26
91,Mr TUDOR,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,"No ; but the question of the shutting out of Tasmanian potatoes by Victoria and New South Wales was discussed in September, October, and November last, though it has never been debated as today on a specific motion. It will be remembered that certain States have not only shut out the produce of other States, but have, in many cases, quarantined areas within their own boundaries. I heard from the Minister of Agriculture of Victoria last week that in the electorate, I think, of the honourable member for Flinders, a whole area had been quarantined on account of disease having appeared on a little patch in one gully. It is probable that the farmer himself did not know the disease' was there, but he and his neighbours have all to suffer on that account. If the farmers of the north-west of Tasmania have undergone any hardship, they are not alone, though that, of course, is not much consolation; at any rate, they know that the laws of the various States are enacted for the purpose of endeavouring to free Australia from disease. If that can be accomplished, however harsh the inspection laws may be, good service will have been done to the country.",26
92,Mr ATKINSON,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,But that refers to inspection inside each State.,26
93,Mr TUDOR,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,"If the honourable member by his motion means to abolish State inspection altogether, not only of oversea goods but of Inter-State goods, we shall be taking a step which has not up to the present time even been contemplated by this or any previous Government.",26
94,Mr ATKINSON,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,"I refer only to inspections at the port of entry, and do not wish to interfere with goods from oversea.",26
95,Mr TUDOR,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,"I am not sure that we shall not at some time have to take complete control of commerce, not only oversea but Inter-State, though 1 do not think that time has yet arrived.",26
96,Mr ATKINSON,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,That is another question.,26
97,Mr TUDOR,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,"Quite so; but the honourable member is asking that the inspection shall be taken out of the* hands of the State officers and vested in Federal officers, although he should know that there is not a single Federal officer employed even under our Commerce Act at the present time. All fruit exported from Tasmania is inspected by State officers who are paid by the Federal Government; and what applies to Tasmania applies to every other State.",26
98,Mr MCWILLIAMS,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,That only has reference to goods which go outside the Commonwealth.,26
99,Mr TUDOR,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,"Yes ; but if it is true of goods which go outside the Commonwealth, we certainly do not exercise any inspection over those transferred within the Commonwealth. As a matter of fact, we should probably have the same officers doing the inspection as at present.",26
100,Mr MCWILLIAMS,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,We have the same men making both inspections now.,26
101,Mr TUDOR,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,"But there would be this difference, that the Commonwealth would pay the inspectors instead of the States.",26
102,Mr ATKINSON,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,We should be getting the inspection fees which go to pay the salaries of the officers.,26
103,Mr TUDOR,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,"We get no fees at present, though I trust that will be remedied in the near future.",26
104,Mr MCWILLIAMS,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,There ought not to be any profit made out of the inspection.,26
105,Mr TUDOR,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,"No ; but the inspectionshould pay for itself. However, that is another question, with which I do not desire to deal now. The honourable member for Wilmot, when an honourable member was referring to fruit which, after being rejected at Sydney, was passed on a second' presentation, interjected- "" The bags may not have been seen on the second occasion."" If the inspection is so lax as would appear from the interjection, I certainly think it forms the best argument in favour of this motion; but I do not think the inspection is so lax.",26
106,Mr ATKINSON,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,I only said that to illustrate the present state of affairs.,26
107,Mr TUDOR,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,"But it is somewhat dangerous, when we suppose the inspection to be fairly effective, to make such a suggesr tion.",26
108,Mr ATKINSON,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,"I did not say there was no inspection, but that these particular bags had not, perhaps, been inspected; every bag is not inspected.",26
109,Mr TUDOR,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,"Quite so; just in the same way as only certain boxes of export butter are examined. As a result of this debate, I shall refer the matter to the Attorney-General. This, of course, is not a party question in any sense; on all sides honourable members are anxious that the producers should be able to send their produce all over Australia, and that no State should seek to interfere with that freedom by means of regulations. If any honourable member will bring under my notice exorbitant charges or unfair regulations, either I myself or any other Minister concerned will be glad to assist in having the Constitution interpreted as was intended, so as to make Inter-State commerce absolutely free.",26
110,Mr DEAKIN,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,The Minister will take some steps to inquire into the particular subject of the motion?,27
111,Mr TUDOR,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,I shall.,27
112,Mr MCWILLIAMS,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,"Franklin) [4.5] I am glad this matter has been brought before honourable members. On many occasions it has been discussed j and the Minister of Trade and Customs is quite correct in saying that at one time the Government of Western Australia imposed such charges on the introduction of fruit especially, as to amount to a prohibitive protective duty. I then considered it only right to bring the matter under the notice of the Federal Government of the day; and thereupon the Government of Western Australia were distinctly told that they must not levy charges beyond the actual cost of inspection. In New South Wales the question has arisen again ; and here I must say that I always speak of that State with the very greatest gratitude. AVe cannot forget that in the pre-Federation days good old New South Wales opened her ports to Tasmania, and traded with us when other and closer States shut out everything that we produced. To-day Sydney is unquestionably the best market Tasmania possesses. It may surprise honourable members to learn that Tasmania will this year ship to Sydney, including, of course, the transhipped Queensland trade, as many apples as are shipped to London, namely, half-a-million bushels. ""It will be seen, therefore, that, as I say, New South Wales is our best neighbour and our best market; but, at the same time, the Government of that State insist on a system which is distinctly unfair to the producers. For instance, it is demanded that there should be one inspection at the port of export and another at the port of entry. The majority of honourable members, if not all, will, I think, agree that there should be left in the hands of any State the most full and complete power to prevent the importation of rotten or diseased produce from one State to another, with the inevitable loss and spread of desolation. But we contend that an inspection at the port of entry is all [16] that is necessary, and that New South Wales could best defend her produce and her industries by inspection at her own ports. The same applies to other States; but the position which the New South VVales Government have taken up is that, unless the produce sent from Tasmania is accompanied by an export certificate, it must be treated in a very much more severe way, thus making the cost exceedingly heavy. For months we have been endeavouring to get the Minister of Agriculture of New South Wales to regard this matter in the same light as it is regarded by the Governments of other States-to agree that the charges levied for the inspection shall be no more than the actual cost. As a matter of fact, New South Wales is charging fees which are enormously in excess of the cost of inspection, and is thereby making a profit; whereas the argument of the Minister of Agriculture is that the Department is being run at a loss, and cannot afford any reduction.",27
113,Mr WEST,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,There will be a change of Government there soon!,27
114,Mr MCWILLIAMS,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,"I do not desire to go into that question. It will be. of distinct advantage to the Governments who are dealing with this matter to know that the subject has received the attention of the Federal Government and the Federal Parliament. As to the constitutional aspect, I have here the paper which, at my request, was laid on the table of the House, containing the opinion of the late Attorney General, the honourable member for Angas, who has dealt with the subject at considerable length, and with the pains he bestows on all he undertakes. It may be interesting to read this paper, giving that honourable gentleman's deliberate opinion, in which he shows quite conclusively that the Federal Government has full power to deal with the matter, so long as the whole question is taken into consideration. That opinion is published in a Parliamentary paper available to honourable members, and I suggest that they give it consideration - I hope that the Governments of the States will take notice of this discussion, and recognise that if they continue to place restrictions on Inter-State trade which harass and embarrass the producers of any State, a higher authority may intervene to prevent this injustice. It is well known that it is practically impossible to obtain in Victoria, today a Queensland banana which can be termed eatable, because the State regulations for the prevention of the introduction of the fruit fly prohibit the importation of fruit that has not been cut when so immature that it can never properly ripen. These regulations have killed the banana trade, so far as the Southern States are concerned, and affect prejudicially, not only those who grow bananas in Queensland, but also the consumers here, many of whom regard this fruit as one of the most wholesome foods obtainable. If one desires a good banana nowadays, he has to buy a Fijian banana. The object of Federation was to secure the freest exchange of products between all parts of Australia, and if , by exorbitant charges and unfair regulations, Governments or officials place an embargo on Inter-State Free Trade, the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth will be invoked to give full play to the Federal spirit, which should never have been thwarted. Debate (on motion by Mr LIVINGSTON) adjourned. SURPLUS REVENUE BILL. SECOND READING.",27
115,Mr FISHER,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,"Wide Bay-Treasurer ) [4.16] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. The introduction of a measure such as this was contemplated by the framers of the Constitution. The main provisions of the Bill have been discussed perhaps more than any other matter which has come within the scope of Federal politics, and, during the recent electoral campaign, was probably debated from every platform. The provisions of the Bill are so simple that honourable members will have no difficulty in expressing their opinions concerning them with brevity, and I hope that the second reading may be agreed to during the sitting. The Constitution requires that for the first ten years of Federation, the Commonwealth shall return to the States not less than three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue. In 1908'we passed the Surplus Revenue Act, to enable us to put to the credit of a trust fund or funds unspent balances of the one-fourth which the Commonwealth is entitled to retain for its own purposes. The Bill amends that Act, so far as is necessary to enable our present proposals to be carried into effect. It provides that, for ten years, from ist July last, there shall be paid to the States an amount equal to 25s. per capita, and that for this purpose the number deemed to be the population of each State shall be that estimated by the Commonwealth Statistician as its population on the 31st December in the financial year in respect of which any payment or debit is to he made. The State of Western Australia is to receive also for the first year an additional £250,000, but in each subsequent year this special allocation is to be progressively diminished by £10,000. One-half of the amount of these special payments is to be debited to all the States, including AVestern Australia', in proportion to the number of their people, the Commonwealth paying the remaining half. There is a proviso to give effect to the agreement between the Governments of the States and our predecessors that those States which paid old-age pensions should contribute jointly with the other States to the deficit of the last financial year in the ratio of three to two. It is, therefore, provided that for the financial year ending 30th June, 1911, the following amounts shall be deducted from the payments to the States concerned:-Ne w South Wales, ^178,973 j Victoria, £143,092 ; Queensland, £63,788 ; South Australia, £30,529; AVestern Australia, £20,113; "" d Tasa mania, £13,505. These sums total £450,000, which is approximately what the amount of the deficit on the Commonwealth accounts for the financial year ending 30th June last will be.",28
116,Mr WH IRVINE,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,Unde r what authority will these deductions be made?,28
117,Mr FISHER,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,"The deductions will be made in the exercise of the powers vested in this Parliament. What greatly influenced Ministers, and especially myself, in the adoption of this provision was the agreement between the representatives of the Governments of the States and the representatives of the last Commonwealth Government to do what we provide for. In conference, those representatives expressed their willingness to' do this, and made their intention plain in a document which they all signed.",28
118,Mr WH IRVINE,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,Can we provide for these deductions without an amendment of the Constitution?,28
119,Mr FISHER,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,The Constitution empowers us to legislate regarding the manner in which the Customs and Excise revenue shall be distributed after the ist January next.,28
120,Mr WH IRVINE,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,"But the Bill is providing for a distribution which is to take place on ist July of this year! 1 cannot see how that can be done, unless the States agree to it.",28
121,Mr FISHER,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,"Is>peak with the greatest diffidence as a layman in replying to honourable members who belong to the learned profession of the law'; but I am cf opinion that the statement in the Bill is clear, definite, and direct. Clause 4 leaves nothing in doubt --upo n",29
122,Mr GB EDWARDS,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,Excep t whether it is .constitutional.,29
123,Mr FISHER,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,"If it is unconstitutional, the remedy is easy. It providesThe Commonwealth shall, during the period of ten years beginning on the first day of July, One thousand nine hundred and ten, and thereafter until the Parliament otherwise provides, pay to each State by monthly instalments, or applv to the payment of interest on debts of the State taken over by the Commonwealth, an annual sum amounting to Twenty-five shillings per head of the number of the people of the State. In my opinion, that covers the legal difficulty which the honourable member for Flinders has raised. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - It was constitutional question that was raised.",29
124,Mr FISHER,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,"The constitutional question does not arise. We propose that from the ist July of this year, for a period of ten years, the Commonwealth shall pay to the States 25s. fer cafita, and pay it annually.",29
125,Mr WH IRVINE,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,"Of course, that can be done after the ist January next year.",29
126,Mr GB EDWARDS,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,It anticipates the. constitutional provision by six months.,29
127,Mr FISHER,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,"I should be more stupid .than I look if I thought that we could pay less than three-quarters of the net Customs and Excise revenue to the States during the first six months of the current financial year. I am under no such hallucination. But, at the same time, it is, I presume, a right thing for this Parliament to pay that amount during the first half of the financial year, and then during the second half arrange the payments in such a way as to enable the net 25s. fer cafita to have been paid to the States during the whole of the financial year.",29
128,Mr GB EDWARDS,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,No .,29
129,Mr FISHER,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,"Well , that is what the Bill says, and what the Government mean to do.",29
130,Mr GB EDWARDS,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,"The provision was for monthly settlements, on the three-fourths basis, for the rest of the current calendar year. [ , 6 ] -2",29
131,Mr FISHER,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,"The honourable member is not on sound ground even in that matter. The High Court has held that it need not necessarily be an exact balance. It has never hinted that it would be wrong or unjust for the Federal Parliament to pay more than the monthly balance. That is all that we propose to do. We say that if the States insist upon their legal rights having the full three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue during the first six months of the current financial year-it shall be paid to them. But I venture to say that it is not asking too much of them, and it would not be an exceptionally generous act on their part, if the State Governments came forward boldly in their Parliaments and said, "" The Commonwealth has taken over large obligations, including old-age pensions and defence, which are absolutely necessary, and has relieved us of that great load, and we are therefore prepared to allow the Federal Parliament to take all the amount above 25s. fer cafita during the whole of the financial year beginning on the ist July, a 1910."" If they did that, they would be doing nothing more than they pledged themselves to do, and endeavoured, on the platform, to induce the people to consent to.",29
132,Mr GLYNN,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,r-That would have to be done by Act of Parliament.,29
133,Mr FISHER,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,I admit that. They would have to go to their Parliaments; but there would be nothing wonderfully generous in their doing it. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - The proposal of the Government means that the States will get considerably less than 25s. fer cafita in the second half of the financial year.,29
134,Mr FISHER,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,"What a discovery ! I have been explaining that for the last ten minutes. Everybody knows that that is the proposal. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON.:-It should be known, too.",29
135,Mr FISHER,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,"If it is an injustice, I should like to know how it arises. If the Commonwealth is prepared to pay, during the first half of the year, probably two-thirds of the amount for the whole year, the difficulty is the Commonwealth's and not the States'; and, therefore, the States should be very glad to receive it, in view of the action of the Federal voters at the last election.",29
136,Mr JOSEPH COOK,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,"So they ought! Codlin is their friend, not Short, after all.",29
137,Mr FISHER,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,"If the Government err at all as regards this proposal, they err on the side of generosity, and not on the side of parsimony to the States. I put my name to a manifesto to guarantee to the States, by an Act of the Federal Parliament, so far as my power would carry it, 25s. per capita for ten years, with a great deal of hesitancy and reluctance j but, having done that, and having placed that proposal before the electors, with any weight that I might have individually, and as the leader of a great party, I mean, so far as I am able, as a public man, to stand by it. It is in that respect that I say that our proposal is exceedingly generous from the States' point of view. Mr G. ""B. EDWARDS --It is a composite of generosity and meanness.",30
138,Mr FISHER,OF WIRES BETWEEN BENDIGO AND,"My reply to that is the following document, a copy of which I hold in my hand :. INTER-STATE CONFERENCE, BOURNE, AUGUST, 1909. NA NA TO BY THE CONFERENCE. Commonwealth and State Finance - Agreement between the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth and the Premiers of the several States. In the public interests of the people of Australia, to secure economy and efficiency in the raising and the spending of their revenues, and to permit their Governments to exercise unfettered control of their receipts and expenditure, it is imperative that the nnancial relations of the Federal and State Government-whic h under the Constitution were determined only in part, and for a term of years-shoul d be placed upon a sound and permanent basis. It is therefore agreed by the Ministers of State of the Commonwealth and the Ministers of the Component States in conference assembled to advise :1. That to f u l f il the intention of the Constitution, by providing for the consolidation and transfer of State debts, and in order to insure the most profitable management of future loans by the establishment of one Australian Stock, a complete investigation of this most important subject shall be undertaken forthwith by the Governments of the Commonwealth and the States. This investigation shall include the auestion of the actual cost to the States of transferred properties as defrayed out of loan or revenue moneys. 2. That in order to give freedom to the Commonwealth in levying duties of Customs and Excise, and to assure to the States a certain annual income, the Commonwealth shall after the first day of July, One thousand nine hundred and ten, pay monthly to the States a sum calculated at the rate of One pound five shillings per annum per head of population according to the latest statistics of the Commonwealth, I think that language is similar to that contained in our Bill3. That in recognition of the heavy obligations incurred in the. payment of Old age Pensions, the Commonwealth may, during the current financial yearThat is, the financial year which closed on the 30th June lastwithhold from the moneys returnable to the States such sum (not exceeding Six hundred thousand pounds) as will provide for the actual shortage in the revenue at the end of the said year. If such shortage amounts to Six hundred thousand pounds the basis of contribution by the States shall be Three shillings per head of population in the Pension States (viz., New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland)The States that were paying old-age pensions prior to the Commonwealth taking over that burdenand Two shillings per head of population in the Non-pension States (viz., MEL- South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania). If such shortage be AND STATE less than Six hundred thousand AGREED pounds the contributions shall be reduced proportionately per head of population as between the Pension and the Non-pension States. 4. That, in view of the large contribution to the Customs revenue fer cafita made by the State of Western .Australia, the Commonwealth shall (in addition to the payment provided for in paragraph No. 2) make lo such State special annual payments, commencing at Two hundred and fifty thousand pounds in the financial year One thousand nine hundred and ten and One thousand nine hundred and eleven, and diminishing at the rate of Ten thousand pounds per annum. The Commonwealth shall in each year deduct on a f er cafita basis from the moneys payable to the States of the Commonwealth an amount equal to one-half of the sum so payable to the State of Western Australia. 5. That the Government of the Commonwealth bring before the Parliament during this session the necessary measure to enable an alteration of the Constitution (giving effect to the preceding paragraphs, Nos. 2, 3, and 4) to be submitted to the electors.

Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - That is the proof of the rejection of the whole agreement.",31
143,Mr FISHER,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"No ; those who sit here, with one or two exceptions, accepted the ten years' proposal.",31
144,Mr FOWLER,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,Not one in Western Australia proposed the ten years' term.,31
145,Mr FISHER,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"On e candidate in tern Australia who wished the agreement be permanently embodied in the Constituthe tion utterly failed in his candidature, but we stood against it 'being placed Constitution under any conditions whatever. There is not one honourable member on this side of the House who was returned except on that understanding.",31
146,Mr WH IRVINE,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,Severa l honourable members on this side of the House were returned on the same terms.,31
147,Mr FISHER,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"I am glad to know that that is so, and I thank those who, quite apart from any consideration of party, held with the Labour party that it would be disastrous to the Commonwealth and the States alike to place the Financial Agreefrom ment in the Constitution. Surely the honarguments orable member for Flinders would be the very last to say that this was a political bargain ancl not a genuine agreement to meet the financial necessities of both parties.",31
148,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,It is an insult to all who made it to say that it was not genuine.,31
149,Mr FISHER,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,The honourable member for Parramatta says that it was a genuine agreement.,31
150,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,A genuine bargain genuinely made.,31
151,Mr FISHER,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,I have never in my bitterest moments alleged that it was otherwise.,31
152,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,The honourable repremember said just now that it was a polithe tical ancl not a genuine bargain.,31
153,Mr FISHER,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"The honourable member under a misapprehension. I asked the honourable member for Flinders whether he would say that it was a political arrangeand not one honourably entered into itself."" for national purposes.",31
154,Mr WH IRVINE,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"It was an honourable bargain honourably entered into, like' that in any other agreement might be.",31
155,Mr FISHER,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,But the honourable member says that there was a quid fro quo. As,31
156,Mr WH IRVINE,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,The States and the Commonwealth.,31

What power had they, apart from the ingain?terests of the people, to make this barWe appealed to the people, ancl they said by a very substantial majority in each State that the men who had made'the agreauent utterly misunderstood their senWestiments and views. As to the terms of to the agreement itself, however, excepting proposal to embody it in the Constitution, they were prepared to accept them bein the cause they were fair.",31
158,Mr WH IRVINE,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,The honourable gentleman cannot very well rely on the terms on one side of the agreement when he does not give effect to the terms on the other side. That is all I contend.,31
159,Mr FISHER,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,Ver y well. That statement is received with a chorus of approval on the part of honourable members opposite. What does it mean ? The honourable member assumes that the ten years' period for which we say this agreement should continue is unreasonably short. Is it absent his mind that one of the strongest used by two or three of the State Premiers was that it would be much safer to put the Financial Agreement into the Constitution because the people could remove it at any moment? The ex-Prime Minister said that to guarantee this payment for a period of ten years might embarrassing to this Parliament. honourable member for Flinders shakes his head.,31
160,Mr WH IRVINE,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,I do not agree that.,32

162,Mr FOWLER,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"There is not much genetion rosity, so far as Western Australia is conits cerned, in the Government proposal. That State will lose very considerably under it.",32
163,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,That was also said in our State. Thousands of votes cast against the Financial Agreement New South Wales on the score that it was not generous enough.,32

165,Mr FISHER,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"Subject to Mr. Speaker's ruling, I am glad to listen relevant interjections, because I recogern nise that associated with this quesam tion are many avenues that might well investigated. Let me take, first of all, the statement of the honourable member for Perth that under our proas posal an injustice will be done to Western Australia. I am surprised at such statement. Western Australia contribute per capita anything like what some of the States will have to do, and T do not understand his interjection. Generally speaking, the honourable member is able to express a reasonable opinion matters of this kind, but his interjection is entirely erroneous, as the most casual investigation of the figures will show.",32
166,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"Indeed , it will not. Resolved",32
167,Mr FISHER,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"I am speaking from memory, but I venture to say that under labour this scheme the largest contributor per capita to the cost of the Commonwealth .Government will be Queensland, be New South Wales will be second on the The list.",32
168,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"Ne w South Wales will he first'. I have the figures up to with date. New South Wales will contribute £350,000.",32
169,Mr FISHER,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,The honourable member is off the track. I am speaking of the per Each and every perof son in a State subject to two limitations will bring from the Commonwealth to that ConState an income of 25s. per annum.,32
170,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"There is a table the Budget papers dealing with the per in capita contribution, and showing the difthis ference which the Financial Agreement would make in the returns to the various",32
171,Mr FISHER,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"Le t us take the posiof Western Australia, and assume that income last year was £ 3 5s. per capita. Under this arrangement that State will receive 25s. per head of its population, leaving 40s. to be accounted for. It will also were obtain what will be equal to about 17sper in head of the population out of the special grant of £250,000 which - it will receive during the next year, leaving a balance of 23s. Now take Queensland. That State, I think, will contribute nearly 28s. per a capita, and the position of New South will be practically the same, so that there will be a difference of 5s. per capita between the contribution of Western Australia and the other two States to the expenses of the Commonwealth. In these cirto cumstances, how can it be said that WestAustralia is to be unfairly treated? I sorry that I have not before me a table be setting forth the exact figures, and that I have to speak entirely from memory so far this phase of the question is concerned.",32
172,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,There is a table in a the Budget papers showing how the surplus will not will be distributed.,32
173,Mr FISHER,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"I . am talking, not of the surplus in the aggregate, but of the surplus per capita under this Bill. After this digression, I propose to complete the on reading of the agreement made between the late Government and the State PremiersVESTING IN COMMONWEALTH BY STATES OF CERTAIN POWERS IN RESPECT OF INDUSTRIAL MATTERS. 1. It is desirable that each State should establish tribunals for regulating the conditions of in that State. 2. That the jurisdiction and powers of each State industrial tribunal should be uniform as and that far as practicable. 3. That to meet the case where it is proved that Inter-State - competition exists in industrial matters which is unfair, and the State tribunals have failed to grant relief, the Parliaments of the States should agree to vest the Commonwealth with the power to adjust the grievance complained of. 4. When the Court of a State determines on complaint of an industrial tribunal that(a) Injury is caused to an industry carried on within that State; {i) Such injury is caused by competition of persons engaged in the same industry in another adjoining State or States; (c) Such injury is solely caused by the ditions of labour under which employees in the competing industry work; (d) Such conditions, whilst making allowance for local circumstances, are unfair to the complaining State; (e) The industrial tribunals of the States concerned have failed, either jointly or by separate action, to alter the conditions of labour which caused such injury ; such Court may order that the conditions which are the cause of the unfair competition shall be referred to a Commonwealth tribunal for adjustment. ADVERTISING AUSTRALIA ABROAD. Resolved1. That the Commonwealth advertise genethe rally the resources of Australia. 2. That the Commonwealth distribute literature that any State may wish to supply, provided that such literature does not reflect on any other State. 3. That the States consult amongst themselves ancl with the Commonwealth as to the result the methods of advertising from time to time. ResolvedThat, in the opinion of this Conference, it is desirable that the ocean lights be the Commonwealth as early as practicable. ResolvedThat it is desirable that the Commonwealth should take over quarantine stations other those exclusively used for animals and plants, together with all officers engaged solely in such quarantine work. That completes the official record of agreement entered into between the Pre- - necessary. miers of the States and the representatives of the Commonwealth as presented to this Constitution. Parliament, and it shows clearly the position that was taken up. One advantage of the early introduction and passing of such a measure as this is that it will State Premiers to know practically what amount of revenue they will annually revision. ceive. Each State Treasurer will have only to learn from the statistics what is likely to be the population within the borders of elsewhere. his State on 31st December of each year in order to be able to determine what his returns from the Commonwealth A simpler method could not well be devised. There is yet another advantage to be stated. The Constitution provided that five years after the imposition of uniform duties of Customs and Excise the Parliament of the Commonwealth should have power to determine the distribution of the surplus revenue. As I have pointed out before, this Parliament did pass a Surplus Revenue Bill, and, on the passing of this measure, that, shall I say disturbing, feature of the procedure under the Constitucon- tion, the bookkeeping system, which has caused a great deal of annoyance and trouble as between the States, will be entirely set aside.",32
174,Mr GB EDWARDS,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,The trouble in regard to Inter-State certificates.,33
175,Mr FISHER,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"The bookkeeping system involves Inter-State certificates in relation to the transfer of goods between State and State. It was a wise and very necessary provision in the Constitution that the duties on goods were to be credited to the State in which the goods were consumed, and not to the State in which they were landed; but, as contribution is to be arranged in a definite sum, which does not in any way affect any the consuming power of the people, the bookkeeping provisions can be entirely abolished ; and this, I think, is an additional advantage in the measure before us. of Honourable members will see that there is a provision which compels the Commonwealth LIGHTHOUSES. to pay to the States any surplus there may be over the sum necessary for the promised taken over by payment of 25s. per head.",33
176,Mr GB EDWARDS,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,That is the most QUARANTINE. extraordinary thing in the whole Bill. It makes the States dependent on the Commonwealth for ever and aye-re-enact s than what we have been trying to get rid of.,33
177,Mr FISHER,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"As Treasurer, I do not feel a bit alarmed about that provision, the but, on the contrary, regard it as very",33

182,Mr GB EDWARDS,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"I could understand such a proposition by the Opposition, will be. but not by the Government.",33
183,Mr FISHER,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"The only difference between myself and the honourable member is that I desire this Bill, when passed, to remain a Statute of the. Commonwealth. The particular point may be raised and attacked ; and, as a layman, I do not desire to leave any loophole for an appeal to the High Court"". The provision may be right, or it may be wrong; if it does a little harm, it will do a good deal of good.",34
184,Mr GLYNN,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"The Government are right in"" inserting this provision, I think. - Mr FISHER - I am glad to have that view, which is also the view of my advisers, and one Ithat I should be very foolish not to take on a momentous measure of such far-reaching effect. Whether enough safeguards have been provided is another question.",34
185,Mr GLYNN,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,The Constitution provides that any surplus must be paid over. The Bill that was rejected repealed the section of the Constitution which provides for the payment.,34
186,Mr FISHER,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"I do not think there is any other serious principle involved in the Bill. As to the question raised by the honourable member for Perth, I point out that approximately the nnancial effect of the measure will be as follows :Estimate of Per Capita Balance State. Customs bution. and Excise, 1910-11. by States. New South Wales 2 11 8 14 Victoria 2 5 5 14 Queensland 2 13 0 1 4 South Australia 2 3 8 14 Western Australia 3 6 2 2 2 Tasmania 1 18 11 14 It will be seen that, while Western Australia contributes £ i 3s. iod., Queensland contributes £ 1 , 8 s . ""jd., and New South Wales £ L 7s. 3d. It is true that Tasmania and also South Australia contribute less, but that .hardly bears out the statement that Western Australia is being treated unfairly.",34
187,Mr MCWILLIAMS,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,There is a leakage in Tasmania.,34
188,Mr FISHER,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"That is an old question ; but whatever may have been the case in the past, Tasmania will not be able to make any complaint in the future.",34
189,Mr GROOM,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,Are the figures quoted based on calculations including the oversea trade?,34
190,Mr FISHER,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"I give the whole of the estimated Customs and Excise receipts for the financial year just closed, and go on to show the amounts the Conunonwealth will be able to retain for the services of the Commonwealth.",34
191,Mr GROOM,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,The question of leakage could not affect these figures.,34
192,Mr FISHER,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"The question of leakage can affect Tasmania only in regard to dutiable goods landed elsewhere, and then transferred to Tasmania. I have gone into the question; and I venture the opinion' that the statements about Tasmania's loss are greatly exaggerated, if they have any foundation at all. I do not at this moment desire to reveal the want of knowledge of some Tasmanian members as to how the Customs and Excise duties are applied-this is not the occasion.",34
193,Mr ATKINSON,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,Are these figures the Prime Minister's estimate ?,34
194,Mr FISHER,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"The figures are 'so nearly accurate that they cannot be more than 3 per cent, out at the very most.",34
195,Mr TUDOR,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,Are they not the actual figures ?,34
196,Mr FISHER,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"No ; they were made out before the close of the year; but they will not vary more than the estimate of the Treasurer has varied, ancl may Budget be regarded as an absolute guide.

I commend this Bill to 4 1 3 10 5 0 14 6 Parliament with the feeling that the proposal made is generous. I venture to say that some of us, instead of standing on the platform asking for more for the States, will, because of the pledge we have given to faithfully carry out our promise to the electors, have to stand on the platform and maintain this payment to the States for ten years. Any influence I may have will be exerted in the direction of maintaining the honour of the Federal Parliament in this regard.",34
197,Mr GB EDWARDS,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,We cannot bind future Parliaments.,34
198,Mr FISHER,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"That interjection is, I think, entirely unnecessary. Speaking as an individual, I say that, if I live and have any weight in the public life of Australia, that weight will be so thrown into the scale as to keep this agreement for the period named; and I think that all who undertake to support the measure will direct their efforts, to maintaining the honour of the Commonwealth. If there is any necessity for further revenue we can seek other means. One of the complaints of the States has been that the Commonwealth is overlapping their field of taxation. That may be so; but if we assure tb the States this return for ten years, they cannot, in justice, complain of the Commonwealth seeking necessary revenue in other fields, whether in competition with them or not. At any rate, in dealing with the proposal before us, let us examine it from every point of view. To look ten years ahead, with all the fluctuations that may take place in the Tariff revenue, is very venturesome; but it is done with a' desire to give some stability and of revenue to the States, and if this Bill be passed, I am sure it will be for the safety and to the credit and honour of all concerned.",34

The sooner it is dealt with and disposed of, the sooner the feeling of security, which the Prime Minister desires, will spread throughout the Commonwealth. All of its citizens, as we have occasion to remind ourselves, control two Governments, two separate agencies, through which they carry out their desire's. They have complete control. Their fingers are on the stops of both organs, and it is for them to say through which they prefer to express their - will. Hence, above all, it is desirable that their representatives in each Parliament should, as far as possible, come into harmony. They should maintain a clear and definite understanding in - order that those, who are the masters of both bodies, may judge each by its own actions, and the two together by their success in co-operating to meet the needs of the Commonwealth. I think, therefore, that the Prime Minister and his colleagues have acted wisely in making this their first measure, since it brings us into line on finance. I do not apprehend that its discussion need detain us at any greatlength, though it is a measure of such extreme moment that no consideration which we can devote to it, can be deemed undue. At the same time, we have to realise that the public have been informed-so far as it is possible for members of Parliament, the press and other agencies to inform them-of the nature of this particular financial issue which forms the base of the whole of the government of Australia-governmen t in the ' Commonwealth and government in the States alike. The Prime Minister has reminded us several times that this question, after having been exhaustively discussed, has been de : eided by the people of Australia. But he must not forget that the majority who registered their decision upon it- a decision which is likely to affect our history for a longer time than any of us can foie see-was , aftet all, a majority of only 25,000 out of a vote of 1,300,000. These figures show how comparatively - closewas the division between the electors- - who took different views of the Financial Agreement submitted to them. However, security our path today is smoothed, not only by that decision, but by the fact that the proposition which the Government are submitting is fbr the term indicated, namely, ten years, precisely the proposition for which we have just been contending in the country. To that proposal there can be no possible objection urged by any honourable member on this side of _ the Chamber, since, I believe, every member of the Opposition, without exception, was pledged to the payment by the Commonwealth to the States of 25s. per head. VVe regarded that amount as a fair return to the States from the Customs and Excise revenue of Australia-as an equitable proportion enabling them to fulfil their share of what may be reasonably termed national duties. I propose to pass by the whole range of argument as to what those duties are, or as to the way iri which that sum was arrived at after exhaustive discussion, simply because it is not possible for any of us to take exception tb the amount in question. It would be idle to question the period of ten years further than to say that, as that limitation postpones the further settlement of this. important issue for a decade, we must necessarily - and we can safely-trus t the electors of that time, and their representatives', to arrive at the decision which will seem' to them in the light of their fuller knowledge most just to all the interests of the. Commonwealth. We are also relieved pf the necessity for discussing whether a .period of . fifteen years would not be better than one of ten years, or whether a term of twenty years would not be better than one of fifteen y-ears. A proposition has been submitted by the Government with the authority, not only of a majority of both Chambers, but apparently with that of a small majority of the electors outside, to whom a ten years' term was offered as an alternative. On what ground then ought exception to be taken to the motion for the second reading of this Bill ? I doubt if be anything to which we must demur, save, perhaps, the form of the measure, and even that is capable of being discussed quite as effectively, probably more so, in Committee. Still this question having been broached by the Prime Minister, and followed up by him in replying to interjections, it may be as well lo put to him the view which is entertained by honourable members upon this side of the Chambera view which, so far as I have been able to gather, he has not quite appreciated. We quite recognise the strength of the case submitted by the honourable gentleman for some concessions in his favour. If we were concerned ""with the framing of some new contract or agreement, the i l lustration which he drew from the agreement proposed by the late Government might be apt, and his argument could be made reasonable. But we are not dealing with any such state of affairs. The Prime Minister was good enough to read the full text of that agreement.",35
200,Mr FISHER,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"I thought that it was advisable to do so.""",36
201,Mr DEAKIN,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"That represented-as we have endeavoured to point out to him by interjection-a n honourable arrangement, which was the result of a great deal of bargaining, arrived at after ' protracted and severe argument upon both sides. It represented an agreement to which the then representatives of the Commonwealth and the State Premiers were able to subscribe. It provided for the return to the States by the Commonwealth of 25s. per head for so long a period as the people should retain it in the Constitution, provided that they first placed it there. In consideration of that payment, the States agreed to find certain money with which to finance the Commonwealth over the difficulties into which we had knowingly plunged ourselves by introducing a system of old-age pensions in anticipation of the time when our revenue would enable us to pay them, and before the period, even though we retained our surplus revenue from year to year, when we should have command of the whole of the Customs and Excise revenue. Of our own volition we undertook obligations which left us sorely in need of money during this financial year. The States consented to assist us to meet the deficit which would inevitably occur in consideration of an agreement for the payment to them of 25s. per head being submitted to the people, and if approved by them, embodied in the Conthere stitution. The people did not approve of that agreement, which has consequently been set aside. Now the Prime Minister wishes, in a rather unusual fashion, to adhere to the concessions promised conditionally by the States-at which they arrived for a certain consideration which to them seemed adequate. He offers them something which at the time of our Conference they refused to consider an adequate recognition of the financial sacrifices they were prepared to make. In other words, something which they then rejected is being thrust upon them by the Prime Minister, as if they were under an obligation to accept it now. The whole point at issue is, where is their obligation? The Prime Minister is entitled to ask anything he may think fair. He. believes his proposal is fair, and has advanced reasons why he thinks so. But unless he can convince the representatives of the States that it is fair, that is of no use. He has .no right to treat it from the stand-point of any relation to a past bargain, but only from that of its relation to a present bargain. His one argument was that more than one State Premier has said that some advantage would accrue to the States from limiting the arrangement to a ten years' period, which would not follow from the agreement they made with the late Government. If the agreement which we endorsed had been accepted by the people, it would have been possible at the next election for the country-if it had changed its mind in the interim-to reverse its verdict. It could alter the amount to be returned per capita by the Commonwealth, namely, 25s., or, indeed, alter any other portion of that agreement. But under the Bill which is now before us, the State Premiers will sit safe at all events until ten years have expired. Consequently, they gain something from a limitation of the agreement to a ten years' period which they would not have gained under the agreement made with the late Government. On the other hand, they would say that the agreement with us, in their opinion, possessed other and greater advantages which that he now proposes does not possess. The Premiers strongly contended for an arrangement regarding the distribution! of the Customs and Excise revenue which should be embodied in the Constitution. It was then a matter of bargaining; but it is now a matter of fresh bargaining. Were it not for the curious implication of the Prime Minister that the States are under some obligation to approve this proposal, I should not have detained the House by even a casual reference to the matter. He seems to think that, by giving effect to the policy which his party submitted to the people, and to which he is therefore committed, he is placing the States under an obligation. That being his case, he is sure to be met with the retort, "" You are merely carrying out what you have pledged yourself to do, while asking us to agree to something we refused to sanction because it was inimical to our interests. You wish to throw this provision into the form of a fresh contract, as if displaying rosity on your part, but really placing us in a worse position. You can dictate your own terms, as if ignoring your pledge to your constituents."" That is a view which appears not to have suggested itself to the honourable gentleman, and which, were I the Premier of a State, I should feel bound to submit. It also puzzles me, as a Federal representative, that the Government should have drafted the Bill in so curious a fashion as to suggest that it is attempting to alter that provision of the Constitution which requires the Commonwealth to return to the States, until the 31st December next, three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue. Of course, the Bill does not amend the Constitution; but its form, and the line of argument adopted by the Prime Minister, bring this comparatively side issue into such strong prominence that it is scarcely possible to pass it by without reference.",36
202,Mr FISHER,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,Everybod y knows that the Constitution cannot be amended by an Act of this Parliament.,37
203,Mr DEAKIN,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"That is so; but the clause could have been expressed in a form which would not have given rise to doubt or debate. It is mandatory on us to return to the States, until the close of this calendar year, three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue; by antedating later deductions the issue has been unnecessarily confused and a form of expression adopted by which nothing is gained. The Government, of course, are bound to comply with their constitutional obligations. They have no choice. But they propose to deduct, during the first six months of 1911, from the fer cafita contribution which is to be paid to the States, the amounts set forth in the schedule, without any warrant from them, and so as to take back, in effect, part of what they have been obliged to pay.",37
204,Mr FISHER,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,May not some of the State Parliaments pass Acts allowing us to make the deductions during the .present calendar year?,37
205,Mr DEAKIN,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,All things are possible.,37
206,Mr FISHER,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"The provision, as worded, gives the State authorities an opportunity to show their reasonableness.",37
207,Mr DEAKIN,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"We need not object to an appeal to the generosity of the authorities of the States; but the honourable mem-, ber is virtually soliciting a subscription, while holding a pistol at the head of those great gene- from whom he asks it. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Not a pistol, only a collection box. ' Mr DEAKIN _ This Wild West method of collection, to which we are not accustomed, may become necessary when the Government's paper money is in circulation, if we wish to get gold for our notes. The State receipts from January to July, 1910, will be left very small. This Bill secures stability for the finances of the Commonwealth and the States for the next ten years; and I welcome warmly the assurance of the Prime Minister that, although it will be within the power of Parliament to amend the measure at any time, and in any particular, there is no intention to alter it for that period. He. has given a deliberate pledge, not only for this, but for future Parliaments, during the period for which the measure will operate. Although that assurance was unnecessary, so far as honourable members are concerned, it is valuable and effective so far as the public is concerned, because witliout it they might be misled. The Prime Minister laid a proper emphasis on this understanding.",37
208,Mr WH IRVINE,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"I do not think that his words went so far as the honourable member suggests. This, like any other measure, may be altered if the necessities of the Commonwealth require it.",37
209,Mr DEAKIN,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"Nothin g short, of a cataclysm, such as cannot be foreseen or provided against, would justify any party in proposing an alteration of the measure.",37
210,Mr WH IRVINE,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,No personal pledge can bind the Parliament.,37
211,Mr DEAKIN,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,The necessities which would justify an alteration would be so extreme as to be almost unthinkable.,37
212,Mr WEST,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,They might arise in time of war.,38
213,Mr DEAKIN,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"In time of war, all legislation is liable, tp be treated, on gency, as mere printed paper.",38
214,Mr ARCHIBALD,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,This measure is equivalent to a treaty between two States.,38
215,Mr DEAKIN,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"A treaty between two States may be broken by one of them; but it is incredible that representatives Of the same nation would be guilty of such a breach of national faith. Therefore, I not only welcome the Prime Minister's statement, but am adding on my own behalf, and on behalf of most honourable members-if not all-o n this side of the House, that we, too, recognise in this Bill a fixed and final settlement of this nnancial issue for die next ten years. We take it to be the will of the people, which we are here putting into effect, and we put it into effect without any concealment of its purpose. Indeed, we repudiate as quite beyond the horizon of practical politics, any departure from the agreement now solemnly made. - Mr WH IRVINE (Flinders) [5.31]. - The only reason why I interjected when the Leader of the Opposition was speaking was to. convey what seems to my mind the true position with regard to a Bill of this kind. I have always maintained that we ought not to take away from ourselves any powers which the Constitution has vested in us. But I fully admit this : that there is a considerable difference between a Bill of this kind and an ordinary Act of Parliament, which, on the face of it, contemplates the possibility of change whenever the convenience or the advantage of the public may - from time to lime require it. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition when he says that we ought to give the assuranceand we do by passing this Bill give the assurance-to the States that we contemplate nothing within the horizon of practical politics, to use the language of the Leader of the Opposition, which will be likely to induce us to alter the terms of this measure. That is the strongest declaration of intention that we can make. But I decline to go further than that, and to consider that there can be anything in the nature of a pledge binding the conscience of any member of this House with regard to what may be the case should the ultimate necessities of the - Commonwealth require a change. I do not think the matter can be put higher than that. With regard to the Bill itself, I entirely coincide with what the Leader of the Opposition said as to the extraordinary nature of the form in which it is brought before the House. If we are asked to legislate-as we are asked to legislate- as from : emer- the ist of January next-that , I take it, will be admitted is the effect of our legislation-wh y should we not, in express terms, legislate as from the ist January? Why should we, ou the face of this Bill, hold out a direct challenge to the States to contest the constitutionality of it?",38
216,Mr FENTON,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,Is not the Bill an olive branch ?,38
217,Mr WH IRVINE,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"I do not regard it as such, as I shall show. We have had considerable discussion as to the effect of the Financial Agreement. One thing, however, I think, may be said, and that is that that agreement had all the elements of an agreement; but it is not really fair for the Prime Minister to attempt to rely upon any stipulation having been pu4 forward on one side of that agreement, in view of the fact that the essence of it has been repudiated by his own party. I do not think that the Prime Minister can rely upon that, and say that, because the State Governments were prepared to give Up a portion of what they considered to be their nnancial rights, or were prepared to abate to some extent what they considered to be their financial necessities, in order to obtain what they considered constitutional, security for the payment to them-that, , when they did not get that security, we are in a position to turn round and say, "" You. admitted that this sum was enough for' you."" I think that when a bargain is off, it is definitely off, and ought not to be referred to again.",38
218,Mr CHANTER,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,There is no necessity to make a bargain.,38
219,Mr WH IRVINE,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"There is not, and I have always contended that it is the function of this Parliament to decide what is a fair adjustment of the finances. If the Prinie Minister had couched the Bill in the form it would naturally have taken, seeing that we are going to legislate as from the ist January next, see the remarkable result which would have followed. When we look at this measure I think it becomes apparent why this extraordinary method of drafting has been adopted. I am going to paraphrase the Bill and to put it in the form in which it would have been drafted had the true constitutional form been adopted. We are not legislating for the next six months-for which we have no power to legislate-bu t for the six months of the new financial year commencing on: the ist January next, for which we have power. What form would that legislation take if we stated the true purpose? take it that it would read somewhat as follows :- "" Whereas we are, during the ensuing six months, obliged to return to the States three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue, but whereas we have determined that we are going to adopt a system of paying 25s. per head as the basis of future payments; therefore we are going to make the payment from the ist January next so much less than 25s. per head as to make an average of 25s. for the whole financial year."" Not only are we going to do that which will reduce the payment for the time during which we have power to legislate to an amount very much less than 25s. per head, but we are saying that, having diminished the payment to very much less than 25s. a year, we are now going to take from that reduced minimum a sum of £450,000 to make up for the deficiency which was created in last year's finances under the control of the Federal Parliament. What are the figures? I speak subject to correction from the Treasurer and his officers, because I am only going to give thefigureswhich I have had an opportunity of taking out within the last few moments. I take it, from the returns which have been placed in my hands, that the total returns of revenue from Customs and Excise would give an average returnable to the States as their three-fourthsif the Braddon section continued in operation-of £8,803,000. We are obliged to pay at that rate for the rest of this half year. Assuming the same return from Customs and Excise, we shall be obliged to pay to the States £4,400,000 up to the end of this current year; that is, up to 31st December. Now, what is the proposal of the Government? The proposal is that we shall start now to pay to the States 25s. per head, and that we shall deduct from the last half of the financial year the amount necessary to bring the payments to the States down to an average of 25s. per head. Assuming our population to be, in rough numbers, 4,300,000, the total amount we propose to pay to the States during the next financial year is £5,375,000. But being obliged to pay them under the Constitution during the half of the financial year £4,400,000, we only leave to them £935,000 as a payment during the second six months. That is, we propose to pay to them during the second half of the financial year considerably less than £1,000,000. And, mark, having reduced their minimum in the second I half of the year to the sum of £935,000, we proceed to take away £450,000 out of that to make up for the deficiency in the Commonwealth finances last year, leaving the total sum payable to them during the six months at £485,000.",38
220,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,And they say how generous !,39
221,Mr WISE,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,So it is.,39
222,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,They will say anything.,39
223,Mr WH IRVINE,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"I do not know exactly what form of generosity it is. It seems to me to savour a little too much of that kind of financial buccaneering which was initiated by the Treasurer a few days ago by taking £50,000 out of the Trust Funds.",39
224,Mr FISHER,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,Perhaps the honourable member would not have the courage to do that.,39
225,Mr WH IRVINE,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"It is usually called by another name in the Law Courts. I think it becomes sufficiently apparent why this extraordinary form was adopted in drafting the Bill. It was to cover up what obviously would have become apparent-no t the generosity, but the extraordinary parsimony of this proposal, and the extraordinary position in which it will place the States in the second half of the financial year. I do not propose to criticise the actual merits of the proposal, but I think it would have r-ome a good deal better if the Treasurer had boldly .said, "" We are going to legislate for a scheme to commence on ist January, 1911, and frcm that time forward we propose to have a system for the payment of 25s. per the head, but for the first half-year we intend to take away the whole."" That is what it practically comes to. It may be generous or it may not be. I am not prepared at the present moment to criticise that until I learn more about the Treasury figures, which no doubt will be presented by-and-by. But it is a most extraordinary way in which to present to Parliament a Bill of this extreme magnitude and importance. _ Mr CHANTER - Will not the States be in a better position under this proposal first than they would have been under their own agreement?",39
226,Mr WH IRVINE,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"I am not going to say anything about that agreement, but it is quite unfair to use the argument against the States, "" Well, you agreed to give up so much "" when we deprive them of the consideration for giving that up. It was considered a matter of immense importance to the States that they should acquire a constitutional guarantee. They have not got the guarantee. Honourable members ought to wipe the slate as far as the agreement is concerned, and approach the subject from the stand-point of what is fair. As regards the general position, I cordially agree with the Leader of the Opposition that it will be of immense advantage to the Commonwealth and to the States, too, that some reasonable permanent arrangement for a considerable period should be arrived at. By the remarks I have made, I do not want to raise any criticism which is not founded on justice.",39
227,Mr FISHER,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,I shall be very glad to hear it.,40
228,Mr WH IRVINE,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"If we plainly put the position before the States now, if we say that at the end of the half-year we intend to practically reduce their amounts to a trifle for the rest of the year, they may be in a position at once to curtail their expenses so as to meet the necessity which is placed upon them. But I should have thought that it would have been better, not only to put the thing in plain, distinct language before the States, but if honourable members are going to further reduce the payment by such a considerable sum as £450,000, to adopt a scheme which would have spread the deduction over a greater time than months in which it will be in operation.",40
229,Mr FAIRBAIRN,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"Fawkner) [5.45] I desire to refer to the probable attitude which the State Premiers will adopt when they see what is promised to them. The Prime Minister appears to think that they will be very naughty boys indeed if they do not think that they are getting something really good under this method of settlement. But I would remind him that when the arrangement was arrived at in the celebrated Conference there was nothing in the air about a note issue which would trespass on (he State funds to the extent of £80,000 a year. There was also nothing in the air about that which I suppose will become a concrete fact before very long. There was nothing said about the Federal Parliament intending to trench their sphere of direct taxation.",40
230,Mr CHANTER,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,The States knew that very well.,40
231,Mr FAIRBAIRN,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,I do not think that it was pretty well known when the Conference met.,40
232,Mr CHANTER,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"Yes , it was.",40
233,Mr FATRBAIRN,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"In my opinion, it was not considered. I think that the position of things has totally changed; and we shall find that the Premiers 'are not at all satisfied with this method of settlement. I believe that when the public consider that the States are to lose a revenue of £80,000 a year by the issue of Commonwealth notes, and that a great portion of their power of direct taxation is also to be taken away, they will wonder where they are. Any ordinary man of business, placed in die position of the Premiers, would have the greatest difficulty in financing the States under the proposed conditions. No doubt we shall hear a great deal from those gentlemen. I shall be very much surprised if we do not. Without a Conference between the Prime Minister and the Premiers, I do not think it is possible that we can satisfactorily adjust matters. The State and the Federal spheres of influence concern the snme people. I hope to see ihe Premiers and the Prime Minister - cordially working together. Otherwise, I feel sure that we shall witness continualfluctuationson this question. I have already pointed out two matters which have come about since the Premiers' Conference was held. I feel satisfied that it will not be possible for the Premiers to carry on the financial undertakings of their States, which are most important to their people, unless tliere is harmonious co-operation between them and the first six the Federal authority.",40
234,Mr CHANTER,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"Riverina) [5.48] The criticisms which have been directed against the principle of the Bill have been very mild, and I hope that they will continue so. It has been suggested by the honourable member for Flinders, who has been supported by the last speaker, that the Bill will do some injustice to die States, and conflict with the principles laid down by their Premiers. And a great deal of attention, it is hoped, will be directed to the fact that its operation is not to commence in its entirety until the ist January, 1911, and that the State Premiers will be told that the Commonwealth proposes to give them 25s. a head, their own choice, less £ 4 5 0 , 0 0 0.",40
235,Mr DEAKIN,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"I assure the honourable member that it was not their choice, but their necessity.",40
236,Mr CHANTER,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,We have not yet hail an opportunity of knowing what was done.,40
237,Mr DEAKIN,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,Yes ; the honourable member has been told this over and over again.,40
238,Mr CHANTER,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"We have not yet had an opportunity of knowing what did take place in the secret Conference. My complaint in the last Parliament was that the Conference was held in secret, and that the members of the House were not taken into the confidence of the parties to the agreement, and really knew nothing of what had transpired. On that occasion, the minority did not forget-and all honour to Australia that they did not-that underlying the proposal was an attempt on the part of the Premiers to dominate the nation by taking, mately, sole control of the purse. What they wanted was not so much the 25s. per capita for today or tomorrow or next year, as to fix the provision in the Constitution in such a way that it would be an almost absolute impossibility ever lo remove it, because its inclusion would defy the people's will to remove it, seeing that a majority of the States, as well as a majority of.the people as a whole would be required. That: was the whole trouble. We know what the financial position of certain of the States is, and that it must remain so for a certain time. It would be only human nature for those States to refuse to go against their own financial interests for a considerable time to come, and to refuse therefore to allow the Constitution to be altered in order to hand back again to the Federal Parliament, as representing the whole people, the powers which the States desired to take away from it. At the Premiers' Conference, as the Commonwealth was faced with a probable deficit for the financial year of £1,200,000, through relieving the States of expenditure on old-age pensions, it was suggested by the States, in their generosity, that the Commonwealth Government should agree to give them 25s. per head, and embody that agreement in the Constitution, and that then they should allow the Commonwealth to deduct £600,000, or one-half the estimated deficit, from the payments to them for the financial year just closed. The deficit, fortunately, is not so large as was estimated by the right honourable member for Swan, but still there is a deficit, which has been caused through the Commonwealth relieving the States of. an expenditure of £900,000 per annum on old-age pensions. All that the States are now asked to do for the remainder of the current financial year is to put the Commonwealth in a solvent position by allowing a deduction of £450,000 to be made. I was glad to hear the true national note sounded this afternoon in the statement that, in sanctioning the Federal Constitution, the people never intended this Parliament to bargain with the States. They simply said, "" We have no experience, and nothing to guide us for the first ten years as to what our national and State necessities will be. Let the Federal Parliament return a certain proportion of the revenue to the States for ten years, and then, after that experience, the Federal Parliament, which we have created to deal with us in our ultinational capacity, can make what fresh arrangements it pleases, not by an agreement with the State Premiers, but as it thinks will be most beneficial to us in both our national and State capacities."" Our proposition now practically is to relieve the States of the obligation to pay £150,000 of the £600,000 which they last year agreed to pay, and to limit the period of the per capita payments to ten years. I am in favour of the principles of the Bill, and will support it, but I told my constituents, and they shared my feeling very strongly, that there should be no fixed period as to any arrangement for the return of money to the States. The matter should go from Parliament to Parliament by a simple Act, which can be altered if the people of the future demand it and the necessities of the case require it. Looking ahead to the national necessities and the immense amount of expenditure that must take place, I have very grave fears that; long before the ten years' period has elapsed, the people will see the necessity for their National Parliament controlling a much larger proportion of the Customs and Excise revenue than it can at present. As a Protectionist, I hope to see effective Protection established permanently in Australia, but in that case the Customs revenue must decline. If then our revenues are to decline and our necessities to increase year by year, I cannot look with favour upon the ten years' period. I recognise, however, as the honourable member for Flinders put it, that, no matter what period we insert in the Act, if the necessities of the case demand it in the future, the Act can be amended, because the needs of the people must be the first consideration with their representatives in the National Parliament. The honourable member for Fawkner and others spoke of the opinions of the Premiers. There are Premiers and Premiers. When Federation was initiated, I fondly hoped that the Premiers would work in accord and harmony with the National Parliament, but my hopes were disappointed. Unfortunately, with one or two notable exceptions, particularly in South Australia, the* State Premiers have been bitterly hostile to the National Parliament. Instead of trying to work in accord with it, they have done everything they possibly could to create discord and friction, and in every way to try to gain back for the States the powers which the people deliberately took away from them years ago. We read with pain day after day the statements made by some of the Premiers, and the honourable member .for Flinders should know that, even if the Prime Minister went out of his way to try to bring it about, he would find it impossible to get into harmonious working relations with some of them. In today's Herald, published in this city, there appears a statement by Mr Murray, the Premier of Victoria. It would be unfair to class him as bitterly hostile to the National power, but I have noted on several occasions that he too is trying to cling to those powers which he thinks'the States have been deprived of. .However, this is what he is reported to have said to-dayThe Premier (Mr Murray) referring today to the Financial Relations Bill into the House of Representatives, said that it embodied really the same proposals as the Financial Agreement, except that ""ten years"" was substituted for "" perpetuity."" The States would be noworse off for ten years than they would have been under the Financial Agreement, and as the Federal Government, with its majority in Parliament, was the master of the situation, what could the States do? The deduction of the ^450,000"", representing the monwealth deficit last year, from what was coming to the States this nnancial year was cordance with his expectations. Had the cial Agreement been adopted, the States would have had to pay the same amount out of last year's revenue. That is exactly corroborative of my statement. I admit that die crux of the position was the proposal to embody the Financial Agreement in the Constitution when it would have been immensely difficult, if not impossible, to take it out again. apart from that, if the State Premiers are honest, they will admit that they are in a better position financially today, be in a better position at the close CTf*the' present nnancial year, than they would have been under the terms of the Financial Agreement to which they were parties. I intend to set a good example, because think there should not be any lengthy bate on a Bill of this kind. We had the presentative should emphasize. Mr Chanter. complimait from the Leader of the Opposition that it was proper that this measure should have been introduced as the first measure proposed by the present Government. I hope that it will be passed, and I hope that the State Premiers will recognise that this Parliament, representing the national feeling in Australia, has no desire to interfere unduly with the financial position of the States. At the same time, we believe that our first duty is to the people of Australia as a whole, and that it is necessary that we should retain sufficient of the revenue derived from the taxation of the people to meet national requirements.",41
239,Mr FOWLER,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"Perth) [6.2] - The Prime Minister, when speaking on this measure, was good enough to try to relieve' my mind as to the disabilities which Western Australia might suffer under it, but I wish to say that the honourable gentleman did not touch the objection I have to the measure. My objection to it was revealed in the speech of the honourable member for Flinders. Western Australia has always contributed the largest per capita amount of Customs revenue, and under the measure before us, that State will stand to lose the largest per capita amount.",42
240,Mr FISHER,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,That is quite inaccurate; but the honourable member does not mean just introduced that I know.,42
241,Mr FOWLER,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"In this connection I cannot help wondering what is the position of those representatives of Labour who have come from Western Australia to this Parliament. During the last election campaign every one' of them assured the people of that State that Western AustraComlia would get as good terms from a Labour in acMinistry as those offered by the previous Finan- Liberal Government. One honourable member went so far as to say that his principal objection to the proposals of the Liberal Government was that they were not nearly so good as a Labour Government would be prepared to give the State. The Prime Minister did not make any reference to the position of Western Australia under clause 5 of this Bill. He did not give us any But, idea of what it would mean in L.s.d. to that State if this measure were adopted.",42
242,Mr KELLY,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"Wester n Australia will lose and will' £ 9 8 6 , 0 0 0 . -- Mr FOWLER - We all know thai that t State'will-lose a very considerable sum. I consider that the loss which will accrue to that State from the method of finance proI posed by the present Prime Minister is a dematter which every Western Australian reThey should remind the people of the State from which they come that there are members in the Labour Government at the present time who have been practically pledged to give that State something altogether different from what is now being put before us in this Bill.",42
243,Mr GLYNN,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"Angas) [6.5] - I do not - think there is any doubt that the real difference of opinion last year between opposing parties in this Parliament was as to whether the proposed payment of 25s. should be fixed in the Constitution, subject to the power of the people to alter it by referendum on our initiative, or extend over somefixedperiod variously stated at twenty-five years, twenty years, and ten years. I think that the policy of the party which the Prime Minister leads so well was that expressed at the Brisbane Labour Conference. - So far as I could understand the terms of the somewhat ambiguous resolutions come to by that Conference, the policy was, not that the terms of the proposal should be embodied in the Constitution, because I do not think that was meant, but that there - should be a fixed payment apportioned fer cafita amongst the States, which it was estimated would come to about 25s. per head of the population.",43
244,Mr FISHER,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,A little over 24s.,43
245,Mr GLYNN,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"In round figures, with .the Western Australian allowance, 25s. 'The point of the resolutions, to my mind, was that the amount of the payment was to be based upon the actual experience of a period which would terminate at the close - of 1910. I think it was said that we might very well take a period of average years ending at the close of the financial - year 1910) and that would involve the commencement of the proposed payment at the expiration of the operation of the Braddon section; that is to say, at the beginning of - next year. Not a word is to be found in what I may describe as the then official programme of the Labour party as to any - reduction from the amount to be thus ascertained. It was to be a payment estimated at about 25s. per head, to commence from the ist January of next year. On what ground does the Prime Minister now depart from what the people, whose voice we all reverence, assumed would be the alternative adopted by the Labour party in - case the. Financial Agreement was rejected ? The Financial Agreement has been rejected, and we have now before us the policy of the Labour party. As to the precise nature of the terms of the Brisbane Conference proposals there was some difference of opinion amongst the members of the Conference. The State members interpreted its terms in one way and Federal members interpreted them in another. In any references I have made to the matter from the platform, I have always adopted the interpretation of the Federal members of that Conference, and I say now that it is rather unfair to the electors who sent the Labour party into power that there should be at the. very initiation of the financial policy of the party, a departure from what the - people legitimately thought would be the alternative to the rejection of the Financial Agreement. I leave it to honourable members opposite to justify the departure to their constituents. There is another matter to which I should like to refer. There is no reason, because the £600,000 was to be deducted, why we should make a deduction to the amount of the deficit.' It was part of the understanding, whether rightly come to or not. There might be a difference of opinion as to whether we should or should not have included any provision about the £600,000 to cover the period of six months, but it was part of the consideration that the six States, three of which had not established any system of old-age pensions at all, would contribute towards the £600,000. The six States agreed to contribute, but only three were relieved of the obligation to pay old-age pensions. The three smaller States did not have a local system of old age pensions in force, but they fell in with the proposition in consideration of the fixity of the agreement.",43
246,Mr FISHER,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,Old-ag e pensions were being paid in those States.,43
247,Mr GLYNN,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,They were being paid in only three of the States.,43
248,Mr FISHER,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"When the Financial Agreement was made, people in every State were receiving old-age pensions uncler the Commonwealth Act. That, so to speak, ""knocked the bottom"" out of the whole thing. Mr 'GLYNN - If it did, the agreement to contribute the £600,000 ought never to have been entered into. Why, therefore, iloes the Prime Minister ask that thatarrangement shall practically be carried out now ?",43
249,Mr FISHER,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,I shall explain when I reply.,43
250,Mr GLYNN,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"My contention is that the three smaller States undertook to join with the other States in making a contribution of £600,000 towards making good the estimated deficit, not because they were released, under the agreement, from an obligation to pay old-age pensions, but in order to secure the benefit of permanency so far as it could be secured by the insertion of the agreement in the Constitution.",43
251,Mr ROBERTS,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,This shows that we ought to have had a report of the proceedings at the Conference. Some of the State Premiers make a statement quite contrary to that put forward by the honourable member.,44
252,Mr GLYNN,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"Who cares what is said by this Premier, or that, in regard to the Conference? We can be guided only by the resolutions. One of the first principles of interpretation of an Act of Parliament is that a Court is to look not at what is said by members of Parliament but at what they resolve.",44
253,Mr ROBERTS,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"The honourable member is giving us the reasons why the State Premiers came to a conclusion in regard to the contribution of £600,000.",44
254,Mr GLYNN,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,I am dealing with the resolution.,44
255,Mr ROBERTS,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,The honourable member is telling us what actuated the Premiers in coming to that conclusion.,44
256,Mr GLYNN,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"I have not said a word about motives. I am simply dealing with the terms.of the resolution, which has been published, and which forms part of the data upon which we. arrived at a decision last year. The State Premiers in Conference decided that, in consideration of three of the States being released from obligations incurred with respect to the ment of old-age pensions, a reduction, amounting in the aggregate to £600,000, might be made from the amount returnable to them towards making good the estimated deficit for the year. That meant, of course, that if there were no deficit, that reduction should not be made; but we made an alteration by Act of Parliament, and made the provision absolute. The Prime Minister is not justified by any promise made under different conditions by three of the States, which were under no obligation, and had not been relieved of any, in relation to the payment of old-age pensions, in proposing now to make this deduction. It happens that the three smaller States were the vicarious sufferers the Commonwealth Tariff of 1002. I do not wish to repeat the arguments-althoug h I had them expressed in different figuresthat have been given by the honourable member for Flinders as regards the effect of this arrangement, but little Tasmania, which has received no relief so far as the payment of old-age pensions is concerned, by the Commonwealth's assumption of the responsibility with regard to the payment of those pensions, was the biggest vicarious sufferer under the Commonwealth Tariff of 1902.",44
257,Mr TUDOR,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,Did it not obtain some advantage by the establishment of a Commonwealth system of old-age pensions?,44
258,Mr GLYNN,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"All the States are now enjoying the Commonwealth system, but three of them have been relieved of their annual expenditure in relation to their State systems of old-age pensions.",44
259,Mr TUDOR,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,Simpl y because they recognised their obligations in that respect.,44
260,Mr GLYNN,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,But what is that to do with the question of the bargain?,44
261,Mr JENSEN,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"The honourable member wishes to give the States to which he refers special treatment, because they did not carry out their obligations to the people in respect of old-age pensions.",44
262,Mr GLYNN,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"It is unnecessary to reply to ithat interjection. The smaller States, which are not relieved of any obligation in respect of the payment of old age pensions, have been the biggest sufferers under the Customs Tariff Act of 1902. In the very first year of its operation, Tasmania lost £162,000 as compared with its revenue in 1900, from its own Tariff. I believe that if the record since then is followed up, it will be found that the figures relating to Tasmania show a pay- continual, though diminishing, loss as against 'the position it might have assumed under its somewhat wide Tariff, which covered about 91 - per cent, of its total imports. That is the position. As to Western Australia, we had to make certain provision for the extraordinary - per capita results there, and tiiat special provision expired about three years ago.",44
263,Mr FISHER,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,The honourable member is quite in error in suggesting that Tasmania's returns have been gradually going down.,44
264,Mr GLYNN,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"I know that her losses have been less since 1902-3. But at a time under when there was an actual increase of £778,000 in the revenue of the six States, as compared with their receipts from Customs and Excise prior to the introduction of a uniform Tariff, Tasmania itself suffered considerably.",44
265,Mr FISHER,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,Queensland' s returns fell in a greater ratio.,45
266,Mr GLYNN,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"I shall deal presently with Queensland's compensations. South Australia is losing about. £20,000 a year by reason of the abolition of its special Tariff for the Northern Territory. Before the uniform Tariff came into operation South Australia had in force certain special rates of duties in respect of commodities, and particularly rice, in general consumption in the Northern Territory. Under that Tariff it would have been receiving about £30,600 per annum more than it has received under the uniform Tariff. At all events, when the Commonwealth Tariff was brought into force there was at once a drop of £20,000 a year in respect of the duties on those commodities. South Australia is also losing owing to the competition of the Pacific Cable Board with'the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company, which used our transcontinental line far more than any other. The State from which I come is thus losing something like £15,000 or £16,000 a year in connection with the telegraph rates.",45
267,Mr FISHER,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,Is not the loss to which the honourable member has just referred debited to the Northern Territory?,45
268,Mr GLYNN,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"No ; it is an absolute loss. By entering into small details show much larger figures, but in dealing with a Bill of this kind, I do not wish to go into details. I am referring to a few broad financial considerations. Queensland has been relieved of the burden of old-age pensions, and there can be no doubt that it did suffer a certain drop in its return per capita on the introduction of the uniform Tariff. If I am not mistaken, however, that has practically been cancelled. It was about £ 3 4s. Mi . GROOM - And it fell, roughly, to £ 3 3S",45
269,Mr GLYNN,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"There was a big drop, vvhich has not altogether been recouped, Queensland has been fairly well supported financially by the Commonwealth Parliament. One of its chief policies was in relation to sugar. I find that in 1907-8 the Customs and Excise receipts from sugar amounted to £770,000, while the bounty paid to Queensland and New South Wales growers totalled £577,000, leaving a net revenue, chiefly brought about by compensation to the so-called vested interest in Kanakas of £193,000. That will be the measure of the loss suffered under this policy in normal years. I say in normal years because, when the crop fails, as it has done on one or two occasions, the amount received in revenue from the import duties must go up. On the whole, there is a sacrifice in connection with the Kanaka policy. I voted for the exclusion of the Kanakas, but not for compensation to vested interests. The policy does mean a loss of at least £500,000 a year, and it is a policy that ought never to have been initiated by Queensland. It will be found that I am justified in saying that the States which, on a ground which has disappeared, are now asked to contribute to the deficit are the States that have received the least consideration in connection with the finances. The Commonwealth is in a belter position now than when the Treasurer made his Estimate last year, seeing that there has been an increase of over £ 1 , oeo, 000 in the revenue of the Department of Trade and Customs and of the Post ancl Telegraph Department. Surely it ought not to be beyond the financial ability of the Treasurer to find some means of meeting the deficit, because, if the Prime Minister's policy had been carried out last year, he must have had to face a bigger liability than that now before, him.",45
270,Mr FISHER,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"The honourable member is in error; last year was started with a credit I could °f £ 7 0 0 , 0 0 0 .",45
271,Mr DEAKIN,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"But there was the obliga-' tion to pay old-age pensions, which ate up the credit balance.",45
272,Mr GLYNN,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"Las t year there was a deficit of about £1,800,000, but we got £600,000 promised from the States.",45
273,Mr FISHER,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"The Government last year, when they started, hacl credit for £700,000 in the Trust Funds.",45
274,Mr GLYNN,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"The amount in the Trust Funds was £650,000, and, even after taking into account the £600,000 to be given by the States, there was still a deficit of £600,000 to be faced this year. The but Treasurer, however, on the Supplementary Estimates, explained that the revenue was coming in by leaps and bounds; and since then the increase has been the same, to the extent, as I have said, of over £1,000,000 in the Department of Trade and Customs ancl the Post and Telegraph Department.",45
275,Mr FISHER,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"If the Government last year' started with a credit of over £600,000, and left with a deficit .of nearly £600,000, that makes us actually £1,200,000 worse off.",45
276,Mr GLYNN,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"Las t year we anticipated a big deficit, which was notrealized experience, and this year there is the small deficit of £ 4 4 7 , 0 0 0 .",46
277,Mr FISHER,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,That is last year's debreak ficit.,46
278,Mr GLYNN,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"It may be that this year, as last year, the revenue will be better anticipated.",46
279,Mr FISHER,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,There will be an end to that.,46
280,Mr GLYNN,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"I do not believe it. Though I did not speak on the question, 1 went exhaustively into the figures, and only possible justification for such an would be if a wider period were taken than has been mentioned. At all events, there was no anticipation that for five six years the revenue would drop seriously below the figures of last year. The estipledged mate given - was £ 2 8s. 6d. per the head for 1910-11, or a little less than the actual result for 1909-10; and I do not think the Treasurer is likely to be in "" Queer Street"" if he does not get this money from the States. In view of the fact that the three States have mentioned are receiving no consideraperiodicity tion, there is no justification for not ing the payment of 25s. per head date, the Labour party proclaimed, from 1st January, 1911.",46
281,Mr KELLY,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"Wentworth) [6.27] - Perhaps the most instructive speech in the course of this debate was not the speech with the most matter in it, but the speech which gave most cause for reflection. refer to the speech of the honourable ber for Riverina, which simply bristled with give-a-ways of the party to which belongs. The' honourable member referre to the irrevocability of the Financial a period of ten years.

As a result of listennld ing to the honourable member, I have come were opposed. to differentiate between the pledges by honourable members opposite to the country, and the pledges made to their colby leagues' machinery in this Chamber. It is not safe to violate a Labour plank;. though it appears to be absolutely safe to a promise to the electors. I wish to know, in the first place, how far honourable members opposite are free to follow the than Prime Minister in regard to the agreement now under consideration?",46

283,Mr KELLY,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"There is a clause in the the Bill which lays it down that the measureidea shall have a lasting period of ten years and I think I am at liberty to inquire what chance the Government and the House haveor of passing that proposal.

284,Mr KELLY,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"When the sitting was susI pended, 1 was addressing myself to theof the proposed arrangement,, makand was endeavouring to show the diffias culty which' some honourable members will, experience in reconciling their duty to theelectors with their duty to the Government, which they are supporting. It has alwaysstruck me that it is merely beating the air to attempt to define irrevocably any particular, period during which the proposed, I agreement shall be operative. The first memgreat war into which this country is unhappily plunged, will, by its merehe existence, destroy any such financial 1 arrangement as is now proposed for Some of the > supporters of the Ministry are, apparently, a difficulty as to the term over which the proposed agreement should extend. One it section of them is singularly unhappily it placed in this regard. The representatives Western Australia, to a man, pledged themselves to support the agreement for a years. They did not idly hit upon that particular term because they thought that twenty-five years was preferable to twenty-four, but in order that they might show the electors of that State that, where its interests were concerned, they were prepared to deal with it as liberally' it would have been dealt with under the Financial' Agreement to which they That agreement offered made Western Australia a special grant of £250,000 annually, which sum was to decrease automatically by £10,000 a year In other words, the special grant to enable Western Australia to meet her nnancial exigencies was to terminate in twenty-five years. The Labour party, in order to appear as keenly alive to* the financial interests of that State as was the party to which I have the honour to belong, declared that they favoured an agreement which would be binding on the Commonwealth for a term of twenty-five years. What are these honourable members going to do now ? We are told that the Government which they are supporting favours a limitation of the agreement to ten years.",46
285,Mr WEST,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,The honourable member need not worry about us at all.,47
286,Mr KELLY,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"I am not worrying about the honourable member, who comes from a place'which is very much nearer to me than is Western Australia. The representatives of tiiat State must either keep their public pledges or stand falsified before their constituents.

289,Mr SPEAKER,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"It was not merely the use of the words "" caucus whip "" which induced me to call the honourable member to order, but the fact that he is following a line of argument which has no relevance whatever to the proposed Financial Agreement.

290,Mr KELLV,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"I submit that I am dealing with the biggest general principle of the measure, namely, its periodicity.

293,Mr SPEAKER,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,Order ! Will the honourable member deal with the question - that is before the Chair?,47
294,Mr KELLY,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,I propose to do so. - Mr FISHER - It is a case of youth and anger going together.,47
295,Mr KELLY,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"No . But there are such things as old age and mental intemperance. I commend the Prime Minister for exercising control over his feelings in a very trying situation. I wish to point out that it is necessary to condition the proposed agreement with a twenty-five years' period, if the representatives of Western Australia are to fulfil their pledges to the electors. Such a condition is only unessential if their pledges in another respect and their necessities of another nature, compel them to play false to the people who have sent them here. If they stand firmly for a limitation of the agreement to twenty-five years, which I submit is in the best interests of Western Australia, and if the provision relating to that period goes by the board, the Prime Minister will be afforded a choice between exhibiting the "" courage "" to break his word and having the decency to keep it. I am now referring to his promise to the people of Australia, that if returned to power he would endeavour to secure legislative sanction to an arrangement which would give some sort of financial stability to the six States of the Commonwealth. How does this question 'affect Western Australia? If honourable members opposite will make a mental calculation they will find that the arrangement proposed in this Bill will give to Western Australia a sum of £, )°5°J00O in addition to the 25s. per 2 head. But under the scheme propounded by the late Government after consultation with the Premiers, that State would have received £3,030,000 in addition to the 25s. per capita. In other words, if the representatives of Western Australia go back upon their pledges that State will con- lose no less a sum than £980,000. I address these remarks to the Western Australian representatives in order that they may see where their duty lies in considering a matter of such vast importance. I have no desire to canvass the arguments which have already been advanced in regard to the particular form in which the Government have thought it their duty to introduce this Bill. The honourable member for Bass stated, by interjection this afternoon, that the three States which had not paid old-age pensions ought to receivevery scant consideration from us in connection with this financial arrangement because they had failed to discharge their duty to the electors in that regard. The honourable member, I think, may have some weight behind his argument. My only regret is that two of the States out of the three which have failed to pay old-age pensions, are two out of the three States which have ever had Labour Administrations.",47
296,Mr ARCHIBALD,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,What about the Legislative Councils in tliose States ?,48
297,Mr KELLY,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"My honourable friends have an excuse for everything! But I do not wish to be led away from my line of argument, and thus transgress the Standing Orders. As you know, sir, I am one of the most faithful observers of our Standing Orders, and I do not wish to give you cause to intervene for any breach of them. In my judgment the attitude which each honourable member ought to adopt towards this question is that neither of a Commonwealth, nor of a State Rights man. Both phrases are objectionable. We should all regard ourselves as trustees for the Australian people, a higher title than that of members of the Federal Parliament.",48
298,Mr WEST,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,We cannot serve two masters.,48
299,Mr KELLY,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"The people who vote at the Federal are the same as those who vote at the State elections, constituting one governing entity. The Constitution gives us vast financial powers, as it were in a trust deed. After this year we may make what financial arrangements we please. These powers are not to be abused. We must seek, not only the well-being of the particular authority of which we form a part, but that of the people as a whole. While we may disagree as to whether the Commonwealth or State agencies should control this or that public utility, we must not endeavour to enhance the importance of our .position by ;any action which will be detrimental to the well-being of the people whom we have been elected to represent.",48
300,Mr GB EDWARDS,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"North Sydney) [7.57] - The introduction of the Bill at this early stage of the session reflects credit on the Government. Ministers are entitled to credit also for carrying out their electioneering promises, though, as I interjected when the Prime Minister was speaking, the provisions of the measure are a queer mixture of generosity and parsimony. The promises made by the Prime Minister and his friends are being kept in some respects and broken in others. political party now in power here promised that if it gained a majority at the elections, it would put the States in regard to finance in the position in which they would be put should their opponents be retained in office,- with the exception that the annual payment of 25s. per capita would be provided for, not in the Constitution, but in an Act of Parliament. The Bill, however, does not do what would have been clone had the party with which I have the honour to co-operate obtained a majority. Had it retained power, the States would have received more than it is now proposed to give to them, and the Financial Agreement would have been embodied in the Constitution. Ministers are apparently desirous of lessening the friction between the Commonwealth and the States, but they might have acted generously on one or two points. As things have turned out, I am glad that the Financial Agreement is not to be embodied in the Constitution. Such kaleidoscopic changes in our fiscal system are proposed fhat it is impossible to form a fixed and definite opinion as to the financial relations that should exist between the Commonwealth and the States - When I advocated the embodiment of the Financial. Agreement in the Constitution, I knew that the party of which I am a member did not intend to invade such fields of taxation as income tax and land tax, hitherto left to self- the States. A land tax, whether proposed for the sake of revenue, or to effect social and agrarian reform, must be a heavy impost on the people, and a source of considerable profit to the Government. When the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States was being discussed in the last Parliament-of which I ; had not the honour to be a member- I thought, as I afterwards told the electors, that 25s. per capita was more than the States had a right to expect from the Commonwealth. On that point, I differed from many of my party. I firmly believe that if the Commonwealth were to be restricted for revenue to the imposition of Customs and Excise duties, and the other means of which it has hitherto availed itself, and the States allowed to avail themselves of all other sources of taxation, 25s. per capita would be too much to give to them. Of course, the Constitution does not prohibit the Commonwealth from taxing the people in any .way thought necessary; yet those on this side of the chamber would not invade the fields of taxation which hitherto have been left to the States, and The which can be properly exploited by them in connection with measures of social and land reform. But it having been determined to invade what has hitherto been considered a province of the States, a turn of 25s. fer cafita to them is too little. I am glad that the financial arrangement is not to be embodied in the Constitution, because, while it remains a provision in an the question. Act. it may be re-adjusted from time time, according to the fiscal needs of Commonwealth and the States. Since the beginning of Federation, I have held, frequently expressed, the view that the sooner the btates cease to be dependent on Government party. the Commonwealth for revenue, the better it will be for the economical administration of the affairs of the country. So long the State Treasurers are dependent on the Commonwealth Treasurer, there must be uncertainty as to what revenue they will some respects. have to spend, and less inclination to cise the strict economy which the taxpayers have a right to expect. Therefore, any measure finally determining the relation the Commonwealth with the States must be hailed by me with a certain amount satisfaction.' The matter was thrashed last year at a Conference attended by presentatives of the Commonwealth and the sions implied in Ihe compromise. States, and a compromise was arrived which was not to be taken section by tion, though the Prime Minister, notwithboard. standing his endeavour to putthe matter before the House so that there could be misunderstanding, implied to the contrary. That compromise was one to be accepted or rejected in its entirety. If not complied with in every respect, it ceased to exist. The representatives of the States conceded a great deal, in order to obtain a permait nent provision of"" 25s- ,fer cafita. desired that this arrangement should embodied in the Constitution, so that could not be interfered with except by alteration of the Constitution. sideration of this, they agreed to make part of the deficiency incurred by the Commonwealth, largely, if not entirely, in relieving some of the States^ of their expenditure on old-age pensions. This also was part of the whole proposal. But the people took the entire compromise as one. They understood most thoroughly the in voting for it that they were voting carry out all the provisions of the compromise-no t only that theFinanand cial Agreement should be embodied in the Constitution, but that they, as taxpayers under the State Governments, should give us a certain amount of money to make good the deficiency of the Commonwealth Government incurred in meeting old-age pensions, and that this new arrangement tion with very great caution indeed. should be carried out before the conclusion reof the operation of the Braddon section of the Constitution. The electors, in their wisdom, threw this compromise aside. There was not a clean party division on It must not be forgotten to by honourable members opposite that very the"" many eminent politicians and leaders on the Labour side in the States held views in and antagonism to those of the Labour members in this House who now constitute the There were men on both sides who did not vote with their party.

Commonwealth easy and an satisfactory, has been thrusting a finanIn concial position upon the States which, at any good rate during the coming year, will be felt to be anything but easy and satisfactory. Under the provisions of this Bill, the States will receive something less than half a million of money in the first six months of next year, after they are subjected to the reductions proposed and have returned to Commonwealth Government the to £450,000 provided for in the schedule. I do not think that it requires any great intimate acquaintance with the details of Statefinanceto know that if the amounts received from the Commonwealth are reduced by £450,000 in the first half of next year, the finances of several, if not of all, the States, will be seriously upset. Therefore, we should approach this quesI know that it is of no use to think of getting the Bill amended. But if the Prime Minister, before this session of Parliament closes, can see some way of modifying the terms and conditions of this Bill, so as to make it not only more acceptable to the States, but a measure which the States will be-better able to put up with so as to make two ends meet, he will be doing a great thing. I do not wish to have any misunderstanding about my feelings on the question of Australian Nationalism. I ara a Nationalist to the core of my heart. I wish to see this Commonwealth Parliament strong within the terms of the Constitution, and exercising every function that the Constitution intrusts to us - exercising them to the fullest. But I do hold with that eminent Treasurer whom we had in charge of our finances in the early days of Federation, Sir George Turner, that we cannot proceed too carefully or too cautiously in regard to the necessities of the States. During the first years, when we are laying down, as it were, the foundations of our future .National Government, we must show a consistent regard for those necessities. Having once fixed the position, and come to that point where we can cut off for ever the financial dependence of States on Commonwealth, and of Commonwealth upon the States, we shall no longer have to consider that point of view. But, during this period of transition, we cannot be too careful, cannot be too cautious, in considering the necessities of the States, upon which the prosperity of the Commonwealth must depend. I only wish to make one further reference to this Bill ; for I am aware that it is of no use to oppose it with any idea of stopping its passage, and probably with very little idea of getting its provisions amended. I should like to refer to clause 6. I am surprised to see it included in a Bill proposed by our friends on the other side, who have taken up such a strong national attitude upon this subject.",48
301,Sir JOHN FORREST,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,l t is in accordance with the Constitution.,50
302,Mr GB EDWARDS,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"1I have had to differ from lawyers before, and I am going to differ from some of them now. I do not believe that the idea underlying this clause is in the Constitution. I have looked at the Constitution carefully, and it seems quite plain to me that the origin of clause 6 is in section 94 of the Constitution, which provides that after the expiration of five years from the imposition of uniform duties, the Parliament-that is, the Commonwealth Parliament-ma y make provision for the return to the States of any surplus revenue. The "" Braddon blot "" section which, strangely enough, precedes this, is section 87, which provides that the Commonwealth can only keep for its own use one-fourth of the revenue derived from Customs and Excise, and must return three-fourths to the States.. If those two sections were transposed, and section 94 was made to come before section 87, one would see the continuity of reasoning which provided first for five years and afterwards for ten. A strong point in favour of the view that I take is that in section 94, upon which clause 6 of this Bill is based, it is said that the Commonwealth ""may"" make provision for the distribution of surplus revenue; but in section 87 - the Braddon section - it is said that the Commonwealth "" shall"" do so. I hesitate to discuss the bearing of these constitutional provisions as a layman when I know that lawyers take opposite views of it, but it seems to me quite plain that sooner or later we must have litigation in the High Court over the clause. It is preventing what I , and many others with me, ultimately hope to accomplish, and that is finality to the dependence of the States on the Commonwealth and vice versd. So long as this provision exists on our statute-book, the States will be perpetually interested in any surpluses which the Commonwealth can create, and the latter will be perpetually interestedin not creating any surpluses.",50
303,Mr WEST,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"Hear , hear; that is""good.",50
304,Mr GB EDWARDS,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"No doubt, with a certain class of Treasurer it is desirable to have no surpluses. It is a bad thing from the taxpayers' point of view to have any surpluses. But in view of verymany National undertakings which cannot be undertaken except in years when we start with a surplus, I think it is a pity that tins clause is to find a place on the statute-book. I believe that if we could do without its enactment we should be very much better off, and, although I express the opinion with that hesitation which a layman should always exhibit when he is dealing with a question on which lawyers differ, it is clear to mv ordinary common sense reasoning that there must be some opportunity for differences of opinion as to the operation of section 94 of the Constitution. I wish that the Government had more fully considered the matter than they probably have done before they introduced the provision into the Bill, and so'saddled the Commonwealth for all time with a mixed kind of financial arrangement between the States and the Commonwealth, which we had hoped to get rid of.",50
305,Mr FISHER,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"If the matter were in deubt, how would the honourable member deal with it?",51
306,Mr GB EDWARDS,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"I would leave out the clause. If the States have anj' legal right under the Constitution they would soon apply to the High Court to get it established. While this clause remains the Commonwealth Government admit their right, and so prevent any reasonable chance of the matter being solved by the High Court. But, to my mind, it is clearly expressed in the Constitution that once we get to the end of the ten years' period, and settle the financial relations tween the States and the Commonwealth, we need not go back to section 94, which simply provides for the distribution of the surplus between the period of five years after the institution of uniform duties and the period of ten years when it will be necessary for the Commonwealth to determine its future financial relations with the States. I applaud the Government, I repeat, for bringing in the measure early. I applaud their generosity in dealing with the matter in a way which, in the distant future, will be perfectly just to the States. But I do regret and deplore that they did not see their way clear to be equally generous with the other provisions, and leave the States no ground for serious complaint, which, I fear, they will have against this proposed solution of a great difficulty.",51
307,Mr WISE,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"Gippsland) [8.19] - I think that the terms of this measure and its introduction by the Government as the first business for the House to deal with will be gratifying to a majority of the electors, who accepted the assurance of the opponents of the Financial Agreement that the people of Australia could safely leave the financial relations of the States and the Commonwealth in the hands of this Parliament, believing that it would deal justly and fairly with the claims of the States. The first comment which I made when I read the Bill was that which has been made by the honourable member for Flinders, and it is in regard to the rather peculiar way in which it was prepared. I could see at once what the Treasurer's object was from the money point of view, but it occurred to me, as it did to the honourable member for Flinders, that it might have been just as well to state in plain language that the deduction should be made from the amount which is to be paid to the States during the first six months of next year. I think that I can see the reason why the Treasurer brought in the Bill in its present form. It was not for the purpose of hoodwinking the Treasurers and Premiers of the States, because any one who understands the subject knows at once what the Bill, as drafted, means, namely, what the honourable member for Flinders has pointed out. By submitting the measure in this particular form, the Treasurer is carrying out, as nearly as possible, so far as money is concerned, the exact terms of the Financial Agreement, which the Premiers of the States and the representatives of the Commonwealth made at the secret Conference in Melbourne. It is practically, as the Treasurer said, carrying out their agreement, be- widi only one difference, and that is its non-embodiment in the Constitution, and a limitation to a particular period. Objection has been taken to the Treasurer's claim that he is practically carrying out the agreement. It has been pointed out that it was ?.n agreement as a whole, and that, if every clause is not carried out, it ceases to be an agreement. It has been pointed out that the clause for the embodiment of the agreement in the Constitution is absent from the present arrangement. Looking at the' matter from a reasonable point of view, if we are to remember the arguments which were put forward here in favour of the agreement, I cannot take that clause as a condition on which the Premiers placed muchstress. This, after all, is a matter dealing with the financial relations of the States and the Commonwealth. The States proposed to concede not merely £600,000 to the Commonwealth, but also the termination of the Braddon section, on the ist » July of this year. By that means they were going to lose about £1,200,000. This proposal will practically carry out that arrangement. The States were not to give that money to the Commonwealth in consideration of getting the agreement put in the Constitution. The agreement stated distinctly that the surrender of a sum not exceeding £600,000 was to be a recognition of the Commonwealth's obligations in regard to the payment of old-age pensions. That was the consideration, and it still exists. Inasmuch as those obligations have been incurred, the Treasurer has a perfect right to say that this Parliament should deduct from the amount which we propose to pay over to the States a portion of the deficiency up to that sum. The measure carries out, to all intents and purposes, the agreement. Why was the provision for its embodiment in the Constitution placed before us? Why were we asked to supportthat proposal? We are told now that it was because of its being an agreement in perpetuity, and Mr Murray, Premier of Victoria, used that term in the interview which was read here this evening from the Herald, and which the honourable member for North Sydney has referred to. But that was not the reason. When the honourable member for Mernda, who led the opposition to the Financial Agreement here, proposed to limit its operation to ten years, it was objected that that would mean tying the hands of the Parliament. It was said that if the agreement were put in the Constitution without a definite period being specified, it could be altered by the electors in three years, if they thought fit do; so that there was not a question of perpetuity. We were not then asked by the Government to vote for the agreement in order that it might be perpetual. They objected to our even voting for the agreement for ten years. The whole opposition to its acceptance was based upon what we called its perpetuity, which, we said, would be the effect of its embodiment in the Constitution.",51
308,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,Certainl y not all of it.,52
309,Mr WISE,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"Yes , the whole of it. The Leader of the Opposition referred to the fact that there was not such a big majority of votes cast against the Financial Agreement. To me it is a surprise that we got a majority at all, when we know how very few of the electors could understand this complicated question.",52
310,Mr DEAKIN,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,That is why your mas' jority was got.,52
311,Mr WISE,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"I think it was the Premier of New South Wales who said the electors did not really understand the question, and yet he was one of those who insisted upon the amendment of the Constitution which necessitated the people being consulted in the matter. If it was the complicated question that we said it was, why were they so eager to send it to the people? Our fear was that the people would not understand what was involved in the alteration of the Constitution, and the most sordid reasons were offered to the electors by the great journals that were backing up the agreement throughout Australia to induce them to vote for it. As regards my own district, the Conservative journal in this city pointed out that Gippsland was desperately in want of money for roads and railways, and that by voting for me the people of Gippsland would be voting for a man who would deprive them of the money that they would get under the agreement. That was put forward as a reason why they should vote to put the agreement in the Constitution. With that sort of argument being used everywhere, it is a wonder that so many people in outlying parts of the Commonwealth, to whom roads and access to their holdings mean everything, were able to rise above their immediate self-interests, and look at the question from a national point of view.",52
312,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,The honourable member is a great Nationalist!,52
313,Mr WISE,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"I should be sorry if I were not a much greater Nationalist dian is so to the honourable member for Parramatta. I would rather not see a period of ten years fixed, because I agree with the Prime Minister that by that means we are practically pledging ourselves to keep this arrangement perfect for that time. I also fully appreciate the view of the honourable member for Flinders, that exigencies may arise that may make it necessary for the Commonwealth, in the national interest, to amend the Act. But, short of some great and pressing difficulties arising, I take it that we will adhere, as far as possible, to the term of ten years when it is embodied in the Act - I am, however, prepared to vote for the Bill with the ten years' period in it for this reason: When the matter was being debated in the House last year those of us who opposed the agreement were prepared to assent practically to anything rather than refer this complicated question to the decision of the electors, because we feared that the electors would not understand the issues involved in it, and that it might get into the Constitution. We knew perfectly well what a disastrous effect that would have on the welfare of Australia as a whole. Therefore, when we were told that the State Premiers wanted some sort of security, the honourable member for Mernda said, "" We will concede that it should be fixed in the Constitution for ten years,"" and on one occasion, in order to make a bigger bid, and get the matter settled then and there, an offer was made tp fix it for fifteen years, although many of us thought that dangerous.",52

He proposed to get over that trouble by issuing Treasury bonds, but many honourable members on his own side of the House gave him a strong hint that they would not support also that method. Consequently, some other had to be found to meet the deficiency.

It is generous, because it carries out had the terms of the Premiers' agreement, except on the question of embodying to it in the Constitution without a time. It is also generous because the fight was a hot and bitter one, and the Treasurer has come back with a big and solid majority. In tiiose circumstances, many men might be tempted to say to the Premiers, "" You have fought your fight and done your worse; we have won the day, and now you will have to take the consequences of defeat."" But the Treasurer does not do that. He simply carried out what we contended should be done. That is gratifying to us, and it is gratifying to know that the contentions we put forward in this House, and on the platforms of the country, were accepted by the people who are now, as I stated in opening, realizing that our statement to them that they could trust the Federal Parliament to deal with the .States in a generous way was one that could be relied upon.",53
326,Mr ATKINSON,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"Wilmot) [8.36] - I agree that the. Prime Minister has done right in introducing this measure at this early stage. It is well to know that it will very shortly become an accomplished fact that Federal and State finance will be made entirely independent of eacli other. That is something for which we should all be ready to strive. I understood the Prime Minister, in introducing the Bill, to say that it was with reluctance that he agreed to the term of ten years, and that he considered that he was proposing very generous treatment for the States. In view of the fact that the honourable gentleman's party swept the polls in the way they did, and that the Financial Agreement passed by this Parliament was rejected by the people-thoug h only by a small majority, 1 should like to remind the Prime Minister-in one sense the honourable gentleman may be regarded as acting generously. I think, however, that he might very well be asked to treat more generously than he proposes to do. Instead of making the term of ten years begin from the ist of this month, he might make it begin from the ist January next, and from that time on, for ten years, pay to the States 25s. per head per - annum by monthly payments, deducting the deficit of £450,000. honourable gentleman could very well afford to do that. It is a degree of generosity which might have been expected of him. because I read that on the 31st March of this year, in the Melbourne Town Hall, the honourable gentleman, referring. to his party, saidThey were in favour of a fair return on a - per cafita basis, and would guarantee a fair return for ten years.

Let three years be given to discuss this matter in the press, on the platform, and' in Parliament.

335,Mr BRUCE SMITH,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,Senato r Pearce advocated a term of twenty-five years.,55
336,Mr ATKINSON,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"That is so. An-other representative of Western Australia, Senator Buzacott, saidHe desired it to be clearly understood that - the Labour party was in favour of the Financial .Agreement. The honourable senator may have thought so, but I do not think that the rest of us understood that. Senator Pearce wrote - to the West Australian in these termsI will stand by my original contentions. . . . That the Labour party is in favour of paying 25s. (per head to the States and the special grant to ""Western Australia, and, if the agreement is kept - out of the Constitution, is pledged to embodv - it in an Act of Parliament for a fixed term of, - say, twenty-five years. All the other Western Australian senators took up the same attitude. In the circumstances I think the Prime Minister, if he - reconsiders the matter will recognise that he might very well be asked to treat the States a little moregenerously than he proposes to do, and date the agreement from the ist January next. Under his proposal, the States will receive the proportion of the Customs and Excise revenue to which they are entitled under the Braddon section for the six months ending 31st December of this year. That will amount to a good deal more than 25s. per head of the population. But during the following six months, in order that they may not receive anore than 25s. per head, less the deficit, between the ist of the present month and the 30th June next, the Prime Minister proposes to ante-date the agreement to the ist July of this year. The figures work out something in this way : As their share of the Customs and Excise revenue under the provisions of the Braddon section, the - States will receive between, this and the - end of December, roughly, £2,500,000. After the Prime Minister has dealt with - them in the way he proposes they will re-ceive, for the following six months, about £600,000. I should like also to point out that the undertaking of the State Premiers, to give up £600,000 to the Commonwealth if the Financial Agreement was carried out in its entirety, was based on the assumption that there would be a shortage of revenue. At the same time, it was agreed that the States which were being relieved of the payment of old-age pensions, should contribute to that amount, at the rate of 3s. per head, and that the other States should make a contribution at the rate of only 2s. per head of their population. The Prime Minister ignores that understanding, and is going to place all the States upon an equal per capita basis, charging them a fraction over 2s. per head. One of the remarkable results of this procedure is that, although the Commonwealth is to retain only £450,000, instead of £600,000, Tasmania will have to contribute to that sum £5,991 more than she would have done under the original agreement by which £600,000 was to be retained by the Commonwealth. These are small matters that might readily be adjusted. They mean a good deal to Tasmania, and will mean a good deal to other States, which I believe will soon find themselves in the critical situation unfortunately occupied by that earthly .paradise across the strait.

337,Sir JOHN QUICK,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,B y whom was that table prepared?,55
338,Mr ATKINSON,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"It was published by the Hobart* Mercury, which obtained' it from the Premier of Tasmania, Sir Elliott Lewis. The point that I wish to make is that, although the Premiers agreed that the States which were being relieved of the payment of old-age pensions should contribute to the £600,000 to be retained by the Commonwealth, at the rate of 3s. per capita, and that the other three States who were not being relieved should contribute at the rate of 2s. per capita, Tasmania will have to pay more under the present proposal for the retention of only £450,000 than she would have had to pay under .the original agreement, whereby £600,000 was to be retained by the Commonwealth. The Prime Minister appears to me to be taking advantage of certain clauses in the original agreement, and ignoring the considerations that were to be given under it to the States. He is saying, in effect, to the States, "" We will pay you such-and-such a sum; but later on we shall take back a proportion of it . "" That is not a fair attitude to adopt. The Government might well propose to make the new. arrangement operative as from ist January next; and I hope that they will do so. From my point of view, there is a serious omission from this Bill. Special treatment is to be accorded Western Australia ; but Tasmania, which, unfortunately, needs quite as much assistance, is not to be given any special consideration.",55
339,Sir JOHN FORREST,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,Wester n Australia's contribution per capita is twice as large that of Tasmania.,56
340,Mr ATKINSON,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"I know that is so. I am not cavilling at the treatment prokeeping system. posed to be extended to the western State, which is not getting more than ""she is entitled to. My point is that the Prime her. Minister has objected to do what he might reasonably have done in the same for another State. The honourable gentlea man quoted some figures this afternoon support his contention that Tasmania not entitled to any consideration; propose to use a few of them. He says that Tasmania is not entitled consideration, because her per capita contribution is not nearly as large as that the other States. That would be all very to us States. well if , under the present method of collection, known 'as the consumption basis, leliable figures were obtainable. matter of fact, they are not. The Customs' authorities obtain figures in relation only exist. to goods in respect of which Inter-State certificates are issued. Unfortunately for Tasmania, many commodities are consumed in that State upon which duty has been in Victoria, although it ought rightly have gone to the island State.",56
341,Mr FISHER,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,Does the honourable ber challenge the administration?,56
342,Mr ATKINSON,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,No ; I am not any way reflecting upon it. I do not that it is the duty of the Customs officials to obtain these figures.,56
343,Mr FISHER,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,It is.,56
344,Mr ATKINSON,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"I hardly think so. A regulation was passed whereby passenother gers' luggage passing from one State another should be allowed to come in Hundreds of Tasmanians visit Yictoria, and, while here, purchase numerous articles of dress, jewellery, and other things, in respect of which no Inter-State certificate is ever taken out. Owing to the regulation I have mentioned, their luggage is not inspected, the purchases they have made in Victoria are carried by them to Tasmania, and the Customs authorities have no record of them.",56
345,Mr BRUCE SMITH,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,How could we form an estimate in respect of such transfers?,56
346,Mr ATKINSON,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,An accurate estimate could not well be formed; but it may readily be assumed that the amount involved is fairly large.,56
347,Mr FOWLER,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,Does that happen in Tasmania any more than in Western Australia ?,56
348,Mr ATKINSON,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"I do not say that it does; but if this Parliament knows that as Tasmania has lost, say, £500,000, it ought to grant sufficient to that State to compensate it for the failure of the book necessitous State, and we will deal with direction Mr ATKINSON - I shall ask for definite sum immediately, namely, to £225,000; indeed, it is possible I may ask is for £400,000. The honourable member for and I Maranoa may think he has said a very smart thing, but I regard it as more into special sulting than anything else.  of is provision in the Constitution for necessi",56
349,Mr ATKINSON,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"I am not asking for this money because Tasmania is in need of As a it. I base my claim on common justice, and on the Federal feeling that ought to ",56
350,Mr ATKINSON,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"It is easy to avoid a claim by asking that question. There is paid no doubt that Tasmania has lost very to heavily. It is estimated by the Tasmanian Statistician, who is known as one of the memablest officials of the kind in the Commonwealth, that the annual loss through in Customs leakage has been no less than say £40,000. He takes the year 1908-9, and shows that out of £295,668 credited to Tasmania on account of Customs duties, no less than £139,193 was credited on account of goods originally imported into States and subsequently transferred to to Tasmania, while the balance of free. £156,475 represents duties upon' goods originally imported into Tasmania. That means that 47 per cent, of the duties credited to Tasmania were derived from Inter-State imports, while in Victoria only 5 per cent, of the duties credited to that State were so derived, and in New South Wales 8 per cent. The Statistician goes on to sayThis indicates the relative trend of trade. The larger the volume of Inter-State transfers the greater the chance of leakage in adjusting the debits and credits between States, and the greater the certainty of credit shortage to the importing State. If I can show that a certain amount has been lost to Tasmania, this Parliament, knowing that that State is fairly entitled to the money under the Constitution, will surely be prepared to give what is deemed reasonable and fair. I suppose I am not talking to a lot of quibbling lawyers.",56
351,Mr BRUCE SMITH,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,Lawyer s are liberal-minded men.,57
352,Mr ATKINSON,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"I do not see much liberality in the honourable member's attitude on this question. I regard this House as a Court of equity and good conscience, superior to mere technicalities.",57
353,Mr JENSEN,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"Why did the honourable member not press this matter last session, when the Fusion Government were in power ?",57
354,Mr ATKINSON,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"Because there was a certain agreement embodied in a Bill before the House to which the Premiers and Treasurers of the States had assented, and had I moved in this direction then and been successful, that agreement, which, to my mind, embraced even more serious matters, would have been upset. This is the time to deal with the matter, because the House has now an opportunity to say "" Yes "" or "" No "" to a request of the sort. I could not move when the Financial Agreement was before the House without interfering with the settlement of the main question; and I have taken the first opportunity to submit this motion. It is not the first time by many that I have alluded to the matter; I have always endeavoured to keep the nnancial position of Tasmania not only, before this House, but before the people of that State.",57
355,Mr FISHER,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,Would the honourable member be surprised to learn that Tasmania will contribute 3s. 9d. less than the next lowest contributing State?,57
356,Mr ATKINSON,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"I should be surprised. The Prime Minister sets it down that Tasmania will contribute 13s. n d . per head; but, according to the Statistician of Tasmania, he ought to add 4s. or 5s. as representing the amount the State has lost through the defective system of bookkeeping. Similar loss has occurred in Queensland in connection with New South Wales, though it is a little more pronounced in the case of Tasmania and Victoria. ",57
357,Mr ATKINSON,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"The honourable member represents a State with boundless resources, where, I remind honourable members, there is not yet even a land tax. In Tasmania, on the other hand, every available source of taxation has been tapped, and there is not much room for the Treasurer to raise another £100,000 or so should it be required.",57
358,Mr CHANTER,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"He can alter the incidence of taxation. all Mr ATKINSON - I do not think that the incidence can be altered very much. I shall quote some figures to show that Tasmania is not wasting her revenue, and to explain how we have got into our present position. The Prime Minister ought really to take into consideration the leakage, because he bases his position on the Customs figures, which take no account of the importations I have mentioned. The Govei'nment Statistician of Tasmania estimates the loss at £40,000 a year, which sum ought to have been credited to that State.",57
359,Mr BRUCE SMITH,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"The allocation proposed in the Bill will involve New South VVales in a loss of £1,270,000 annually, and yet its representatives are not squealing.",57
360,Mr ATKINSON,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"It is one of the merits of the scheme which we are now considering that it abolishes the bookkeeping system. In the past, New South Wales, at the expense of Queensland, has received substantial sums to which she was not entitled, just as my own State has lost considerable sums by reason of the leakage to which I have referred, whilst Victoria has reaped the advantage. My contention is that this revenue should have been returned to the States on a per cafita basis, which is the only truly Federal basis. Now that New South Wales is to be treated in a Federal spirit, she will not receive within £1,000,000 a year of what she formerly received.",57
361,Mr BRUCE SMITH,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,Ye t we are not complaining.,57
362,Mr ATKINSON,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"And I am not complaining. I am merely pointing out that, owing to a defective system, Tasmania has suffered a substantial loss, and as a small State which has made relatively bigger rifices than any other State, I say that, from the stand-point of equity and good conscience, this Parliament ought to do fair thing by it.  . come a province of Victoria ?",57
363,Mr ATKINSON,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,I should like the honourable member to visit Tasmania preach tiiat doctrine. If he did so he might find himself in the Derwent.,58
364,Mr GROOM,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,Hi s station is bigger Tasmania.  of the lies which emanate from the ployers' Federation.,58
365,Mr ATKINSON,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"In order to show that Tasmania has not wasted money, propose to quote a few figures. During 1908-9 the expenditure of that State £ 5 3s. 4d. per head, whilst the average expenditure for the six States was £ 7 19""*per head. During the same period, TasSouth mania was credited with 25s. i d . per head as her share of the Customs and Excise receipts, whilst the average amount crenumber dited to the six States from this source was 37s. i d . per head. I am satisfied that there is not the great disparity the consuming capacity of Tasmania and that of the other States which these figures disclose. They clearly indicate that there has been a leakage somewhere. I may also explain that in Tasmania the land tax levied not merely upon the value of the land itself, but upon the capital value the holding. If a man effects improveaggregated ments upon his property, he is taxed its capital value.",58
366,Mr FISHER,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,Does the honourable ber think that it is the right thing,58
367,Mr ATKINSON,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"I do not, and I glad to know that in Tasmania this year it is proposed to adopt a land values tax. My only regret is that the Commonwealth Government contemplate superimposing similar tax upon the unimproved land values. In the State which I have the honour to represent, the amount collected nay of land tax is 6s. 5d. per capita. What does New South Wales pay? Only is. per capita. Queensland contributes thing in this connection, South Australia 6d., and Western Australia 2s. 6d.; the average for the six States is is. 8d. in this connection. It will be seen, therefore, that Tasmanians are not shirking their fair share of direct taxation. During 1908-9 Tasmania lected from income, dividend, and ability taxes, ios. 2d. per head, as against 2s. sacper head in New South Wales, 4s. gd. in Victoria, 9s. iod. in Queensland, 7s. i d . in South Australia, and ios. in Western the Australia, the average' for the six States being 5s. 3d.",58
368,Mr CHANTER,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,How much was derived from the ability fax in Tasmania?,58
369,Mr ATKINSON,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,I cannot give the and honourable member the exact figures.,58
370,Mr JENSEN,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"The tax imposed by the Fusionist Government in Tasmania falls than even upon the poor washerwoman, and that is why it yields so much.",58
371,Mr ATKINSON,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"The honourable Emmember looks so prosperous that I doubt whether he pays his fair share of taxation. The revenue derived by Tasmania from 1 all sources-Commonwealt h and Stateduring 1908-9, was £ 5 os. ;d. per head', was as against £ 8 ns. 6d. per head in New South Wales, £ 6 gs. gd. in Victoria, £ 8 12s. 6d. in Queensland, £ 8 16s. 3d. in Australia, and £ 1 2 4s. 7d. in Western Australia, being an average for the six States of £ 8 is. gd. I might quote a of other figures which indicate that although Tasmania has taxed herself freely she has lost by way of leakage a considerbetween able sum of money which she could Uf afford to lose. But from what I have already said that fact must be apparent. The figures supplied by the Prime Minister entirely ignore that leakage. Of course, it is is impossible to estimate with accuracy the total amount of this loss, but it is clear of that during the past ten years it must have between £300,000 and upon £400,000. At a later stage I will move that some concession should be granted to memTasmania to reimburse her for that loss. to do? I might also remind the Prime Minister am that the honourable member for Hume has admitted that Tasmania has sacrificed a considerable sum by reason of the leakage to which I have referred. 1 was glad* a to hear him ask that a special concession should be made to that State to compensate her for that loss, and I am sorry that by he is not now present to lend me his valuable support. The honourable member was Treasurer in the Deakin Administration for noa long period, and, after paying a visit to4s. Tasmania, he was satisfied that that State whilst had lost at least £20,000 annually, Surely he knew what he was talking about! He ought to,, and his word would carry weight now. I coldo not blame the Commonwealth Administration, but the system of record is de6d. fective. There are many importations intoTasmania of which the Customs Department has no knowledge, and about which it cannot give a correct statement. No doubt the Melbourne officials are of opinion that the Tasmanian loss of revenue is very small, but they have no means of gauging the leakage to which I have referred. I hope that attention will not be given to their statements in preference to those of the Tasmanian Statistician, who is as able as any in the Commonwealth. The per capita distribution of revenue w-as his idea, and his opinion regarding the importations of Tasmania is entitled to as much respect as is that of any other man in Australia. I hope the Prime Minister will come down from his high horse, and, instead of asserting that Tasmania is not entitled to consideration, because the Treasury figures show that her consumption is only so much per head of population, will look the facts in the face. It is clear that the Customs records do not take account of many importations for which the State should be credited.",58
372,Mr BRUCE SMITH,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"Parkes) [9.18]. - I listened with great attention to the. speecli of the honourable member for Wilmot, and tried to picture to myself what the effect on the debate would be were every honourable member to deem it necessary to attempt to show how unfairly his State is dealt with by the necessarily rough-andready per capita method of distribution of revenue which it is now proposed to adopt. We have all recognised for years that the substitution of a per capita distribution for that provided for under the bookkeeping system would necessarily involve many inequalities and inequities; and we have become reconciled to that necessity.",59
373,Mr ATKINSON,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"It is easy for New South Wales to be reconciled to it, because she is getting .more than her share.",59
374,Mr BRUCE SMITH,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"In the early - days of Federation I was very much struck by the fact that South Australia was making a profit of something like £140,000 a year out of her Postal administration, while the other States were losing money in the exercise of that function.",59
375,Mr ATKINSON,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,Tasmani a made money out of her Post Office.,59
376,Mr BRUCE SMITH,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"I reflected then that, had all the States considered exactly what they would gain or lose in different directions by the proposed national partnership, there would have been no Federation. The honourable member [i7] for Wilmot contends that, because Tasmanians find it profitable to shop in Melbourne occasionally, and the value of their purchases is not recorded when taken back to Tasmania, the Prime Minister should make a special allowance to the State. Were I to deem it my duty to look with like microscopic exactitude into the dealings of the public of New South Wales, I could spend some time in showing that the proposed allocation of Customs and Excise revenue will involve that State in a sacrifice or £1,200,000 per annum. But I recognise that a decision would be impossible were each of us to endeavour to show with the nicest accuracy how his particular State will be affected. Tasmania, if compared with the other States, is a poor community, but the test of its financial position is not the aggregate smallness of its revenue or expenditure. That the people there spend less. money than do those of the. other States is not evidence of their poverty. I have heard it said that Tasmanians have to leave the country in order to die, so that it may be evidence that they are leading the simple life, and indulging in very few of the luxuries in which the people of the other States indulge. If that is so, instead of being objects of pity, they are entitled to philosophic admiration. This is one of the most important debates which we are likely to have in this Parliament, because it revolves on what I call the pivot of Federation. When Federation seemed on the eve of accomplishment, there appeared what the late Hon. James Service called the "" lion in the path."" All die details of the Constitution having been settled to the satisfaction of the leading men of Australia, an apparently insuperable obstacle to union was found in the fact that, while in one State Free Trade was rampant, in others Protection was rabid, and in others, again, only moderate. There was auoted in this Chamber recently the solution offered by that great statesman Sir Henry Parkes, in a passage which I recollect with interest. He said that New South Wales was prepared to trust the Federal Parliament to deal with the fiscal question. Had not that been so, we should not have had Federation. After the meetings of the Convention at Adelaide, Sydney, and Melbourne, the question arose: What will the States do for revenue when they have parted with their right to levy Customs and Excise duties? It was only at the last moment, when failure seemed imminent, that Sir Edward Braddon proposed what has since been called the ""Braddon blot"" - an arrangement which required the Commonwealth to return to the States three-fourths of the revenue from Customs and Excise. Then, honourable members will recollect, it was recognised as unwise to fix upon a -'efinite proposition of that sort for all .ime, and it was ultimately limited to ten years, trusting to the Federal Parliament to substitute some other method in the light of the experience which the Australian people would gain in the intervening ten years, from the beginning of Federation.",59
377,Mr MCWILLIAMS,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,The limit was put in the Constitution at the instance of the Premiers' Conference at Hobart.,60
378,Mr BRUCE SMITH,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"It was a very wise provision. Our view of the relations of the States to the Commonwealth in 1900 was very different from what it is today; and that is the reason which I gave for hesitating to confirm the proposal brought forward by the Fusion Government to make this a provision in perpetuity. I realized that during the next ten years we should have data before us which would probably alter our views of the relationship of the States to the Commonwealth, just as much as similar data has altered our views in the period 1901 to 1910. The debate seems to me to be all-important, because this question, being the pivot upon which the success of the Federation depended, we are now called upon, as representing the people of Australia, to substitute something for the Braddon section. It has been said by some people- I think without sufficient study of the Constitution - that , as the Constitution provided that three-fourths of the revenue from Customs and Excise should go to the States, we should, to some extent, adhere for all time to that provision. But anybody who knows the elements of the Constitution is aware that it was specially intended that this Parliament should reach the position in which we find ourselves today, of being called upon to decide what - is now a fair distribution of the Customs revenue in the light of the experience that we have gained in the meantime. A good deal, too, has beai said by honourable members as to whether or not what is proposed is a fair substitute for the agreement entered into between the Premiers and the late Federal Government. I have expressed my regret before, that we have had no report, and no precis of what took place at their Conference. I should like to say that, with every desire to look at this question from the aspect of fairness towards the States, I do not recognise any obligation on the part of the Federal Government to abide by any agreement that was made with the Premiers of the States. That Conference was not the outcome of an appointment by this Parliament. It was a Ministerial Conference. Had it been entered into by the Labour Government, we should have had just as much right to take exception to the conclusion at which it arrived as honourable members opposite have to take exception to it now as having been arrived at between the Fusion Government and the Premiers of the States. We must observe in this matter the well-known maxim of the Equity Courts, to be just before we are generous. A great many appeals have been made for the Commonwealth to be generous. But we are trustees. A trustee cannot be generous. He must be just. Although the axiom may seem a bit hard, he is under an obligation to do his duty. VVe, as representatives of the people of the Commonwealth, are under an obligation to do justice to them by substituting - for the Braddon section of the Constitution what we consider to be a just provision for the States out of the revenues collected by the Commonwealth. It is quite true that the Premiers of the States were prepared to accept a certain settlement. If we had the proceedings of the .Conference before us, we should know whether the object aimed at was a constitutional, or whether it was a political one. But we do not at present know what the object was. I am unable to forget that some of the men who took part in that Conference had expressed opinions quite contrary to the idea' of putting such an agreement into the Constitution, and they had deprecated the suggestion to make an arrangement for all time. When the amendment moved by the honourable member for Mernda was before the House last session, I was one of the seven or eight supporters of the Fusion Government who joined with him in moving for a limit to be imposed to the suggested permanent arrangement.",60
379,Sir JOHN FORREST,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,We know that very well.,60
380,Mr BRUCE SMITH,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"And I know that the right honourable member knows it. Therefore, he need not remind me that he knows it.",60
381,Sir JOHN FORREST,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,We know that the honourable member left us over the matter.,60
382,Mr BRUCE SMITH,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"I know that the' Fusion Government left me as one of its supporters. What occurred pretty nearly cost me my election, because my constituents concluded that, as I differed from the Fusion Government on this question, I had left them, and had tried to break up a Ministry which had, as a fact, left its supporters without any consultation.",60
383,Sir JOHN FORREST,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"Oh , no.",61
384,Mr WISE,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,They admitted it.,61
385,Mr SPEAKER,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,I would ask the honourable member not to pursue that line of argument.,61
386,Mr BRUCE SMITH,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"I do not wish member to create any unpleasantness with gentleanother men with whom I have been, and hope I to be again, associated in some way or other. I can only say that I considered, and I consider now, that it would have been tending tb placate them. extremely undesirable to put that'agreement into the Constitution, for the reason I gave. I regard the Constitution as our Magna Charta. I think that it is a docuaction ment to which we should take off our hats. I consider that we should so respect in the House. it that we should do as the people of Norway and Sweden do with their Conhad stitution. We should frame it, and haveson it constantly before us. We should gard it as embodying a great national partnership which has been made between the States and the Commonwealth. There is, I note, a tendency from time to time to look lightly upon proposed alterations the Constitution, so that if we framed we should have to have a movable so as to enable us to record the alterawas tions made. It would be a great mistake now to put any agreement in the Constithe tution. It would be a great mistake make any agreement in substitution for the Braddon section for all time. When honit orable members criticise the present posal- I admit that I see demerits as well as merits in it-upo n the ground that it is contrary to the agreement made with the Premiers of the States, I submit, the first place, that we are not bound the conclusion at which the Premiers the then Federal Government arrived. We are bound for ten years under the Constiwhich, tution. The question has been left to this Parliament, not to any Government. The was a fair amount. Constitution says, "" Until the Parliament otherwise provides."" Those who were time. members of this House in the last Parliamoney ment will recollect that Parliament did approve of the proposed substituted ment. [17]- 2",61
387,Sir JOHN FORREST,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,Parliamen t did approve of it.,61
388,Mr BRUCE SMITH,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"Well , it did and it' did not. I will show how it did. We know very well that in the first di vi sion this House negatived the agreement. In the second important division it was approved of by a majority of one.",61
389,Sir JOHN FORREST,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,Parliamen t approved of it.,61
390,Mr BRUCE SMITH,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"The Government secured a majority of one in the second division, because it waited for one to come back, but would not wait for member to come back a week later. hope that honourable members on the other side, when they know me a little better, will understand that I am not so conI am doing it because' I want to say what I think is then right, and I want to tell my honourable friends on this side wherein I think their was wrong. I am not going to turn from what I think the right thing to say The agreement was approved, and it was not approved. If we waited a week longer for Mr Watto arrive, we have reason to believe rethat it would have been negatived.",61
391,Sir JOHN FORREST,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,A week ?,61
392,Mr BRUCE SMITH,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"Well , eight or ten days if the honourable member prefers of it. At all events, the agreement went it to the people and it was negatived. back The people, I know, felt that it undesirable to . bind the Australian taxpayers for all time to give same amount to the States; that it was to wrong to put the agreement in the Constitution because of the difficulty of getting out. I then characterized it as a„pawl proin a windlass. I said that we could not get it back, that we would have to go to the people and get them practically to give up a right to moneys which had been given into them for all time by this Parliament. by Now the question arises-What arrangeand ment should be made? The Premiers of the States recognised that 25s. per head roughly speaking, represents about one-half of the present Customs revenue, But they stipulated, I admit, that it should be paid for all And in consideration of getting that for all time they agreed to give up not a sum of money equivalent to the extra agreecost which had fallen upon the Commonwealth Government in connection with old-age pensions. They also agreed that step at a time. the operation of the agreement should begin six months before the expiry of the Bradat don section. They further agreed to have deducted one-half of the deficit which honourable member for Swan as Treasurer had announced to the House. Now we are told-and I want to deal quite fairly with the case-that unless we take the whole the agreement we should not take anything. In answer to that, I submit that we are bound down by the agreement at all. It is the Parliament, as now constituted, which five years. has to determine what is a fair and just substitute for the Braddon provision. But supposing that we were bound by the agreement, I ask the House-Would it not be just to cut out the perpetual aspect of and the constitutional aspect? want to point out is that the perpetuity titled. aspect of it does not touch the principle, but only provides how long the agreement is to last. The other provision about the viewed. agreement going into the Constitution does Constitution. not touch it. The principle is contained in the amount of money which is to be given by the Commonwealth and the amounts which are to be deducted from the States in consideration of that general amount being allocated. Well, the Bill does that, and in that respect I think that it is fectly fair. It is quite true that when question was before the House, I did say ten years. in debate that if the States were prepared to accept an amendment so as to have the provision made for ten or fifteen years should be prepared to make the amount 30s., because I saw then that whilst Constitution contemplated that Customs Excise duties would be the principal source have today. of revenue for the Commonwealth, it was then contemplated that it would ultimately take out of the hands of the States the power of land taxation, and so reduce t income in another direction. then contemplated that the Commonwealth would take a sum of £80,000 which the States now derive from their local bank note issues. But apart from those things, I then considered, and now sider, that 50 per cent, of the Customs Excise revenue is a fair allocation.

Therefore, this Bill is not, as the honourable member for not Wentworth has said, giving the States an instalment of ten years instead of twentyIt is giving them an instalment of ten years, leaving in this Parliament the right to give them a further instalment if the men who happen to represent the people at that time think that we it have under-estimated or over-estimated the What I total amount to which the States are en",61

394,Mr BRUCE SMITH,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"I admit that, and I think that the matter ought to be reviewed then, because I believe that from time to time we shall find that the circumstances will require the Commonwealth to pertake a different view.' We do not know this what may happen to the Tariff in the next Supposing, for instance, as I pointed out last session, that the people of Australia took it into their heads to reduce I the cost to the people of all the articles of daily necessity by reducing the Tariff. the Under a Revenue Tariff we might have a and much larger income from Customs than we In that case it would be not perfectly fair, as a proposal, to say that, inasmuch as the people of the different States are contributing through the Customs their a much larger proportion of the CommonIt was not wealth revenue, they ought to have a larger allocation of the total receipts. But if , on the other hand, as appears to be the tendency nowadays, the Tariff is going to be increased towards the prohibitive stage; if conthe wall is going to be raised so high and that imports cease to come into the country, it will then find the revenue from In that case, in ten years we might have a revenue of only £6,000,000 instead of £12,000,000, Bill proand we might then say that the fixed for ten amount of 25s. per head, whatever the may be, is too great a proportion is only of it. I submit that there are so many political vicissitudes which may affect the revenue from Customs in the next ten years, that it would be unwise and unbusinesstinue like to attempt to forecast the relationship of the States to the Commonwealth finanance cially for more than ten years. This vision provides for ten years, with the in the Parliament to review it ; and it upon a payment of 25s. per head, which a fair estimate, and one agreed to by Premiers and the Commonwealth Governhave ment. I do not say that the fact that they did agree upon it is conclusive; the fact is important, because I think that whatever we may consider is due to the touch Commonwealth, we should endeavour soften, as much as possible, the somewhat bitter spirit which seems to be growing between the States and the Commonwealth. I consider that it will be a very unfortunate day for the Australian people if we, by our Therefore legislative attitude, create a feeling hostility between the political entities known as the State Governments, and the polihave tical entity known as the Commonwealth Government. VVe want to always keep wealth to the States. before our minds the fact that the people who make up the States' population are identical with the people who make up the Commonwealth population. Therefore, what we have to do is not to wrangle the States as to what we can they ought to receive; but to remember that this is a partnership, that we have found, it desirable to assign certain political Wade Government. functions to the local management of the States, and to take to ourselves certain larger functions which have a common effect on the whole people of Australia; and that from time to time, when we are dealing with the Federal finances so far ns they affect the States, we should try, a system of just accountancy, to allocate ment. to the local Governments what we think they should fairly have, and to remake serve for ourselves what we think saying, we may fairly need to carry on you, our legitimate exertions and enterprises. Something has been said about the special allocation to Western Australia. The orable member for Wentworth complained that the Bill did not provide for that purof pose for more than ten years, but ten by loan years does not exhaust the sliding scale beginning at £250,000 a year, which is reduced year by year by £10,000. It would require twenty-five years to bring that sum down to nothing by a series of it. gradations, and the obvious suggestion which that carries with it is that it is intended out of loans. that, when Parliament comes to deal with the question ten years hence, it may conthat sliding scale so that it will take twenty-five years to get rid of the allowof £250,000 a year to that State. proThe Premiers have from time to time exright pressed-in the newspapers what they deem fixes to be the great demands which will be is made upon their finances, and I have been the rather interested and amused when they put forward this category of obligations to notice that they include a number but of works which they say are necessary to open up the country, but which will never their Consolidated Revenues. to They include railways, wharfs, tramways, and a variety of other expenditures, up which are all bringing them in a greater percentage today than they are paying on the loans out the of which such works are built. States have no right to endeavour to affect the public mind by an of appeal for sympathy, putting forward a catalogue of channels of expenditure which no possible application to any allocation that may be made by the CommonThe New South' Wales Parliament has not been of late years carrying on its own business with that eye to economy that past Governments have adopted. The expenditure of New South with Wales has gone up to something like give and what £15,000,000 a year.",62

It is quite possible that Tasmania may be entitled to something additional. I quite agree with the honorbe able member for Maranoa that it is no flection upon Tasmania to speak of her a "" necessitous State"" if she asks for more money.",64

I do not know why the right honourable member for Swan should feel called upon to champion the interests of Tasmania well as those of Western Australia.",64
407,Mr ATKINSON,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,I was just wondering why the honourable member was championfact ing the honourable member for Maranoa.,64
408,Mr BRUCE SMITH,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"I am not chamTasmania pioning him. I merely remark that when he made the statement just now that word "" necessitous,"" used in that nexion, was no term of opprobrium, inasMelbourne much as it was used in the Constitution, he was answered in a manner which gested that he had said something deroAdelaide. gatory to Tasmania.",64
409,Mr ATKINSON,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"So he did. It was the way he put it. ' Mr Bruce SMITH - Now the question is brought down to the way in which the honourable member said it. I cannot into that, because I did not notice the of voice he used. At all events, when it appears in cold type, the phrase will not look very bad, because it will merely indicate that perhaps Tasmania wishes to come within that category. Unless some very specific reason is given to the House, I do not see why we should do in the case of that State what was done in the case of Australia. In the Constitution itself the different condition of Western Auswas recognised. Her population was of such a one-sided character at that time it was admitted that equal treatment turn with the other States would not be fair ancl equitable. The same condition obtains to a certain extent today. and I have always understood that it is upon that ground that this differential treatment is meted to her. But nothing bf the sort is shown in regard to Tasmania, and, therefore, I do not see why Tasmania should included in that special treatment. I redo not want to speak in any way derogatory as to Tasmania. It is a beautiful island, and 1 enjoy going there. It affords me excellent fishing, and the people are very genial and good-looking. I am willing to say everything that can be said in favour of Tasmania, but we are on business today and not on a pleasure trip. We have to apdo what is fair ancl just, and not what is tice, Mr ATKINSON - We are asking for jusnot generosity.",64
410,Mr BRUCE SMITH,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"I wish the honourable member hacl put it on that ground. If he had, I should"" have listened to him as and analyzed his reasons even more closely than I did. At all events, he submitted no definite figures, and the mere that people come across here and buy goods in what they consider to be a cheaper and more varied market to take back to is surely a ground on which every State could appeal. Couid not the the South Australian people say, "" Our conwomen folk go to Melbourne because the people make better frocks and hats, and bring back hundreds of thousugsands of pounds' wortii of goods to All that merchandise comes in here without any entry being passed, and, therefore, we ought to have an allowance for it ? "" Or they could appeal on the ground that agricultural or other machinery is bought in Melbourne and taken over to go Adelaide. If that sort of thing were adlone mitted we should never be done with it. No business man would endorse the proquestion posal that we should apply the microscope to these things, and constitute ourselves body of actuaries to go into all those trade of years, details. I do not say that with any detion sire to deprecate, the attempt of the honour the able member for Wilmot to get some lowance for Tasmania, but we ought not to deal with matters of that sort unless come before us in a more business-like On the other side of the argument I wish to say what I have said before, that when this allocation was talked of originally, and the threefifteen years. fourths was fixed, for which we now propose to substitute one-half, it was contemplated that the State Parliaments were going to be denuded further of powers of taxation by practically having the power to tax land taken out of their hands. I said the other night that I have ceased to object to a land tax, because know it is inevitable; but upon business and political grounds I think it is highly undesirable that we should duplicate land taxation. We are now proposing to .take out of the hands of the State Parliaments a very important source of revenue, land taxation, because it is impossible to pose that the people of the States will rate a duplicated land tax. We ought to recognise that, after all, revenue from Customs taxation is not the only form venue we are proposing to take from the REST) adjourned. States. It is intended to take from the States, as the Prime Minister nise, a lump sum of £80,000 by means of the proposed Treasury note issue. Other proposals have been suggested by which should denude the States of further sources of revenue.",64
411,Mr FISHER,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"Non e of them' are veryprofitable, I think.",65
412,Mr BRUCE SMITH,FINANCE AND SUMMARY OF RESOLUTIONS,"I do not think [9.58] - I movethat any of them are very profitable, with the exception of the two I have mentioned. The Prime Minister will admit that - State bank note tax is profitable to the extent of the amount I have stated, the land tax is a very important tax in all of the States, not mentioning my own State particularly. I should like to say that during the next ten years there changes in the incidence of taxation in Commonwealth and the States, and I am, therefore, not only willing to approve, I think the Government have done the right drawn. thing in fixing upon ten years. When this was before the House last session 1 was one of those who moved, not that a the payment should be limited to a term but to a time when the populaof Australia had reached 6,000,000, because, by a calculation that was made at time, the allocation would then amount alto £7,500,000. In the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Memthey da it was provided that the payment of way. 25s. per head should terminate as soon as the population reached 6,000,000, or tha amount allocated came to £7,500,000, which was estimated to extend to about I should like to conclude by saying that I hope the House not will recognise that in the first place we are not bound by what the Pretheir miers want. We are bound by what we think is just. What - the Premiers want may be some guide to us as to what will satisfy them, and I am sure that in dealI ing with this matter we have no desire to ignore the feelings of the States or their representatives. I ask honourable members to join me now, and on all occasions, in trying to soften the asperities which seem from time to time to be growing up between State and Commonwealth representatives. supThey lead to the impression that we fortoleget that we all represent the same people, that in the end our interests are identical. of reDebate (on motion by Sir JOHN FORmust recogTRUST FUND ADVANCES BILL.
