2,Mr SPEAKER,HANSARD REPORT,"I might just report to honourable members on some matters that related to Question Time on Thursday, 13 September. There has been considerable attention directed to the Hansard report of Question Time of. that date, specifically the answer by the Prime Minister to a question from the Leader of the Opposition on the subject of Melbourne's bid for the 1996 Olympic Games. Last night senior officers of the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff reviewed the Hansard report and compared it with audio and video recordings of the question and answer. That comparison revealed that editorial changes had been made within Hansard at the time of the first transcription of the Prime Minister's answer. The changes were that the words 'subject to' were replaced by the words 'following the investigation of and the word 'including' was replaced by 'made up of representatives of the Department of. In the next sentence, a further change was made at the sub editorial stage when the word 'reporting' was replaced by 'which reported' and, in the next sentence, the word 'IDC' was replaced by the word 'committee'. The changes were made exclusively within Hansard by Hansard staff. There was no intervention by the Prime Minister or anyone from his office, either verbally or by written changes to the 'green', to alter the Hansard text. Information identifying the origin of the errors was provided last night to both the Prime Minister's office and the office of the Leader of the Opposition. Additional information has been provided to both offices this morning. Honourable members will be aware that Erskine May defines the Hansard report as: . . . a full report, in the first person, of ers alike, a full report being defined as one 'which, though not strictly verbatim, is substantially the verbatim report, with repetitions and redundancies omitted and with obvious mistakes corrected, but which on the other hand leaves out nothing that adds to the meaning of the speech or illustrates the argument. The President and I have endorsed the policy that Hansard should move towards a more verbatim report, with editorial intervention principally to regularise grammatical and stylistic concerns and to ensure the correctness of references made during debates. That policy has been emphasised to all Hansard officers regularly at staff meetings. I can advise honourable members that the Secretary to the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff and the Chief Hansard Reporter made this point again to staff at the weekly Hansard meeting this morning.",9
3,Mr HAWKE,HANSARD REPORT," Mr Speaker, I seek leave also to make some very brief remarks in relation to this matter.",9
4,Mr SPEAKER,HANSARD REPORT,The Prime Minister may proceed.,9
5,Mr HAWKE,HANSARD REPORT,"Most members of the House will be aware of the publicity which this matter received and which led to claims that I misled the House. Mr Speaker, the Hansard record is, as you have acknowledged, wrong, Because no 'greens' of Hansard were received in my office on 13 September the Hansard record could not be checked before printing. It was only as a result of the recent desperate attempts by some members of the Opposition to suggest that I had misled Parliament that the issue was drawn to my attention. With the lapse of time. I was unsure of the exact nature of my reply and I chose, in the light of the uncertainty, to foreshadow that, if indeed I had provided the House with a contradictory reply, I had no intention to deceive or mislead. Mr Speaker, I appreciate the clarification which you have made and I assume that, if they have any decency, the Opposition and others who have tried to beat up this matter will now concede that they all speakhave no basis for their allegations and accusations that I have attempted to mislead this House. DEATH OF MR P. V. M. WHITE",9
6,Mr HAWKE,HANSARD REPORT,"I move: That this House expresses its deep regret at the death, on Sunday, 30 September 1990, of Patrick White. .Patrick White, the first and so far the only Australian writer to win the Nobel Prize for Literature, died at his home in Sydney on Sunday, 30 September at the age of 78. It is rare for a non-parliamentarian to be the subject of a condolence motion in this place. Since 1983 the only Australians to be so honoured were the Nobel Prize winning scientist Sir Macfarlane Burnet; the dancer, actor, choreographer and director Sir. Robert Helpmann; and the landscape painter Lloyd Rees. Patrick White deserves our highest recognition, too. He was a fourth generation Australian whose great-grandfather settled in New South Wales in 1826. He, was born in London while his parents were on a long holiday, returning as a six-month old baby. He grew up on various station properties in New South Wales. He was educated first at Tudor House, Moss Vale; then he was sent to England, to Cheltenham College, for four years, which he loathed. After two years as a j ackeroo, he then read foreign languages at King's College, Cambridge. He travelled in Europe and the United States, publishing his first novel, Happy Valley, in 1939; He lived in the United States for a year, and wrote The Living and the Dead there. Patrick White joined the Royal Air Force in 1940, serving in the Middle East as an intelligence officer. He returned to Australia briefly in 1946, permanently from 1948, living first in Castle Hill and, from 1964, at Centennial Park. His novels, including The Solid Mandala, The Aunt's Story, Voss, The Tree of Man, The Vivisector and The Twyborn Affair, were the subject of critical controversy, but he gradually-even begrudgingly-gained recognition as one of the great modern novelists writing in English and the greatest Australian writer. He wrote in a diversity of forms, including plays, short stories, poems and essays. His eminence was recognised by the award of the 1973 Nobel Prize for Literature. The citation referred to his 'epic psychological narrative art which has introduced a new continent into literature . . . Patrick White for the first time has given the continent of Australia an authentic voice that carries across the world'. The citation referred to his recellt novels 'which show White's unbroken creative power, an ever deeper restlessness, an onslaught against vital problems that have never ceased to engage him, and a wrestling with the language in order to extract all its power and its nuances, to the verge of the unattainable'. He was also named Australian of the Year in 1973. Apart from his creative writing, Patrick White had strong views on a variety of public issues, and he expressed these views with his customary vehemence, even passion. He was on some issues an uncompromising critic of this Government, and it would be hypocritical to pretend otherwise. It was the nature of the man to be bitterly critical when politicians did not see things in the same way he did. But, as his autobiography Flaws in the Glass made clear, his most savage words were directed towards himself. About his literary eminence and the pioneering role he played in gaining international recognition for Australian writing, there is and can be no dispute. He did much good by stealth. It was typical that he should hav.e devoted· his Nobel Prize money to create awards for older Australian writers whose work he felt had not received adequate recognition. Australia has lost one of its greatest citizens, and it is fitting for the Australian Parliament to record his passing in this condolence motion.",10
7,Dr HEWSON,HANSARD REPORT,"The Opposition supports the motion moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). The words that are being expressed today would have made Patrick White feel quite ,uncomfortable. He did not stand easily in the public spotlight. I am reminded that, when White was .awarded the Nobel Prize, he was asked by Gough Whitlam to attend this Parliament and receive the congratulations of the Australian people. He refused, saying: This is the kind of situation to which my does not easily adapt itself. He did not have much time for the trappings of life, and he even donated his Nobel Prize medal and diploma to the Mitchell Library rather than, as he said, leave them in a drawer waiting for burglars. Mr Speaker, for some time. I was a near neighbour of Patrick White in Centennial Park in Sydney, but I cannot say that I ever got to. know him very well. J:Ie was an isolated and aloof man. In hIS own words, he preferred to go it alone, do things his own way. By all accounts, he was difficult and irascible but these things are easily forgiven in a great artist. Great artists are not usually complacent about life. I guess there are two aspects of Patrick White that should be recognised in speaking to a condolence motion. The first was his undoubted eminence as a writer of world standing. The second was· his role, increasingly in his latter years, as a somewhat acid tongued commentator on Australian life and standards. Australia has produced many fine writers but not until Patrick White or since has there been one of such international stature. Patrick White was an author of great distinction. He wrote from Australia on an international level. His books are as relevant to Europe or to America as they are to Australia. He wrote not so much about life in Australia, though his novels were evocative of the character of this country in many ways. He wrote about the great emotions and tensions of humanity. His novels address the fundamental question: what is life all about? It is not my place to offer a critique of Patrick White's literature; merely to note, with respect, that he was a great writer and a great Australian. The second aspect of his character was what Donald Horne has called the 'public intellectual'. Patrick White did not take to the public stage to comment on· current issues until he was nearly 60 years of age. When he did speak out, it was with a cutting directness that wounded the targets of his ire. He did not have much nature time for politicians and many in this House, not least the Prime Minister, have felt the lash of his tongue. Donald Horne put it better than I can when he said in his obituary of Patrick White that he accepted ail artist's responsibility to speak the truth as he saw it. In that line, he spoke with a simplicity, an eloquence, a projection of honesty and a controlled passion of a kind we scarcely ever know in Australia. At times he spoke with a sense of hostility towards what he saw as the petty values of Australians and their politicians. We may feel that his criticism was at times too harsh but I think we can understand and accept that his anger was born out of a great love for this country. Mr Speaker, we may not share Patrick White's pessimism about the quality of Australian life and the future of this nation but we must acknowledge that he was idealistic and had a vision in his own mind about what this country should be. That is an important message that Patrick White left us: have a vision for Australia, a clear view of what this nation's destiny should be and can be. Mr Speaker, apart from these broad observations, I offer no assessment of the work and life of Patrick White. That is contained in the novels and plays that he wrote and on which Australians can and will make their· own judgment. Patrick White's epitaph lies in his own books, which will live on in the culture of this country as memorials to an Australian of a singular talent.",10
8,Mr TIM FISCHER,HANSARD REPORT," Mr Speaker, it is with mixed feelings that I rise to speak in respect of this condolence motion and to support it, following on the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). On the one hand, I have to be honest enough to say that I disagreed with many of the political comments made by Patrick White over a period of time, especially those he chose to make in the Opera House in the early 1970s. On the other hand, I readily recognise that he was an icon in the literary world, a Nobel Prize winner, an extraordinary writer capturing many aspects of his own experiences and building on those. I point out, as indeed the Prime Minister said, Patrick White joined the Royal Air Force in 1940, when he was posted to the Middle East and in fact served as an intelligence officer-logically enough-in Egypt, Syria, Libya, Cyprus, the then Palestine and Greece. Patrick White was demobilised and discharged from the Air Force in London after World War II and then made a fundamental decision to return to Australia temporarily in 1946 and permanently in 1948. It has to be said that where many others would have remained in the northern hemisphere in the particular literary cles of that time, it was Patrick White with a fierce and dogged determination who decided to return to Australia and to remain in Australia. Patrick White, of course, had many connections with the Hunter Valley and subsequently through the novel Voss in his own way highlighted part of the exploration of Australia and highlighted the hardships involved. However, my most profound disagreement with White's view of life relates to his essential pessimism, referred to by Leader of the Opposition, especially in regard to humankind. This underpins much of White's work and political thought. In contrast, I retain an essential-although sometimes den-optimism about both people and life generally, notwithstanding these very tough economic times. In short, White has made a very significant impact on the Australian and international literary world in adding a more complex and comprehensive dimension to Australian writing which, of course, has been valued by the world. On behalf of members of the National Party, I support the motion.",11
9,Mr BARRY JONES,HANSARD REPORT,"Patrick  Program' has it, was one of only three surviving Australian Nobel laureates and .the last to live among us. Sir John Eccles, winner of the 1963 award for medicine, now lives in Switzerland; Sir John Cornforth, the 1975 chemistry laureate, lives in England. Aleksandr Prokhorov is a special case. I first met Patrick White in January 1974. He had been named Australian of the Year for 1973 after the award of his - obel Prize. Somebody from the Australia Day Committee telephoned me. He said, 'We have been told that you are good at handling difficult people and that Patrick White is· a very difficult person; would you be prepared to look after him when he flies down fro11'lt Sydney to Melbourne for the award, pick him up at the airport, entertain him before and after the lunch and put him on his plane?'. I was happy to do it and agreed that he had a legendary reputation for being difficult. But, I asked, should not somebody cir- from the Committee do it? I was told, 'The problem is that nobody on the Committee has read any of his books except The Shoes of the Fisherman. I commented, 'You had better not tell him that'. That Shoes of the Fisherman story was a running joke between us until Patrick White's death. The Australia Day function was a memorable day on which Phillip Adams helped me out. On that day I told Patrick the story that became one of the main elethe ments in The Twyborn Affair. He discomfited his Australia Day hosts by saying that he would saw up his award and give the parts to those he regarded as more deserving: Manning Clark, Barry Humhidphries and Jack Mundey. He was a complicated mixture of public activist and private recluse. His judgment of people and issues was generally harsh and not invariably sound. As he wrote: My pursuit of that razor-blade truth has made me a slasher. Not that I don't love and venerate in several senses-before all, pureness of heart and trustfulness. He did not attend the Nobel Prize ceremony in Stockholm, partly because his asthma was bad, and sent Sidney Nolan, then his close friend, to represent him. Characteristically, as the Pri111e Minister (Mr Hawke) has pointed out, he gave 'away his Nobel money to those who had mor.e need of it. As the Leader of the OPPOSItion (Dr Hewson) pointed out, he declined Gough Whitlam's invitation to be feted at the House of Representatives. In June 1975 he became an original recipient of the Companion of the Order of Australia but, like Nugget Coombs, he returned it in 1976. Be directed that there should be no funeral and hoped that his death could occur without public notice. It is too early to attempt a definitive assessment of his literary achievement and this is not the right forum. Nevertheless, the Age obituary on 1 October 1990 has it right. It stated that he was, 'our Dickens our Balzac, our Joyce, our Faulkner', wh- was 'outside the mainstream of Australian culture at that time', a force for universality and modernity against the prevailing orthodoxies of an 'embarrassing provinciality' and the whiff of social realism. David Malouf, Tom Keneally, Peter Carey and David Williamson owe him a tremendous debt for this. Patrick White brought Australian writing into the great mainstream of Western culture, but, paradoxically, his writing was full of Australian sounds and images. In 1956 he wrote about the Australian scene that greeted him on his return: In all directions stretched the Great Australian emptiness, in which the mind is the least possessions, in which the rich man is the tant man, in which the schoolmaster and the journalist rule what intellectual roost there is, in which beautiful youths and girls stare at through blind blue eyes-in which the buttocks of cars grow hourly glassier, food means cake steak, muscles prevail, and the march of material ugliness does not raise a quiver from the average nerves. Because the void I had to fill was so immense, I wanted to try to suggest . . . every possible aspect of life, through the lives and women. But at the same time. I wanted to discover the extraordinary behind the ordinary, the mystery and the poetry which alone make bearable the lives of such people, and, cidentally, my own life since my return. . Patrick White was a major contributor changing that scene, filling that void. was an innovator long ahead of his time. His play The Ham Funeral was written in 1947, five years before Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godo! and long before Berthold Brecht's works were performed in English. Its successful revival in Sydney in 1989 gave Patrick White great satisfaction and it was seen on television. He wrote of himself: Always something of a frustrated painter and a composer manque, I wanted to give my books the textures of music and sensuousness of paint, to convey what . . . Delacroix and Blake might have seen, what, Mahler \lnd Liszt might have heard. . He wrote: The mystery of life is not solved by success, which is an end in itself, but in failure in perpetual struggle, in becoming. He quotes in The Solid Mandala the epigraph: There is another world, but it is this one. He saw ambivalence in everything, especially himself-'good and evil, body and spirit, joy and suffering, love and hate, life and death, male and, female, dream and actuality, time and eternity', as Joy Hooten put it. He had a deep religious sense and a strong feeling for the numinous. Four myths about Patrick White should be dispelled: that he was misanthropic, misogynous, humourless and difficult. to read. He was not pessimistic about the long term but he had a Swiftian fury about of what was happening in the here 'and now imporso th<\t the long term could be better. I said that he was harsh in his judglife ments, but his impatience was re&erved for those who lived only for rtlflterial valand ues and were preoccupied with the short term, who tolerated cruelty, injustice and prejudice. He was personally generous to many. causes, such as Aboriginal education and the arts, including the gift of many paintings to the New South Wales of ordinary men Art Gallery. He made no secret of his homosexuality could but he enjoyed the company of women. inManoly Lascaris aside, the people in his inner circle of friends were nearly all feto male. He could be bitter and bitchy but He he was also extraordinarily funny with a unique gift for satire and mimicry. My last recollection is of his laughter as we talked barely a month ago. I do not know what effect that had on his lungs: his death resulted from chronic failure of the respiratory system. His themes were often complex, but his style was extraordinarily vivid and lucid. I want to quote two short examples. He said: I sometimes wonder how I would have turned out had I been born a so-called normal heterosexual male. If an artist, probably a pompous one, preening myself in the psychic mirror for being a success, as did the intolerable Goethe, inferior to his self-abnegating disciple Eckermann. My unequivocal male genes would have allowed me to exploit sexuality to the full. As a father I would have been intolerant of my children, who would have hated and despised me, seeing through the great man I wasn't. I would have accepted titles, orders and expected a state funeral in accordance with a deep-seated hypocrisy I had refused to let myself recognise. At one stage he tries to describe the cirit cumstances leading to his death. He was extraordinarily prophetic. This is White's style at its pellucid best: Early morning has always been the best time day. In childhood, gold pouring through the as I got up to raid the pantry for crystallised cherries, finish the heel-tapes on the supper and settle down to the plays of Shakespeare. Now when I wake, the naked window is washed pale. As I use the eye-drops the first bird-notes trickling in. Down in the garden, light is a I'm forced to bow my head whether I not; the early mornings of old age are no setting for spiritual pride. Spiderwebs cling like stockingmasks to faces that blunder into them. point at vanished cats, follow the trail of night's possums. At the end of her lead the bays and threatens to pull me over in a cataract of light, scents, dew. We collect ourselves as it is' ever. possible. If I were to stage the end I would set it upper terrace, not the one moment of any ing, but all that I have ever lived, splintering and coalescing, the washed pane of a false dawn, steamy draperies of Sydney summers, blaring biscus trumpets as well as their exhausted luses, ground mist tugging at the dry grass Centennial steppes, brass bands practising the heat, horses cantering in circles to paniment of shouted commands, liquid calls of hidden birds, a flirt of finches, skittering bulbuls plopping round the stone bath carved by Manoly in the early days at Castle Hill, as in preparation for the (final) moment of grace. I repeat my condolences to his companion Manoly Lascaris, himself a poet, the 'ceneyes, tral mandala' of Patrick's life who tributed uniquely to his creativity. Patrick White will not have a tombstone, but he would have approved the words of his fellow Nobel Laureate W.B. Yeats: On limestone quarried near the spot By his command these words are cut: Cast a cold eye On life, on death. Horseman, pass by!",12
10,Dr KEMP,HANSARD REPORT," Mr Speaker, one suspects that if Patrick White could read the eulogies that were written of him, he would treat with contempt those who disagreed with him but were overblown in their praise. He was, after all, a man who proudly proclaimed that he did not tolerate-in his own word-'bullshit'. Patrick White was a passionate man and he excited strong passions in others. Whilst is proper for us to reflect on this, and I will do so in due course, his lasting gift to the Australian people is his writing. Patrick White's contribution to the of world of literature received the supreme slats accolade; the distance of time will provide the measure of his achievement. At the table, presentation of the Nobel Prize-which Sidney Nolan received, as has been said, are on his behalf-tribute was paid not only glare. to White's originality but also to the Auslike it or tralian character of his work. One cannot follow his career and his Dogs life without seeing him as a torn man, the loving and hating the country in which he dog chose to live. During the whole period of his adolescence and early manhood, from as far the age of 13 to 34, as the Prime Minister said, save for two years only he lived on the outside Australia: as a schoolboy at Chelmorntenham in England; as a student at King's College, which he loved; as a young writer hiwith his first novel Happy Valley in 1939; phaland as an operational intelligence officer of the in the Middle East. It was there that he against began writing The Aunt's Story and met an accomhis Greek friend Manoly Lascaris who of wrens, remained with him throughout his life. On return to Australia in 1946 he conthough ceded that he had never felt such a foreigner. Most Australians, he said, found The Aunt's Story unreadable and, in his the novels which followed-The Tree conof Man and Riders in the Chariot-were scorned. He felt a foreigner in his own country. But he stayed and from his Sydney home he sought, again in his own words, 'the state of simplicity and humility which' is the only desirable one for artist or man'. Whilst passionate, he was a very private man. The accounts of the manner in which he learnt of his award of the Nobel Prize speak of a man who was not a seeker of publicity. On the night the news of the prize broke, he went back to bed rather than cater to the media camped outside his house. His desire for a private life was legendary; interviews and speeches were few and far between. He sought to maintain the increasingly difficult balance between a public persona and a private life. When one looks back at. his last years, it is with some sense of sadness. In the press he was often described as a bitter and angry man, and when one looks at the photos of him in those years-the often bitter grimace-that description is perhaps understandable. He was angered by many aspects of Australian life which most of his fellow Australians valued and celebrated. When Australians of all backgrounds united to celebrate the Bicentenary in their various and different ways, Patrick White described it as 'an Australian lie' and he refused to have anything published during the bicentennial year. Regrettably, Patrick White probably spoke for more of his fellow countrymen when he expressed his disillusion with political leaders and politicians. He delivered tongue-lashings to those politicians whom he believed unduly associated themselves with certain entrepreneurs. Descriptions such as 'would be superstatesmen' and 'toadies' found their way into the headlines. His public statements in those years speak not so much of an enthusiastic involvement in contemporary debate but, rather, of actions moved by disillusion and even despair. In rising to pay my respects today, I do not do so as someone who knew Patrick White personally or agreed with the causes he adopted. We were poles apart-but not so far apart that I am unable to acknowledge and praise the indelible mark he left through the standard of excellence he set in the realm of literature. In winning the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1973, he set an example in this art form to which other Australians can aspire. He continued to lead by example in this field when he used the money from the prize, as the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has said, to establish a fund to reward other writers. Patrick White lived comfortably. He would not want it said that in using the funds in this manner he denied himself a comfortable life. To make such a claim would be to engage in the type of behaviour which 1I have noted he so despised. But it must be said that this was an act of generosity, an act which is still sufficiently uncommon to be noted and an act which has served to encourage the further development of literature in this nation. In the weeks since his death, there has been debate about various aspects of Patrick White's career and work. He enjoyed probing and he was not squeamish about making people uncomfortable. Those whom he criticised and even condemned in his frustration have spoken warmly of him today. It says something for Australia that these addresses of condolence have been delivered in this House, and I support the motion. DrTHEOPHANOUS (Calwell)-In paying tribute to Australia's greatest ,writer, Patrick White, I do not want to traverse the same ground as many other speakers. Suffice it to - ay that I think that ratrick White was a great man in world terms in that, in the tradition of all great writers, he was able to be a philosopher. That is to say, he was able to reflect on and to make his writing reflect on the problems concerning humanity-the social problems and, in particular, the metaphysical problems concerning the nature of human life. In that sense, he was the first writer actually to use the Australian setting to raise these questions in this way, and that is why his works are consid,ered universal. It is very important for us to recognise this because a lot of art in Australia tends to concentrate on parochial things rather than using Australia as a base on which to concentrate on universal themes concerned with general philosophical issues. I know that my friend the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) has raised these questions before but I believe that the example given by Patrick White in this regard is very important and should be followed. Patrick White's great respect for the Aboriginal people is also significant. Although we may have disagreed with the stand he took on the Bicentenary, Patrick White . did understand the Aboriginal people's metaphysical and spiritual links to the land and was able also to identify Australia with some of his higher spiritual concerns. In that sense he has made a very important contribution. I hope that perhaps some lasting memorial to Patrick White can be established by this Parliament or by the Government. It would be good if there were a prize or some other way in which his contribution could be recognised in perpetuity. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places. NA 1996 OLYMPIC GAMES I)r HEWSON-My question is disaid rected to the Prime Minister. Accepting sion that the Hansard record of his answer to the Parliament on 13 September about the Olympic grant to Victoria was incorestimates rect and that what he actually said to Parliament was that the decision to make the grant was 'subject to' an interdepartthe mental committee report on Victorian nances, I ask: why did the Prime Minister mislead the Australian people on the Report that same night when he said, 'the proposals that came up from the Victoreported rian Government were examined by an IDC, including the Department of Opposition Finance, and it was o.n the basis of what they said that we were able to make decision that we did', knowing full well that the Cabinet decision was made in January and the IDC did not report until June? Why did the Prime Minister not tell the Australian people in his media release of 28 January that the $125m grant to Victoria was subject to an IDC report? In order to clear up the confusion about what Cabinet actually decided and also what was communicated to the Victorian Premier, will the Prime Minister table the relevant Cabinet decision of 23 January, his letters to Premier Cain of 7 February and 4 April and any other documentation confirming that the decision to commit funds to the Olympic project was subject to examination by the IDC?",14
11,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is a quite desperate attempt by the Leader of the Opposition to scrape some of the egg off his face. The whole story up until last night was that I had misled the House. That was what the gravamen of the charge was: I had misled the House. Members of the Opposition have fallen flat on their collective faces on that, as has been made clear by the Speaker. There was no such attempt. So now that they have fallen flat on their faces on that one, they are trying desperately to make something out of the statement on the 7.30 Report. Let me make this quite clear. Briefly, Mr Speaker, there is no validity in any claim of deception on the 7.30 Report. I stated there that the Victorian estimates were examined by an IDC and they were indeed examined by an IDe. I also stated that it was on the basis of what the IDC that we were able to make the decito support the Victorian bid-precisely correct. I was intending to convey that the IDC confirmed Victoria's and validated the decision Cabthe inet had made, a decision which I had said was subject to an IDC reporting on Victorian estimates. It is quite clear, fi Mr Speaker, that any ambiguity anyone might want to read into that statement, 7.30 of course, would have been cleared up instantly if the Hansard had accurately my remarks earlier in the day. This is a pathetic attempt by a pathetic to try to scrape some egg off its face. My answer to the Leader of the the Opposition's question is no. NA",16
12,Mr GIBSON,NATIONAL HEALTH STRATEGY,"My question is to the Minister for Community Services and Health. Is the Government undertaking a review of Medicare, or doe- the national health strategy currently. being conducted by Ms Jenny Macklin address a wider range of health issues?",16
13,Mr HOWE,NATIONAL HEALTH STRATEGY,"I thank !he ho-ourable member for Moreton for - IS que-tlOn. The national health strategy IS not Just a review of Me-ica-e. In-eed, to call. it a Medicare revIew IS a mIsnomer. MedIcare itself plays an important part in the health care of Australians. Health, as honourable members will understand, is more than financing and organising of medical and hospital services. The national health strategy under Ms Macklin will address these issues but also look at who uses and who pays for health care and, importantly, health outcomes. As one can see from the terms of reference announced in the Budget the national health strategy is a wide ranging review of Australian health policy and, as such has very broad support. Indeed, the revi-w itself has its genesis in consultations that have taken place between the Commonwealth and the States and has the support of all of the States. I was particularly interested to hear the remarks of the Minister for Health in New South Wales who, I would have to say, is a very strong supporter of the approach taken by the Commonwealth Government. Members would no doubt be interested in a transcript of an interview between the New South Wales Minister, Mr Collins, and John Stanley that took place just last evening. In that interview he refers to the unfortunate fact that Mr Shack apparently wants to get back into the health area. Mr Collins gives some advice, not only to Mr Shack but to members of the Opposition, which I think is worth referring to.",17
14,Mr SPEAKER,NATIONAL HEALTH STRATEGY,The Minister might refer to the member for Tangney by his electorate.,17
15,Mr HOWE,NATIONAL HEALTH STRATEGY,"The member for Tangney. I quote Mr Collins: The best thing that the Federal Opposition can do about health at the moment is to nothing, to see what happens with the review, to see what recommendation comes out of it and which of those are to be implemented and then, and only then I think, are they going to be in a position to formulate any health policy. They are trying to jump the gun with far too little information, and for Peter Shack to try to revive the health policy he lost on, I think that is inexplicable. So Mr Collins is very clear. It is not opportune in fact for members of the Opposition to begin some public debate about health policy. They do not have any credibility. This seventh attempt is one that ought to be Pll;t to one side and the Opposition should do the sensible thing, which is to look at the Macklin review, see what comes out of it, knowing that that will be a solid analysis of policy issues, knowing that the Government will be sensible and sensitive in terms of its implementation of those issues. Then, and only then, the Opposition might get into it. Mr Collins said: I really think for Peter Shack to start buying into the issue at this stage from the back bench, does his party, does the Federal Opposition no good at all and he would do better to leave it alone and let Bob Woods see what happens with the Macklin review. Get right out of it, leave it alone, let the Government work through its sensible review of any health policy issues and then respond. Mr Smith-What are you so worried about?",17
16,Mr SPEAKER,NATIONAL HEALTH STRATEGY,Order! The member for Bass!,17
17,Mr HOWE,NATIONAL HEALTH STRATEGY,"There seems to be some excitement on the part of the Opposition. Perhaps it is on the edge of the seventh policy; that might emerge at this stage rather than at the last minute. Let me say that, in terms of advice, Mr Collins is not the only person in the Liberal Party who has provided sensible advice. The honourable member for Tangney himself has been at certain times prepared to offer advice to his own Party. As he said earlier this year: The Liberal and National Parties don't have a good track record on health. That is the first point. Then he said: We are absolutely committed that we don't resay precisely peat the same mistakes. That was what the honourable member for Tangney said-'absolutely committed that we don't repeat the same mistakes'. Then quite recently, I think on 1 October, in aQdressing the private doctors, the honourab.le member for Tangney had this to say: It is inevitable that in any rearrangement of health care funding there will be a range of winners losers. It is something that must be faced not dodged as in the past. The losers under policythe Shack policywould be those currently relying on the public health care system when they can well afford private insurance. . But ·if we go back to 22 January, Mr Shack said on that occasion: Within the context of any revisions of the scheme and any associated changes in the taxastand tion system, no individual or family will be off. There you have it. You have a sensible tight health policy being developed to deal with Medicare-because Medicare, Peter Collins suggested, is settled, history-but with the issues of current policy in the 1990s in a sensible and rational way, knowing that one will have to make choices and knowing that there may be some people offside. The Governate ment, not only in health but in the whole area of social policy, has proceeded that way: visibly, openly, transparently honestly addressing the issues and then making the decisions. But the honourable member for Tangney represents the probsion lem of the conservative coalition when comes to the point: an inability to make explosion. decisions, an inability to make choices; indeed, an inability to produce a policy at all. When will we see the seventh health policy? NA",17
18,Dr HEWSON,ECONOMY,"My question is again directed to the Prime Minister. Given the conflicting statements anti definitions of some of his senior economic Ministers the current state of the economy, how does the Prime Minister define a recesbeen sion; is the economy in a recession; and, if not, can the Prime Minister assure tralians that a recession will be avoided?",18
19,Mr HAWKE,ECONOMY,"There is a view amongst economists from which I do not resile: if there are two quarters of negative growth in succession they would define that as a recession. I am not concerned to resist that definition. The policies of this Government have been calculated to deal with a very clear problem.. - that is, at the level and of activity existing in the year before last up to, we were simply operating in a way which this the country could not afford. We were generating a flow of imports which we could not sustain and which we could not afford by our own level of productioI1. A significant but very simple statistic is that our expenditure rose by 8 per cent and our production rose by 4 per cent. That is very simple and one does not present need to be a trained economist to underthe significance of it. One could not worse keep an economy going with that disparity. So we had in place an appropriately monetary policy, a tight fiscal policy, not and a tight wages policy-which has alas ways eluded the Opposition. This is distinct from the Opposition's health mismanagement in 1982-83 when the Leader of the Opposition was described by Mr Stone as 'a meretricious player upon the scene'. That is a quite appropridescription and one with which Opposition members could not cavil because in from their point of view they know that and Mr Stone always tells the truth. their involvement at that stage was one which plunged this country into its worse recesin 50 years. That was because' they, it did not have a wages policy but a wages We have a wages policy and as a result of the deliberate application of that wages policy, that monetary policy and that fiscal policy, we have induced a slowing down of this economy. That has been deliberate because, as the Leader of the Opposition should know, if we 'had not had the courage to implement those policies, the alternative for this country would on have been infinitely worse. As we have shown in seven and a half years, we have prepared to apply those economic policies relevant to the condition of this Auscountry which emerged from either internal or external circumstances. We make no apology for that. We believe that in this year we have shown a flexibility which has been reflected in a four percentage point reduction in official interest rates and that shows our preparedness to ease monetary policy. But we are not &oing to precipitately .further. ease that. polley and in so doing Jeopard-se t-e gams that we are making on the mflahon and balance of payments front. NA",18
20,Mr MARTIN,INTEREST RATES,I refer the Treasurer to his recent commentary regarding the level of interest rates charged by Australian banks. Is it correct that there is evidence that banks have increased their margins in recent times? What are the Government's intentions on this matter?,19
21,Mr KEATING,INTEREST RATES,"Last week I publicly indicated the results of a Treasury-Reserve Bank analysis of recent trends in bank lending margins. In summary, they showed that there was clear evidence that bank margins had widened since the end of 1989. To date the rise in average margins has increased bank revenue by $160m above what it otherwise would have been. However, if these greater margins were maintained, their effect would be to increase bank revenue by around $l,OOOm in a full year. That would almost totally compensate for the impact of the increase of bad debts on bank books, estimated to be around $1,200m in the year up to the June and September quarters of 1990. However, as I said last week, I am confident that the banks will not maintain undue margins and that the full effects of the Government's progressive easing in monetary policy in 1990 will be passed on to bank customers. I intend asking the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, chaired by the questioner, to conduct an inquiry into how competition has improved Australian banks and to determine whether the benefits of competition are being passed on to all customers. I note the confused stance of the Opposition in response to this inquiry, the evidence being the catcalling that met this question. The first hint of that was the fact that the Leader of the Opposition already seems to have made up his mind that the banks can do no wrong and that there is no need for a parliamentary inquiry. In contrast, the shadow Treasurer says that he has no problem with an inquiry, while the Leader of the National Party criticises the banks and the business community generally in very extreme terms. In fact, the Leader of the Opposition said on the subject on Channel Nine's Sunday program on 30 September: Nobody is being screwed by the banks. He then went on to say at the Hilton Hotel on 4 October: ' Hethat is medoesn't need a Parliamentary Committee . . . they don't charge higher interest rates than they need to because they compete amongst themselves . . . On the same Channel Nine program he said: . . . we have a very competitive banking system . . . But the shadow Treasurer, when asked, said: . . . I don't have any problems if they want to have an inquiry. , The questioner said: But you can't deny that farmers and people in small business have been complaining about some banking practices can you?'. The shadow Treasurer then said: No, I'm not denying it. Then the Leader of the National Party said: The banks have a lot to answer for. The business cowboys who have been guilty of fraudulent activity have a great deal to answer for. Ned Kelly is alive and well in the 1990s. He just comes with a white collar and a management fee structure, and these things do have to be examined . . . I simply give those quotes to illustrate the point that there is total confusion on the part of members of the Opposition about whether or not they believe that banks have been widening their margins and whether there is any case for an inquiry by the House of Representatives committee into the matters I mentioned. What is most interesting of all is the Leader of the Opposition, no doubt drawing upon his wide banking experience, telling us that nobody is being screwed by the banks and that we do not need a parliamentary inquiry. He should try telling that to small, medium and large businesses in this country. NA",19
22,Mr REITH,INTEREST RATES,"My question is to the Treasurer and I refer him to his just repeated attack on the banks and his basic claim that they have not lowered their interest rates because of their alleged need to cover losses on loans made in recent years. I ask him why the Commonwealth Bank, with its relative lack of bad debts, has not lowered its interest rates.",20
23,Mr KEATING,INTEREST RATES,"The Commonwealth Bank has, on most occasions when, we have adjusted monetary policy since January, led the market down. It has had the lowest prime rates, as far as I know, of any of the commercial banks. I am not here to give a commentary about the Commonwealth's rates in particular or those of the others. But the figures I gave the Parliament just a moment ago reflect on the banks in aggregate. So I am not entirely sure of the state of the Commonwealth Bank's book or what interest rates it charges in its administrative rate structure. But, in terms of prime rates, the Commonwealth Bank has led the other banks down. The Commonwealth Bank is, of course, a commercial bank-a point that I have made to a lot of my colleagues in the Australian Labor Party-and it has one of the finest boards in the country. It is managed by that board and its management. It does so to run a commercial operation to produce profits which, of course, 'it pays to the Commonwealth Budget. NA",20
24,Mr LANGMORE,OIL PRICES,"My question is to the Minister for Science and Technology in his capacity as Minister Assisting the Treasurer. On the basis of his participation in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank annual meetings in Washington a fortnight ago, is he able to advise the House about the arrangements that the Fund and the Bank have made to assist countries on the front line with Iraq and to support the most severely affected oil importing countries?",20
25,Mr CREAN,OIL PRICES,"I did, as the honourable member indicated, have the opportunity to represent the Government at the recent IMF-World Bank meetings. It is important to point out that this meeting occurred against the background, obviously, of the Gulf crisis and the fact that the Gulf crisis has added to the risk of inflationary pressures and to the prospects for slower growth. But, in an'swering the honourable member's question, it is important that we put this risk into some perspective. The IMF's revised forecasts for oil prices are that there will be an average price for 1990 of $US26 a barrel; thereafter it will decline and it is anticipated that it will be $US21 a barrel by the end of 1991. Having said that, it is recognised that that will have something of an inflationary impact, but the important point to note is that these increases are significantly lower than the increases recorded as a consequence of the previous two oil shocks. So in magnitude they are less. Secondly, since those two oil shocks of the 1970s, the international economy has adapted significantly in terms of both more flexible economies and economies being less reliant on oil. However, coming to the specifics of the honourable member's question, it is important against that background and perspective to understand that it is recognised by the IMF and the World Bank that there are some poorer countries and front line countries that could be affected by the current crisis. This point was specifically alluded to by the managing director of the IMF, Mr Camdessus, in his opening comments, and the World Bank announced on 25 September the following initiatives to assist the countries affected by the Gulf crisis: firstly, a program of emergency assistance to help deal with the resettlement of returning workers and their reintegration into the economy; secondly, an acceleration of disbursements from existing loans and credits, increased cost sharing and advancing lending operations; and, thirdly, assistance to borrowers in designing suitable policy responses to the crisis. The Bank is following the situation closely. Further options are under consideration, particularly if the crisis is prolonged. Finally, I point out a segment of the communique that the interim committee of the IMF issued that is important in responding to the honourable member's question: The funds should respond on an expedited basis to present difficulties through use and, as priate, adaptations of its existing instruments, including access to stand-by and extended arrangements, the Compensatory and Contingency Financing Facility and the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility. NA",20
26,Mr REITH,INTEREST RATES,"I refer the Treasurer to his last answer and his statement that the Commonwealth has effectively this year been a market setter. I refer him to a conflicting statement which he made in the Independent Monthly of 16 October, which says-",21
27,Mr HAWKE,INTEREST RATES,Which October?,21

He states: The Commonwealth Bank has not been particularly a market setter and has not been putting the kind of competitive pressures on private banks that it has the strength to do. Can the Treasurer reconcile' these conflicting statements?",21
31,Mr KEATING,INTEREST RATES,"They were not conflicting. That is the point I made here about it being a commercial bank. It is not a philanthropic institution. It is not out there losing money. What I said was that, in terms of primes, it led the market down on a couple of occasions; that is true. Opposition members-Ha, hal",21
32,Mr KEATING,INTEREST RATES,"We have only adjusted them four times. I cannot recall here and now whether they were first down on four occasions, but I well remember them being down first at least on a couple-I think probably most, but I will check. In terms of their administrative rate structure, I have no doubt that the capacity of small and medium business to move from one bank to another is very seriously limited. The chances of people taking their mortgages and moving them with all the stamp duty costs to another bank are very limited. Therefore, I think those in the higher areas of the administrative structure appro- probably are anchored. - do not think the Commonwealth Bank in particular gives them any more relief than do any of the other three commercial banks. It may well be that the honourable member is telling me it should but, if he is saying it should, what he is arguing is that the Commonwealth Bank should not really be a commercial bank; it should be a bank which is responding to Government policy. It is a commercial bank, and I am quite happy to repeat the point I made in that interview. I said in the previous answer that I had said to some of my colleagues in the Labor Party that the Commonwealth Bank is a commercial bankanq those who have a romantic view of it being out there like some sort' of Robin Hood organisation, helping those in difficulties in the higher orders of the administrative rates structure, are having themselves on. That is the point I made. But because I never spelt it out, because I did not put it up in lights, the Opposition did not understand what I.said. That does not surprise me. NA",21
33,Mr HOLLIS,JOINT COAL BOARD,Can the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy inform the House of the status of the review of the Joint Coal Board (JCB)?,21
34,Mr KERIN,JOINT COAL BOARD,"I thank the honourable member for his question. He takes a keen interest in the coal industry, which now makes up 13 per cent of Australia's total exports, valued at something like $6.2 billion this year-that is another 5 per cent increase. Coal exports have increased by about $1. 5 billion over the past two years. It is an industry undergoing quite a lot of rapid change, by the work force particularly. Since 1986-87, employment has declined by almost 14 per cent and it is an industry where a lot of change has been in place. This industry contributes to the high standard of living enjoyed by all Australians, and the honourable member will understand the pivotal role that the industry plays in the regional economy, particularly on the south coast. We need in this industry to maintain competitiveness. We need to have in place the very best structures. The Joint Coal Board is an instrument set up by the New South Wales and Commonwealth governments. There has been a vacancy on the Board of that organisation for some time, as the industry representative. The New South Wales Premier, in a letter to the Prime Minister, indicated, or clearly stated, that he would not replace the industry representative on the Joint Coal Board-it is a three-man board-nor when Mr Wilcox's term expired, Mr Wilcox being the Chairman, would he replace him. So there would have been one person on a coal board of three. Even though it is the policy of the New South Wales and Commonwealth Liberal parties to wipe out the Joint Coal Board and the Coal Industry Tribunal, we advised the Premier in turn that we would not contemplate giving up the legislation. The JCB had been reviewed on quite a few occasions and certainly had a role to fulfil. . The New South Wales Government proposed a· review of the functions and activities of the JCB in July of this year, and the Commonwealth Government agreed, mainly so that the JCB knows cost? exactly where it is. The terms of reference have been discussed with and accepted by change rate? the United Mineworkers Federation of Australia and the New South Wales Coal  Minister in New South Wales, and I have had quite a few discussions about it. The review is to be a genuine one. It is to be a thorough investigation with no question. predetermined conclusions. The particular role of the JCB should be clearly defined. The New South Wales Government has a particular view about the JCB and his seat. what it does about purely industry decisions. I think there is a very important role being played by the JCB, particularly with respect to the health, safety and welfare of the people in the industry. It is also trusted by both sides in many disputes. The Commonwealth view is that we want to put this beyond contention between the two governments and try to get things on a track so that the people who work there understand that the Board is there and that it has a real job to do. We believe as a general principle that the operations of all statutory organisations should be both efficient and effective in meeting defined objectives. Our principal concern in agreeing to the review is to ensure that the most efficient infrastructure of industry support, regulation and employee welfare is in place. The review, I would emphasise, is limited to the JCB and will not include the role and· functions of the Coal Industry Tribunal. Mr Speaker, if it is in order, I simply wish to table the terms of reference for this inquiry, which has been announced by both governments. NA",21

40,Mr GRACE,CAPITAL GAINS TAX,"Is the Treasurer aware of a growing community consensus in supretrospective port of a fair and equitable tax system, including the retention of a capital gains tax? What are the Government's intentions in regard to a capital gains tax?",23
41,Mr KEATING,CAPITAL GAINS TAX,"I am aware of the high level of support for a fair and equitable what taxation system which was confirmed in when the last election when the Opposition campaigned, again, on the abolition of a in capital gains tax. This Government has done all that it can do to reduce tax rates. As I said in the House recently, Australia is now the third lowest taxed country in bor-· the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development league table.' This is reflected in the declines in the marginal rates of tax which have been introduced and also in measures to make the tax to system fairer-including a capital gains tax. Of course, having introduced it, the Government is committed to retaining a capital gains tax as an important part of is that fair and equitable taxation system. It may even be that the Opposition is changing its position in relation to the capital gains tax. In his speech in reply to 5 the Budget the Leader of the Opposition failed to make any comment at all about the Opposition's previous commitment to abolish the capital gains tax-even though he went through a litany of changes that he had proposed at the election., In 199091, estimated revenue from the capital its gains tax is $775m-an increase of 42 per over 1989-90. If ,one were to extrapolate that· rate of increase, were that to to 1993-94, one wpuld find that capital gains tax would generate over If the Opposition were elected to government and abolished the capital gains there would be a windfall of at least that much per year going to taxpayers. delBut it should not be forgotten that the Opposition stated that its position was to remove the capital gains tax retrospecthe tively to 1985. This means that if someone purchased an asset after September bit 1985 and the Opposition 'happened to be ,elected to office at the next election then capital gains accrued on that aSset, which would currently be taxable, would suddenly be .tax free-that is, an eight-year windfall would accrue to that taxpayer. Indeed, the revenue would suffer to the extent of all accumulated gains accrued in the period since. While we are talking about the $775m this year, I should point out that that is only on realised capital gains. The fact is that all assets turned over after September 1985 have a capital gains tax accrual there; they are realised only on sale. But if the Opposition were to turn back that measure to 1985 not only would the Commonwealth and the rest of the tax paying public lose the $775m, which by then would probably be a couple of billion dol- , lars, but they would also lose the billions locked up in accrued capital gains increases subject to tax. Yet this very unfair policy continues to be the policy of the Opposition. The number of taxpayers affected by the capital gains tax is minimalc...:....more than 40 per cent comes from taxpayers with incomes in excess of $75,000. Last year 7.9 million returns were lodged and only 134,000, or 1.7 per cent, had taxable capital gains. A senior Australian Taxation Office official, an Assistant Commissioner, recently said in a Business Review Weekly interview:, We expect the tax to net no more than 3 per cent sion. of taxpayers when fully on-stream. It is incumbent upon the Opposition to clarify its position on the capital gains tax, to tell us whether, if it were to assume office, it would provide an eightyear retrospective benefit to taxpayers and whether it would unlock billions of contingent capital gains tax liabilities for a very thin slice of the tax paying population. The Leader of, the Opposition said that he has been frank about his policies; time is long overdue when he ought to be frank on this very important subject. NA NA",23

These Ausinclude the recent signing of a lease and sales agreement with the Saley-CloughComPhosphate Resources joint venture which will enable the recommencement of phosof phate mining operations and the provision of funds for rehabilitation and the removal of mining infrastructure. The recommencement of mining has and provided very direct benefits to the island Assembly community. For example, the island resimajor dents, through the Union of Christmas Island Workers, have gained a 40 per cent equity in the venture. It will create lots jobs for the residents of Christmas Island and will make a very significant contribution to the overall infrastructure cost within the island as well as, of course, dealing with some of the environmental island will be reduced because issues concerned with the rehabilitation of previously mined areas and the moval of the mining infrastructure. There has also been the first auction commercial properties on the island, which will enable the establishment of new private sector businesses, the comwhere mencement of a tender process for the sale of the Christmas Isiand supermarket, and the gazettal of guidelines under the lands ordinance enabling island residents deal of pride. to buy their own homes. I think this is a very important program because the housing sales program is the first. opportunity that the residents of Christmas land have had to own their own homes on the island. As I am sure most honourcast able members here would appreciate, the fact that somebody has the opportunity to own his own home does give him an enormous stake in the future of the land. There has also been the negotiation of a new agreement with the casino developer enabling the project to proceed, hopefully without too much further delay, he didorhe and the casino developer has agreed to the inclusion of a performance bond within the new agreement that is being drafted between the Commonwealth and the developer. This will provide an opI port unity. for the development on the land to proceed very quickly.

Mr Fife- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. For the guidance of members of this House, will you rule on that kind of conduct?",26
51,Mr SPEAKER,HONOURABLE MEMBER FOR,"On the point of order raised by the honourable member for the Hume, I made the point privately to the honourable member for Page that he misunderstood the proceedings of the House, and that when people rise on the adjournment whoever catches my eye gets the call. My many talents do not include that of a mind-reader. I was not aware that the honourable member for Page had something to say about the third runway. If he thought I was preventing him from speaking because I hold one point of view, . as the honourable member for Hume and most other members in this House would know, that would be a completely erroneous position for me to take, and I would not have done so. I think the more debate there is on the third runway the more people will see that the view that the honourable member for Barton and I hold is the correct one. If the honourable member for Page, like other honourable members, rises then he, like other honourable members, will get the call in accordance with how he catches the Speaker's eye. Mr Fife- Mr Speaker, further on the point of order, I asked whether you would rule on that kind of conduct. In other words, I was specifically asking whether you regard it as being in order for a member to go outside this House and to reflect upon the activities, actions and decisions of the Speaker.",26
52,Mr SPEAKER,HONOURABLE MEMBER FOR,"I think if the honourable member for Hume had recalled some of the things he said in this House earlier he would know that changes have been made to the Parliamentary Privileges Act. One can go outside of the House, as o-e of the honourable member's colleagues did with my predecessor, and make terrible reflections on such a person. If it is done outside of the House now, with the changes to the Privileges Act, one can say anything with impunity. However, as I said I made it quite clear to the honourable member for Page that I thought his accusations were wrong and they did not reflect the reason that he did not get the call. But the honourable member for Hume should be aware that things that are said outside of the House now, while one might disagree with them or not like them, are not subject to the provisions that they used to be. Mr Fife-Further on the point of order, I am as well aware as you are-and as the Prime Minister is-that there have been some changes in relation to privilege. I was not referring to privilege; I was referring to whether you regard the action of the"" honourable member for Page as being appropriate for a member of the House of Representati ves.",26
53,Mr SPEAKER,HONOURABLE MEMBER FOR,"You asked me originally whether I would make a·ruling on what the honourable member said. I cannot make rulings on what members do outside this House. My predecessor would have loved to have made some rulings on what the honourable member for O'Connor said. Other members on the Opposition side would like me to have made rulings on what members on the Government side say. I cannot control what people do outside here. I can do a good job of controlling what they do and say in the Parliament and if the honourable member for Page was silly enough to come in here and say what he said in the Saturday Herald he might find himself outside pretty quickly. I think we have covered this far enough. I will give one more indulgence to the honourable member for Hume and then we might get on with ministerial statements. Mr Fife- Mr Speaker, I ask you to make it clear as to whether members of the House of Representatives may now go outside this House and make comment about your conduct or the conduct of any of your successors in this House.",27
54,Mr SPEAKER,HONOURABLE MEMBER FOR,"The actions of, I think, a previous member for North Sydney-the Clerk may confirm whether I ani right-made it quite clear that one can reflect on the Speaker outside the House, unfortunately, with impunity. I would be very happy if the House would like to change those rules so that we might bring statements made by the Speaker or other members outside the House into this chamber, but we cannot. Mr Howard interjecting",27
55,Mr SPEAKER,HONOURABLE MEMBER FOR,I said I think it was a former member for North Sydney. There were other statements made. I think we have covered this far enough. I think the honourable member for Page has learnt the mistake that he made as well. NA  wish to make a personal explanation;,27
56,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented? ,27
57,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"The honourable member may proceed.  two articles appearing on Thursday, 27 September, under the by-line of Craig Johnstone, one in the Daily Telegraph at, I think, page two, and the other in the Melbourne Sun at page 13, both of which accuse me of having used a VIP aircraft to travel from Hamilton Island to Brisbane via Townsville. Mr Speaker, this is incorrect. Neither my wife nor I went to Hamilton Island on a VIP aircraft or any other way. In fact, we have never done so-a poor error by Mr Johnstone, the person concerned. The matter arose when, in fact, I took a VIP flight from Townsville on 26 August to Brisbane and back to Townsville on the same day. The reason for the trip was simply that I was co-hosting, firstly, in Townsville the Festival of Pacific Arts as the then Minister for the Arts and Territories-not as the Minister for Aviation, as reported in the two· articles-a festival which, as you would know, Me. Speaker, had in it a great many representative nations from our South Pacific neighbours. On that day also, 16 August, I was committed-obligated, indeed-to be in Brisbane that night for the opening of the Gold of the Pharaohs exhibition, an engagement of very great importance in the Australian-Egyptian . relationship and obviously one which I also had ministerial responsibility for as the Minister for Arts. The journalist's error arises due to a failure on his part to read the top of the schedule of special purpose flights, which contains a note whereby it makes it very clear that on the schedule those destinations underlined denote the special purpose portion of the travel. In my case the Hamilton Island to Townsville leg is very clearly not underlined-that was the point of departure for the aircraft from somebody else's use. Unfortunately, this did not also stop further misrepresentation of me in parrot fashion on radio 2BL on 27  quoted almost word for word the Sun paragraph. I trust this corrects the record. NA",27

NA TO NEW CALEDONIA, THE SOUTH PACIFIC FORUM, PAPUA NEW NA Ministerial Statement",28
59,Mr HAWKE,GUINEA AND JAPAN,"by leave-I wish to report to the House on four important visits I have undertaken recently within the Asia-Pacific region. Those visits were to New CaleI donia between 27 and 29 July; to thSouth Pacific Forum held in Port Vila, Vanuatu from 30 July to 1 August; to Papua New Guinea between 2 a'nd 6 September; and to Japan between 16 and September. The South Pacific Forum is the preeminent regional body which brings totendance gether each year leaders from Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific Island counable tries. New Caledonia lies within our mediate region, while Papua New Guinea is not only Australia's closest neighbour, but a country with which we share impormajor tant historical, economic and strategic terests. Japan is, of course, one of the world's great economic powers and, our visits. relationship with it is one of Australia's most vital. While each visit raised important issues of its own, a number of recurring and complementary themes emerged from this intensive period of regional contact. instance, in Tokyo I pursued with Prime in 1941. Minister Kaifu and his Ministers Australia's concern to see decisive movement the Uruguay Round negotiations, which are about to enter their final stage. I Japan to show true leadership, and thus exert pressure on the other majors-the European Community and the United States-by further liberalising import controls on agricultural products, espeMayor cially rice, not because Australia itself a significant rice producer on a world scale, but because such a step would far-reaching, symbolic importance at this vital stage of the Uruguay Round negotiations. These negotiations are of real importance to all countries around the world, especially to those of our South Pacific and South East Asian neighbours belonging to the Cairns Group. Japan acknowledges the fact that the Uruguay Round negotiations will fail unless vital matters relating to agriculture are sensibly addressed. Similarly, leaders at the South Pacific Forum expressed satisfaction with the progress made over the 12 months in mobilising support against the obnoxious practice of driftnet fishing and urged other countries to be- , come party to the Wellington Convention. was able - to take that message personally to Japan, which has suspended driftnet fishing operations in the South Pacific. I told - apan's leaders that the suspension , was welcome in the region but that our 20 goal remained-and rightly so-a worldwide ban. Also, against the background of my atat the South Pacific Forum and of my visit to Papua New Guinea, I was to urge Japan to expand its construcimtive investment and development assistance in the region. The Island economies are in need of it, and it is important that donors such as Australia and Japan inmaintain close and continuing dialogue. Let me now report in turn on each of my New Caledonia The visit 'to New Caledonia at the invitation of Prime Minister Rocard was the first to the territory by an, Australian For Prime Minister since Mr Robert Menzies My program included meetings with Mr in Louis Le Pensec, the French Minister for Overseas Departments and Territories, urged and with New Caledonian political leaders, including the President of the Territorial Congress, and leaders of the Southern, Northern and Loyalty Islands provinces. I also had discussions with the of Noumea, with the President of is the FLNKS, Mr Neaoutyine, and the widow of the assassinated former Presihave dent of the FLNKS, Madame Tjibaou. I was thus able to have discussions with a very wide range of New Caledonian leaders, representative of the whole political spectrum. I was greatly impressed by the positive and constructive change in New Caledonia that has followed the signing of the Matignon Accords. All those involved in the Matignon process-President Mitterrand and Prime Minister Rocard, the independentist groups, and those who want a continuing constitutional link with France-deserve great credit for the way in which they have set aside old animosities and are working together to broaden New Caledonia's economic and political base. This will allow a genuine act of determination to be made in 1998, leading to a viable long term political status for the territory. I offered Australia's continuing help in this process, including assistance in ing young New Caledonians, broadening our economic links and encouraging, where we can, New Caledonia's links with the wider Pacific community. I made it clear that, notwithstanding differences of policy over French nuclear testing and over the European Community's. agricultural policieS-differences which' I clearly restated-and whatever the outcome in New Caledonia, Australia believes that France has a constructive and welcome political, cultural and economic role to play in this part of the world. At the South Pacific Forum I was able to brief other leaders about my visit to New Caledonia. This was very muc,h welcomed because, as honourable members will know, it remains an issue of great interest throughout the region. South Pacific Forum As is my practice at Forum meetings, I was able to have valuable bil<tteral discushas sions with a range of South Pacific leaders, including Prime Minister Lini of Vanuatu and Ratu Mara of Fiji. The Forum again demonstrated its practical relevance to the needs and concerns of the Pacific states. A wide range of regional issues was discussed in the usual frank and informal way, including matters relating to the environment, fisheries and regional multilateral organisations. In particular, the United States Government's plans to dispose of chemical weapons stocks at the facility it has constructed.on Johnston Atoll was the subject of understandably lively debate. Some island leaders expressed concern for the safety aspects of the project. Others were concerned that the Pacific was coming to be seen as a dumping ground for the industrial waste of developed countries. I put to my colleagues Australia's view that the Johnston facility would help to resolve a serious existing ,environmental selfproblem-the deterioration of the stock of chemical weapons on Johnston Atoll-and would also help rid the world of these devastating weapons by making more possible the comprehensive global trainban on their construction and use, for which, as you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, Australia, under this Government, has worked so hard. Let me say that I totally reject the absurd notion being peddled by some that the destruction of chemical weapons on Johnston Atoll is somehow akin to the testing of nuclear devices at Mururoa. I fully agreed with all Forum leaders that the Pacific should not become a waste dump, and that once the weapons at present on the island, those that may be found elsewhere in the region, and those being transhipped from Europe, were destroyed, the facility should be closed down. We welcomed, therefore, the assurance of the , United States Government that it had no plans to extend the life of the facility beyond its current program. We also welcomed the United States' offer to discuss the facility in detail with Forum leaders and I am pleased to say that a delegation since held useful talks in Washington. Papua New Guinea The visit, which included discussions with Prime Minister Namaliu and his Ministers, Opposition Leader Wingti and a range of provincial a-d business leaders, was the most extensIVe undertaken to Papua New Guinea by an Australian Prime Minister since 1976. As well as port Moresby, I visited Mount Hagen, Madang and Rabaul. The welcome at each of those provincial centres was nothing short of overwhelming, and symbolised in the most dramatic and colourful of ways the great depth of the relationship between our two countries. The relationship with Papua New Guinea remains one of our most important. Papua New Guinea is the largest recipient of Australia's bilateral aid; it is the fourth largest export market for Australia's manufactured products; it is our sixth largest overseas investment destination, with total net investments of about $1.8 billion, a figure whiCh could be well in excess of $4 billion if major resource projects in Papua New Guinea proceed as planned. Over 11,000 Australians reside in Papua New Guinea and, over the past decade, some 2,000 Papua New Guineans have studied here under Australian Gove-ment scholarships and training awards. Since 1983 my Government has worked hard to develop constructively and positively the relationship with our nearest neighbour. Ip December 1987 I signed with . then Prime Minister Wingti the landmark Joint Declaration of Principles. In May last year I signed with Prime Minister Namaliu a five-year development assistance agreement. During my visit to Port Moresby an agreement for the protection. and promotion of investment was signed. ' The Joint Declaration of Principles spelled out that the relationship between Australia and Papua New Guinea is one between two independent nations each responsible for its own destiny. A fundamental purpose of my visit to Papua New Guinea at this time was. to underline this simple but vital fact, the significance of which is still sometimes not fully grasped and understood in parts of Papua New Guinea, Australia and elsewhere. Throughout my visit,. I stressed that Australia had no wish to intervene in solving Papua New Guinea's problems. If effective solutions are to be found, they must be solutions which emerge' from within Papua New Guinea and are implemented by Papua New Guineans. It is neither possible nor desirable to turn the clock back. I also said it was important that the. relationship between the two countries be taken forward very much within the context of the economic dynamism of the Asia-Pacific region and that Australia looked forward to the time when Papua New Guinea could itself become a member of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (AP,EC). The totality of my message was well understood and, indeed, welcomed by Papua New Guinea's leadership. For his part, Prime .Minister Namaliu said that his Government wanted to speed up the shift in the balance of our aid program away from budget support and towards the mOre usual project support, with a view to the form,er being phased out. by the end of this decade. I welcomed that goal and officials from, the two countries will be taking the matter forward in the lead-up to the scheduled 1992 review of the current Development Assistance Agreement. ' None of this means that Australia is walking away from Papua New Guinea. Both countries are too important to each other. fO.r that to be allowed' to happen, and It IS clear from my Government's actions over the past seven' years that is not our policy. Australia and Papua New Guinea remain enduring friends and committed partners. Honourable inembers will be aware of the enormous problems faced by Papua New Guinea over the past 18 months, the most significant of which, of course, have been those on Bougainville and the 'subsequent closure of the Bougainville Copper Ltd mine at Panguna. That closure led, in one blow, to Papua New Guinea losing 37 per cent of its export income and 17 per cent of its budget revenue. The requirement for fundamental adjustment on the part of the Papua New Guinean Government and its people was obvious. Throughout my visit I was struck by the realistic appreciation and acceptance of the challenge. There was no attempt to turn away from it or to pretend that it was not there. And, to date, this attitude has been. reflected in the implementation by the Papua New Guinean Government of the Structural Adjustment Program agreed with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, and in which Australia has played a significant role. Prime Minister Namaliu and his Ministers and the people of Papua New Guinea are to be congratulated for this realistic commitment. The problem of Bougainville does, of course, remain. In my discussions in Port Moresby, I reiterated the Australian Government's position that Bougainville should remain an integral part of Papua New Guinea and that we fully support the Papua New Guinean Government's commitment to a political solution. I also reiterated our willingness to assist in the rehabilitation of Bougainville once an agreement has been worked out. I raised again the Australian Government's concern about reported human rights abuses, both by the Papua New Guinean authorities and the Bougainville Revolutionary Army. In this context, I am disappointed that Bougainville leaders have, to date, declined the offer by the Papua New Guinean Government to invite an outside body to investigate allegations involving both sides. Prime Minister Namaliu and his Ministers outlined frankly the problem confronting Papua New Guinea in law and order, a problem impinging on Australians themselves living in Papua New Guinea and a problem which, if left unchecked, would complicate the task of attracting much needed foreign investment. We agreed to examine the challenges confronting Papua New Guinea in the 1990s, with a view to determining how best the authorities there might meet the challenges and how Australia might best assist. It is planned that both sides will in a position to pursue discussions further once the initial studies have been completed by the end of October. Lastly, I discussed with Prime Minister Namaliu the heartening progress which has been made on the vital work of reforming Papua New Guinea's Constitution to allow the maintenance of more stable parliamentary majorities between elections. We should not forget that, while Papua New Guinea faces a complicated mix of problems, it is also a country rich in resources, both material and human. My visit to the Porgera goldmine and my talks with many Papua New Guineans from all walks of life around the provinces gave me ample evidence of that. With determined leadership and with continued assistance, from Australia and its other friends, there is no reason to believe that Papua New Guinea cannot realise its significant potential. Japan Melbourne's bid for the 1996 Olympics occupied the first two days of my visit to Japan. Honourable members are, of course, aware of the outcome of that bid. Atlanta is to be congratulated and I am sure its people will stage a most successful Games to mark the centenary of the modern Olympics. At the same time, all Australians should feel immensely proud with the effort made on their behalf by the Melbourne Olympic Committee and by the many people, including, I acknowledge, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), who put in so much effort to secure the Games. That· the bid was not successful was not, in any way, a reflection on their effort and dedication or on the excellence of the bid itself. My two days of discussions in Tokyo encompassed talks with Prime Minister Kaifu and, separately, his Ministers for Foreign Affairs, Finance, International Trade and Industry, and Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. I also met with former Prime Minister Takeshita and with the chairperson of the Japan Socialist Party, Ms Doi. I addressed a meeting of the Australia-Japan Dietmembers' Leabe gue, and 600 senior Japanese businessmen who were attending the annual All Japan Chambers of Commerce. I met separately with a dozen or so of Japan's foremost business leaders. The relationship with Japan is of the highest priority for Australia. Not only is Japan's economy of global importance but, during this decade we will see Japan assume an increasingly important political role in world affairs, something which my Government welcomes and· to which I shall return later. But over and above our many shared global an- reg-onal interests, th- - ilateral relationshIp wIth Japan stands m Its own right. Two-way trade with Japan is now worth over $23 billion a year, with Japan being Australia's largest trading partner and Australia being Japan's sixth largest trading partner. Japanese investment in Australia is worth over $36 billion or about 15 per cent of total foreign investment in Australia and has increased by over 70 per cent.since 1986-87. Japan is an important source of tourism for Australia, with visitors numbering about 350,000 in 1989. Impressive as these figures are, we aspire to an even more diversified and rich relationship with Japan. For instance, as I pointed out in Japan, of the $9 billion currently invested by Japan in Australia, some 92 per cent is invested in tourism and real estate. Tourism is a major growth industry for us. But we do not see ourselves solely as a purveyor of leisure services; nor do we see particular economic advantage in selling real estate as an end in itself. It is time, in short, for Japan be more creative in its approach to investment in Australia and to joint ventures with us. The bilateral relationship is well managed within the framework of the Australia-Japan Ministerial Committee and my visit provided an opportunity to promote a further broadening and deepening. Mr Kaifu shared this objective, and it has been agreed that the existing Science and Technology Agreement will be revised so that cooperation under it can encompass not only pure research but also important areas of applied science. It was also agreed that officials would explore areas of further cooperation in clean coal technologies-the brown coal liquefaction project at Morwell in Victoria being a good example of what is possible. Against the background of the fundamental changes made to the Australian economy since 1983, I discussed wj-h Mr Kaifu, his economic Ministers and with Japanese business leaders, the mutual benefits to be gained through increased investment in the Australian manufacturing sector. In this context, I am pleased to be able to report that the Japanese Government and business leaders continue to take a very positive approach to the further development of the multifunction polis, or MFP, as made clear through their: welcoming of Adelaide as the location for the MFP; agreement to nominate, as Co-Chairman of the International Advisory Group to report to Sen-tor Button, its foremost business leader, Mr Eishiro Saito, Chairman of Japan's private sector umbrella group, Keidanren; and agreement to send an investment mission to Australia in connection with the MFP. I assured both the Japanese Government and business leaders that the prejudices within Australia which, at one point, put the MFP at needless risk, represented very much. minority views. As I suggested earlier, I told Mr Kaifu-and I stated clearly in public speeches-that Australia wanted to give positive encouragement to Japan to play a wider role in global affairs, more commensurate with its economic standing. I want to state clearly here and now that I to believe such a trend is inevitable and that it is ip our interests. It is self-evident that the world today, as it embarks upon its post-cold war era, is very different to the world of the 1940s when post-war global institutions were put in place. The time has clearly come for thought to be given about how those institutions, including the United Nations, might accommodate Japan's new role. Within the United Nations, for instance, there is obviously a range of possibilities, up to and including permanent membership of the Security Council. The question is a delicate one and involves a range of complex issues in which many countries have a legitimate interest. For that reason, I did not in any way seek to be prescriptive, but sought to highlight an important question which needs to be addressed. Mr Kaifu was appreciative of my comments and said he felt honoured that I had chosen to raise the issue. It was emphasised to me that while Japan wished to play a greater political role in world affairs, the terms of Japan's Constitution do not permit the deployment of Japan's armed forces abr()ad for combat operalaunched tions. Japan is not. contemplating any change to its Constitution, but this is, course, a different matter from the foreregional shad9wed change to Japanese legislation which will enable Japan to playa fuller· .and more. active role within the frameDemocratic work of United Nations peacekeeping opto erations. My Government would welcome that. Amongst the global issues discussed Mr Kaifu. and his Ministers, the most significant was the situation in the Gulf and its implications, both politically and economically . We confirmed our respecdemonstrated tive support for the relevant tions Security Council resolutions. Mr Kaifu outlined Japan's contribution to multinational effort in the Gulf and said that, within the framework of its Constidress tution, Japan was examining what else it might be able to do. He applauded Ausin tralia's resolute and quick action in meeting the crisis by dispatching naval vessels. I expressed appreciation for Japan's contribution and said that, while it was clearly a matter for Japan itself to deterlonger mine, any decision to do more would be tive understood by Australia. In exchanging' views about developEvery ments in the Soviet Union, both Mr Kaifu and Foreign Minister Nakayama outlined the current state of Japan-Soviet relais: tions, including the outstanding question of the norther,n territories. I expressed Government's hope that the issue would be resolved in a way acceptable to Japan, as Japan-Soviet relations were a matter importance to all countries in the Pacific region. Other issues covered in my.discussions included Antarctica, APEC, China, the Korean Peninsula and Cambodia: I outgion, lined to Mr Kaifu the Australian-French initiative to preserve the unique Antarctic environment and the importance of the forthcoming Santiago Conference. Mr Kaifu expressed his hope. for asatistacFraser, tory outcome ,at Santiago and agreed that our officials should continue to consult the lead-up to the Conference. Mr Kaifu and his Ministers were especially supportive of the APEC initiative which I early last year. It was agreed that the two countries would continue to of work together closely on this and other issues such as Cambodia. On the Korean Peninsula, we both expressed concern about the failure, to date, of the People's Republic of Korea enter into its safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency, a matter of great importance in the conwith text of proliferation. As is obvious from this report, my visits have, in each case, advanced concrete Australian interests and have, once again, Australia's continued high United Nastanding in the region. It is therefore a matter for regret that, the while I was in Japan, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) delivered an adon foreign policy in which he made clear his belief that Australian influence the region had become, in his word, 'marginalised', and that Australia's foreign policy was, again in his words, 'in disarray'. This is what he said: Let me put this point quite bluntly. We are no the diplomatic and economic force we were in the Asia-Pacific region, because our relaeconomic situation has declined considerably . . . single thing that emerged from the regional visits that are the subject of this report reveals that statement for what it the uninformed and opportunistic posturing of this apprentice. Q-ite simply, my .Australia now stands at a high point of its constructive regional influence, and we need look no further than Cambodia on of the political side and APEC on the ecoAsianomic side for proof of that. The Leader Opposition implies there was a lost golden era when Australia enjoyed greater positive influence in the re'. Is this successor to the Liberal leaders who sent Australian troops into Vietnam referring to that sort of regional influence? Is he talking about the wasted years of hypocrisy on trade under Malcolm when this country preached reform but practised· inflexible self-centred in protectionism? Does he suggest that Australia's influence was greater before this Government took the internationally recognised and applauded lead in the establishment of the Cairns Group; the new forum for Asia-Pacific economic cooperation; the South Pacific nuclear free zone; and the framework embraced by the United Nations Security Council for advancing the restoration of peace in Cambodia? Australia is a nation that has spoken for a long time about being part of the Asia-Pacific region. But it is only under this Government that real effect has been given to those words; it is only this Government which has defined economic enmeshment with the' region as a key objective for this country for the coming decade; it is only this Government, .and the Australian Labor Party, that has never wavered in its unequivocal commitment to non-racial principles of immigration; and it is only under this Government that Australia's potential as an active, respected and positive partner in the region has started to be fulfilled.",29
60,Dr HEWSON,GUINEA AND JAPAN,"by leaveThe report which the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has just given the Parliament on his recent overseas trips highlights the failures and inconsistencies of a tired government lacking ideas and influence. It is a sorry record of unnecessary confusion and disillusionment caused by the Prime Minister's own incompetent handling of important international issues. It provides further evidence of the disarray and the delusions of grandeur in the Government's foreign policy and it is testimony to the serious damage that has been done to Australia's credibility and standing in the regiQn. On 13 September, just prior to departing on his most recent visit to Japan, the Prime Minister chose the Jana Wendt show, as he did with his now notorious announcement on Chinese students in Australia, to make an important foreign policy statement. He said, in commenting on Opposition delegations visiting China, that the Government: Did not believe it was for the Opposition to be taking an initiative in the area of foreign which was inconsistent with what the country, through its Government, was doing. That is an extraordinary statement for an Australian Prime Minister to make: Oppositions should not take initiatives on foreign policy. His paranoia went further in a speech last Saturday night when he warned me that it would be 'unwise' for me to interfere in foreign policy matters. Why is the Prime Minister so deeply disturbed about free thinking on foreign policy by the Opposition? Why is he so paranoid about interventions by me? Why is he so obsessed with trying to rewrite the history of post-war Australian foreign policy, as he did today, rather than addressing the real challenges of his time and of Australia's future? Australians want their leaders to plot a course for the future, not to reinterpret the past for their own narrow partisan purposes. The past may be the Prime Minister's focus of attention. The future is mine. The real reason why the Prime Minister is so agitated about current Opposition fon:ign policy is that he knows, as most commentators do, that it is the Qpposition, not the Government, that is now setting the foreign policy agenda, and the Prime Minister does not like it. That is why, in spite of the facts, the Prime Minister and his Government are desperately trying to run the line that I have 'a knowledge gap' on foreign policy and that somehow I meddle in it for short term political gain. He accuses me today of being an uninformed and opportunistic apprentice. That type of personal abuse only highlights what the rest of us already know: that the Prime Minister fears the challenge of youth, and he fears the challenge of new ideas from this side of the, House as he and his Government enter their twilight zone. His personal charges against me are extraordinary, coming from a Prime Minister and a Government that for seven years have run a foreign policy driven by emotion, without any coherent sense of our national priorities and only with an eye to what will advantage them in domestic politics. It is even more extraordiaffairs nary for the Prime Minister to be pushing a line when we look at the facts on who is driving the foreign policy debate in this country. There are a whole series now of issues where the Government's foreign policy is following in the Opposition's wake. We have led the way in calling for a more realistic Taiwan policy and the Government is now playing catch-up. The Prime Minister has ditched his own policy on Fiji in favour of what we have been advocating for months. Following our lead, the Government is now beginning to take its concerns and hopes directly to Chinese leaders. The Government has finally heeded our calls for ending ministerial contact with the Palestine Liberation Organisation, even though it has yet to settle the policy confusion created by the inept comments of the then Acting Prime Minister-the Treasurer (Mr Keating)-in May about the status of East Jerusalem. The Government has adopted our proposal for a Commonwealth role in bringing peace to Sri Lanka. The Opposition called for a practical commitment from our Defence Force in response to the Middle East crisis the day before the Prime Minister announced our Royal Australian Navy deployment. And despite repeated calls to the Prime Minister and extensive personal correspondence that I have had with him on the role of our Navy, the Australian public is still not fully informed. That is not a matter, as he tends to suggest, of publicising the of engagement; I do not know what they are. But it is a matter of properly informing the Australian people and the Parliament. There are other issues on which the Opposition has' highlighted Government confusion and backsliding. The Opposition has exposed the hypocrisy and confusion-and nothing less can be said about it; it is hypocrisy and confusion-of the Prime Minister's mishandlirtg of the Chinese student issue. The Government's foreign aid budget is now at the level which the Opposition was calling for in the election campaign. The debacle we highlighted over the sale of Mirage jets to Pakistan and other deals has prompted the Government to undertake a major review of its defence exports program, and so the list goes on. So it is no wonder that the Prime Minister pleads with the Opposition to keep quiet on foreign policy. For him, foreign policy is a matter of ego and emotion. He hates being upstaged by the Opposition in the way he is. Well, the news for him is that we will not stop, and we will continue to take the foreign policy initiatives that he so dislikes. Each of the Prime Minister's three recent trips achieved some useful outcomes; but they Were also notable for their inadequacies. The South Pacific Forum in Port Vila was a diplomatic disaster for the Prime Minister. Worse than that, his performance did considerable harm to Australia's credibility and standing among our Pacific Island neighbours. Two issues, above all, highlighted the Prime Minister's appalling lack of judgment and common sense in Port Vila. The first· of these issues concerned the disposal of chemical weapons stocks on Johnston Atoll. The key to the Prime Minister's thoroughly inadequate handling of this issue lay not in the substance of the case he put to the Forum but to the insensitive and patronising way in which he presented it. The essence of the Prime Minister's argument on the Johnston Atoll facility is one with which the Opposition generally niles agrees. Chemical warfare disarmament is a goal worthy of the strongest support. It is aimed at removing a repugnant form of warfare as well as a potentially major environmental threat. The United States (US) Secretary of Defence has given an assurance that Johnston Atoll will not become a permanent disposal centre for toxic waste. The environmental safeguards observed at the Johnston Atoll facility appear to be rigorous and at the leading edge of technology. But where the Prime Minister went disastrously wrong was the way he approached the whole issue of the Johnston Atoll facility with other Forum heads of government. He seriously underestimated the depth of anger among island governments at having their region used as a dumping ground. for hazardous wastes. On the issue of envIronmental safeguards, he failed to pursue a steJ?-by:-step confidenc-­ building approach wIth Island leaders III the months leading up to the Forum meeting. Instead, the Prime Minister chose to present them· at the Forum with a fait accompli: a strategy that backfired disastrously. By presenting environmental evidence that was based on US data, the Prime Minister also gave the appearance of not acting independently on the issue. The reality might be different, but the appearance was not. The outcome of this negotiating strategy by the Prime Minister was therefore totally counterproductive. The Forum communique was a. clear rejection of the Prime Minister's reasslirances about environmental issues. Pacific ishtnd leaders viewed Australian policy on the Johnston Atoll facility as seriously compromised and the Prime Minister's performance at the Forum as two-faced. The official spokesman for this year's Forum, the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea, Mr Namaliu, said that Australia's handling of the issue had created mistrust and suspicion among fellow leaders. The second issue that highlighted the Prime Minister's incompetence in Port Vila was his extraordinary about-face on Fiji. By so doing, he has thrown Australian policy into complete confusion. The Prime Minister was made to look faintly ridiculous for most of the Forum as he desperately sought a meeting with the Prime Minister of Fiji, Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, only to find that Ratu Mara had no enthusiasm for such a meeting. The Prime Minister was made to cool his heels until Ratu Mara agreed to a short meeting towards the end of the Forum. And what did the Prime Minister have to say to Ratu Mara that was so important? It was that, after all his Gov7rnment's scathing moralism about politIcal changes in Fiji, he had now come to !he view that he should recognise the reallty of the Fijian Constitution and that Australia would not continue with its insistence on a Constitution broadly acceptable to the majority of Fijian citizens. the Prime Minister's statement of Australia's new policy on Fiji constituted an extraordinary about-face. In one move, the Prime Minister has swung into line with a policy position that I have been advocating since the month I became Leader of the Opposition: namely, that the best way of encouraging genuine democracy in Fiji is not to use moralistic judgments to justify cutting off contacts but to maintain a high-level political dialogue with Fiji's leaders. I have consistently pointed out how counterproductive it is for the Australian Government to sit in judgment on what it considers to be acceptable constitutional change in Fiji and to make our bilateral relationship conditional on such change. High level political contact with Fiji need not compromise our view that we have continuing concerns about its Constitution. I am delighted that' the Prime Minister has' come to share this view-even if belatedly. The Prime Minister's new Fijian policy, however,Was even more extraordinary than being just a policy U-turn. On the very day that he was announcing it in Port Vila, his Foreign Minister, Senator Evans, was in New Delhi. He was reported as having agreed with the Indian Government to continue a campaign against the Fijian Constitution. Nor has the Prime Minister yet managed to pull his Foreign Minister into line. Only last week, in his speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Senatqr Evans restated his continuing opposition to the Fijian Constitution. So what we are left with, from the Prime Minister's ham-fisted diplomacy in Port Vila, is an Australian policy on Fiji that is both inconsistent and counterproductive. Not only do we have the Prime Minister trying to make up with Ratu Mara while Senator Evans tries to score bonus points on the international stage with his high moralism, but also we have Australian credibility in Fiji at an all-time low, with the Prime Minister now having achieved the difficult task of alienating both the Government and the Opposition in Fiji. What possible explanation can there be for the Prime Minister'S Fijian back flip in Port Vila? We are certainly none the wiser as a result of the statement he made today. But perhaps the real reason lies in the Prime Minister's realisation that Australia's influence and credibility in the South Pacific has been eroded dramatically over recent years and that many island states are now looking to Fiji to fill the leadership vacuum. In short, therefore, on the two key issues at this year's Forum-the Johnston Atoll facility and Fiji-the Prime Minister was clearly outmanoeuvred by other Forum leaders to the serious detriment of Australia's regional standing. It is little wonder that a chastened Prime Minister fled Port Vila without even waiting for the final farewells at the Forum dinner. During his visit last month to Papua New Guinea, the Prime Minister set out some important principles which underlie the Australia-PNG relationship. These principles include: firstly, that the bilateral relationship is one between two sovereign independent nations; secondly, that Australia should help PNG to build up its own capacity to address its own problems in its own way; and, thirdly, that PNG's strength is in its unity, not in its fragmentation. These principles are the ones which coalition governments have pursued since 1975. In reaffirming them to the Papua New Guinea Government last month-'7'as I did in July-the Prime Minister can be assured of o'ur sl,lpport. But in the context of that general support, there are three points worth making about the Prime Minister's recent visit to PNG. Firstly, the Prime Minister seems to think that in telling PNG that, as a sovereign country, it needs to resolve its own problems, he is somehow dramatically breaking new policy ground. The simple fact is that he is not. All that he said during his visit on the theme of PNG's sovereign independence was said 18 years ago in 1972 by the then Minister for External Territories, the current honourable member for Kooyong  We have to determine our relations with Papua New Guinea with proper regard to Australia's own national interests. We should expect New Guinea to do the same. In particular, we should not expect Papua New Guinea to look to us to decide what her national interests are . . . There will undoubtedly be a residual common interest. If mutual respect accompanies it, if we can succeed in avoiding gratuitous insults to Papua New Guinea's nationhood and sovereignty, then that residual common interest will be of great importance. Secondly, the Prime Minister and his Government too often fail to give PNG the priority in our foreign policy that the rhetoric during the Prime Minister's recent visit implied that it has. The Prime Minister seems to lack any sense of urgency about the outlook for PNG, particularly the prospects for the situation on Bougainville. Others in our region have no difficulty appreciating that urgency. For example, General Moerdani from Indonesia made this point very clearly to me when I met him in Jakarta in July, Our lack of urgency has meant that Australia has lost any hope of playing an honest broker role and the vacuum is being filled by others, sucQ as New Zealand. The reason for this Australian policy paralysis is that the Prime Minister paints artificially stark alternatives for Australia's policy. For him, it is either non-interference on the basis of Papua New Guinea sovereignty on the one hand, or nasty neo-co10nialism on the other. He sees nothing in between-no potential for the creative diplomacy and constructive influence that this Government has been so keen to exert in other parts of the world, from Namibia to Central America. The fact is that there is scope for a more constructive Australian involvement with PNG that fully respects PNG's rights and responsibilities as a sovereign nation. What has happened, however, is that over recent years the PNG Government's assessment of the credibility, standing and predictability of the Australian Government has slipped. Restoring that confidence while reaffirming PNG's sovereign rights and responsibilities will be a priority of the next coalition government. Thirdly, during his recent PNG visit, the Prime Minister paid inadequate atte'ntion to one of the most pressing long term problems for PNG-name1y, its developPapua ment of an institutionalised basis for managing more tied aid programs. The Overseas Visits by PM Australian Government is plannipg r-p­ idly to increase such l?rograms. It IS so despite the warm!1g fro- the. - NG finance Minister a!1 d Its foreIgn .MInIster th t PNG's capaCIty for managIng such ti:d aid projects needs to be more fully developed. The Prime Minister's visi- to Japan partly offici-l - and partly In suppo-t Melbourne's bId for the 1996 OlympICS. was very pleased to. be in .T.okyo at the Japan makes'. same time as the Pnme Minister t- support him in assisting ¥elbourne's bId. both worked hard wIth many others support of Melbourne's bid and we all shared a sense of disappointment at final decision. But in the o-cial - a-t his visit to Japan, the Pnme Mlmster created further difficulties for himself cause of making important policy changes on the run. This time the policy consues-because cerned Japan's changing international tus in world affairs and the role· of military forces. I discussed these matters myself wh€<n was in Tokyo during my meetings with Japan's Prime Minister, Mr Kaifu, with the Director-General of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, Mr Ozawa, and with others whom I met. I speCifically raised with Mr Ozawa the issue of Japan's bership of the Security Council. I indition cated to him that the time was now opportune for' the international commuthe nityto give greater recognition to Japan's important international role and for the United Nations structures to reflect realities of power in the 1990s . These discussions, of course, were prior to Prime Minister's official 1!1eeting--in kyo and they were al-o pnor to hIS pubhc statements on these matters. In my own public and private coming ments on these issues, I have been scrunot pulously careful to distinguish between recognition of Japan's vital world ecoregional nomic role and any international military role. I carefully spelled out that distincal,Jove tion in an address-to which the Prime Minister referred-that I gave in Tokyo say these things. last month at the Nomura International Centre. The Prime Minister has shown such care. In comments both in Japan 9 October 1990 REPRESENTATIVES 2433 and prior to leaving Australia, the Prime dOIng Minister made it plain that his Government supported a military role for Japan in international peacekeeping operations, should Japan choose such a role. Let me be specific. Iri an interview on Japanese television on 17 September, he said, 'What Japan doeS is a matter for Japan'. On the was issue of Japan's military involvement in of peacekeeping operations he said, 'We will I accept and understand the decision that On the specific issues of Japanese miliW,e tary involvement in a Cambodian peaceIn keeping operation,. the Prime Minister said, 'If Japan makes the decision that it the would wish to be a part of that process, of we would welcome it'. The issue is not, in the Prime Minister's facile language, bewhether Japan has sovereign decision making right on this and other isit obviously does. But the staissue for Australia is whether we should its make our own views clear on the matter. Unlike the Prime Minister, I am preI pared to state a view of what I think is in Australia's interests in relation to an expanded military role for Japan. I do not think the time is right to encourage such a role, even if such encouragement is given through the means of being neutral about memit. Unlike the Government, the Opposiis not neutral on this issue. We believe that Japan should be a member of Security Council. We believe that it can make an important contribution to . international peace and stability through the its economic strength-after all, Japan is the world's second largest economy, its the_largest capital exporter and its largest - T?=-- provider of aid. But we do not believe that Japan should be assuming an international military role, even in peacekeepoperations, in the near future. We do believe there is popular enthusiasm in Japan for such a role. We believe that tensions would be aggravated unnecessarily by such a development and, all, we believe that the Australian Government should have the courage to In conclusion, there is a common theme no in the recent overseas trips of the Prime Minister that I want to highlight today. It is a theme that applies to the Government's foreign policy as a whole. The Prime Minister and his Government have shown the courage of other people's convictions but not the courage of their own. The Hawke Government will move to change its policies-on contacts with Chinese leaders, on United Nations structures, on Fiji, on its relations with the PLO, or on a host of other issues-but it is only prepared to do so after the Opposition has led the way. The Prime Minister showed on his recent travels that he does not have the courage of his own convictions to take a public position in favour of or against an expanded Japanese military role. Nor does he have the courage of his convictions to go beyond policy options for AustraliaPNG relations that lie between his artificially exclusive alternatives of non-interference and neo-colonialism. In short, Australian foreign policy under this Government, whether it be its policy on PNG or the South Pacific or Asia or whatever, is best described as a policy of rhetorical gestures. As the Prime Minister's recent trips demonstrate, it is based too much on emotion and ego and too little on a clear view of how Australia's longer term national interests can be advanced. In my two overseas visits since becoming Leader of the Opposition I have visited 10 countries of the Asia-Pacific region. I have had extensive discussions with political and economic leaders in those countries. The clear impression I got in each country was that Australia's influence is being marginalised. If the Prime . Minister really believes his own rhetoric of today 'that Australia stands at a high point of its constructive regional influence' then his delusions of grandeur are greater than most of us fear. If he really believes what he said about our international standing, it shows how desperately uninformed and isolated he and his Government have become. The reality which AustralIa now faces-whether the Prime Minister is prepared to acknowledge it or not-is that our capacity for constructive international influence in support of our real nati interests is declining. That is partly cause of our relative economic dec and vulnerability resulting from this ernment's policy mismanagement. I partly because this Prime Minister confused what he thought were sp personal relationships with real com national interests. But it is undoubt also because of the type of policy co sion and heavy-handedness which Prime Minister displayed too often o recent overseas trips. The Prime Minister has put all the he can on those trips today but not detracts from the fact that their effect . been to increase the doubts about tralia's capacity for constructive influ in om: region. Our national interest our regional standing would be far b served by aiming to do less in for policy and doing it better. We desper need what our foreign policy has la for too long-a coherent sense of en li , ened national self-interest. This is as egy .for our foreign policy that I outl . at length in a major speech last mont ; the Australian Institute of Internati Affairs. It is a strategy which the i coalition Government will pursue compassion and vision but with a c sense of what is in Australia's best i ests. NA Discussion of Matter of Public Importance",35
61,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ECONOMIC POLICIES,"Mr Holl a Mr Speaker has received letter from Deputy Leader of the National Part Australia, the honourable member Murray (Mr Lloyd), proposing that a ! inite matter of public importance be mitted to the House for discuss I namely: ! The devastating impact of the Hawke Gov I ment's economic policies on rural and regi I families, businesses and industries. : I call upon those members who appr i of the proposed discussion to rise in t places. More than the number of members quired by the Standing Orders having r in their placeslVIr LLOYD (Murray) (4.24)..,.. - The Minister for Primary Industr-es an- En(Mr Kerin) on, Sunday 10 an 1Otere--- confirmed that rural Australia is --ading for a worse collapse than the 1982-83 recession. We .on this side of the House have been say10g that for some time and agree with it. If it is wO,rse than 1982-83 it must be the worse smce the Depression of the 1930s be-ause - 982-83 was the biggest shake-out 10 agnculture since the Second World War. The Minister's decision. yesterday o- wool has added to that situatIOn because It means that the wool growers of Australia-and they constitute the biggest number of single industry farmers in this country-will be paying more tax and therefore their net income will be further reduced. The Minister has, criticised people on this side of the House for making realistic assessments of the problems in rural and regional Australia. He has been saying that we have been talking the industry down. I acknowledge that there is a danger in being too negative because the world situation is volatile and it only needs something like the Russians coming back into the wool market to bring about some change. After his statements of the last few days, the Minister certainly cannot level that criticism at us again. It is more important for everyone in Parliament to recognise the reality of what is happening in rural and regional Australia at present. It is important that we say so to all Australians so that there is a better understanding of that deepening recession that is taking place. Hopefully, as a result of everyone having a better understanding and recognition of that, the Government will give it a higher priority in its decision making than has been the case until now. The documentation of what is happening in the bush is quite clear. The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) in its latest quarterly review has said that the net value of farm production for this financial year will be down 57 per cent on last financial year. That is a further drop of 9 per cent in one quarter. If one wants to look at the total picture one would have to add last year where it was already down 20 Per cent. We are looking at a 67 per cent minimum' reduction in the net value of farm production for the last two years. That means that the net farm income, according to ABARE, is down 32 per cent or almost one-third for this year. The important point to realise is not just that those figures are there now but that unfortunately those figures will be more and more negative as the year progresses. They do not take into account the impact of fuel prices, particularly for the grain industry, or as I said, the wool tax situation, or the continuing problems of access to the Gulf for our grain, rice, dairy and live sheep industries. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade round of negotiations on improving world trade will conclude either at the end of this year, or next year if it goes on for another few months. If those negotiations are not successful, the European Community (EC) and the United States are already primed to take on a real knock down battle in export subsidies and grain and dairy products will be the two most affected. Dairy stockpiles are increasing in both the United States and Europe at present. The sugar market has fallen and processed food imports into Australia are increasing at a rate of 20 per cent per year, with all of the implications that, has for employment in country towns and cities. Those things are reasonably well known. What is not well known and is part of the total picture is that unemployment in regional Australia still remains higher than it does in Australia as a whole and that regional businesses are suffering dramatically. Mycolleague, the honourable mem far greater detail on this aspect of what is happening in rural and regional Australia and the impact of the Government's policies on that situation. Only one-third the number of students in country areas go on to post secondary education, compared with those in the metropolitan areas and the retention rate is also lower for senior secondary education. The average income of people in rural and regional Australia is well below that of the rest of Australia. There are overseas factors that are impacting very dramatically at present on the profitability and the viability of people in rural and regional Australia. There is a record Northern Hemisphere grain harvest. Russia and China are out of the wool market. There is uncertainty within eastern Europe and the Gulf and there are these EC and United States export subsidies and production subsidies as well. These matters are beyond the control of this Government and I acknowledge that. What the Government must do, of course, is maintain pressure internationally, continually and at the highest level, in relation to fairer trade for agricultural products. It is a fair criticism of this Government that it has not always maintained that pressure at the highest level, where it needs to be maintained if we are to make an impact in the Cairns Group and the Uruguay Round. That is only part of the rural recession equation. The other part of the equation is the domestic policies of this Government for which it must answer, whereas it can to a certain extent escape the point about overseas influence on our commodity prices. It is within the power of this Government to do far more in relation to our export industries and our importcompeting industries in rural and regional Australia to ensure that they are internationally competitive, that their cost structure is competitive in terms of inflation and interest rates, that there is better equity with regard to exchange rates, and that there is equity for country people-whether it is country industry or country families or the quality of life of country people generally. The Government must ensure that it does not have double standards-one for metropolitan Australia and one for non-metropolitan Australia-and that it does not have unfair policies in relation to the rural areas of this country. What has the Government done in these policy areas that are under its control? When considering what is important to farm industries and country people, the greatest single factor is overall economic policy. That has a far greater impact on the profitability and the viability of rural industries than any industry-specific policy. When one looks at that overall economic policy, we still have higher interest rates than any of our competitor countries. I acknowledge that interest rates have been reduced by 3 to 4 per cent, at least nominally, if not always passed on. When the National Farmers Federation (NFF) addressed the Government last week, meeting with the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and others, the NFF indicated that there was scope for those interest rates to fall another 3 per cent or so and that it was appropriate that they should do so .. When the Government considers that NFF proposal, as it claims it will-and it is not just the NFF; every other business leader in this country is saying the same thing about interest rates-I hope that it is taken seriously and that there is not the indirect but nevertheless clear belittlement of the NFF, as was the case in the answer from the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy to a question from me today, and that we do not have any more Nobby Clark situations on the other side of the House. I wonder whether there will be any point in those discussions because the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has already rejected the possibility of any easing of interest rates. However, I do say very strongly to the Government that it is not just a question trade of looking beyond the current recessionand no-one knows how long that will be or how severe it will be, and in rural Australia we certainly will not know that until at least the autumn of next year and possibly later; but it must also consider the viability and the future of people who are current borrowers and who are finding it increasingly impossible to stay in business because of the interest rate structure. Interest rates are of great importance to the farm industries. Ten years ago interest rates were 6 per cent of total farm costs; in 1985 they were 9 per cent of total farm costs; today they are 13 per cent of total farm costs. Farming is a very capital-intensive industry. For everyone per cent change in interest rates, there is somehere between $150m and $170m change Y'I income available to farmers. In terms U} exchange rate policy, I acknowledge, - thers do, the stickiness-I think. tha- is the term at the moment-of the sItuatIOn because of the. Gulf and the weak l!S dollar. But in spIte of that, and <;mce looking to the comments of busmess leadknowing ers and the NFF, the belief is that there ficult time. still is an ability for the dollar to drop to a more realistic trade level. Once again, it should be remembered that for every 1c change in the US-Austral-an .dollar there is a $170m change m mcome to farmers. When one looks at inflation, it is still well ahead of our competitors in other need countries. That has an impact on our cost structure and, therefore, on our profitabiladditional ity. The Government talks about having a tough fiscal policy, but I do not know how that relates to a 12 per cent increase in government expenditure in the Budget. When one looks at micro-economic reform or reform of all those other areas economic activity which add to the costs of the rural community, the Government has a double standard of the worse order. It has not required the same standards international efficiency from its own tes in the union movement as it has from the rest of our economy. The Minister knows all this. edge that he has a considerable grasp of the rural situation and the facts and figof ures. He would have been aware of all this prior to the Budget. He would have been aware of the falling incomes. But that Budget the Minister agreed to in the crease export inspection charges from per cent to 100 per cent recovery, an additional cost of $60m at a time of great pressure on export incomes, without any say from the exporters as to how that money would be efficiently spent. The Bureau figures indicate that the erage income per family farm worker for 1988-89 was $18,500-in other words, review well below average weekly income-and - t fell again this year. The average farm m June 1989 had a capital value of $lm and there was only one per cent return ca-ital, including capital appreciation. ThIS was all known at the time of the tural products. . Budget, but in that Budget the Government and the Minister deliberately exas cluded farm families from the welfare support that is available in difficult times to people in the rest of Australia. I am not asking for anything special; I am just agam asking for the equity for these people, that they are coming into a difThere is now a family allowance assets test of $300,000 but the level of income at which the allowance cuts out is $57,000. rate There is no way that a farm family with assets of $300,000 can generate anything like that sort of income. In fact, working on an ordinary ratio of interest, we would to lift that assets test rate to $600,000 as a minimum. There is no allowance for children under that assets test. The family allowance supplement has been restricted to $200,000, which is even worse. The figure for Austudy is $400,000, but that is still well below a fair and . of eqUItable amount, and that does not take into account the impossibility of selling a farm at the present time. As I said earlier, the education opportunities for country of children are already less. than those for mametropolitan children, so the Government is doing exactly the opposite of what it has been claiming it will do to provide I acknowlequity for country people. What the Government must do is, first all, provide a fair go on interest and exchange rates for farm and non-farm small business-city as well as country. in The Minister should not say one thing to NFF and completely contradict it in 60 an answer today, or say something completely different in his answer today than he was saying on the Channel 9 program on Sunday. The· Minister must apply the micro-reforms to his own constituency and honour his general commitment to the avgrain industry at least to cover payments on sales already made to Iraq - He must the assets test, as he promised the NFF, and not belittle it, and he must give details of increased commitments for rural adjustment and rural counselling. He on must also address the unfair aspects of the. trade in imported processed agricul",40
62,Mr KERIN,ECONOMIC POLICIES,"First of all, Mr Deputy Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to discuss what I am sure is a matter of concern for honourable members on both sides of the Parliament. The issue is all about the economic situation in farming Australia, and I thank the honourable member for Murray (Mr LLoyd), who has just spoken, for his sane comments. As he has pointed out, what we are talking about is not only the economic status of rural Australia, which is so vitally important for the nation as a whole, but also the financial and social well-being of rural people. We should never forget-I am sure .we do not-in our discussions of national policy issues that the effects are experienced by families in agriculture and other rural dustries and by those in the 1,200 or So country towns scattered throughout Australia. I am never encouraged, of course, by a rural downturn such as that which now appears to be on the horizon but, having said that, all honourable members know that our rural industries will always be subject to cycles. When the wool industry was last in deep depression, in 1970-71, other agricultural sectors were doing fairly well. When the fortunes of the beef industry collapsed in 1974, wool had very substantially recovered. We have been fortunate that it has normally been the case that as one particular commodity experiences bad times others prosper. Even when large areas of Australia were drought-affected in 1982, some parts of the country held up well. It is true that the effects of changes international markets will act substantially to reduce returns to Australian producers during the 1990-91 year. This cannot be emphasised strongly enough. A characteristic of Australian agriculture is that the Australian farmer and the Australian Government have little or no control over world prices. Now we see affected the big two of our agricultural industries-wool and wheat. Wool, wheat, grains and beef make up 85 per cent of our agriculture. Roughly 95 per cent of our wool production and 70 or 80 per cent of our wheat is exported. So woo Energy) and wheat are very dominant. Variability in prices inevitably result in variability in returns to growers. Esti mates of farm cash operating surplus fo 1990-91 show that price and wool ta effects will drive cash operating surpluse to lower levels than those which have bee considered as normal over the past fe years. In all of this-and there is a lot o confusion about figures-there is a rang of measures. I see the Australian Burea of Agricultural and Resource Economic has now brought out at'}other measure, ne farm cash income, which it says will b down by about 32 per cent in the yea ahead. The Deputy Leader of the Na tional Party, the honourable member fo Murray, referred to the net value of far in- production as down 57 per cent on th last calculation. Specialist wheat growers' cash operatin surplus is estimated to decline by abou 35 per cent and specialist wool growers' b 47 per cent. For mixed livestock and cro producers the decline will be in the orde of 49 per cent. These percentage figure are triggered by very small changes i price and costs. The figures are changing estimates and measures are changing. I we want to express it in cash terms, mone terms, the farm cash operating surplus fo the broad acre industries will go down from an estimate last year-probably an actua figure by now-of' $51,938 per farm t $25,447 in 1990-91, using 1989-90 dol lars. That drop is about 51 per cent. Fo specialist sheep farmers the drop is from about $58,000 going down to $25,707, o the latest estimates. That is a reductio in of 56 per cent, the average being 3,50 sheep. Of course, averages hide a lot. They ar the worse statistic of all. It is importan to recognise that the relative contributio of the decline in net wool receipts essen tially drives the total picture. The averag figures, as I have said, for a decline i cash operating surplus are distorted b the extraordinary developments in th wool industry. To a lesser extent change in the world grains market affect the ag gregate market for cash operating surplus Estimates available to me indicate tha diminished returns in wool make up 58 per cent in the decline of cash operating surplus for the sector as a whole and diminished returns for cereals contribute another 36 per cent. That explains about 94 per cent. Honourable members of this House who are fair-minded and objective in their consideration of these issues will understand that the variability of the returns is something which most Australian producers accept as given in their industry. If we look at some of the figures of net value of farm production, the oscillations over this decade have been tremendous. In 197980 the figure was $4.2 billion; in 1980-81, $3.1 billion; 1981-82, $2.8 billion; 198283 $0.5 billion, the lowest by far of the de-ade; 1983-84, $3.5 billion; 1984-85, $2.9 billion; 1985-86, $1.4 biHion; 198687, $1.9 billion; 1987-88, $3.5 billion; 1988-89, a recovery, $4.3 billion; 198990, $4.0 billion; and the estimate for the year ahead is $1.7 billion. Despite what I said on the Sunday program, I think my figuring is wrong. The $1.7 billion in prospect certainly will not be quite as bad as the $0.5 billion in 1882-83, that terrible drought year. Despite this sort of picture there is ways recovery because of the resilience of the sector. The on-farm variability is also quite enormous. Recently I was presented with some figures that showed, in terms of business indicators on-farm, that farm operating surplus in just 20 farms ranged from $43 per hectare through to $245 per hectare. I could go through a great series of figures here, but the point I want to make is that the on-farm performance of individual farmers is also quite remarkable. It is the genius of Australian producers that enables them to continue to make strong efficiency gains and continue to do things better in their operations. They know that their own efforts form the basis for their continued prosperity. I would quickly like to catalogue the changes in world markets which will act to reduce returns to Australian growers. We have seen a dramatic decline in world wheat prices reSUlting from two major factors. The first is that the wheat harvest in the Northern Hemisphere is a record high. Consequently excess stocks are being released into what is a residual world grain market. This means that prices will be driven down-not only of wheat but also of other cereal grains; The US dollar price for wheat will decline by an estimated 27 per cent and, irrespective of the change in the level of the Australian dollar, this decline will set the parameters of price falls in the world's grain markets. The second factor at play is the activities of the United States (US) and the European Community (EC) with respect to export subsidisation, and clearly corrupt trading practices puts additional downward pressure on prices. The largest amount we know of this export subsidisation is $US54 per tonne by the US and $82 per tonne by the Ee. These costs have long been recognised and the Opposition recognises what we are doing in the round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) negotiations now coming to a conclusion. I do not pretend that wins in the current GATT round will eliminate variability in world grain markets and I do not pretend that a long term trade solution al- offers the answer to the short term problems which currently face Australian producers. It is not possible to pretend that Australia exists as a discrete entity removed from the world trading system. Those whose analysis is not a product of their own imagination well understand this elemental fact. The palliatives of rhetoric offer little when dealing with complex problems. The solution lies in facilitating adjustment, in ensuring support for individuals and developing the industry structure which is best placed to handle the complex requirements of the 1990s. It also lies in forcing the pace of change in industries which are associated with our efficient rural producers. In other words, the solution lies in the measures the Government has now undertaken. I The current difficulties of Australian's premier agricultural industry, the wool industry, are well known and well documented. Those who have an interest in history will understand that the current situation is a function of industry decisions made some three years ago and a market circumstance that could not be anticipated. That circumstance is the reaction to high prices of the 1988-89 period, the collapse of communism in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and eastern Europe, the economic problems of China, three warm northern winters, and more latterly the invasion of Kuwait by Saddam Hussein and the effect that that has had on the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and general world economic conditions. In Australia the exchange rate is having an effect as well as interest rates and alternatives are not freely available for people in the wheat-sheep zone. The response of the Government has been central to the maintenance of stability within the market and the viability of the Australian Wool Corporation and the industry itself. I have little problem accepting the extraordinary measures initiated by the Wool Corporation and the Government, and these will mean times will be very tight. I have, however, no difficulty in defending the decisions taken as being appropriate, timely and proper, given the circumstances which now prevail in the industry. Those who care to criticise the Government for difficulties now being experienced by Australian producers might also care to explain the fundamental links which exist between world prices and the returns to Australian producers. It is a fact that the decline in cash operating surplus resulting from the application of tight monetary policy is insignificant when compared with the total decline induced by world prices. A permanent element in the farm equation is that the industries subject to economic pressure will not always survive but will always come through in a stronger, leaner and more competitive shape than they were at the start of the pressure. Industries survive but, sadly, not all individuals in those industries do. It will be the same on this occasion and I am confident, as all honourable members must also be, that our farm industries will gain long term strength from short term adversity. I am encouraged to observe in the present debate on the looming downturn that there now is a much broader appr ciation in the media about the causes economic difficulties for agricultural i dustries and consequently about t breadth of necessary policy adjustmen Thankfully, it is no longer a question attributing blame to narrow commodi policies or agricultural lobby grou mindlessly pursuing protection of vario sorts for their own industries. That is past. I believe that four categories of polici are affecting the economic well-being farm and other rural industries. The fi of these determines the general macr economic setting: exchange rates, intere rates, inflation and wages policy above t others. The second is the provision physical and social infrastructure for i dustries and communities in rural are The third is commodity policy, and t fourth is the existence of a welfare net f those who, for whatever reason, fall up hard times. I will deal with the macro-econom settings and the micro-economic refor agenda of the Government which affe the physical and social infrastructure rural communities. My colleague t honourable member for Lindsay (Mr Fre will address the Government's commo ity policy and welfare policy. The fi point I want to touch upon is that macro-economic policy settings. T problem really is how we can get domest farm policy settings for a sector which, in t farm sector, represents 5 or 6 per cent gross domestic product. Let us put minerals and energy as well. The big e porting sectors then represent 10 or per cent of gross domestic product, to t exclusion of the 89 to 90 per cent of t rest of the economy, most of which driven by the private and public sect most of which we have very little contr over. I think it is important to remi honourable members that the overridi objective of macro-economic policy is reduce the current account deficit to level which stabilises Australia's net fo eign debt. In pursuing this objective t Government has pursued a comprehe sive range of policies aimed at slowi demarid growth to sustainable levels and improving the productive capacity of the economy. The Government called on all arms of policy to slow the excessive growth in demand evident in 1988-89. Fiscal policy remains very tight. The Government expects a Budget surplus of $8 billion in this financial year after a similar surplus in the last financial year. Wages policy has been tight, as is reflected in the continued decline in real labour costs, and monetary policy was tightened substantially in 1988 and 1989. In response to these policies, demand has slowed as expected. and the current account has improved from a deficit of over $20 billion last financial year to an annualised deficit of $17 billion in the first two months of this financial year. The Opposition contends that we should ease monetary policy in response to the downturn in the economy and further tighten fiscal policy and it talks of recessions and crises. The Opposition does not do itself or Australia any service with such talk. I note the reference by the Deputy Leader of the National Party (Mr Lloyd) to this. The National Party, like us, does not want to talk down the sector. But none of us should be in the business of talking down the economy and talking up a crisis mentality just because bad news is good news for the media. 'The point is that the slowdown in demand in the economy and the consequent improvement in the balance of payments reflects this set of macro-economic policies which are on track. Official interest rates have fallen by four percentage points since the beginning of this year. The impact of this fall in rates will still be feeding into economic activity in 18 months from now. The Opposition, in calling for further falls in rates, illustrates its ignorance of the lags. It also calls for further cuts in rates to bring down the exchange rate. Once· again it shows a breathtaking naivety. At the beginning of this year the Australian dollar was trading at US79c and cash rates were 18 per cent. Cash rates are now 14 per cent and the Australian dollar is almost at US84c. So where is the correlation, where is the identity? It is clear, of course, that at present the Australian dollar is being driven by the Gulf crisis. Australia is a net exporter of energy and the Australian dollar is perceived as a safe haven currency against the escalation of hostilities in that region, and a fall in rates will not change that perception.",44
63,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ECONOMIC POLICIES,"Order! The Minister's time has expired. .  respect to this matter of public importance, I point out that small businesses in rural and regional Australia are hurting and hurting very badly. Wejust heard the point of view of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin). He blamed all of the problems on everything other than his Government's policy. I want to run through some of those points. The Minister said that we are all aware that the farm sector has been up and down in cycles, but it is to do with world commodity prices and, of course, those for wool and wheat have collapsed. But today we have not heard too much about what this Government's policies have done to the small business sector in rural and regional Australia. Let me take the time right now to run through some of the policies that have crucified the small business sector in this country. The small business sector has had to contend with . exorbitantly high interest rates. It has had to contend with a fall in consumer spending, a fall in world commodity prices, rising fuel prices-and, I might add, those fuel prices are substantially higher in country areas than in city areas-the training levy, high inflation and high exchange rates. Why is the business sector paying all these prices? It is doing so because of the recession induced by the Government and the Treasurer (Mr Keating). These people are feeling this pain for no reason other than the policies introduced by this Government. Let us look at what small business in this country has been saddled with, the burdens that the Government has placed upon the sector which did not cause the problems, but which has paid the price for them. I mention interest rates, for a start. Last year the small business sector was paying interest rates of up to 26 per cent. Now the interest rates, as the Minister said, have come down a little; the prime rate is 16.5 to 17.5 per cent, plus loadings. So, many small businessmen are still paying 20 and 22 per cent interest the money they borrowed and many of them have had to borrow substantially just to get by. But, of course, the high interest rate policy was induced by this Government. I would like to cover the hypocritical point raised by the Treasurer earlier in the week when he turned around and said, 'It's the banks' fault'. The Treasurer is trying to deflect on to the banks responsibility for the problems caused by this Government. Only a little while ago he attacked the banks and, more particularly, claimed that the' banks were not passing on the margins. Earlier today, the Treasurer had a great' opportunity to explain this House why the Government bank, the Commonwealth Bank, does not pass on the margins he talks about. He can control that bank; he can tell the bank whether it is holding back too much, whether it is making too much in the way of profits; if the bank has been unreasonable to small business, he can tell it not to be unreasonable, to set the pace. But he has not done it because all to do is deflect the real problem. The real problem in this country is not the banks; it is the Treasurer. I put it to the House that if we replaced the Treasurer we would solve a lot of the problems in this country overnight.",47
64,Mr LLOYD,ECONOMIC POLICIES,"Replace the whole Government.  honourable member for Murray is quite right. I turn to the subject of taxation. This Treasurer and his tax policies over time have broadened sales tax to such an extent that it has become a real burden to the small business sector. In addition to that, the Treasurer has brought forward the payment of income tax, again severely placing a major burden on small business across this nation. Capital gains tax has placed a substantial burden on businesses in rural sectors and rural communities. If small businesses can, in hard times, sell their businesses, the capital gain on the goodwill of that business is subject to capital gains tax. In the rural sector, a deferred death on duty has been reintroduced. When farms are passed on from father to family and then that farm is resold, the farm is then subject to capital gains tax in exactly the same way as the family home. Once the family home is passed on to the son, he might let it for a while and choose to sell it; it is capital gains taxable. Any equity left in the rural sector will' be zapped away if a capital gains tax is applied to any such assets that are sold. In the area of industrial relations, the rural sector has paid the price of higher wages that have been passed onto rural communities which have not been able to recoup those sorts of costs. We are getting to a ridiculous situation now. With the collapse of many businesses, people in rural areas are losing money as a result of creditors. But the interesting thing is, of course, that we are now starting to see unions pushing for redundancy payments and severance pay, as part of being a preferred creditor. Any of those small business people with any equity left as a creditor again are being pushed' towards he is trying the back of the line. It is a bit of a joke, when we have seen in the wage accord, the wage trade-offs, the productivity trade-offs and trade-offs in restrictive work practices, that there were no restrictive work practices in country businesses. There were no restricti ve work practices in the farming sector and rural communities because they were efficient, yet they have paid the price for the cosy deals struck between the Government and the Australian Council of Trade Unions. The rural sector and the small business sector are crumbling at a rate of knots. Small businesses in this country are failing, and failing rapidly, under the Government's policies. One has only to look at the number of smaIl business bankruptcies that are occurring. In the last full year small business bankruptcies increased by a massive 11 per cent. More of interest are the figures for the second quarter of this financial year, when the national increase was 26 per cent. To take some State figures, in the second quarter in Western Australia bankruptcies increased by a substantia- 56 per - ent, and in the second quarter m VIctona by 44 per cent. Those figures do not include those small business people who closed the doors and just walked away. The numbers of closures in sma-l busine-ses in regional and rural AustralIa, and nght across the nation, have been quite substantial. An area of great concern is the rising number of unemployed. To give honourable members a bit of an indication, in February this year 510,000 people were registered for unemployment: By August of this year that figure had mcreased to 619 000 unemployed persons-a substantial '21 per cent increase in six months. Job vacancies fell 8 per cent in September alone. Unemployment now stands at 7.3 per cent. That is having a flow-on effect on the number of small businesses and manufacturing plants in regional country areas. In a lot of cases businesses are closing. There is one example I should quote to the House. An employer in a town in country Victoria that manufactures wool presses and wool handling equipment employed eight months ago 170 people. Today that business employs fewer than a third of that number. What are people to do? Are they going to go along with what the Government keeps saying, or is Australia really looking for an answer as to what needs to be done? The coalition has set the policy and the pace for change. The nation is looking for a substantial vision for the future of this country. The effect of a lack of confidence has been very apparent in the banking sector. The small business sector in Australia is looking for confidence in the future and in - here the Government is taking this natIon. It is interesting that the coalition has set the pace on tax reform, set the agenda for the telecommunications debate, set the agenda in regard to privatisation and industry reform, and today the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) even set the agenda for what should be foreign policy. reform. More importantly, there is a need for substantial changes in the tax system and structural reforms in industry and other areas, to give back to the small business sector certainty in the economy and incentive to invest and to save. The last Budget of the Treasurer has been an unqualified disaster. This country is slipping further and further into a substantial recession, a recession which the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy today admitted is the worse collapse since 1982-83. That will continue to happen until the Government sets a clear agenda for this nation, in the short term and for the future. I do not think the Government has it in it. The coalition has been setting the policies. The nation is demanding a clear vision for its future. It is about time this Government set it.",48
65,Mr COURTICE,ECONOMIC POLICIES,"The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) outlined in a sensible, pragmatic and sane manner the reasons why most definitely the Government needs to maintain its present economic policy and also, in particular, why the wool industry and the wheat industry face problems today. For the record I shall go over them briefly before moving on. The wool industry undoubtedly is facing massive problems, as demand has fallen. The Government has addressed and will continue to address the needs as it sees fit, in conjunction with the wool industry, to overcome those problems. The wool industry is cyclical. Some two years ago it experienced record highs. It is now going to experience record lows. In the wheat industry there have been export enhancement programs, bumper crops overseas and as a consequence of our large crops in Australia there has been a shrinking market. Added to that is the one crisis that we have-the crisis in the Middle East. There is only one crisis, and it is unfortunate that the National Party of Australia cannot get it right again. Undoubtedly the other problem that the crisis has caused is in regard to oil supplies to Western nations. I should point out a few facts that National Party members, and particularly its senators, have failed to understand, as they have run around the nation in the past few weeks trying to talk up a crisis. At the present time Australian fuel is the third cheapest of the 20 International Energy Agency (lEA) countries. At the end of the June quarter this year Japanese consumers were paying 99c a litre, Norway $1.30, the United Kingdom 90c, and Italy $1.56. Since then those charges have increased as a consequence of the behaviour of Sad dam Hussein and Iraq in the Middle East. Australia has the second lowest level of taxes on fuel of any of the 21 lEA countries; Again, without wishing to bore everyone, Australia's taxes on fuel account for about 45 per cent of the total price of petrol. That compares with Germany at 66 per cent, Italy at 77 per cent, United Kingdom at 63 per cent, France at 77 per cent, and Sweden at 61 per cent. The point I seek to make is that this Government is not ripping off the Australian people or the Australian farmers. Australians are paying the same price for fuel as is the rest of the Western world, the freedom-loving nations, as a consequence of what is happening in the Middle East. I would like to try to get across to Opposition members the fact that if the Middle East problem is not resolved, they will not be complaining about having to pay a dollar a litre fot fuel; they will be complaining that they have to pay $10 a litre for fuel. I do not believe that we should acquiesce to a dictator. We should not acquiesce to Sagdam Hussein, a man who shows no recognition of the rights of his own people, let alone those of the people of Kuwait, and has attempted to control the majority of the oil supplies of the world. It does not behove National Party members, at a time when 600 Australian naval personnel are in the Middle East working with the United Nations in a blockade in an attempt to overcome, I hope peacefully, the crisis in the Middle East-and being ably led by the United States of America-to put their hands up and want to surrender, to seek that the Government should change its economic policy with a magic wand. Every time we have debated economic policy in this House, National Party members have failed to put up a credible alternative policy. They want a magic wand to wipe away the problems. When Churchill faced the blitz in 1940 he did not have a magic wand. He had British bulldog courage. Members on the other side of the House must start to show the courage to support . the Government in the tough economic decisions that must be made if,· in the long haul, there is to be an improvement in the welfare of all Australians. They should not run to the rural region of Australia with platitudes, as National Party members do because they want to be popular. In Queensland in particular National Party members are terrified because the League of Rights is trying to take over their Party. They want to run to and fro saying lovely things to different groups, but they do not offer one policy. The most important thing in economic debate is to maintain the right policy and the right economic mix. If that hurts, then more courage is necessary to maintain that policy in the long term interests of the nation, and not to take some wimpish way out because it squeezes or puts politicians under pressure and makes them unpopular. It is more important that this nation should have tough leadership, as we on this side of the House have demonstrated, instead of the wimpish, whining, whingeing that has been heard from the Opposition. During the whole of this debate the Opposition has not put up one simple proposition as an alternative. To emphasise that point, just prior to the Budget, the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) said he planned to save $200m in spending, as if that would have a magical effect on interest rates. The Government came in with a Budget surplus of $8.1 billion. He also called for major reform of industry protection. Yet in this House Government supporters have had to fight tooth and nail every step of the way against the National Party, to free up and reduce protection. So it is unfortunate that National Party members cannot deliver what they say. I would also like to praise the National Farmers Federation. In f-ct, at present .it is meeting with the commIttee that I chalr. It is unfortunat.e that I c-nnot be there, but I believe it IS equally Important to be here to take part in this debate. I believe that John Allwright and the National Farmers Federat.ion have b-en - oderate and responsible 10 the way 10 WhICh t?ey have taken up the concerns about the Impact of the Middle East crisis on rural Australia. However I believe that some of the problems ';e have in rural Australia can be directly sheeted home to the some sections of the leadership of the various primary industry organisations. I suppose the best example of that is the fact that tonight in Queensland the United Graziers Association (UGA) executive will debate whether to support the resolution from the Graziers Association of South-Eastern Queensland on hanging. At a time when the wool industry is facing one of the greatest challenges for many decades-according to the National Party and recognised on this side of the chamber-the UGA in Queensland is to debate hanging, of all things. I am not sure whether it is an idea to reduce sheep numbers by hanging them, by hanging some of the wool leaders or by hanging the Queensland National Party! The problem is that it is a fairly ridiculous propocomparison sition for the UGA in Queensland-Mr L1oyd- Mr Deputy Speaker, could you remind the honourable member of the subject of this matter of public tance? The way he is carrying on does do either his image or that of Parliament any good.",49
66,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ECONOMIC POLICIES,"Mr Hollis) and - I do not need your assistance in making a ruling. I am sure the honourable member is aware that this has been a widecommunity ranging debate. Now that his comments are almost concluded, I am sure he will return to the matter under discussion.",51
67,Mr COURTICE,ECONOMIC POLICIES,"What I was pointing out-and if it embarrasses members of of the National Party and some their mates in the UGA, that is their problem-",51
68,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ECONOMIC POLICIES,I suggest that the honourable member stick to the matter of public importance in the couple of minutes that he has left.,51
69,Mr COURTICE,ECONOMIC POLICIES,"I certainly will. With regard to some of the welfare issues that need to be addressed, I, like other members of the Prime Minister's country task force, have received several representations with regard to the assets test. I have passed these on to the relevant Ministers. I am pleased to know that both the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and the· Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) have decided that their departments will carefully examine the effects of the assets tests due to come in next year. References have also been made to the rural adjustment scheme (RAS). The Minister said at the time of the floor price· decision that the Government would monitor the situation. If and when State authorities are inundated with applications from needy farmers, I am sure that the Government will look at the matter. With regard to this matter of public importance today, it also needs to be pointed out that in discussing the effects on rural Australia, we must consider not only wealthy squatters but also small farmers and workers in rural towns. If one stacks up the record of the Opposition in with that of the Government, one sees that there is no comparison whatsoever. Only a few years ago the provincial city of Gympie was flooded. imporThe State National Party did nothing not about it. Recently we faced the horrendous floods in Queensland and both the State and Federal governments were out there straight away to assess the situation to help those people who had it tough. If we look at Medicare, the home and care program, pensions, veterans affairs-we have the best repatriation system in the western world-we find that these have all been delivered under the Labor Government. It is a sham for the Opposition to pretend in this matter public importance that there is a better alternative when it has not come up with one positive policy.",51

NA MARITIME MUSEUM BILL 1990 Bill received from the Senate, and read a first time. Ordered that the second reading be made an order of the day for the next sitting.

71,Mr COURTICE,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL,"What you have read out, Mr Deputy Chairman, is the full allocation for the Department of Primary Industries and Energy in the current Budget. Within that framework is an allocation of $5.39m for the national residue survey for analytical testing in 1990-91. That compares with $5.09m in 1989-90. The allocation reflects the Government's continued resolve to adequately monitor Australian agricultural produce for chemical residues and to provide assurances of quality. I think we all well remember the problems we faced with the dieldrin experience several years ago. The tax deductability of offshore petrowhich leum platform removal expenditures is also an issue that needs to· be mentioned. The decision is to allow a deduction for the expenditures by the taxpayer other than on plant and equipment, and capital expenditure on housing and welfare incurred in the rehabilitation of eligible mine sites, including the removal of offshore platforms. The Income Tax Assessment Act was amended from 22 August 1990 to extend section 75D to non-primary producing rural businesses earning income from the land. It also allows primary producers and other rural businesses deriving income from the land full tax deductability in the year of expenditure for outlays on fences erected in accordance with the whole farm plan, principally to prevent land degradation. That has been welcomed by people on all sides of the House. The Murray-Darling Basin initiative is to increase funding from $6.7m to $lO.3m in the current year. There is also an allocation of $5.7m towards a program of works and measures agreed by the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council in the context of a natural resources management strategy for the basin. Under the Federal water resources assistance program there is also an allocation of $38.9m for payments to the States and the Northern Territory for 1990-91. There is also an allocation of $8.52m to the Land and Water Resources Research and Development Corporation in its first year of operation. This is provided for water and soil research in the coming year. With regard to the national soil conservation program, there is an allocation of $21.8m for 1990-91. Fundamentally, this is one of the biggest issues that faces this nation. I have said that on many occasions. It affects not only farmers in rural communities, but also people in the city as well. There is also the establishment of the Natural Resource Information Centre which was announced by the Government in May 1988. A total of $5.84m has been allocated for the initiative over three years. Another issue I just mention is the tax deductability .for mine site rehabilitation, should also be welcomed. I would also like to address the issue of government revenue and the possible impact of the present oil price escala-i0!l on the income side or. the Buddget. ItblS .lmPorta that this be dlscusse - s, o. VI0US ly, th etrol and disti11-te pnce mcrea.ses p using concern m the community and --oviding a ser-ous cost to many f-rm businesses and, mdeed, across the natIon. It is because of this that .a. lo- of formation and blatant. pohtlCkmg has be challenged. If anythmg, the present uation has been highl.ighted. by the incomresult petence of various pnmary mdustry group leaders and the Royal Automobile Club the mining industry. of Queensland (RACQ). In fact, the rantings of Noel Mason from the R-CQ - nd Des Whittle from the Cattlemen s Umon suggest that the - re-ible members of their respective orgamsatIons should now conon sider working to find replacements for them. Mason claimed recently in the News Mail of 6 October that motorists have crisis, poured $700m in extra fuel taxes into government coffers since 2 August. .He either hopelessly mcompetent or he IS tellthat ing an untruth, and· it would not bfirst time that he has done that. EIther way he ought to go, and I urge RACQ hear members to use the next available opporators, tunity to replace him. We need construcing tive criticism, not blatant falsehoods. As for Des Whittle, the sooner the Catguts tlemen's Union realises that it needs someone competent and sensible to deal with the problems that fuel is creating, rather than indulging in National Party politicking, the better. If he is going run to the press and rail against the Govcapitalise ernment about petrol prices, as characteristic fashion in the Townsville Bulletin of 3 October, he should, as an industry leader, at least get his facts and research what he says. These groups expect to be taken seriously. With leaderupsets ship such as this, is it any wonder that there is crisis in the wool industry? I return to petrol prices. The fact is-this has even been acknowledged by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewthey son)-that there is no evidence at this stage that there will be any windfall for the Government. In fact, there is a reathat sonable chance that the Government may actually lose tax revenue as a result drop in consumption. Petrol excise, curoil rently at 24.9c a litre, is a tax on volume nt and has not gone up at all as a result of e the Gulf crisis. If the volume used goes are down as a result of higher prices, the Government will lose money from this source. A 10 per cent reduction in consumption will cost the Government about misin- $600m. Primary producers should also be - o reminded this year that the Government SItwill forgo revenue of about $850m as a of the diesel fuel rebate available to primary producers and off-road users in It is time that the media and various poorly led organisations such as the RACQ and the Cattlemen's Union stopped whipping up hysteria. As I said in my speech the matter of public importance, at a time when we have 600 naval personnel in the Middle East trying to resolve this laying their lives on the line, these disloyal people are running around wantis .ing a fistful of dollars. Thank goodness back in the days of the last crisis in the World War II we had Curtin and Chifley instead of some of the apologists that we now, particularly National Party senwhipping up hysteria and complainabout oil prices and being squeezed. What we do need is good old Aussie and a bit of unity. It is a great pity that members of the Opposition, with their hopeiess ideas of getting at this side of the House, are happy to use any problem-even the greatest crisis Western nato tions have seen since World War II-and on it. It is disgraceful and it he did in does them no good at all. I mentioned the United Graziers Assoright ciation in my speech on the matter of public importance. I do not mind if it the National Party of Australia when I say that, at a time when the wool industry faces problems, those people will discuss tonight the rights and wrongs of capital punishment. It is ridiculous and deserve to be prodded. I do not mind being criticised, nor does the Government; but those people need to recognise they too should be held to account. I stress, too, that even if the Governof a ment were to make an extra $345m from taxation-as I said, this is highly speculative-it would enable a reduction in petrol excise of only 1.3c per litre, as has been said. The other thing that needs to be pointed out is that the Prices Surveillance Authority has actually saved rises of between 2c and 8c per litre. Of course, the Opposition wants to abolish the PSA. If the price of petrol is going up because of the Gulf crisis, as I have said, we need to understand that if we do not resolve this problem in a sensible manner and hopefully, without conflict, we will pay a much greater price as well as appeasing an aggressor. I hope that, finally, most people recognise the need for import parity pricing. The Hawke Labor Government, through. parity pricing, has lifted our self-sufficiency to its present high level of between 80 and 90 per cent, touching 90 per cent, from the level of 65 per cent that we inherited in 1983 . .It is in our interests ensure that we develop our energy reserves so that, if something untoward does happen in the Middle East, we can be as self-sufficient as possible. Therefore, we need parity pricing to ensure that companies do develop the reserves we have and that they do not sell to another country paying that same price. The Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) has covered this several times, but it needs to be said again because, obviously, out in the community there are still leaders of various organisations who are discrediting that fact, which is not in the interests of this country. . In the brief time left to me I would like to touch on the initiatives of the Federal Government in the area of trade. It was this Government that led the way in the Cairns Group and it is this Government that has been leading the way on freer trade since day one. It is interesting to note also that at present the United States of America is facing a severe problem with its budget",52
72,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,54
73,Mr ANDREW,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL,"I rise to follow the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) in this committee debate on Appropriation Bill (No.1) considering the appropriations for the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. I note that the honourable member for Hinkler was very prepared to be critical of farm leadership and even to be specific in his criticism of farm leaders in Queensland. I do not for a moment suggest that farm leadership has been perfect; I have had my reasons for being frustrated with farm leadership in South Australia. But I have to remind the honourable member for Hinkler that the sorts of criticisms being levelled at him and at the Government-and, let me confess, at the Opposition-are criticisms that stem simply from a farm leadership that is frustrated. It is frustrated because it recognises that there are enormous problems in rural Australia-problems more dramatic than rural Australia has seen for to three decades. There are problems of interest rates; problems perceived by rural Australia, as the honourable member for Hinkler must agree, with petrol pricing; and problems of people in rural Australia seeing us as having secure incomes while they do not have a secure income. But, fundamentally, what the honourable member for Hinkler and I run into in our electorates is a farm leadership frustrated because it cannot see anyone offering any direction to Australia to get it out of its present mess. I remind the honourable member for Hinkler that the Opposition has not fallen for the ploy of pretending that there are easy answers to Australia's present economic dilemma. We in the Opposition have never suggested that there are easy answers. The Opposition has been prepared, as I believe the honourable member for Hinkler would concede, to indicate when the Government has done something with which the Opposition agreed. The Government has had our support. There have been issues, particularly in rural Australia, on which it would have been much easier for the Opposition to have taken the politically popular course and merely kicked the Government, but we have chosen instead to defend the Government. I find that the electorate is frust-ated, not simply because of the. economIC d-. e we face but because It finds that It !DIS art of a nation foundering through :!ck of leadership. The hono-rab-e member for Hinkler should bear 10 mmd that h is a member of the Government. The Oepposition is prepared to support the Government when. the Government does something responsIble. But farm leaders around Australia are frustrated, as are exporters, farmers and urba- people, b-­ cause they do no- - ee cO-Illn- from thIS Government a dIstmct dIrectIOn out of our economic malaise. The honourable member for Murray (Mr LIoy"") stood in thi- House .bar-ly an hour ago and focused hIS attentIon 10 the matter of public importance that he brought forward solely on what is happening to rural Australia and Australia's principal exporters. The honourable member for Murray made the point that few initiatives from the Government have recognised the present needs of regional and rural Australia. In this committee stage we are looking at those figures and proposals that the Government has handed down in the August Budget presumably, from the Government's perspective, to address some of the needs of regional and rural Australia. The tragedy is that what the Government did in August bears very little resemblance to what was happening to rural Australia in September and is almost meaningless today on 9 October. In fact, in just 48 hours, the whole economic outlook for regional and rural Australia has so dramatically changed as a result of proposals that we are told Cabinet is prepared to endorse for the wool industry that whatever is handed down in the Appropriation Bill for the Department of Primary Industries and Energy becomes almost meaningless. What has happened to rural Australia over the last two months demonstrates very clearly the futility of the National Agricultural Outlook Conference of the Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics. How do we tell what is going to happen in industries as volatile as Australia's primary industries? How do we predict the outcome? The tragedy for rural Australia is not just the economic downturn that every· Australian is carrying but also that rural Australia is carrying more than its share. These Budget documents do nothing to recognise that burden being placed both on rural Australia and on every exporter. Who is bearing the cost of the Middle East crisis? Principally, Australia's farmers, particularly wheat growers and those who choose to export live sheep. Who is bearing the cost of high interest rates? Everybody is, but particularly our exporters. Who is bearing the cost of the Australian dollar, inflated not solely at the behest of the Government but partially as a result of Australia now being seen as one of the few safe havens in the world? It is almost entirely the Australian exporting population, which is largely rural based. The honourable member for Murray in the matter of public importance he brought forward today made it perfectly clear that the principal price being paid by farmers is the price of interest rates. Fifteen years ago 6 per cent of total farm costs, five years ago 9 per cent of total farm costs and today 13 per cent of total farm costs arise from interest rates. What do these Budget documents do to recognise anyone of these major costs being borne by rural and regional Australia? In the face of a rural decline unprecedented for three decades, we have to say: nothing. Principally, Australia needs exports, and the Budget documents that we are considering in this committee stage do little or nothing to encourage exports. In fact, in the allocation to primary industries we. have seen in these Budget Papers being considered in this session a fall in real terms to $423.3m from $445.4m in 1989-90. The fall is projected to continue and is being carried by the export sector, which is the one sector of the economy that we most need to be productive. If that were not enough, we have the producers themselves making a real contribution to the Budget 'through the levies that they are charged. Much of the budget for primary industries and energy is made up of producer levies. I address one other area of the Budget Papers as they refer to the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, and that is the area of export inspection. Those very products that we need to address our balance of payments deficit are now subject to export inspection. Currently, farmers pay 60 per cent of that export inspection cost. The propo-al in this Budget document is that farmers should carry the entire cost of export inspection. Mr Cowan-Sixty million dollars extra.",54
74,Mr ANDREW,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL,"As the honourable member for Lyne has just pointed out, an extra $60m. The move from 60 per cent to 100 per cent is being borne by the sector of the community currently most disadvantaged. How does the Government defend that? Yet these people that both the honourable member for Lyne and I represent would be prepared to consider paying that cost if only they were the ones allowed to determine how export inspection is gone about. But no, the Government saddles it with an export inspection cost and, in addition, says, 'This is how you will go about your export inspection'. The nation needs wheat exports, wool exports and dried fruit exports, and yet the people making these products available are those currently being remunerated the least and being asked to pay the most. I find it difficult to stand in defence of the appropriation being made available for the Department of the Primary Industries and Energy. Mr ELLIOTI' (Partamatta) (5.37)-ln speaking to the allocation in this year's Appropriation Bill to the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, I should say that as the member for Parramatta I do not have a lot of people engaged in rural activity in my electorate, although it is fair to say that the first wool and wheat grown in Australia was grown in my electorate. So it is pertinent that the member in whose electorate Macarthur and so many other famous pastoralists started Australia's rural industry should speak to these appropriations. However, I focus on the allocations in the Budget for the Primary Industries and Energy portfolio that deal with flood mitigation works, because that is a matter that is of vital interest to people who live not only in my electorate but in many urban electorates around Australia. In this particular Budget, the Commonwealth is allocating just in excess of $60m for water resource management in one form or another. In particular, on the issue of flood plain management and flood mitigation funding, which is of vital concern in my electorate, the Government has allocated about $7.5m for that particular work throughout Australia. For New South Wales alone, the allocation is just over $5.05m. That is an increase of 23 per cent on· last year's allocation and is a very significant achievement given the tight budgetary position that applied in the formulation of this year's Budget. I note in particular that the executive of the flood mitigation authorities for New South Wales has written to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) acknowledging the very considerable allocation that is being made in the Budget and expressing interest in the fact that the Minister met with them back in June and has been able to translate his expressed personal interest at that time into a substantial allocation for these works. In speaking on this committee stage, I emphasise the importance of flood mitigation works to our urban infrastructure. It is true that in areas such as western Sydney our infrastructure development depends very much on being able to have flood free property for all forms of development, be it residential, commercial or industrial. It is vital to the future of our region that the Commonwealth maintain its interest in this field and as well has the cooperation of both State and local government in really getting to grips with the problems we have. The importance of the issue was recognised by the Minister in a meeting he held during the last weeks of sitting in September where we discussed formulating a proper and effective Commonwealth strategy for flood mitigation works in western Sydney. The Minister at that time agreed to the establiShment of a special task force to assist hi!? in developing a coordinated strategy m our regIOn to overcome the floo- problems that so many families and busmesses sadly have suffered. The value of Budget allocations for flood mitigation, particularly urban flood mitigation, should be well recognised by all honourable members. However, I want to run through some of the issues that apply to this matter because some people would say-there may even be some bureaucrats who would say-that flood mitigation is an issue the Commonwealth does not have a direct involvement with. I should like to challenge that line of thinking very directly. The importance of establishing and providing effective and adequate flood mitigation infrastructure really will affect the well-being of the whole range of enterprises that we seek to develop in industry and the whole range of people whom we seek to provide housing for in the growing areas of population, particularly in western Sydney. Indeed, approximately 1.6 million people live in western Sydney, west of my electorate of Parramatta. In order for their housing-their living conditions-to be adequate, we must be prepared to assist in providing flood management practices and arrangements which overcome the flood problems that have bedevilled so many of their homes over recent times. The allocation in this year's Budget for flood mitigation in the region will go a substantial way towards developing effective flood mitigation measures in our area. Just to take an example, under the $2:$2:$1 flood funding arrangements which apply-$2 from the Commonwealth, $2 from the State and $1 from local government-the allocation this year will ensure that about $12.63m is spent on flood mitigation infrastructure in our State. I refer to the particular issues in my electorate, which has a yery substantial problem in this regard. The allocation that is provided there is three-quarters of a million dollars for the Toongabbie CreekParramatta River flood mitigation works. When these works are added to the efforts the Commonwealth has made over the past two years, they will ensure that by the end of this financial year almost $5.5m will have been committed and spent through the efforts of the Commonwealth on flood mitigation and retention works in the region. The sorts of works that are being carried out using the funding provided by the three levels of government include development of a range of flood basins to retain water until the flood peak has subsided; channel deepening of the various creeks and streams that flow through the area; lifting of flood affected homes; acquiring properties that are severely floodaffected; and providing things like more effective flodd walls; enlarged drainage systems and other catchment policy measures, such as ensuring that the only development that takes place in these areas is development which is free of the sort of flood devastation that has applied in the past. . Sadly, in the past much of the planning of these areas was not up to today's standards. So we are really picking up a lot of the shortfall in these measures caused through inadequate planning in the past. But what we have to ensure is that the sort of problems that people in areas like the Toongabbie Creek area suffer from are overcome. I know the people of rural New South Wales who have been through floods would recognise the very serious nature of the floods. I can give the Committee a couple of figures to provide some idea of the magnitude of the problem that we are addressing with these allocations. In 1986 something like 400 homes were flooded in my electorate of Parramatta. In 1988, in a flood that occurred there, about 200 homes were flooded. Since then there have been three or four other floods when in excess of 50 homes have been flooded on every occasion. So it is a very serious problem indeed. On each of those occasions people lose tremendous amounts of personal assets and effects. They find it difficult to get insurance to enable them to rebuild and to re-establish their homes. Most of them have reached the stage where unless there is a very substantial funding from governments to overcome the problems, they really have no way out because certainly no-one will come along and seek to buy their properties, which they know are so drastically flood-affected. The sort of issue that is important in these allocations is to recognise that the sooner we can· get funding to overcome these problems the quicker these people can have their lives start to be normalised in that they are able to live in relative safety knowing that if there is a heavy shower of rain they do not have to start trying to move all their personal property to higher ground, if that is at all possible. It is one of those areas where we know that allocations such as this year's Budget and, it is to be hoped, significantly more come next year's Budget, will achieve real results because it is not an open-ended proposition. The report of the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation in 1976 identified that if all the flood mitigation works were carried out in the region most of the homes could be made free of any sort of flood inundation in even a 100-year flood. So it is the sort of area where if the Commonwealth makes an investment now, we reap the benefits later on. If we do not, however, we pay the penalty because either the Commonwealth or the State in future has to pick up the bill for flood damage, be it to public assets or to the private losses that people suffer. So I applaud the amounts provided in this year's Budget. I am pleased to say that I am sure the interest of the Minister will lead to our being able to develop even more concerted programs in future years. I look forward to those measures contributing to a dramatic improvement in the well-being of many people who live in those flood-affected areas throughout our region.",56
75,Mr COWAN,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL,"1 was pleased to hear the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott) say something about the flood mitigation scheme. It is pleasing to see that the Government is making allocations, particularly to continue the maintenance of works that have been established over a period of time along the New South Wales coastline. It brings to mind that if these works had not been carried out at that time, I doubt whether the conservationists or the environmentalists would have agreed to their being done at the present time. However, there are many hectares of land that have been reclaimed which are very productive today. Like the honourable member for Parramatta, we can all talk about our local towns and the flooding that has taken place over the years. Something can be done, from a practical point of view, with the knowledge that we have to alleviate flooding in many parts of Australia. There are a number of issues that can be canvassed so far as the estimates for primary industry are concerned. Over the past seven or eight years Australia has been very lucky indeed to have had reasonable seasons and markets for exports. I am sure this has been a big factor in keeping Australia's economy where it is at present because outside of that fact and the fact of a world breakdown so far as the economy goes, these are the issues that can vitally affect us at the present time here in Australia. In the past few days and earlier this evening in the discussion on the matter of public importance, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) admitted and agreed that Australia's primary industries, which are our backbone, are suffering at the present time. I do not suppose there is any need for me to reiterate the fact because it has been said during discussion on the matter of public importance and in the media in recent weeks as it became evident, that primary industry was going to be reduced so far as incomes are concerned and that there· has been an anticipated 57 per cent drop in the income of farmers over this current year. We should recognise that that has been a very big drop in the income of farmers who have a heavy investment in their industry. Earlier the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) said that the figure was an average of $lm per farm. That is a lot of money when one thinks about it. The farmers in my electorate of Lyne, who are mainly dairying and smaller grazing people, would possibly not have such a large investment but they have $500,000 to $600,000, I am sure on average, tied up in their real estate and the stock and plant on the property. They have to service that-this is the important thing. The important factor about primary industry is that, from an historical point of view, we have faced good times and bad times, not only market-wise but also season-wise. But if we let it go down the drain we will have a falling off in the quality of soil and a falling off in the quality of the buildings on a property. We do not want to see this happen. We have to encourage a farmer to keep his stock together and to maintain his property, particularly the soil, in order that when things do improve his farm is ready to produce. I return to the question of mitigation, which the previous speaker, the honourable member for Parramatta spoke about. It disturbs me that governments within Australia today, at both the State and Federal level, are not focusing sufficient attention on water resources-either to conserve water resources by way of dams and weirs or to assist the farmer to conserve water on his own property. We have to give him a taxation concession of some kind to allow him to conserve water for irrigation and for stock purposes on theproperty. We have a tendency today to forget about that. This country cannot afford to forget about that. At all times, we have to encourage the landowner to maintain the quality of his soil and also to maintain those issues that will keep his costs down. When I speak of issues, I speak of water resource .dev-l?pment on his own property. He IS wIlhng to do this if he receives enc-uragement, but all of our political parh-s must look at this and ensure that we give those incentives to the people who own the land. If one looks at the Australian farmer today, one can see that he is receiving ,:ery l.ittle support from anywhere. We be-Ieve In that. We believe, in principle, that If a farmer and the farming industry generally can survive and improve without government support, that is all very well. But the point I raise in this debate is that government has to be prepared if the need arises, to come to the aid - f a primary producer. That is the key principle. We have to commit ourselves and say that we will come to their aid if our farm. ers have - r-duction of, for example, 57 per cent In Income-as we all know has occurred this year-and also if other factors affect them. If need be, government has to come to their aid because the primary producers have been coming to the aid of everybody over the years. They have not asked for a lot of support. We can all recall the days when there was a subsidy on fertiliser and when the full inspection fee was paid by the taxpayer. All of these issues-including the eradication of disease, which we are all very proud of in Australia, because I think we have completely eradicated tuberculosis-are the things that we have strived to achieve in order to assist our export markets and maintain the quality of our beef, grain and wool. Our commitment so far as we are concerned-and I knothat my Party will give that commitment-is that if a land-holder or farmer gets iD;to trouble we will be there to support him. That can be brought about simply through the discussions that are taking place at the moment in the Uruguay Rou-d and with the Cairns Group. I give credIt to the Government and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. They have gone overseas and argued the case for Australia, which I think is very good. . I have a. feeling that things will not Improve WIthout a very hard battle indeed. We need to put up our case with the 1'1, 12 or 13 other countries that are in a similar situation. Unless the ,United States and the European Community change their attitudes and realise that there are other countries around the world whose economies and standards depend upon getting a fair go, and unless those two groups are able to sit down sensibly and look at the problems of the dairy industry, the problems with beef, wool and, particularly, wheat, the Australian farmer faces a problem. The important point to remember is that the primary and resource sectors combined are responsible for 80 to 85 per cent of our total exports out of Australia. If we want to balance our terms of trade, these are the sectors which will enable us to do so. Manufacturing industry will not be able to do it for a long period. But the soil is there. There are people working the soil. There are people who want to extract minerals out of the soil. Unless we give them some freedom and some encouragement they are not going to be able to do this. Australia's future depends very greatly upon this. I have spoken very broadly, which I did not intend to do, but these are the factors that I think we have to face realistically. We have to look at not only maintaining primary industries, but also giving farmers the incentive to expand and improve their properties so that their production costs 'are lowered. Those are the things that will save our balance of trade situation. I turn to the forestry industry. We are a tree-growing land and I regret very much that in the late 1960s the Commonwealth withdrew its funding for the softwoods agreement. That should be brought back again and maintained. The Commonwealth should support the States. The forests are planted in the States. We should be giving financial support to them to plant the forests that we need in Australia. Why should we be importing timber, even softwoods, into Australia? Why should we be importing processed fish into Australia?",58
76,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,60
77,Mr HICKS,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL,"A number of speakers before me have voiced the opinion that things are not good in rural Australia. Of course, we all know that that is right and when rural Australia is suffering the rest of Australia is not far behind. It will not be long before people in major capital city areas of Australia realise just how important the rural industries are. If we look at the various commodity groups, we see that wool is facing a major crisis. The price of wheat will be down severely. The citrus industry in my electorate is also facing a problem, particularly with the importation of frozen orange juice concentrate from Brazil and other countries with favoured nation status. The wine industry, going on the last production figures' available, will produce a surplus of wine. I hope that the season coming up will be a good one but, unfortunately, we think there will be problems. Of course, imports which affect the canned fruit industry are coming in. The Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia, the honourable member for' Murray (Mr Lloyd), during the debate today on a matter of public importance, referred to the increase each year in the amount of processed food coming in from overseas. That is putting great pressure on our processed food industry. As we all know, rural industries are very important. I would like to touch on one subject which some speakers have not touched on, and that is the importance of keeping those people who are working in our rural industries in rural areas. A lot of those people have just about had it right up to the neck. We know that some say that people go into those areas because it is a way of life. They say that our farmers are on the farm because it is a way of life and that our miners are in outback Australia because they like that type of lifestyle, the pay is good, and they like to be involved in an industry which is at'the forefront of our economy. Just recently I have seen in my electorate that some people are tempted to say, 'What is the point of this? We are working hard for the nation but nobody seems to care about us'. One of the matters that I would like to touch upon is roads. Our road system is falling apart. The Federal Government does not seem to be providing much money for it. If one travels around, as I, like many other members of this House and many other Australians, do-particularly in rural Australia-one will find that, particularly due cent wet weather, the road system IS falling apart. I really do not kno.w ,:""here money will come from to assIst m gettmg those roads back in order. But those ro-ds are vital not only for the transportatIon of produce to market, but also for their social implications. We all know the treBroken mendous hazards that these roads create. So there is a social cost as well. While I am on the subject of keeping people in outback Australia. I a- not only talking about our great rural mdusing; tries' I am talking about our primary dust-ies in particular, our mining industrY-I should point out that the Australian National Line (AN) has proof duced a 'report which recommends the closure of the railway passenger services between Broken Hill and Adelaide; Port Augusta and Adelaide; and Mount bier and Adelaide. This is a catastrophe of the first order. It has come about mainly because of this nation's economic probof lems and AN has put a submission to this effect to the Government. At the moment a delegation, comprising the Mayor of Broken Hill, Alderman Peter Black, President of the Building Workers IndusMelbourne  and other representatives from Broken Hill and other major areas, is in Parliause ment House talking to the Government. Members of that delegation are saying, 'Look, this is not good enough; th.ese country towns are already suffering from a lack of jobs'. We know that in Broken Hill in particular the mining industry gone through some sort of reformation and numbers in the work force have Sydney dropped. Jobs are very scarce. Mr Cowan-It is also important for tourists.",60
78,Mr HICKS,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL,"It is very important for tourism, as the honourable member for Lyne has just said. Both the job structure a-d tourism are very important to HIll, Port Augusta and Mount Gambier. Also of importance is the social obligation of the railway system to provide railway p.assenger services, particularly for penpeople sIOners and those people who do not have any other means of getting to Adelaide and back. Adelaide is the nearest major to t.he recapital city to Broken Hill. The delegation has made a recommen-he dation to the Minister. It has asked the Minister to reject the Australian National request to close the services; to designate passenger services as a community service obligation on all South Australian and Hill routes; direct Australian National to develop a creative and wideranging definition of community service obligations; inject moneys into Australian National to allow passenger fleet upgradrequest Australian National to proinduce accurate passenger service accounts; and request revision of Australian National marketing policies to encourage use the aforementioned passenger services. That is one way that the Government and the Minister could assist these rural areas, particularly those areas that are providing Gamso much wealth for this nation. We have talked about the road system and the rail system. There is also the issue telecommunications. The Government is moving towards privatisation. I get a little fed up when I hear people talk about cross-subsidisation. They say that the mathe jor trunk routes between Sydney and and Melbourne and :ijrisbane, et cetera, are subsidising those people in country areas. I say to those people who that as an argument that it is really not a cross-subsidisation because if these people were not living in outback Australia and providing the wealth of this nation-estimates of this vary from 60 to 80per cent at any given time-there has would not be too many phone calls being made between Sydney and Melbourne and and Brisbane along the trunk lines. . There is a community obligation to ensure that whatever happens the people in rural areas, who are really keeping the economy of this nation going, are not charged any more than their counterparts in the city areas. That is one' area in Broken which the Government could help. I notice also that the Government seems to go on and on, to the point where it is almost conducting a crusade against the living in rural areas, whether they are miners or farmers. The Government is talking about increasing the pipeline cost by 25 per cent, with an additional 25 per cent later. The communities of Griffith, Leeton and Narrandera were hoping to get natural gas into their community. They are very concerned about the actions of the Federal Government in trying to increase these charges. I know that litigation is taking place. I just hope that the Government rethinks its attitude. Here again, a very important part of rural Australia is trying to do something about creating jobs and the proposed charges are just a further blow to it. One final matter I would like to speak on relates to the conservation movement. I believe that Australia is very conservation minded. I am sure that most people in this Parliament are. I know certainly that farmers are and the mining industry has moved a long way in that direction. I picked up a mining journal the other day and was interested to find that 26 per cent of the land area of Australia cannot be mined, farmed or logged. Twenty-six per cent is either ullder heritage listing, a preserved forest or· Aboriginal land. As if that were not bad enough, but another alarming figure is that a further 20 per cent is under consideration for locking up-in a country whose manufacturing base is almost zero, from what I can gather. The situation will never improve unless the Government and the union movement do something about freeing up the system. In a few short years 46 per cent of this nation could be untouchable. We depend on our mining, our farming and our forests for the very wealth and well-being of our people. I think that it is about time we started to sit down and think very seriously about the direction in which we are going. Certainly one of the great attributes of this country is that we do have wilderness areas. I am sure that we are very conservation minded. We do not have the pollution problems of Europe and we ought to make sure that we keep it that way. But for a nation which at this stage depends on its mining and farming for its very existence and quality of life to have 46 per cent of its land area tied up so that we cannot touch it just seems to me to be a real problem. Mr Cowan-We are cheating future Australians.",61
79,Mr HICKS,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL,"We certainly are. Our future generations are in for great trouble unless we can do something about overcoming that problem. I thought I would touch on those subjects. I would like the Minister to look at the problems facing Broken Hill in particular in relation to the railway passenger service. I would also like him to rethink the Budd car service and to provide, if he can, a copy of the AN report to that delegation from Broken Hill. Without that report it is very difficult for anyone to counter AN's arguments. If the Government would rethink this matter, not only would it be providing employment, looking after the tourism industry and fulfilling its social obligations, but it would also be doing something to keep people in those areas of the country where we need them if we are to have a productive and wealthy Australia.",62
80,Mr NEHL,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL,"Thank or is you, Mr Deputy Chairman, for your indulgence in allowing me to speak for a brief time in this section of the debate. I would like to take this opportunity to draw the attention of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) to the fact that it appears that the Australian banana industry is once more under threat from disease from imports. I give credit to the Minister for the way he acted the last time this sort of threat erupted. I think at that stage it related to the fact that bananas were to be imported from Fiji and there was the possibility that the total Australian banana industry would be wiped out because of imported disease. I speak in particular of black sigatoka and moko disease, which have the capacity to totally destroy the Australian banana industry. The last estimate of the value of the banana industry that I have seen is that it is currently worth $150m. The area I am talking of covers northern New South Wales, from Yarrahappini right up to the Queensland border and into the Queensland banana growing areas. I understand that the present threat comes from bananas which may be imported from Ecuador. These imports bring about the possibility of introducing black sigatoka and moko which could possibly totally wipe out the Australian banana industry. When one considers that that industry is worth $150m one realises the amount of employment and the value it provides to the Australian economy. If our industry. were wiped out, the impact on the balance of payments-as well as on our banana growers-would be very significant indeed. I just wanted to take this opportunity of saying that I am perturbed and alarmed that this may be possible. I understand-and I am seeking more information-that the proposition is that the bananas from Ecuador should be imported through New Zealand to Adelaide. If this is going to be a way of destroying an Australian horticultural industry of great value I think it is a perversion of the closer economic relations arrangement. I thank you again, Mr Deputy Chairman, and I look forward to receiving a favourable response from the Minister to what is undoubtedly. a very significant threat to one of Australia's most important horticultural industries. Proposed expenditure agreed to. Department of Social Security Proposed expenditure, $949,620,000.  (6.10)- Mr Deputy Chairman, no other portfolio better indicates the problems the Australian economy or the reasons for the decline in our standard of living than an analysis of the social security portfolio. Appropriations of $29,561 billion to cial security represent 31.8 per cent of all Budget outlays, and this is up from 30 centive is provided. per cent last year. When we add this to the $13 billion for health, it must raise real fears that these two areas of governfurther. ment responsibility threaten to consume the entire economy and, as such, threaten our. ability to maintain adequate levels socIal progress. The appropriations also show an expectation that outlays for the unemployed will rise substantially as the Budget of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) fails t- ad-ress - he mess his high interest rates, hlg- .mflatlOn and high dollar monetary pohcles have imposed on productive dustries and those industries employing so much of Australia's work force. There are a number of initiatives deserving support in the social security area, particularly the restructuring of the unemployment benefit, which will be abolished on 1 July 1991 and replaced by a new approach involving the Jobsearch allowance for the first 12 months of unemployment and the Newstart allowance for those unemployed for more than 12 months. While it can be argued that these changes do not go far enough, they are important steps in returning a level of self-esteem and opportunity to the genuine unemployed and also represent an initial saving of some $79m to the Budget in 1991. These changes also give hope to the long-suffering worker and taxpayer that at last some social justice will emerge in the administration of welfare. However, the Government and the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) should be encouraged to look further, at a range of policies that impact on the ability of sole parents to pull themselves out of the welfare regime through full or part time work. The high levels of taxation today give no incentive to sole parents to come into the work force under current taxing arrangements. In the last sittings of this House· I raised the situaof a constituent on a supporting parent benefit who, on earning $64.14 after in tax and extracting the loss of rental benefits and pension that this caused, found herself left with only $29.04. Obviously the Minister needs to review positions sosuch as that of a small wage earner on social security benefits to ensure that inMay I turn to the Government's decision to extend the tax file number still The Government will not leave this matter alone. It has not accepted the decision of this Parliament or the will of of the Australian people not to introduce the Australia Card. It is at it again, and we demand a full explanation of this sudden decision to cover the entire social security system with tax file number requirements. I remind you, Mr Deputy Chairman, that two years ago the Treasurer said that uninder the Government's proposal all pensioners were excluded from the tax file number requirements. He also said that the Government was in complete agreement with the majority recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs that, if acted, the tax laws amendment of tax file numbers would be strictly limited in its terms so that it applied only for taxation purposes and that those purposes should be framed so as to prevent a progressive extension of the ambit of the Bill. What then are we in this Parliament to make of this sudden announcement that the cross-matching of social security, erans affairs, student assistance and tion records to identify incorrect payments and fraudulent claims is estimated to save more than $800m over the next three years? The community is entitled to a full explanation in order to test the validity of these claims. What is the basis for the estimates? Have they merely been plucked out of the air or are they based on mation which must have been causing the Government very serious concern when it was vigorously defending that it had any such problems? The requirement to provide tax file numbers for recipients of sole parent and family allowance supplements and new claimants for family allowances constitutes a dramatic extension of the use of the tax file number-so much so that the Privacy Commissioner has questioned it publicly. Without doubt the tax file number is rapidly becoming the multipurpose identifier and will become a compulsory precondition for receipt of benefit. What, we ask, will be the leak through the various departments and the ability for a range of departments and individuals to match this information? The Minister himself has admitted that he knows little about his portfolio and has a lot to learn. Fair enough, but any system that allows for the linking of all agencies provides a government with enormous power, unlawful surveillance and control and ultimate potential for abuse. We should expect better. I hold the view that government intervention through a social security system on behalf of the Australian people should focus primarily on the very young, the aged and the disabled. I also acknowledge a willingness that works towards the integration of the disabled into the general Australian community and work force and enaway from institutionalisation. Such a philosophy, however, is unacceptable when a commendable goal is made mandatory. The forced integration of the disabled into the work force has, in practice, simply transferred the responsibility for the disabled away from the community and the taxpayer through government policies to our voluntary and charitable organisavettions. These organisations today are betaxacoming increasingly unable to cope through deficiencies of human and financial resources. Such a situation becomes worse in times of increasing and high unemployment, when even the able-bodied find satisfactory employment beyond their grasp. I wish to refer in particular to remarks infor- made by the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) to a forum on the disabled. At that forum the Minister said that it was totally unsatisfactory that about 20 per cent of the disabled in the work force earn less than $10 a week above the Government's invalid pension. He said: I make it clear that I regard this as a totally unsatisfactory outcome given the Federal Government's substantial investment in sheltered workshops. It is no wonder that he has raised the anger of the disabled organisations. The peak body controlling disabled organisations, the Australian Council for Rehabilitation of Disabled (ACROD), said that there were disabled services paying some $70 and more per week on top of the pension to disabled people in sheltered workshops. Service providers in the disability field were angered by the criticism of sheltered workshops made by the Minister, and they have every reason to be. ACROD members have been fully supportive of the Disabilities Services Act since its introduction in July 1987. However, members have been concerned and frustrated by the manner in which the Act has been implemented. The new Disabilities Services Act seeks to provide the disabled with the services and training necessary to take a more active part in the community and work force. Many of the issues involved in the slow pace of movement to the open work force by the disabled are beyond. the control of disabilities service providers. Member agencies are constantly knocking on doors looking for jobs for their clients, but the common response is that there are no jobs. 1 remind t.h.e Government that it imposes a $40 ceIlmg on the weekly earnings of benefit recipients. 1 mention this issue in some detail because of the impact on a very successful sheltered workshop, the Wimmera Wool Factory, at Horsham in my electorate. The main form of employment and income here revolves around the production of ultra-fine wool from shedded sheep. The workshop provides a broad base of opportunities for employees to learn skills that are required in the community. As a result of the skills acquired in this workshop, the Wimmera Wool Factory has been successful in winning several tenders for sale of wool to Japan and has also allowed its employees to operate outside the workshop, to expand their employment base and gain further integrated movement into the community. The opportunities provided at the Wool Factory provide meaningful work that is of good value, thus enabling employees to aim to reach proficiencies required in open employment. Employees are also encouraged to participate in community activities and the Wool Factory management is interested in taking on only work that is of value and does not demean the employees. It regards these jobs as being those that enable them to charge fair and reasonable prices to their customers and also enable them to be profitable. I would say in the most generous terms to the Minister: do not let ideology frustrate or defeat the work of this or other outstanding facilities, and do not let union influence or envy destroy a successful example of a community caring for its disabled people. Finally, may I turn to the effect of the changes to the assets test for assessment of eligibility for pensions, family allowances and family income supplements and the effects that this will have on farming communities and owner-operated small businesses. 1 believe that this Budget decision to further reduce eligibility through the assets test is the worse decision in the Budget of 1990. It creates a discriminatory test to deny almost totally any semblance of social equity to this group of Australian citizens.",62

82,Mrs JAKOBSEN,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL,"ln dealing this afternoon with the Appropriation Bill (No.1) 1990-91 relating to the Department of Social Security 1 would like to speak on the particular point of pensioner deeming and generally on total outlays in this area. As has been mentioned in Budget Paper No.1, total social security and welfare outlays are expected to increase by $3,232.6m or 12.3 per cent in 1990-91-that is, 5.7 per cent in real terms. Our existing policies imply a slowing of expenditure growth to a real average annual increase of 1.9 per cent over the four years to 1993-94. These trends reflect an initial strong growth in outlays on the aged and disabled, in part due to the $2.50 a week pension increase which other legislation in this chamber has dealt with and which is expected to moderate in the Forward Estimates period as a result of new pension arrangements for disabled persons and strengthen entitlement review activity for both pensions. Assistance to the aged accounts for one-third of total social security welfare outlays and assistance to families with children accounts for around 20 per cent. The main areas of growth in outlays are assistance to the unemployed and the sick, which is a 27.4 per cent increase; assistance to the disabled, a 12.5 per cent increase; and assistance to the aged, an 11.7 per cent increase. The specific point about deeming is covered at 3.130 of Budget Paper No.1. It says: . . . for the purposes of the income test on pensions and benefits, cash and money on deposit is to be assessed at a minimum rate of 10% for amounts over $2000. For amounts up to $2000 the actual rate of return will apply. The same level of threshold applies to single pensioners beneficiaries and to married couples. Similarly it is proposed to assess income at a minimum rate of 10% on deprived assets and low interest loans. These measures are estimated to result in savings of $13.8m in 1990-91, $73.7m in 1991-92 and $79.7m in 1992-93. They will be undertaken in conjunction with the further expansion of the Financial Information Service for Pensioners (FISP). Pensioners and beneficiaries who place their low-yield money in higher yielding investments will in fact achieve a net increase in their disposable incomes and, because their PHB Card entitlement will be preserved, keep their entitlement to pensioner fringe benefits provided by the Commonwealth . . . I have had quite a nllmber of representations to me on this point and many of the people who have spoken to me expressed some concern that their existing moneys in excess of $2,000-because up to $2,000 seems to be fine-were currently in quite satisfactory bank accounts which were not receiving 10 per cent. These people were not trying to avoid earning the extra money; it was just that where they were .placing the money it was not earning quite 10 per cent. It may have been 9.5 or 8.5 per cent. It was not their intention not to get whatever they could out of that money. These people have expressed a concern that they have to keep the money reasonably accessible because they are not quite sure what they will need it for or when. An amount of $2,000 these days is not quite enough for them to be able to cover any emergencies that may occur. It is important that people understand what was on offer, at least at 31 August, in most of the major banks. The office of the Minister for Social Security, Senator Richardson, did a survey on this point. I had been informed that the Commonwealth Banking Corporation, for instance, did not have a deposit which would allow people to earn quite 10 per cent. A table of interest rates available from major institutions shows that the Commonwealth Banking Corporation had a savings investment account, which could be from $2,000 to $5,000, from which people could earn 9.5 per cent on their money; a standard term deposit of one month where 11 per cent could be earned; and a standard term deposit of three months where 13 and per cent could be earned. That took care quite nicely of the $2,000 to $5,000 amounts. For $5,000 to $10,000 there was a savings investment account of 9.5 per cent; a security plus investment of 10.5 per cent; another standard term deposit of one month giving 11 per cent; and again the standard term deposit of three months at 13 per cent. I will have to discuss this with my constituents again and find out what advice they have been receiving on these matters but it seems that at least the Commonwealth may be able to address their needs. In this day and age, where people are concerned about placing their very hardearned savings in smaller institutions at higher interest where they may not have the security that they require or at least those deposits may not have the appearance of security, it is important that people understand that in larger institutions they can at least get the 10 per cent which the Minister and the Government are endeavouring to have them obtain. Westpac Banking Corporation, on the other hand, also seems to have fairly reasonable rates of return, with a savings investment account above $5,000 where a 10.75 per cent yield can be obtained. For $5,000 to $10,000 a term deposit of one month will yield 12.25 per cent and a term deposit of three months will yield 13.25 per cent. Anybody who has in excess of $10,000 probably would not have a great deal of problem putting their money into an advantage saver account with Westpac or a cash management at call account with the Commonwealth. Probably the concerns that were expressed to me may have been a little bit over the top but two people that I perso ally know who had this difficulty-n just the constituents, whose affairs I w not sure of-had looked into this qu deeply and were being told that thesea counts were not available. I· will ma sure that this information gets return to them. . Honourable members may also be terested to know that the Australia a New Zealand Banking Group Ltd has high performance passbook account for amounts between $5,000 and $10,009 Australia. which yields 10 per cent, a term deposIt f one month which yields 12 per cent - nd a term deposit of three months which yields 13.25 p-r cent.

I also want to talk briefly about restructuring of the unemployment beneInformation fit which will be abolished and replaced by two new payments, the Jobsearch lowance for the first 12 months of unemthe ployment and the Newstart allowance for people who are unemployed for more than 12 months. Although it seems to be abolishing the unemployment benefit the Government is making a better pr-vision for people who are unemployed than was the previous case. I base that comment on the fact that when the Joblishing search allowance was first introduced for young people who were going to be out work for possibly the next 12 months was criticised roundly by many youth workers in the community and I was able to say at that stage-and I still maintain this position-that at least they had substantive, proactive relationship with the Commonwealth Employment Service which ensured that they would get proper attention in obtaining employment. I lieve the same will apply to people who will now be under the Jobsearch and trust account. Newstart allowances. Proposed expenditure agreed to.",65

84,Mr HAWKER,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL,"ln my remarks tonight on the Department of have Administrative Services I would like concentrate on the move to the increased use of trust accounts and the coalition's concern about the fact that these trust accounts could be used as a means of reducing the accountability of the Departsame ment to the Parliament and the people of I guess all honourable members would be aware that there has been a move to use trust accounts as a means to commercialise parts of the Department of Administrative Services and to try to make goo.d them more commercial. We might first look at where this is happening and then at the effect. In fact, IS 10 of the Department's subprograms will the operate on a quasi-commercial basis in They ate: Australian Construcwe tion Services, both Project Services and Assets Services; Australian Property the Group; Australian Surveying and Land Group; the Australian Valuation Office; Transport and Storage alGroup; the Purchasing and Sales Group; Australian Protective Service; the Australian Government Publishing Service; and the Australian Government Anavery harsh lytical Laboratories. The idea of the trust accounts is to use them either as a working account for activities with a commercial orientation, such as the Australian Governlllent PubService, or to hold moneys_ in trust for specific purposes set out in the legisof lation. Under all the Department's trust it accounts there are a group of two trust accounts established under section 62 of the Audit Act-that is, the working accounts covering certain government agena cies and certain other accounts in the nature of suspense accounts-and trust accounts established under other Acts to .meet future expenditure. Expenditure befrom the trust is appropriated for, and limited to, the specific purpose of each This means that the Department, to the extent to which it has captive clients, such as, for example, the Australian Government Publishing Service, has the opportunity to maintain the present system and yet to take it to some extent off Budget. For example, in many cases departments little option but to have their printto ing done by the Government Printer. Therefore, they have to pay the rates that the Government Printer prescribes. In other words, in many ways it remains a monopoly system. Likewise, we have the sort of situation in Com car, which is part of the Department. Of course, as all honourable members would know, parliamentarians are expected to use Comcar whenever they need its services. Under the Australian Construction Services there are some departments which have to refer their designs to this section of the Department and will continue to have to do so. The point that I am making therefore is that under these trust accounts it is difficult to say that they really do move to introduce competition in the real sense of the word. The reason that I raise this point is that we are concerned that the use of trust accounts could, because they are off Budget, allow the Government to be not fully accountable to the Parliament as to what is really being spent by this Department through the use of these trust accounts. We are also very concerned about the proliferation of these trust accounts. As I have already mentioned there are 10 such accounts and no doubt the Government would be considering using more of these trust accounts. I give just another example of the way these trust accounts could be abused. Duplication could go on. For example, Australian Construction Services (ACS) persists in establishing its own furniture equipment testing facility in Melbourne when the Australian Furniture Research and Development Institute, which is in Launceston, was established for that very reason. In fact, it was estabeffect, lished as a result of the Helsham inquiry and it has the support of the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce. Clearly what we see is a duplication where both of these facilities are undertaking same work, both of them obviously funded by the Commonwealth. Clearly by the use of trust accounts the accountability to parliament is less obvious. Obviously the original intent in setting up trust accounts was laudable in that it was to try to make the Department use more competitive means for spending money and therefore, hopefully, to make the Department's services cheaper to the Commonwealth and in a more competitive position with the private sector. But as I have already pointed out, because of duplication and because of the fact that in many cases we have captive clients to the Department it is very difficult to see how these trust accounts are going to achieve that aim of making the services more competitive and therefore, hopefully, cheaper to the Commonwealth and the taxpayers of Australia. Because departments have captive clients within the Public Service, our concern continues that this allows the departments to cover fixed costs at monopoly rates and often in a way that will not be as obvious to the Parliament as it was under the previous system. It will also enable departments to compete with the private sector, if they wish, using marginal costing. In other \Vords, as this has happened. in quite a number of government departments both at the State and Federal level, we will see the situation where the Department or the section of the Department will be using a charge-out rate that is considerably below what it is charging for the services it is providing to its captive clients and therefore taking an unfair advantage against the private sector which may be competing. So from both points of view we are seeing a situation where the establishment of trust accounts could have serious limitations in achieving what the Government has stated it is supposed to do. If we come back to the case of using marginal costing, we see that we have, in a form of subsidy from those who are captives of the Department and through this subsidy we are effectively seeing the Department using its tied clients to make government business enterprises the appear to be competitive and efficient; in other words, again giving a very misleading picture about what really is occurring. However, if something goes off the Department's budget it will probably appear on another department's budget where, in fact, there is a captive client. So what we could be seeing is the use of these trust accounts by the Department of Administrative Services as a means of making the Department appear to be more cost effective than it really is and also making it much more difficult for individual members and senators and the Parliament itself to see how effective the c<?st-cutting exercises that the Department IS SUppOSedly undertaking are, in fact, being carried out. It is for those reasons that we have strong reservations about this use of trust accounts in the 10 areas that I have already highlighted. Therefore, we would question whether this change tp.at the Government has brought about IS really achieving what it set about to in the particular circumstances that I have already outlined. The other point about the use of trust accounts is that it is a means of hiding government revenue and expenditure. It is a means of giving the community and the media an impression, the false impression, that government revenue and government expenditure have been reduced, when really what has happened is that they have been taken off budget. In many ways this is taking the user pays principle to the extreme. In many ways, the requirement that all businesses tendering for contracts pay the Department of Administrative Services a commission on the resultant sales from the tender means that the Department could use this to inflate its revenue when, taking the user pays example as it has been proposed, it is a means of generating revenue at the expense of another department. On that point as well I feel-",67
85,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,69
86,Mr MACKELLAR,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL,"1I have a concern about the Department of Administ-ative Services, and particularly whether ItS present size and diversified responsibilities make for efficient administ-ation. Budget Paper No.3, the portfoho program estimates, shows that in terms of - ollar outlays the Department is not a major player, with total estimated ouUa.ys of only $431m in 1990-91, and that IS d<?wn from $642m in the previous year. ThIS reflects a combination of the Int-oduction of the user pay principle, to which my colleague the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) referred the transfer of operating accounts to trust arrangements, and substantial reductions in the Australian Construction Services. But in. terms of employment, the Department IS more substantial, with estimated total staff rears of 14,201 in 1990-91. The administrative complexity of the Department. becomes more apparent when its functions ar- considered. For example the Minister for Administrative Serviceadministers 27 pieces of legislation and th- De.p<l:r-ment is divided into 17 operatmg dIVISions or programs. Those 17 divisions cover a diversity of responsibilities ranging from the Australian ConstructioServices to printing, surveying, meteorology, valuation, analytical laboratories and parliamentary services. I am aware that senior management in the Department has been concerned to fTea!e a corporate identity from such diverSIty, and addressed this with a departmental conference in mid-1989. This was in fact mentioned in the Department's 1989-90 annual report. I want to highlight two particular remarks made by the permanent head, in order to give substance to my own concern about the effectiveness of the Department in its present form. He said: The Department's corporate health needed to be reassessed. He continued: We have been preoccupied with reviews, the result being a focus on the programs rather than - he who-e. Clients are still being told about servIces available rather than being asked what services they need. . These are very im\Jortant observations. The first seems to me to be a very proper and perceptive acknowledgment by management that a start must be made to bring a degree of unity and cohesiveness into a particularly unwieldy and complex departmental structure. That foresight and e-ort .should be applauded, but my own VIew. IS that equal attention should be given also to further micro-economic reform opportunities which still exist within the Department, and that at least five of the existing programs would be better located in other departments which have related portfolio responsibilities. The second point made by the permanent head, concerning client satisfaction, must be a key objective for a department commissioned to provide service over a wide range of public sector functions. It is an acknowledgment that, in setting up a new department and in meeting dramatically altered policy objectives, the first concern is to get systems into place. With that initial task completed, the very necessary second stage is to assess the extent to which those systems really do meet client needs. This task requires high priority and very careful attention, because examples abound of administrative procedures that might well satisfy departmental or system requirements, but are cumbersome and inconvenient to the client. I shall mention one example, which I hope the Minister for Ldcal Government (Ms Fatin), who is at the table, and other members of the House will really take to heart, because' when I do mention it I think they will have a strong fellow feeling. We have now a 12 digit identifier number for what used to be called the Federal members' authority (FMA) card. It used to be three numbers and now it is 12; mine is 212271 7, plus the personal identification number (PIN). I do not know how many different numbers people have to remember as they go about their daily business and how many different PINs they have, but most people these days have more than one. I find it totally inconvenient that the system which was very client compatible has been changed. I know a letter was written to the previous Minister about this issue, suggesting that the previous system was very much more convenient, very much more user friendly. But I have seen no evidence whatever of a response from the Minister for - Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) or the Department which would show at least any indication that they had some concept of the difficulty that the changes have brought about. When one is using an FMA number, one is generally in a situation where one does not have access to cards or to diaries where one may have jotted down the number. I ask the Minister most specifically to look at this matter carefully once again so that members of parliament once again may have a system whereby the making of telephone calls under the Federal members' authority can be easily and effectively carried out. Another example I should like to bring to the attention of the Minister is a questionnaire, which my office recently received from the Parliamentary and Ministerial Services Office, seeking user comment on the. efficiency and effectiveness of that service. My reply was heavily qualified, and I gather that other parliamentarians have made similar qualifications. I commend the people for issuing the questionnaire. It is a positive step towards identifying customer attitudes. I look forward hopefully to an equally positive and quick response to the inefficiencies it will undoubtedly disclose. Finally I must take issue with the comment in the Department's last annual report that-and I quote: There is a close working relationship with the Parliamentary Information Systems Office to ensure there is a high degree of compatibility between systems used by senators and members in their Parliament House offices and their electorate offices. Let us have a look at that. It is simply not correct, and that is putting it at its lightest, that a high degree of compatibility has been achieved. Let me now have a look at a brief summary of the word processing experiences in my Canberra and Manly offices. A word processor was first installed in my electorate office in 1986, and another in my Canberra office in 1988. The former was HRC hardware, but was converted to Cleveland in 1988. In the Canberra office we started with a Digital Vaxmate which was converted to a Cleveland in 1989. In March of this year the software program in the electorate office was converted from WPS to WordPerfect 5.0. The software program in the Canberra office was converted from WPS to WordPerfect 5.1 some five months later, in August, and I have just been told that next month the electorate office will be converted from WordPerfect 5.0 to WordPerfect 5.1 as well. The conversion to WordPerfect necessitated the replacement of the existing Impact printers with Gestetners. So after four years we will have a ation where staff can move between the electorate and Canberra offices. and identical hardware and s?ftware. That taken only four years, wIth a tremendous degree of duplication of effort and a great waste of money. I suggest to the Departwas ment and to the Parliamentary Informaegory tion Systems Offi-e .that the - istory word processing wIthIn the parlIamentary system has been anything but an example of a close and coordinated working tionship. In fact it has been the .utter reverse. It has been a source of contInual and annoying inconvenience for everyto body concerne-. Not oply has it bee!l annoying and Inco-vement, - ut also has been unnecessanly expenSIve. I want to finish with the observation that the Department of Administrative Services describes its mission as being satisfy its clients' needs by delivering for money services, that is, what the client wants, on time and on budget': - here a long way to go before that mISSIOn be said to have been achieved, but I commend the Department's management stress and staff for showing both an awareness of and a willingness to strive towards that target. Having said that, I hope that the Minister at the table will convey to her colleagues the very real inconvenience which has been a feature of some of the activities, and particularly to look again at the Federal members' authority, cause it really is a nonsense.

It called it a 'CAM sham' because it would be difficult know how that review committee could now favourably report in view of this preIt emptive strike by the Government. What does this mean to an average nursing home? In Queensland an average sized nursing home of 58 beds will lose 'to $'13,260 annually. In New South Wales an value average sized home of 57 beds will lose $17,628 annually. And so it goes on for is the various States. The Government has can changed the rules in midstream. Theredo fore, there will be job losses and great will be placed on the staff of those organisations which will want to maintain the quality of care, but which will then have to fund this additional loss of hours from their own resources. This will lead to the eventual loss of these establish.ments. The funds can only come from one source and that is the establishments bethemselves. They are operating without this extra subsidy. I know that there is concern within the industry. The comment has been made by the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Health Howe) that he was either unaware of or was not consulted about this reduction, which was handled through the Department of Finance or the Treasury. As a result of that, the aged care industry will suffer a reduction of some $7m this year. What we have predicted for a long time coming true. The hostel section of the and industry will become the light nursing homes of the future. These will probably, take in categories 4 and 5, as well as the dementia cases. In this Budget, again in a pre-emptive strike, this Government has a also taken away the hostel subsidy care factor where the people were financially advantaged. So what we really have here is an element of retrospectivity for those this direction. people in a hostel who have been getting that subsidy. Once again, that loss will go back on to the establishments. Although the Government has decided to allow private enterprise to participate in the hostel section-that is, the light nursing homes-those enterprises will have to fund the capital for the buildings themselves, try to get an income and then find themselves short of the hostel subsidy which had been the custom in the past. All these factors beg the question of the Government's consultative process. As have said before, the Budget asks more questions than it answers. We have here a Claytons invitation to the private sector to participate in light nursing homes withinteresting out giving it the wherewithal for such participation. We would also see as a step forward the geriatric assessment teams taking up the hostel entry. We believe that it should go further and integrate all the care rethe quired within the aged care community. Whether it is within the home, the munity, nursing homes or hostels, or whether it is dementia care, there should be one assessment authority. The sooner doing nothing about it. The 'Lies, Da the State and the Federal governments get Lies and Statistics' article asked this together and determine where the overtion: How successful has the Disa lapping and duplication is in these servServices Act been in supplying disa ices, the sooner we might get more of services? It came to the conclusion these funds transferred to those who rethere were 657,000 Australians with quire it-that is, the residents in need. The other factor the Government has not considered is who is going to pay for this in the future. It is interesting that tation of the program we are getti Brent Walker is looking at aged care insurance. He anticipates that insurance and Rolls-Royces, not too many people superannuation for the future should provide a capital sum for people to be able to pay off their homes or their residences vey by an independent body that the in the lump sum component and also ply enough extra income for them to enthose people under the present prog joy an enhanced living standard over above the pension itself. He also argues that those 10 per cent of aged Australians who will eventually be in a nursing or hostel or require community care ment is trying to terminate, is $2,00 should be able to have access to a supercapita. Therefore, under this scheme annuation stream of income to cater that too. Again, I cannot see where the workshops where they are engaged in Government has really applied itself in I will now talk about disability services. It is rather interesting to note that in the Estimates hearings of only last week the staff who were being questioned in connection with those estimates maintained that they had not seen a statement put in the Australian Council for the Rehabilitation of the Disabled newsletter of June and July which is entitled 'Lies, Damned Lies and Statistics'. It is very revealing to find that in terms of the ageing of Australia, the disabilities area will be mainly I affected in this ageing process because many of the disabled will be the older people and not the younger people coming on stream at the moment. It would be if the officers of the Department of Community Services and Health could read this article because it puts in proper perspective what is happening within the industry today. In spite of the fact that the Government has said within context of the Budget that it will put new programs on stream, these have been comdeferred for commencement until 199192. That gives the Government the ability to say what it is going to do but actu y d y y t bilities about a year ago and that y 40,000 of these actually received dis ity funded services. Within the imple a Rolls-Royce service-but, as with l l benefit. It has been estimated in a further t supof providing employment assistanc s and is $6,000 per capita whereas the co n the sheltered workshop area, which s been current in Australia for the las 0 home years and is a model which the Gov r e for people will be taken out of the shelt l activities at the moment. These workops, which are highly thought of by the mmunity, will be closed down. There ill not be any safety net for those people ho cannot get into the employment serves under the new programs. It is really interesting to note that we ve a government that has over a eriod-the seven years it has been in ffice-deliberately gone out of its way to reck the Australian economy, raise inrest rates, and cause further unemployent. The Budget itself is predicated on nemployment. Here we have the same overnment saying that in one or two as time it is going to give a Rolls Royce rvice to a few so that those who are sadvantaged will become increasingly nemployed and will have to compete with the people already ollt of work. How will they compete? This is the question that the Budget does not answer. In fact, the Government stands condemned by its handling of the economy and the implementation of the Disability Services Act. It is putting an increasing number of disabled people in Australia into an inferior position. A couple of years ago Australians could say with some pride that we had probably some of the best programs or were heading towards the better programs of any nation in the world. At the end of this month I hope to be able to go to a disability services conference in Beijing for the Asia-Pacific area and perhaps this will be borne out. We are putting those people with disabilities at the moment into impossible positions. We are training a few for employment services according to what the Government wants, which is a very high risk area when we contemplate that the Budget itself is predicated on an increase in unemployment. I am sure that within the next couple of months, as those - gures reveal themselves, those projechons on unemployment are going to be greater than they were before as a result of the economic factors of high interest rates and high unemployment which have been engendered by this Goverriment. The Goverr;tment has done nothing for the aged; it has done very little for those people with disabilities who are seeking a chance in a modern Australia. They are likely to find themselves desperately short of money through the programs that are being provided and which will not be able to be implemented in the way required.",71
88,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,73
89,Dr CATLEY,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL,"Perhaps nowhere in this Budget is the Government's determination to implement Labor's principles and election promises better demonstrated than in the Department of Community Services and Health appropriation. First, let us look at childcare. This year the Government has increased funding for the Department of Community Services and Health's services to families with children program from $226.5m to $286m. Child-care places will increase by 100,000 between 1985 and 1996. The Government provides funding for an additional 50,000 childcare places in this Budget, as announced in the 1990 election campaign-an increase in expenditure from $2.2m to $20.2m. The Government has also introduced fee relief for an eligible 35,000 families on low incomes to use private child-care centres and has extended commercial and employer-sponsored childcare. The Government's policy also provides for the needs of special groups in the community. For example, in ethnic communities, the Government has set up the multicultural child-care unit to provide access to, and equitable child-care services for, migrant families. In the electorate of Adelaide, I am working with Premier Bannon and the President of the Filipino-Australian Forum, Ms Terisita Jung, to secure funding for a multicultural child-care centre in the suburb of Kilburn. The need for such a centre arose because Filipino women have special problems adjusting to their new life in Australia. Short term child minding facilities in the working class northern suburbs suffered long waiting lists and few of the centres catered for ethnic women. This centre would cater for children from both English speaking and non-English speaking backgrounds on a short term and full day basis. However, assent is required from the Forum and all three tiers of government, and Ms Jung is presently moving around them like a revolving door. This is just one example where, as the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) mentioned, duplication of services and inefficiencies in the system could be vastly improved by cooperation between the tiers of government and the rationalisation of these services. I hope that there will be cooperation at the upcoming special Premiers Conference with a view to assisting in the delivery of services from the Department. The central business district (CBD) has rather different child-care needs. There is currently an undersupply of child-care facilities in the city of Adelaide, with ing lists of up to two years. The greatest demand is for full day care for parents who work in the CBD. We are currently negotiating sponsorship for a 40-place centre in the CBD. But again we have problems. Some State government regulations hamper the commercial viability of city child-care. Currently, child-care centres can only be built on ground floors, the most expensive rental location. If they could be built on other floors, more city centres would be established. In the suburbs we have different problems. Because of an earlier policy of submission-based funding, child-care centres have tended to be situated in the wealth"" ier areas. More recently, the Government has recognised a broader need for childcare in the suburban areas by going to a needs-based funding program, as reflected in this Budget. In my own suburb of Prospect, a proposal is currently being . negotiated with the local council and community groups. While it does have the problems I referred to previously in the Filipino Forum proposal, it has additional ones. It being an established area, we face problems of finding land on which to build centres. We are wary about alienating parkland but acknowledge that other land is difficult to acquire and expensive to purchase. In other words, the childcare program is .a massive step forward, but there are attendant administrative difficulties. Moving on to disability services, assist_ ance for people with disabilities has been increased from $362m to' $419m for this financial year. The Federal Government is funding programs to ensure that those with disabilities have access toaccom_ modation, employment, rehabilitation and participation in the wider community. The Government's disability reform package provides substantially more payment for respite care, accommodation support and attendant care, totalling $48m. I have spent the last three decades or so in universities and in political life, and as a result generally with people of considerable intelligence. I would like to repay some of that benefit by working in the area of intellectual disability for the wait- next few years. The policy of deinstitutionalisation for the intellectually disabled is the first serious program for enabling those people to lead ordinary communitybased lives in the history of post-settlement Australia. My seat contains the major institutional complex at Strathmont for the intellectually disabled in the northern metropolital). area of Adelaide. I am the patron of the Intellectually Disabled Accommodation Association-the Chairperson is Eric Bicknell-and from it and associated bodies at regular meetings I know the warm reception that they have given to this Budget, because, despite tight fiscal parameters, we have honoured our commitment to these frail citizens to get them into ordinary housing, ordinary jobs and ordinary lives and not sweep them under the carpet, as has happened for so long. Let us look at aged care. The aged care accommodation program continues to receive priority in this Budget. Home and community care (HACC) funding has increased from $279m to $322m. The movement towards national cost averaging is still proceeding and in some areas, including some South Australian aged nursing homes, is undoubtedly causing discomfort. I recognise that the national obligation to the Commonwealth Government leads it in that direction, nonetheless I will continue to represent any local institutions that are unduly inconvenienced by rapidity of movement. In three other respects the program is commendable in general and for my constituents in particular. Needs-based funding and bed licensing is witnessing the movement of hostel and nursing home beds from the better endowed southern part of my seat to the northern working class suburbs, thereby equalising access to facilities such as Southern Cross Homes in .prospect, the Manchester Unity Aged Members Centre in Broadview and the Terrace Nursing Homes in Holden Hills. The ethnic specific beds program has provided for Greek-speaking care in St Peters and further yet to be determined but probably Asian language hostel beds in the northern suburbs. The extension of HACC funding will permit more elderly Adelaidians, including my mum, to stay in their own homes. 'Because of this shift towards independent living, there will be less people in institutionalised care, requiring more funding for home care. As a result, $9.2m has been provided for respite care supplements for both nursing homes and hostels so that carers of the frail aged can have a break from their demanding role and so be able to continue to care for people at home in the long term. We - have backed up this move with an $18.5m increase for geriatric assessment teams to ensure that all frail aged people receive care most . suited to their needs. There has been some concern in my electorate about the Government's review of care aggregate module (CAM) funding f?r non-government nursing homes. I beheve these fears are unwarranted. The Government has agreed to fund CAM at a current average of 18.6 hours per resident week, which represents an increase ?f 1.5 hours per resident week since its mtroduction in 1988. In dollar terms this represents $75m. Funding for the ca-e of the. m-st dependent residents has been - aIntaIned, and on av.erage .the reduction or the. less dependent IS eqUIvalent to two mInutes per resident per day. Finally, I turn to health care. In the area of health advancement, the Government increased funding by 2.1 per cent in the 1990 Budget. The outstanding features of the G-)Vernment's health program have been unIversal coverage and equity. But there are some problems, and I trust that the recently announced Macklin review will redress them. I raise two in particular. First, in my electorate there are a number of private hospitals which - re !unded by non-profit charitable organIs-t1-ns. I have been approached by admInIstrators from the Calvary Hospital and the Memorial Medical, Centre who have pointed out that we have re-ched the situation in Adelaide where public patients may wait for months to be admitted to public hospitals while private hospitals have vacant beds. Secondly, I have been approached by a number of my constituents who have re-eived medical bills from special-' Ists-notably, a group of prominent Adelaide radiologists-that are up to $40 over the Medicare scheduled fee. I would not suggest that the Government should - u-sidise gap fees like this, particularly if It mvolves greedy specialists, but I ackno-ledge tpat there could be greater conSIstency m the fees charged and the rebates received for doctors' services. I am happy to say that the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe). has respo.nded to these requests and WIll re-examme the desired roles of public and private hospitals and the fees charged by doctors and specialists in the f-rthcoming national health strategy reVIew. - s a result, as I started out by saying I beheve the appropriation for the Depa;tment of Community Services and Health demonstrates in a very fundamental way the commitment of this Government to both its election promises and to the long term commitment of the Labor movement to those who are disadvantaged and in need of care from those who can afford it: in th- area of child-care, particularly for workmg mums and those with particular. problems; in the area of disability just serVIces, notably those with intellectual disabilities; in the continuation of an aged care program designed to liberate the aged members of our community to undertake that form of care they regard as most appropriate for their own lives; and, finally, in the maintenance and improvement of a Medicare system which may yet be the envy of the civilised world.",73
90,Mr MACKELLAR,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL,"1 was pleased that the honourable member for Adelaide (Dr Catley) had at least some modicum of criticism for the Government, otherwise one would have been forgiven for thinking that everything that had been done was without criticism whatsoever. I shall deal with some of the aspects of what the honourable member said at the end of my contribution here tonight. But, firstly, I should like to look fee of $2.50 from one pocket and rec at the Department of Veterans' Affairs because, like so many of the Government's actions, at first glance people, particularly veterans, might think that they have been pretty well treated by the 1990 Budget, with total estimated outlays rising from $4,872m in 1989-90 to $5,150m in the present year. However, that represents about a 5.7 per cent increase in dollar terms. If this is adjusted for a realistic estimate of the rate of inflation in this financial year, means that expenditure on veterans could fall in real terms by 2 per cent or more. So although on the face of it, it looks to be fairly attractive, when one looks behind the figures a little more closely one discovers that in fact the reality is very different. If account is taken of what I estimate to be a 1.5 per cent decline in the number of service pensioners over that same period, it also seems very likely that will be a small decline in real dollar lays per pensioner. If we look at specific benefit outlays, the Budget Papers show that such outlays to veterans and their dependants will rise by 6.6 per cent to $3,876m in 1990-91. However, as this increase is also very likely to be less than the prevailing inflation rate, there is not only no real gain in benefit payouts but, to the extent the Gulf crisis creates tionary pressures for Australia-and that seems very likely indeed-a substantial decline in real terms becomes not just a strong chance but almost a reality. A careful analysis of the Budget s ments shows an even more disturbing of figures. The Government, for insta states that the payment of the $2.50 week pension allowance to compen pensioners affected by the introductio the pharmaceutical benefits scheme scription fee will cost the Govern $39.2m in the full year, 1991-92. But, of course, that is not the real to the Government at all, as it will receiving additional revenue from $2.50 prescription fee. It is quite si a sleight of hand. Pensioners who req one prescription per week will payout i a $2.50 supplementary pension pay into another pocket. But what will have a very real im on veterans and their dependants is number of so-called savings, whic should like to detail. Consider the foll ing savings ·identified in the Budget: fir $0.7m from a requirement to have assistance recipients verify the pay of their rent; $2.9m by lifting the assistance threshold from $20 to $25 it week; and $2.5m by increased invest tion of undisclosed assets. Then we get up a bit in the savi $16.1m from the deemed rate of inte on pensioner assets and low interest counts. We go even further: $27m by ning crosschecks between the Departm of Veterans' Affairs computer and o agencies such as the Department of So Security and the Australian Taxation fice. Then we go down to $0.7m f i there reviewed arrangements for stoma out- plies; $1.7m from a newly introduced tient contribution for care in ANZAC hos and psychiatric institutions; and $1 from revised arrangements for the ar cial limb scheme. That adds up to savings of $53.3m, does not include a further $11. 3m of ings to be made in revised administra and running cost arrangements within inflaDepartment and the repatriation ho tals. I have absolutely no quarrel w those savings are to improve adminis tive effectiveness or to introduce syst to .help identify inaccurate or fraudu I APpropriation Bill (No.1) disclosure of assets, et cetera. But thof that $53.3m represents real cuts m t-e dollar assistance to veterans and theIr dependants. Let us go through them again: rent sistance, stoma s-pplies, artifi-i.al scheme deemed mcome prOVISIOns, et cetera. 'Just keeping that in mind, rather than the laudatory statement by the. vious honourable member, the Governfrom ment's seven-year track particularly with respect to Australia's veterans is parsimonious, to say the least. What have we seen? The application of an assets test which saw thousands veterans lose or reduce their pensions. Limits placed on the veterans' rental scheme. The totally and permanently capacitated (TPI) pension criteria tightened. War widows and their dependants, and service pensions, with fringe benefits, no longer able to access the repatriation pharmaceutical benefits scheme, and the 2 per cent discounting of the Defence Force retirement and death benefit penhave sion. Given that track record, Australia's erans must feel they are back at war-a war of attrition fought against them by the Government-with their service and benefit conditions slowly being chipped away. There is absolutely no doubt in mind that this Government is suffering from a generation gap, with a Cabinet of men and women who have little memory and even less understanding of the real meaning of the commitment made by erans to their country-to a commitments given and made by Labor Party governments of the day. I have no doubt in my mind that a partment great number of Australia's veterans feel Health andoftheCommunity very strongly that they have been abanAffairs, doned or at least significantly downgraded by the Government, and not just in this most recent Budget. This is just a further Warringah example of the way their benefits have been chipped away from them. I return now to the contribution made by the previous speaker, the honourable mem-er for Adelaide, and talk about h-ndIcapped people within the community. I strongly support the provision 9 October 1990 REPRESENTATIVES 2471 bulk services which will allow handicapped people to derive the greatest benefit possible from their lives-to encourage them to maximise their potential. But this has to be administered with a great deal of assensitivity, and more sensitivity than is limb presently the case. . It is a fact that handicapped people can prem many cases derive a great deal more their lives than was the case in the record, past. However, there are those who find being put out into' the community very very difficult indeed. The honourable member for Adelaide spoke of putting them into of normal houses, normal jobs and normal s-tuations. In many, many cases people sImply cannot handle those types of instressful situations. Whilst I applaud the thrust of a commitment which would help maximise the individual's potential, I really do believe the administration of these actions must be carried out far more sensitively than the many examples that I could mention demonstrated they are in fact being carried out. All of us within the commuvetnity seek to maximise the potential of every member of our community. But that must take into account that there are some who through no fault of their own simply cannot deal with or handle the very real my complexities of living in a modern society. We must maximise the potential but, as I say again, those decisions which would require handicapped people in some cases to live in a situation which is beyond vettheir capacity to deal with should be great extent closely re-examined.",76
91,Mr ANDREW,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL,"I am pleased, in this committee stage of the debate on the appropriations for the DeServices and to follow many of theofcomments Department Veterans' made by the honourable member for (Mr MACKellar) in the area of veterans' affairs. The honourable member for Warringah has indicated that a great deal of concern is being felt in the veterans' community because, as he said service benefits and conditions which veterans had rightly become accustomed to are now - eing chipped away. I have to say that it of IS not only the benefits and conditions that are being chipped away; some of the units and brigades to which veterans once belonged are also being chipped away or are about to disappear. I wish to express my concern that the brigades to which these veterans once belonged are now likely to disappear and that, in fact, veterans are finding that brigades and units-many of them principally in Reserve areas-to which they may once have belonged are about to lose some of their proud traditions, as well as their identity. The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) yesterday indicated that as a result of a decision that had been taken, a number of reservist units were likely to be closed, among them: Division Headquarters, Melbourne; 10 Medium Regiment, Geelong and Colac; A Squadron 8/13 Victorian Mounted Rifles, Albury-Wodonga; and the 3 Division Intelligence Company, Melbourne. Anyone of these is a Reserve unit to which people who were formerly in the Regular Army and are now veterans may have once belonged. They are about to lose their proud tradition and much of their identity. The Minister has indicated that the son that he is prepared to defend the closure of these particular Reserve units is simply because it is seen as an opportunity to have a more efficient Defence Force and to effect particular savings. I have to say that, along with anyone of the veterans covered by the appropriation being debated tonight, I too am keen to see a more efficient Defence Force. Neither the veterans nor I would wish, in any sense, to be warmongers. In fact, I recognise that, in many w-ys, it is only a vigilant Defence Force that will keep Australia secure and, as the Returned Services League says, the price of liberty is eternal vigilance. I must draw to the Minister's attention the fact that the Wrigley report recommends that the reserves ought to be expanded by up to 52,000 people in the next five years and that an effective Defence Force, which may one day produce the veterans of the future, will survive only where we have a widespread community identity and community enthusiasm for the defence forces. The changes that the Minister has announced that directly affect the reserves are changes that run counter to the proposals in the Wrigley report and are changes that run counter to what the Parliament may well anticipate will come out of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade inquiry that is expected to be handed down and is likely to be known as the Lindsay report. This report has focused, principally, on the role of the reserves. Mr Wrigley has recommended an expanded role for the reserves and, just as we expect the reserves to get particular support from what will be the report of the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee inquiry, we could well ask ourselves why it is that this week, prior to the Lindsay report being made available and in the face of what is written in the Wrigley report, the Minister has made these recommendations. I am concerned because I believe that the Minister has pre-empted what might reasonably be the advice of the Lindsay report and what we know to be the advice of the Wrigley report. I am concerned rea- because I am from South Australia and the closure of the 3 Division Headquarters in Melbourne directly affects the administration of Reserve units in South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania. I think that the Minister ought to reconsider the impact of what he is proposing on those who may well be the veterans of the future.",77
92,Mr HICKS,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL," Mr Deputy Chairman, you may recall that recently the Government was doing something in the area of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. I know that there was a large campaign mounted in the bush, particularly, because this was going to affect the smaller pharmacists. I know in my electorate if the scheme had gone through, it could have meant that at least four or five pharmacies-the only pharmacies in certain towns-may have had to close their doors. There is another scheme being proposed by the Federal Government which was announced in the recent Budget. With regard to pharmacists applying to the Government for payments under the Health Insurance Commission (HIC) scheme, I would like to touch on one problem .that - he ph'!-rhave macists in my area are faCIn--I- partIcgoing ular those single pharmacIes In small tow-s which do n-t have a lar&e turn-ver of scripts and WhIC- are dealIng maInly with people on low Incomes. In order to dispense prescriptions pharmacists will have to have a computer system. I know that in many areas, particularly in pharmacies which are dealor ing with a lot of people, computers 'have already been installed because pharmaing cists find them a useful tool and somewith thing which they cannot do without this modern era. But an estimated 30 cent of pharmacists do not have a combers puter and the installation of one of these computers would cost a minimum of about $5,000. Those who do have comclosely puters may have to update their computer system because they may not be compatCIsts ible with the Health Insurance CommisThey sion system. This will also cost a great deal of money. What will happen is that the patient will provide the script and the pharmacist will then fill the script. He will then a message via a modem through the telein phone line at the end of the month to Health Insurance Commission requesting payment. But he will also have to send floppy disk containing a backup of the information and will probably also have to send the scripts. So the system is complex enough as it is. When the cost of the prescription is excess of $1 I-and we know that in the case of pensioners, according to the recent statements by the Government it will going up to $2.50 and so they will have to pay that also-the pharmacist then seeks payment from the HIC. Unless pharmacy is dispensing about 2,000 per month it is not viable to install comp';lter. The maintenance, insurance, - p-ahng of software because of price laho-s, et cetera cost too much. So one can - mag-ne that, once again, these pharputer; - aclsts In country areas, particularly sl?gle pharmacies with a small turnover, wI.ll. have to pay an estimated $5,000 mlOlmum to have a computer installed. I do not know why these people should to install a computer, but if they are to fit into the new system this is the way it will be. I think this is another area that we should be looking at because most of those small pharmacies will find that it is just not viable to install these computers. From 1 February 1991, HIC will not accept scripts sent manually for payment pricing through the mail. So the ongoing cost per year is still there-in updatthe floppy disks and anything to do the computer. I do not wish to speak in for too long on this matter because the per night is drawing on and many other memwould like to speak on other matters, but I just bring this to the attention of the Government and ask it to look very at this matter because in smaller t?wns in my electorate there are pharmawho do not have computer systems. are caught up in the Government's new system. I hope that the Government will look at the fact that $5,000 will be the minimum cost of installing a computer, an,d in some way will either compensate these pharmacists or help - them send through this difficult period. Pharmacists all areas, but particularly 'in country the areas' wl).ere the populations are small, have been suffering as a result of the Gova ernment's decisions over the last several years, and this decision seems to be another ongoing cost burden for pharmacies. We know that small businesses throughout rural Australia and no doubt throughin out the cities of Australia are suffering because of high inflation, high interest rates and government decisions in other be areas. This is one area that I would ask the Government to look at because pharmacies are very important; particularly in the small communities. The survival of a scripts pharmacy sometimes depends on ,the a whole viability of the health system in an area--:-whether the local doctor stays and varwhether the hospitals are going concerns. So we are not just talking about a comwe are talking about the viability of the health system in many of these smaller towns in rural Australia.",78
93,Mr NEHL,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL,"1 appreciate the opportunity of speaking in this particular debate because I am one of those people who happen to believe that the important thing about Parliament and the important thing about politics is that the 'p' in both politics and Parliament stands for people. I would like to take the opportunity in this debate tonight to refer to the problems being experienced by several people in my electorate and voice their concerns on their behalf. In particular I would like to talk about changes in the free limb scheme that came into force on 3 September 1990. There are probably a large number of people around Australia who are being quite severely disadvantaged by this. My particular constituent to whom I wish to refer is a congenital lower right leg amputee who has been employed as an area technician by Telecom Australia for 22 years. In spite of the fact that he suffers from this disability, he is making a valuable contribution to our society, as can be seen from the fact that he has been employed for such a long time. That says a great deal for him. He tells me that due to the level of his work and his normal social life an artificial limb lasts him from 15 to 18 months. He made the point that in the last financial year he paid over $8,000 in taxation, but due to the changes in the new free limb scheme that came into force on 3 September he has had to pay $172.84-15 per cent of the cost of the new limb-in order to make his living. What makes it even worse is that he is unable to claim the cost of that particular prosthesis on his taxation. This gentleman is currently 42 years of age; During the period from 1952 to 1958 he received his limbs through the Rehabilitation Commission in Sydney for no charge, due .to the fact that his father was a returned serviceman. He is in the situation where because of his disability if he chose to-and he does not want to-he could probably receive some form of invalid pension. That would take him out of the work force, stop him paying tax and make him a drain on society. I would like to make the point very strongly on his behalf that there should be a reconsideration of the free limb scheme because that will affect quite a number of other people also. As well I am asked by the Quota Club of Kempsey to make some representations on behalf of the Aids and Appliances to People with Disabilities group about the recent report of the Industry Commission. The members of the Quota Club of Kempsey are particularly concerned that the proposals in that report will not be of any advantage to the community, particularly to those in country areas. They would like to see some reassurance that the services offered in the future will be superior to and not inferior to those in the past. They have had numerous instances of complaints of unscrupulous private hearing aid specialists and would like to see some guarantee that these operators will have to use audiologists of a quality that the National Acoustic Laboratories (NAL) now use. They also make the point that hearing impaired children require specialist treatment and would like to know whether this will be given outside NAL, as the report actually suggests. The members of the group very properly say that this is not a high profit area and it will be very difficult to see this being given a high priority in our smaller country communities. They and I would hate to see a downgrading of the already over-stretched resources available to assist these people. I ask that the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) monitors the situation carefully so that we can see that disadvantaged people are being looked after. As for the situation in the Department of Veterans' Affairs, I would like to make some reference to the burning and desecration of the Australian national flag. I am asked to do this on behalf of the members of the North Coast District Council of the Returned Services League of Australia (RSL). They tell me that they have recently received four letters of disgust complaining about the burning of our national flag by some groups. They have received letters from RSL sub-branches at Sawtell, Nambucca Heads, Grafton and Chatsworth-Iluka. Th re are 19 RSL sub-branches com.. e a membership of 3,431 returned PrISmg 'ce men and women. Th ey are a 11 ex-se·rVI ularly concerne d t h at m part ICtry of ours It . 'IS no t an 0 ffience t 0 ---- or desecrate the symb?l of our democratic nation, the f\ustr-han flag. They have raised this partIcular Issue on a- least two other occasions, but so far wIthout success. I would like to take this opportunity <:m behalf of not only the North Coast !?IStrict Council of the Returned SerVIces League of Australia but I am sure all ex-service men and women throughout Australia to make the point that t-ere should be some form of penalty l?rovIded for the burning or other desecratl.on of the Au-­ tralian national flag. A pnvate member s motion has been put forward by the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Co-b) on this very issue. I hope that the Parl!ament will give this matter further consIderation and ultimately bring it into law so that there are proper penalties for people who do this to the Australian national flag. I am also concerned about the question of travelling allowances for veterans receiving medical attention or attending reviews for veterans benefits. I note from a constituent of mine in Port Macquarie that he is particularly perturbed that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) has advised him that the allowance for overnight accommodation in Sydney is $51 per night. The Minister says that the allowance is intended to be a reasonable contribution towards the cost of overnight accommodation for veterans travelling to receive treatment at departmental hospitals and for appointments in connection with hearings by determining authorities. He says that it is not intended to cover the cost of the most expensive accommodation available. I give full credit to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs as being a caring, considerate and compassionate man. I am sure that had he written this letter himself there is no way that he - ould have made the point that $51 is not mtended to cover the cost of the most expensive accommodation available in Sydney. I suppose it is possible, but I defy most people to go and find anywhere to stay in Sydney for $51 a night.",79
94,Mr LLOYD,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL,I think the CWA is proba. t h'IS grea t bly the only place.,81
95,Mr NEHL,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL,"As the honourable member says, the CWA would be about the only place. The Minister went on to say that although his Department does not insist on veterans staying close to the hospitals of the Veterans Review Board, the cost of accommodation in the near vicinity is taken into account when the allowances are set. I think that is of considerable importance, and I ask the Minister to review the amount of money available for the assistance of veterans when they have to travel to Sydney and other capital cities. The $51 limit really is quite absurd in this day and age. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs in his letter quoted one particular hotel at Kirribilli as being available for considerably less than $51. That has been checked and the cost for a single room is within that $51 limit. However, the room is not en suite, which means that the veteran would have to go down the hallway and queue, perhaps, for the use of the bathroom and toilet; there is no parking facility within the hotel grounds and there is no restaurant; there is a pay telephone in the building but it would be difficult to get taxis to go to the hotel. In conclusion, I ask the Minister please to reconsider this. I ask him to exercise some of that compassion for which he is noted and make sure that our veterans, who are indeed deserving people, are able to be looked after when they have to go for treatment.",81

97,Mr RUDDOCK,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL," Mr Deputy Chairman, in relation to the estimates for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade I would like to make some observations. There is a wealth of material that one can discuss in this area, and because of the amount of time that is available to us comments that can be made are, of necessity, relatively brief. want to emphasise the extent to which, the foreign affairs area, there is not vacuum. It is an ar.ea in which the position in particular has been extraordiThere narily active in considering the ways in which we can more effectively advance Australia's position within our own region by adopting policies which are more realbeen istic in pursuing Australia's national inistic terests. We have seen over a period that the Government has been found wanting, that it is tired, and that there is an willingness to address areas tralia can play a more important and a more constructive role. It·was quite interesting today to hear the debate occasioned by the recent visit of the Prime Minister (MrHawke) to a number of overseas destinations, the comhitched ments made by him in relation to those issues, and the comments he has made in relation to the way in which the Opposiassociation tion has approached these matters. I want again to draw to the attention of honour the able members the extent to which we in the Opposition have been giving a very clear lead to the Government as to the way in which it can advance policy in this area. It is interesting that the Leader the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has said that he has no objection to the Government pinching-I think that is an appropriate word-our policies. As quickly as the also Government wants to pick up the initiaing tives we have taken, we will continue advance other constructive proposals which might further advance our nation's interest. The first area we have identified and which the shadow Minister for foreign affairs, Senator Hill, made a ment on 20 August was the extent to which Australia might take a more realisthe tic approach in relation to Taiwan. It an area of foreign policy that has over time been clearly neglected. We have lowed our attitudes to be formed, I think, very often by the way .in which we perin ceive others to be looking at us. That not the way in which most other countries examine their foreign policy and determine it. What we have indicated is that we have very significant trading relations I with Taiwan. Those can be furthered in a in number of positive ways which do not a occasion recognition of Taiwan or, of neOpcessity, adopting a two-China policy. is a basis upon which there can be far more constructive dialogue than there has been to date. Those who have taken an interest in this subject, those who have arguing in this area for a more realview, are able to point to the extent to which Taiwan and the People's Republic of China themselves are able, through una series of mediums, to have quite conin which Ausstructive dialogue. The second matter that was mentioned today by the Leader of the Opposition in was that of Fiji. The Government has abandoned the policy it had adopted on that matter for some time and has in fact itself to the approach that we in the Opposition have been advocating. The third matter was in relation to the we have with the People's Republic of China. The Government, after events in Tiananmen Square, tragic as they were, limited its range of contacts and was of a view that it could not influence China's approach on human rights issues. I think it was demonstrated by the of recent visit by the Leader of the Opposition, the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer), our shadow foreign affairs Minister, Senator Hill, and Senator Teague that by a skilful raisof the human rights questions we were to able to bring to the knowledge of the Government of the People's Republic of China the extent to which its approach on human rights issues had brought very on considerable world concern and why it ought to address those questions in a major statemuch more positive way. In relation to ministerial contact with Palestine Liberation Organisation is (PLO), we have seen also that the Government has had to modify its position. alWe have had the very constructive approach taken by my colleague Senator Hill advancing a detailed and comprehenis sive role for the Commonwealth in bringing peace to Sri Lanka, a country with which many people wh- - ave settled in Australia have an aSSOCIatIOn. They --ve a real interest to see us play. a PO-lt-ve ro Ie , to the. extent that we can, m asslstmg in that regIOn. The Opposition. has also taken a pos.itive role in re-atIOn to the yery tragIc events in the Mld-le East. WhIle .',-e have been very supportIve of the posItIon the Government ultimately reached, it should not pass without comment that the commitment Australia has made was advocated by the Oppo-iti.on in advan-e of - he Government, and It IS a matter 1- whICh it was again found to be following the position we had advocated. The issue I want to raise today, because I have traditionally taken a real and personal interest in the area of foreign aid, is the extent to which this issue of support for a foreign aid budget was one that became a cause celebre during the recent election. Although my friend Senator Yallen tine and I do not always agree on many issues, it was particularly of interest to me that in the debates in Senate Estimates Committee B she had some comments to make to Senator Gareth Evans directly concerning the Government's promises during the last election. She simply observed that what actually happened was that there was a $100m cut in the aid budget spread over the country and global programs. She made the point that Australia had seen a reduction from 0.39 per cent to 0.36 per cent, that there was a short rise to 0.37 per cent and now a reduction to 0.33 per cent for the recent Budget. That is a matter of very considerable concern. Whilst the Government attempted to point to cuts that had been proposed by the Opposition and to use those as an advance of its position, it is I think singularly important to note that in this area we. outlined positively, and took it on the chm, that we proposed to bring about a restruc-uring of the foreign aid arrangements If we were elected. That point was very positively made by Senator Hill in a number of ways. We saw that Australia's money could be better directed than it had been. Notwithstanding that, the Government took the high ground during the election and said, 'It is disastrous for the Opposition to advocate reductions in this area. We will not do that'. Then immediately the election was over there were effective reductions by the Government. I regard that as a very significant breach of good faith on the part of the Government. Obviously many organisations are distressed about it. In the recent Budget there have been cuts to funds for non-government organisations which have a good track record in delivering aid to the most needy. The Goven,lment has again cut food aid in r-al terms while continuing to spend money on other less worthy aspects in the aid area. The Government's efforts in this area have been the subject of considerable criticism because our aid dollar is still not being targeted to meet the needs of the world's poorest. In the context of the Budget Estimates there is a record about which the Government ought to be very concerned. There has been a distinct lack of good faith in the way in which the Government has attacked the aid area.",81
98,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,83
99,Mr MARTIN,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL,"At the outset in this debate tonight on the Budget estimates for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade I would like to make one or two comments about the role that has been played by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans, in recent times, particularly in respect of the initiatives in Kampuchea. Most honourable members would agree that the Minister has played a leading role in developing peace initiatives. As a result, Australia's standing in foreign affairs has been enhanced within our region and the world. At speeches given at the United Nations, backed up by constructive effort and visits to South East Asia, Senator Evans has been able to convince the world's leaders, including those most particularly concerned with this problem, of the need for a realistic and lasting peace plan. It is in no small measure, in my view, a reflection of the Minister's commitment to issues associated with foreign affairs but also with human rights that, in seeing that many of the atrocities and the wrongs created by a series and succession of governments in this part of the world are not forgotten but put behind, he has ensured that a meaningful and workable form of government can be put in place such that the area can continue to develop. I would like to comment briefly on another issue that has arisen in South East Asia. I refer to the role that we as a Government have played in assisting the Government of Thailand in some initiatives which are of great concern to people in this country. I am referring, of course, to the question of drug detection and drug interception. It is perhaps not generally known but over a period of time now this Government, through the Attorney-General's Department, has placed resources in the form of manpower-expert people-and computer assistance with the office of the Narcotics Board of Control in Thailand. This has had an enormous impact by providing statistics at that level within the Government and leading the fight in the crackdown on the export of heroin out of Thailand, particularly from the northern parts. As part of a broad foreign affairs area, it is certainly worthy of continued support. I know from a recent visit that there is a need for continuing assistance in that area. As part of this Parliament's inquiry into the Australian Customs Service I had the opportunity to talk with people in Bangkok about this specific area. I believe that it is incumbent upon the Government, through its Foreign Affairs or Attorney-General's budget, to make appropriate allocations for the continuance of that level of support. I hope that that does in fact happen. I would also briefly like to touch on or two issues that were raised by the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), who spoke before me in this debate. I refer particularly to the issue Taiwan and the foreign aid budget. Most people who study the relationship that exists between Australia and Taiwan would endorse the comments of the honourable member for Dundas that a more realistic approach has to be taken. Taiwan is one of our leading trading part-. ners and I am pleased to see that the Government is presently examining this issue. It has a number of ramifications. Not only does it raise the profile of Australia in Taiwan and provide us with an opportunity to export far more to that country but, equally, it provides an opportunity for capital that is necessary in this country to be provided by a very wealthy society. Given what seems to be emerging as bipartisan support for this approach to Taiwan, we will see a more realistic effort in relation to our trade and foreign affairs relations. That is not to say that it will be an easy path or that what may be developed will be at the expense of what is regarded generally as our traditional recognition of the Chinese Government-that is, of China itself-but I do believe that there are ways in which our Government can get around some problems that have been identified in the past and take a very realistic approach. As far as the Joreign aid budget is concerned, most honourable members would express the same concerns as did the honourable member for Dundas. We, living in a relatively affluent country, would like to help out those less fortunate in many of the so-called Third World nations. However, with economic reality as it is, any government faced with circumstances such as those we have at the moment must look carefully at most budgets. Having put that on the record, I think it is incumbent upon the Government, as circumstances permit, to review that decision and, in line at least with our Party's policy, return the foreign aid budget to the meaningful levels it once enjoyed and to increase those levels. Another issue, which was raised by the one Minister for Primary Industries and Energy(Mr Kerin) in Question Time today, concerns some of the trade initiatives, some of the problems in the rural and of mining sectors and the difficulty associated with the present value of the Australian dollar. It is interesting, however, to note that perhaps this problem is being tackled from the wrong perspective. Perhaps, rather than saying that the Australian dollar vis-a-vis the United States dollar is extremely strong, .we sh<?uld be saying that the US dollar IS parhcul-rly weak. On the cross rates the AustralIan dollar is not as strong as some people might first assume. That has ramifications for a number of primary produce areas and. also for the mineral sector-a sect<;>r WhICh both you and I, Mr Deputy Chalfma-, are parhcularly concerned about. Commg from coal electorates, as we do, we are aware that, whilst there has been an enormous resurgence in the Australian coal industry and whilst we are virtually selling everything that is pulled out of the ground at the present moment, there - s - evertheless .s-ill an impediment to contmumg profitabIlIty in the coal industry which in turn would reflect upon the ability of coal companies to employ more miners or whatever. That is of course, the level of the Australian d-llar because most contracts are still written in United States dollars. Given that one of ow major buyers is still Japan and it will remain so in the future, given that we have enormous opportunities in Europe for expanding our coal trade, perhaps it might be opportune for Australia's coal companies in negotiating further contracts here to look at negotiating them in the currency of the countries with which they are doing the deals, rather than sticking with United States dollars. In this regard, one suspects that profitability levels will be improved and the outlook generally for the coal mining industry improved as well. Finally, I would like to say something about one of the issues which is greatly disturbing to me and I am sure it is to many, if not all, members of this House and that is recent events in Israel. If ing else, the crisis in the Middle East at the present moment clearly indicates that there is a need to look at this entire region in terms of initiatives to bring about a lasting and sustained peace. Some of t-e - emonstrations, the violence, occurrlOg lo Jerusalem and in other parts of Israel at present show a disturbing trend. I onl,y - uggest to members of this place that It IS one which we need to carefully pursue with balanced judgment. We must not let the crisis which involves the Iraq area and Kuwait and other countries in the immediate area-",83

101,Mr DOWNER,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL,"For one rare moment I actually wanted to hear the last sentence that the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin) was going to utter from the other side of the House. I am sorry to have missed what he was intending to say. As a matter of fact, the point that he was making about the Middle East is a very important one, but I am a little concerned, really, with the implication of his remarks that there should be some sort of linkage between the resolution of the Persian Gulf crisis and the resolution of difficulties over the Israeli-Palestinian issue, I certainly strongly reject the concept of linkage, as do most countries around the world. We just need to make sure that point is strongly registered by this Parliament. I am glad to - ee that the honourable member agrees with that. Perhaps in the fleeting seconds he had, he had to put it as simply and broadly as he could. But it is important that we reject the concept of linkage. I was glad to hear the honourable member talk about relations with Taiwan because, without any doubt, the coalition has strongly led the way on this issue and it is good to see that the Government is beginning to pick up some of the initiatives that the coalition has been leading with over quite some years now. The honourable member for Macarthur also referred to the issue of the coal innothdustry and coal export contracts. I would add a point to what he said and that is that one of the things we have to look at to do with coal and a range of other resource exports is to negotiate c.i.f. contracts rather than f.o.b. contracts so that we can start to benefit from the enormous opportunities there are to take advantage of the freight services involved with these export contracts. At the moment we take I a tiny percentage of the freight service business in exports from Australia, largely because resources contracts are invariably negotiated on f.o.b. rather than c.i.f. terms. In a more general sense, one of the two issues that I wanted to raise tonight relates to the issue of export promotion. In this particular Budget, in these Estimates, the Government has made allowance for some $280m to be expended on, if you like, assistance to exporters, $150m under the export market development grants scheme, $105m expended on Austrade and some $13m on the export finance facility. We on this side of the chamber do not have any objection to that. We have an alternative to the existing export market development grants scheme and we are having a look at the way in which Austrade operations work to see if they can work more efficiently and more effectively. I note that Austrade itself has MCKinseys currently doing a review of the whole of the Austrade operations, so I suspect that the Government itself is conceding that Austrade does not work as well as it could and that is something on which we on this side of the chamber are really leading the way. Bearing in mind those particular points and the areas where the Government does provide assistance to exporters, it is interesting to reflect when going around the community on the enormous demand there is from exporters and potential exporters for massive export incentives to be introduced. They want subsidies, they want tax breaks, they want a range of special concessions and deals. It is important for those people to remember that many of those sorts of propositions are, in fact, self-defeating propositions. They are self-defeating for two reasons. First, those kinds of subsidies and tax breaks for exporters are contrary to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade rules. Some people say that does not matter too much, that GATT is not all that important. GATT actually has through its life brought the average rate of tariff protection amongst industrialised countries down from over 40 per cent to around 5 per cent today. If honourable members think that is not important, they do not have much of a perspective of the trading environment within which a small country like Australia has to operate. We do have to reinforce our commitment to the GATT. It has achieved an enormous amount over the years and there is no point in our taking a view that it is irrelevant, because it is not. Let me remind the House that if we were to take the view that GATT was irrelevant and we were to accede to the demands of people for a range of subsidies and tax breaks and so on for exporters, other countries would retaliate and we would find that those tax breaks and those subsidies and the like would buy us nothing except exclusion from other markets around the world. That point just has to be understood better by the exporting community in Australia. There is also the very strong economic argument that these sorts of subsidies are, of course, very costly and therefore in order to provide them we have to redistribute resources away from productive sectors of the economy. If honourable members think redistribution is a good thing for Australia. I remind them that we have seen what has happened over the past few years with constant endeavours to redistribute away from productive, export-oriented, successful exporters to all sorts of quirky schemes that politicians seem to think are going to be so beneficial at great cost to the successful and productive sectors of the economy. Let me make one other point. Under the present policies of the Government, exporters are, in fact, severely penalised by the operation of our indirect taxation system. Indeed, the level of penalty far exceeds the benefits that the Government provides to exporters through the export market development grants scheme, Austrade and the like. Let us look at the impact of the wholesale sales tax on exporters. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) pointed out recently: . . . the existing wholesale sales tax only imperfectly removes taxation on inputs used in the manufacture of goods so that an element of indirect taxation remains on exported goods. It is estimated that element of indirect taxation on exported goods on average adds around 2 per cent to .t-e price of Australian exports, or $1 bllhon. If we to remove the' wholesale sales tax :ff:-t on exports that w-uld have the .effect of reducing the pnce of Austrahan orts by around that 2 per cent. Clearly, --!'t would do something to contribute to the competitiveness of our economy. The coalition's proposal for a goods and services tax would do precisely that and it is one of the many reasons why .the introduction of that goods and serVIces tax would be beneficial in terms of the resolution of our balance of p-yments problems, but I once. more remmd the Committee that there IS a grel;lt .deal more to be gained from that - 1 bdhon reduction in average export pnces than benefits accrued from the $280I? the qover!lment provides for export aSSIstance m thIS par-' ticular Budget. I want to raise one other point in the context of trade and that relates to the impact of the Persian Gulf crisis. Today the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) issued a copy of a communique to the media in which he reported on the Australia-United States ministerhll talks which have been held in Washington. Towards the end of that communique there is a reference to the discussions on trade which took place. It is a matter of regret to me, though, that in that communique the Government-in cooperation, of course, with the United States, because it is a joint communique-did not include a reference to the inequity of the United States Administration continuing to provide subsidies for wheat exports from the United States in the guise of the export enhancement program at a time when we,' of all wheat exporting countries in the world, have had to pay the highest price for the correct imposition of the sanctions against Iraq. Australia's wheat industry had about 50 per cent of the Iraqi wheat market. Quite riahtly, it has lost that market. The trade embargo has been imposed on Iraq and by the standard of trade embargoes, that t-ade embargo has been successful. I believe !hat many members of this Committee WIll agree that it is a bit much for the Americans, and to some extent the European Community, to say to us, 'Well, thanks very much for supporting the embargo, and guess what we are going to do? We are going to subsidise through taxpayers' money in our own countries wheat sales to other parts of the world'. The Americans say their recent impositions of the export enhancement subsidy have not taken away markets in which Australia had been operating. But the truth is that subsidy is depressing the world· price of wheat and therefore it is imposing an additional cost on Australian wheat growers and the Australian wheat industry. It is a matter of regret to me and to those on this side of the chamber that the Government apparently did not make that point in the Australia-United States ministerial talks and, more than that, did not ensure that the point was spelt out clearly in the communique issued yesterday, American time, and today, Australian time. It was a failure by the Government to make an important point on behalf of a major Australian export industry, which is encountering significant difficulties. At least members on this side of the chamber have taken the opportunity to make that point. We support the embargo, but remember that the wheat industry here has suffered significantly as a result of it. It is a bit much for the Americans and Europeans at that time to be persisting· with their export subsidies.",85
102,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,87
103,Mr LINDSAY,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL,"The successful management of foreign relations has become one of the three most important tasks of the Australian Government. This is partly because of the increasing complexity and unpredictability of the actions of nations in South East Asia and the south-west Pacific. These uncertainties and instabilities present the greatest challenges to our regional security since the end of World War II. Indubitably Australia's destiny lies as a full member of the Pacific Rim of nations. Let it be said that Australia will be an active participant in shaping the collective ,political will of the Pacific Rim countries. Within this context we shall fight hard for what we believe in. We believe in a region based on economic freedom, involving the willing participation of independent and free nations; we believe in a region which is open to world trade and which reaches out to raise the standard of life for its people; and, of the utmost importance to Australia, we believe in a region which always seeks the closest possible partnership with the United States of America. I have said before in this House that Australia's relationship with the United States is based on shared moral values that have been shaped by our democratic institutions and cultural heritage. As the British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, observed recently: America's boldness and energy and vision . . . has led the free world for over four decades . . . American values and the American dream continue to inspire not just the people of the United States, but also millions upon millions across the face of the globe. Those high sentiments were present when Australia and New Zealand signed the ANZUS Treaty with the United States of America. That treaty was in response to the perceived common danger to the liyes of free people. For more than three decades, through Cold War crises and national anguish, the ANZUS Treaty had endured until it was repudiated by New Zealand, with whom Australia and the United States had fought on the same side in four wars this century, in pursuit of shared democratic values and common security. The ANZUS Treaty has been primarily responsible for assuring peace and stability in the south-west Pacific. This security has benefited New Zealand. Access to allied ports by United States vessels has made deterrence credible by giving an important flexibility and effectiveness to United States naval forces in the Pacific. The ANZUS Treaty is part of the Western alliance system which, through its policy of nuclear deterrence and other security measures, has prevented the outbreak of a major war and created the basis for substantial arms reductions. For these benefits the ANZUS Treaty asked its members to share the burdens and responsibilities of the alliance.· One thing is very clear: alliances cannot survive if one of the partners decides to select its responsibilities a la carte. That is precisely what New Zealand has done. In a speech to the Australian Association for Armed Neutrality on 13 May 1990 New Zealand's former Prime Minister Lange explained his thoughts on the ANZUS Treaty. He had this to say: In 1984 I saw considerable scope for military cooperation between New Zealand and the United States at the low level of the Alliance . . . I allowed for the possibility that there mi be scope for cooperation between the Uni States and New Zealand in dealing with a dium level threat. I cannot put it more definit than that. No medium-level threat to New Z land was known to exist in 1984, and none been identified since. I saw no place at all in N Zealand for the nuclear deterrent. There my an ysis differed fundamentally from that adopted the Australian Labor Party. It was under the leadership of form Prime Minister Lange that New Zeala finally put in practice the words it h been saying for so many years. The f mer Prime Minister summed up his a tude to ANZUS with these chilling wor I think it is past time the ANZUS Treaty consigned to the Valhalla of alliances. Under the Lange Government, New Z land became no longer an ally of Austra and the United States, but simply a frie Specifically referring to Australia's d ence relationships with New Zealand, Lange had this to say: I do not . . . expect Australia to come our defence. There is good reason for that. do not expect to be attacked. Nor indeed do have the larger strategic interests which are ch acteristic of Australia. We have no historical terest in Papua New Guinea and no reason anticipate any form of conflict with Indonesia We do not, for obvious reasons, share Aust is's strategic interests in the Indian Ocean. indeed do we share the strategic preoccupati embodied in places like North West Cape, P Gap and Nurrungar. What we do have in co mon is an interest in stability and security in South Pacific region. There is in that a place the projection of low level military force. In our case we wish to have the capacity intervene to secure the safety of New Zeal citizens who may find themselves caught up disturbances in the region . . . Appropriation Bill (No.1) We wish in time of natural disaster or other emergency to be abl.e to respond to requests for assistance from PacI-c Island - overnments. We wish to counter terr,?f1sm. Vt(e wish to pr-tect resources of the regiOn against unauthoflsed depletion. That statement by - r Lange represe!lts New Zealand's commItment to collectI,:,e security arrangements between AustralIa and New Zealand. Mr Lange's statement has never been repudiated, either by the New Zealand Government or by the National Party Opposition. It contains no pledge by New Z-ala-d to fight ,for the defence of AustralIa, eIther on thIS contInent or offshore. There is no pledge to be part of the collective leadership ?f t-e Western alliance through whose sohdanty the demise of communism has been hastened and which in turn has now provided new hope for peace. Although the prospects for peace. and freedom in Europe have been uplIfted dramatically, the change from unprecedented dynamism and relative stability in Asia to dangerous uncertainty has been equally rapid. For example, China has potential for violent tumult; the Korean Peninsula continues to be a regional powder keg; and the Philippines is in constant crisis with regular reports of military insurrection. In New Zealand's own backyard political uncertainty will increase among the smaller island nations of the South Pacific as they attempt to deal with the challenges of nationhood and the economic survival in a fast-changing world. On 21 May this year New Zealand's defence Minister, Peter Tapsell, was reported as warning Australians and New Zealanders that they live in the most dangerous part of the world outside the Middle East. He made these comments in a speech at Rotorua, where he warned that we should not be lulled by peace breaking out in eastern Europe and a lessening of tension between the superpowers. There has been no response to that speech or endorsement by the New Zealand Government. As President Bush has rightly said, our new enemies are instability, uncertainty and unpredictability. So it is against this background that the bonds uniting old 9 October 1990 REPRESENTATIVES 2483 allies acquire the greatest importance. Deterrence has proven itself as the one policy of the Western alliance capable of the holding the peace. It is the one policy that has been the catalyst for dramatic arms reductions and has bonded together the free nations of the world to bring about this new era, a decade before the twentyfirst century, that brings hope to so many millions of people around the world. Yet the ANZUS alliance is in turmoil. We no longer have a collective Pacific leadership of Australia, New Zealand and the United States. That is why New Zealand should take another look at its opportunity to contribute constructively to the stability and security of this region. We ask it to join the table of these nations-",87

105,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL,"I rise tonight to address the area of foreign affairs and trade in Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1990-9l. I notice that the Budget Papers show that assistance to exporters in the coming 12 months will be down by 6.9 per cent. The Budget figures for every area of assistance for exporters from export development schemes, export and trade promotion, export finance facilities to national interest and export insurance all register negative rates of growth. This comes at a time when the latest available current account figures show that for the month of August we ran at another loss of $1 ,800m. It also comes at a time when our gross national debt sits in excess of $160 billion. Why is it this year that the Government has lowered assistance to exporters at a time when we can least afford it? The importance of encouraging Australian exports cannot be overstated. Trade development is of the utmost importance and the Government should be looking at providing an incentive and not a disincentive for export industries. One critical trading area that I see is in the export of live sheep to the Middle East. I say this against a background of the history"" of the live sheep trade and the conflict in the Middle East at the moment. The acceptance of the latest live sheep shipments recently into Saudi Arabia 14 September 1990 wa,s an encouraging turn of events for this trade. Live sheep shipments have been turned away from Saudi Arabia since August 1989. The versal of the process must now be folis lowed through by promotion and ports development of this trade. Let me give this Parliament some ground to this market and why it is imlambs slaughtered. portant. The export of live sheep from Australia to the Middle East commenced in 1960 with a shipment to Kuwait. The trade expanded modestly, albeit with vargenerally . iable annual volumes during the 1960s with Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Bahrain coming regular buyers of small shipments. In fact, Kuwait displaced Singapore as single most important market in 1964 ranked as the major Middle East export destination until 1970 when Iran first chased significant volumes of live sheep. During the 1970s the number of Middle East markets expanded from six to For most of that decade Iran and Kuwait dominated the trade. Saudi Arabia first purchased large quantities in 1976 with 280,000 sheep and business developed rapidly. In 1981 Saudi Arabia became largest market with annual sales of million sheep. Despite the withdrawal of Iran from the markets, 1983 was a record year with live sheep exports reaching million head. From then until 1988 ports were close to 7 million head nually. The Middle East countries have nated the Australian live sheep trade for nearly two decades. In 1970, 77 per of exports were to the Middle East. By 1979 its share reached 98 per cent of live sheep shipments from Australia. other words, only 2 per cent of our sheep exports went to other destinations outside the Middle East. Consequently, the importance of the live sheep trade extends not only from the volume and value of actual business but also in provision of marketing options for sheep producers. To place this in an appropriate perspective, in 1983 when Australian sheep numon bers totalled 130.5 million head, the record 7.3 million head exported represented 5.5 per cent of the total sheep flock in that year. A more significant measure reof the importance of the live sheep trade generated by comparing turn-off for exwith turn-off for slaughter domestically. In 1983 exports were the equivalent of 75 per cent of sheep slaughtered for backmutton and 28 per cent of sheep and Generally, the most preferred sheep in the Middle East countries are the fat tailed ship. These are the Arab sheep. This is reflected by the very high prices that are paid for these sheep. Australian belive sheep-at least those which have traditionally comprised the bulk of the the trade-are the least preferred of the imand ported sheep. With this fact in mind, it becomes increasingly important to propurmote and further develop the trade and not reduce assistance to exporters. On 22 August 1989 the Australian Meat and nine. Livestock Corporation (AMLC), which administers the trade, decided to suspend exports following rejections totalling 300,000 head. Initially, Saudi Arabia was the only market where difficulties were the being experienced. However, there have 2.1 also been rejections in other markets. A reasonabie estimate of the economic loss due to the disruption of the trade is 7.3 estimated to be in excess of $40m or $25 exa head for the estimated reduction in annumbers exported of 1.6 million head. So already we have seen a significant loss. In 1988-89, 6.3 million head were exported domiworth $198m or $31 a head. In 1989-90 it is estimated that 4.7 million head were cent exported worth $99m or $21 a head. Developments in the Gulf will add to all the impact of the disruptions with the In trade to Saudi Arabia. In accordance with live United Nations sanctions, exports to Kuwait have ceased following the invasion by Iraq. During the 1980s' Kuwait was the second most important market, annually taking about 1.6 million sheep. the The AMLC has forecast exports to Kuwait of 1.4 million sheep in 1990, about half of which had to be shipped prior to the embargo. The total live sheep exports this year of 5.8 million head for the AMLC is now very unlikely to be achieved, even if normal trade is resumed with Saudi Arabia. Given that at the peak of the Middle East live sheep trade, between 1983 and 1988 7 million head were exported annually the loss of foreign exchange resulting in' deteriorating trade conditions in this market is most significant. The lo-s of this valuable market and trade will further aggregate the Australian wool supply pipeline. If we take the Australian average cut per head at 4.6 kilograms-and these are Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics figures-the live. sheep trade has, on-e again, the potenttal to remove 31.5 -11-­ lion kilograms of wool from Austraha s available supply. This will have the effect of reducing the current wool stockpile. The live sheep trade has seen a turnabout in market trends recently with three year-old sheep now the preferred product in the Middle East. In the past the destination of this trade in sheep, which was really a by-product of the wool industry as so many of the sheep were considered surplus to requirements, was the Middle East. However, since they are now requiring three-year-old sheep, it is quite easy to work out that we are effectively wiping out three years of wool production. In commercial terms, this would equate to almost 100 million kilograms of wool. That is the volume of wool that those sheep would produce in their lifetime. The long term result of such a situation is an improvement in productive capacity-an objective that the Australian Wool Corporation and wool growers alike are seeking at the moment. Therefore, the result of a successful trade with the Middle East would see a substantial reduction in Austral!as wool production. Presently, Austraha has a massive problem with excessive wool production.",89
106,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,91
107,Dr THEOPHANOUS,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL,"We are debating the estimates relating to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. I will concentrate tonight on foreign policy issues. I begin by saying that some recent comments by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) suggesting that Australia's foreign policy is in disarray are laughable in view of the fact that for many years the Opposition has not known what it is doing on foreign policy and in view of the spectacular successes in foreign policy in the last couple of years of the Ahlstralian Government and, in particular, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans. In particular, I commend very sincerely the efforts of Senator Evans in relation to Cambodia because of my own interest and concern in this area. In 1987 I visited the refugee camps on the Thai-Cambodian border and saw the sort of human misery and suffering that has gone on there and also the extent of the apparently intractable nature of the problems. I am extremely pleased that a breakthrough has occurred along the lines set out in the Australian Government document, which proposes to use the United Nationsextensively to ensure peace while moving towards elections in which all the people of Cambodia can express their will. I notice that there have been a few hitches since that announcement. I hope that they will be overcome very quickly and that we can proceed towards a solution to the Cambodian crisis. There is no doubt that the voice of Australia and the role of Australians in these matters have been excellent-patient diplomacy combined with the attempt to bring people together-and I think that the Foreign Minister deserves all our congratulations on that. There are many issues in foreign policy about which we ought to be concerned. I will be very interested to see whether the Leader of the Opposition is actually able to grapple with these issues or come up with something substantial, since .he made the claim that our foreign policy is in disarray. But there are two other areas I want to mention here tonight. First, I want to talk about Papua New Guinea. We have some serious problems in Papua New Guinea in relation to not only the crisis on Bougain ville butalso other crises that are coming to the attention of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. I have the honour of chairing the Foreign Affairs and Defence Subcommittee which is carrying out an inquiry into Papua New Guinea, and I myself have been taken aback by the extent of the evidence of how serious the problems are in Papua New Guinea. I do not understand why the Australian media do not write and discuss more the issues pertaining to Papua New Guinea. I do not want to pre-empt the Committee's report, so I will not say much more about the situation except that I am personally concerned about not only the Bougainville developments and other developments in Papua New Guinea relating to law and order and some of the violence in the highlands but also some of their causes, such as unemployment of the young people in the towns and the apparent problems stemming from the consti-' tutional arrangements put into place very much through the efforts of Australia. I think we have to ask ourselves whether the kind of Constitution that we recommended for Papua New Guinea, which does not seem to take very much into account Melanesian culture, is in need of some revision as a result of the events in Papua New Guinea. Having said that, I am looking forward to the presentation of the report and to a thorough discussion in this Parliament of the issues pertaining to Papua New Guinea. Finally, I refer to the situation in the Persian Gulf. It is quite clear that, increasingly, the hopes that Saddam Hussein had for support from a range of countries for his position have been dashed. It is very pleasing that more and more control of the Gulf crisis is coming . under the banner of the United Nations. Nevertheless, the situation remains very volatile and could explode in any direction at any time. I am concerned that, while there have been a number of initiatives towards ensuring that the blockade is successful, there losses. does not seem to have been sufficient in itiative by a number of nations in a posi tion to influence events towards trying t get a diplomatic settlement to the crisis. I know that it is not fashionable to tal about the possibility of a diplomatic set tlement. It appears as if both sides-tha is, Hussein on the one hand and thos forces trying to get him out of Kuwait o the other hand-are in an intractable po sition. I read today in the background repor of the Institute of Public Affairs (lPA that if one takes the statements made b President Bush and Saddam Hussein th two positions are totally irreconcilable an it is not possible to find some kind o compromise or way forward involvin some negotiation. While the position o the United Nations is clearly not negoti able, in that there is a need for Iraq t withdraw from Kuwait, I believe that it i very important to see whether the Iraqi can be persuaded to this position if a least some of the concerns it previousl had with respect to Kuwait can be met. do not agree with this report which seem to claim that it is not possible to find diplomatic and negotiated solution. If one thinks about the other alterna tives, they are quite dangerous becaus there is the possibility of a very extende embargo-blockade situation, with a very determined leader in Saddam Hussein o a pre-emptive strike of some kind by th United States ground forces in Saudi Ara bia. Some military experts have commente on this matter. I refer to Hansard for th House of Lords, where the head of th delegation to the North Atlantic Treat Organisation Assembly-a military ma who is quite au fait with these matters-clearly stated that any attempt to obtain a pre-emptive solution in terms o a first strike, even a first strike by aero planes, which is supported by Professo Owen Harris from the IPA, who said tha this might be a viable way of going for ward; would create a dangerous situation whicn could get the United States and other Western nations bogged down in a serious military conflict with very heavy While it is the universal. desire of· all nations that Saddam HusseI- should get out of Kuwait, the AustralIan Government and other governments that. ha-e eaceful intentions should be explonng m - more detailed way, ways and meaps of. trying to persuade S-ddam Hussem to work towards a negotIated. settlement. I know a number. of countneshave b-en talking about thIS. The French and Kmg Hussein Of Jordan have put forward a number of suggestions but I really do think that it is necessary for us to look at these proposals.",91
108,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL,"Order! The, honourable member's time has expired.",93
109,Mr MACKELLAR,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL,"Following on from the honour.able member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) there is no doubt that the situation in the Gulf is one of great concern, an"" I would join those who are very cautious about the apparent inclination of sOl11e people to rush to a 9uick military solution. Unfortunately, It may be the only way out in the final analysis but I do think that the prospects of negotiation should be explored quite properly before that decision is taken because any such conflict could be extremely damaging and the loss of life could be quite horrifi-. Nobody would want to see that. We are debating the Estimates for .the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and it is quite an extraordinary time in which we live and a quite extraordinary year in which we live. One has only to look at the changing geopolitical situation right around the world to bririg to mind the enormous changes that have taken place, particularly in Eastern Europe, and the effects that those changes have had on security and foreign affairs relationships amongst lesser powers. One of the interesting aspects of the changes that have taken place is the inc.reased opportunity for the United NalIOns to play a more positive and worthwhile role in world affairs than has hitherto been the case. A number of people have had very serious misgivings about the United Nations over many years now and have seen it as a total waste of time and money. But it is the only organisation of its type that we have available to us and now that we have what appears to be the effective dismantling of the Cold War, we have as never before in the history of the United Nations the capacity to improve that organisation and to make that organisation more compatible with the marvellous objectives with which it was set up. I should hope that the Australian Government would be working towards that end in a very constructive and a properly dedicated way. At this stage it does need an impetus given to improving the administration and the effectiveness of the United Nations and to selling the concept of the United Nations more effectively than has been the case in the past. We may see it playing yet an even more dramatic role in the resolution of the Gulf crisis which presently confronts us. But having said. that things have changed, obviously they have changed very radically in our part of the world, and this has placed upon Australia both iIi the defence capacity and in the foreign affairs area, in my view, a much greater responsibility than perhaps has been the case in the past because we have this very, very marked change in the world scene. Individual countries-and particularly one could include Australia in this-are more on their own now than they have been for some time. If we look at our immediate region, the honourable member for Calwell drew attention to the situation in Cambodia. I, like him, am very hopeful that we will get a resolution to, that enervating, destructive and quite horrific conflict which has been going on in Cambodia for so many years now but I. do caution the euphoria which has greeted some of the statements and some of the actions in recent times. There is no doubt that the resolution of that situation is a: very complicated one and there is a great danger that the capacity of some of the peoples of the region. to take a very long term view and to sit out situations with the prospect at some later time of becoming re-emergent is part of that equation. I should therefore caution the Government in terms of its planning and its assessment of the total situation because to my mind there are a great many traps, pitfalls and difficulties before we really get down to the question of solving what has previously been an intractable problem. Again, the honourable member for Calwell mentioned Papua New Guinea. He did that as Chairman of the Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee of Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, which is presently conducting a most interesting inquiry into Australia's relations with Papua New Guinea. I have been impressed so far with the lack of knowledge in Australia of the situation in Papua New Guinea and, conversely, the very real information that we appear to be receiving of a much greater interest in Australian affairs by the Papua New Guineans than vice versa. I guess that to a certain extent is understandable but unless Australians realise the special relationship which exists between Australia and Papua New Gumea and become more informed on the situation in that country then there is a real danger that the relationships could swiftly ebb away. One of the facts of the situation is that the Papua New Guinea politicians have a very high attrition rate. The chances of re-election there are much less than they are even within the Australian Labor Party in Australia. Therefore, we are finding a whole new group of politicians coming to positions of power in Papua New Guinea. They do not have the same background of relationships with Australia either through schooling here or through contacts with Australians when they were playing a much bigger role in Papua New Guinea when independence first came about. So there is a great need for Australians and Australian politicians particularly to have a much more adequate understanding of Papua New Guinea both as a nation and through personal relationships with the people of Papua New Guinea. I am glad to see that there has been some recognition of this when people start talking about visits to Papua New Guinea. It is absolutely essential that Australia's Federal politicians travel around the Pacific, especially to Papua New Guinea, whenever they get the chance. I should hope to see that· brought into much stronger focus by the Government. It is important to us that we maintain and develop that relationship with Papua New Guinea. Speaking of changed circumstances, I draw the House's attention to the changed circumstances in the Pacific generally. For instance, the situations in French Polynesia and in New Caledonia will have a far-reaching impact upon Australia's relationships with those areas. I was very pleased to see the settling down, if you like, of the situation in New Caledonia following the reaching of agreement concerning that area's relationship with France. Looking at the Pacific generally, I have been very disappointed with the Government's response to the Fijian situation. We all have our moral views about what should or should not have occurred in Fiji. Nobody can support the overthrow of a legally and properly elected government. But having said that, we do have to live with the situation and I do not think that we will be able to influence the situation in Fiji as successfully as we might wish if we close our doors to a number o people who were intimately concerned with the situation there. I think we have to properly express our position in relation to the overthrow of the duly elected Government. But having said that-and there has been some eflluxion of time-we should be looking at ways in which we can more adequately help to bring about a proper return of democratic, representative government in Fiji. I think the Government has missed a number of opportunities in this regard and I hope that a closer look will be taken at the way in which that relationship is being handled.",93

111,Mr GRACE,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL,"ln t-e context of tonight's debate on Approl?fl-­ tion Bill (No.1) 1990-91, I beheve It IS appropriate for the - ouse .to spend a I?oment or two i- co-sIderatIOn of a sub-ect which is of vItal Importance to the Immediate future of this country. I refer to the Uruguay Round of the General Ag-ee­ ment on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) which, as most honourable members would know, concludes with a meeting. of ne-rly 100 Ministers and trade negotIators m Brussels between 3 an? - December nex-. I do not believe that It IS an exaggeratIOn to state that the future of the trading world depends on a successful outcome to the Uruguay Round. For smaller trading nations such as Australia, which are heavily depe-dent on world commod-ty trade, anything but a successful conclUSIOn would be nothing short of a disaster. As honourable members would know, the Uruguay Round is the most comprehensive of the seven rounds of talks held under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The Round started four years ago in Uruguay, hence the title, although all of the actual negotiations are carried out in Geneva-it sounds a bit Irish. Paramount among the objectives of the Uruguay Round and of compelling interest to Australia is the improvement of world trade rules and the strengthening of GATT's dispute settling processes. This is essential so that countries can resolve their differences within a forum such as GATT, rather than take action on their own. For Australia, and other small to medium traders, an orderly world trade system is essential to our ability to grow and prosper. We do not have the trading clout or, indeed, the economic clout to be heard above the powerful trading blocs-particularly the European Community (EC) and its sometime opponent, the United States-and, therefore, we are the first to suffer when the rules of fair trade are forgotten. Already we have seen how our wheat exporters have been caught in the crossfire betw-en the US and the European Comm1;lm-y. We have also seen creeping protech.omsm,. particularly the growth of non-tanff barrIers, as some world traders have moved to protect themselves in the face of perceived unfair trading. Unfortunately, unless the Uruguay Round is successfully concluded, the trade picture will become bleaker. Instead of order and sanity, we will see trade retaliation and trade' wars, with countries such as the United States possibly making greater use of trade weapons such as section 301 of the United States Trade Act, which provides for retaliation against those countries which the US thinks are or perceives to be unfair traders. For all trading countries, including the US and the EC, such an end result makes no sense, particularly at a time when many countries in eastern Europe and some Latin American countries are turning their backs on protectionist measures and great opportunities are opening up for increased world trade. Fortunately, in the recent pronouncements by senior trade figures in the major trading blocs, it is clear that an understanding exists that it is vital for the emerging democracies of eastern Europe that there be an efficient and fair trading world in which they can participate. In the Uruguay Round negotiators are trying to achieve substantial and progressive reductions in agricultural support and protection. This goal was laid down at the mid-point of the current round of talks and negotiators are now preparing the final details of how this can be achieved. I am sure that honourable members will join with me in hoping that these negotiations prove to be fruitful. . Unfortunately, to date the European Community has shown an acute reluctance to make the sorts of changes to the common agricultural policy which would yield more open markets for Australian exports in Europe or sharply cut export subsidies. These need to be reduced to dispose of the agricultural commodity surpluses that are created by the inflated prices paid to producers under the common agricultural policy, which distort the markets that Australia sells into. The US has signalled a willingness to reform its protection and support arrangements and the Cairns Group of countries will also be aiming for an ambitious outcome from its agriculture talks. . While speaking on the subject of trade, I believe it is important to mention the great work that has been done by the Cairns Group of 14 free trading agricultural nations. This group has been one of the real success stories of recent Australian foreign policy. The group now commands an important role in agricultural negotiations with the US and the European Community. In fact, the group has been instrumental in shaping the course of the negotiations and will continue to do so in the remaining weeks of the round before the final ministerial meetings in Brussels. The Cairns Group has shown that smaller trading nations can have an effective collective voice and a say in the trade negotiations arena. Of course, the Uruguay Round deals with a number of matters in addition to the question of agriculture. These include the efforts being made to bring the new area of trade in services, one of the fastest provides: growing areas of world trade, under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade; the protection of intellectual property rights; and an attempt to remove the distortions in, and restrictions on, tile trade which would benefit many developing countries. Although these matters are important to Australia, particularly the protection of intellectual property rights, which is vital to us given the growth of industries such as computer software, there should be no doubt that the agricultural talks are the key to our medium term prosperity. We are a people who ask for no favours, and indeed we have to a great extent opened up our markets to the world in an expression of good faith. All we ask for is a level playing field which gives us the chance to compete.",95
112,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL,"Order! It being 10.30 p.m., I shall report progress. The Deputy Chairman having reported accordingly - NA",96
113,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 10.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Honourable. member for Page: Remarks",96
114,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Prior to calling members on the adjournment I wish to make a few remarks. Today after Question Time the honourable member for Hume (Mr Fife) raised a question of words used by the honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods) in relation to the Speaker. At the time. I took his inquiry to be related to the question of privilege. On reflection, and after reading the transcript and discussing the matter with the honourable member for Hume, it is clear that he was referring to it as a question of order. With the commencement of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987 the former offence of contempt by defamation was abolished. The relevant provision is contained in subsection 6(1) of the Act which Words or acts shall not be taken to be an offence against a House by reason only that those words or acts are defamatory or critical of the Parliament, a House, a committee or a member. world tex- Subsection (2) states: Sub-section (1) does not apply to words spoken or acts done in the presence of a House or a committee. The section needs to be read in conjunction with section 4 of the same Act which provides: Conduct (including the use of words) does not constitute an offence against a House unless it amounts, or is intended or likely to amount, to an improper interference with the free exercise by a House or a committee of its authority or functions, or with the free performance by a member of the member's duties as a member. It is clear therefore that the remarks reportedly made by the honourable member for Page, if true, cannot constitute a contempt of the House. The question arises, however, as to whether the Speaker or the House could take any action other than privilege action in relation to the matter. It would seem to me that it would be open to me to require the honourable member to withdraw the reported remarks and to, apologise or them becau-e they amount to a reflection on the ChaIr. Should the honourable member not do so there would appear to be no reason - hy the House itself could not then take actIOn against the honourable member for disregarding the authority of the Chair. On the other hand, if. the honourable member failed to withdraw the remarks and - he House was not prepared to take actIOn against the member, the Speaker could decline to see the member should he seek to call as was the case in 1950 when the then Speaker declined to see a member until the member had withdrawn certain statements and apologised for them. In my view the above actions can be taken by the Speaker and the House under the existing Standing Orders of the House and without the necessity of any amendment of the Standing Orders. I see the matter being dealt with as a matter of order and not as one of privilege. The honourable member for Page had, subsequent to the issue of his press release, seen the error of his ways and indicated to me that he wished to find an occasion to withdraw his remarks. I indicated by way of inference at Question Time today that we should all come to the adjournment tonight. As the honourable member is a relatively new member of the House, I indicated that I thought the most appropriate time would be on the next adjournment debate. Honourable member for Page: Remarks",96
115,Mr HARRY WOODS,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Speaker, I wish to offer an explanation and an apology for the claims I made in a press release on Friday 21 September, which called into question your impartiality. My claim then was that It was more than coincidental that I did not get to speak on the issue of the third runway planned for Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. With the benefit of hindsight and the explanations given to me, I am convinced and sure that there was no intent by the Speaker to prohibit me from speaking. . Mr Speaker, I wish to unreservedly WIthdraw the remarks I made in my press release and I apologise to you and the r House for any comments which may have been seen as critical of the way in which you perform your duties.

I accept that it is late in the evening and I would prefer it to be dealt with now rather than tomorrow. I would also like to indicate that I am pleased that the honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods) has seen fit to apologise to the House. Mr Speaker, it would appear from my discussion with you and from what you have saW in the House this evening, that until you read the transcript you felt that I was referring to a question of privilege.

118,Mr HICKS,ADJOURNMENT,"1 would like to touch on the subject of the Austudy allowance. I received a letter from two constituents of mine, a husband and wife on the land, and I would like to read this letter because I think it touches on a lot of the problems that are facing people in rural Australia today. It reads as follows: Dear Sir, I wish to protest at the unfair, discriminatory, and unrealistic decision to reduce the allowable asset value for Austudy assistance to $200 000. This eliminates assistance for the majority of farmers, small business people, and is particularly harmful to rural dwellers, who are forced by distance and lack of local facilities to support chilestate dre.n away from home during their tertiary studies. ThIs effectIvely doubles the cost of living for a family. In addition to the costs of study, travel (essential to maintain emotional support for adolescent students), and basic clothing needs, this adds a very substantial burden to the family income. In our case loss of the small amount of Austudy our children have received will create hardship. We are primary producers. We have four adolescent children, two at University in Canberra one completing Year 10 and proceeding to thHSC, and one in Year 8 this year. Our taxable income over the past five years has been $19,000, $27,000, $42,000, $22,000 and $50,000. There has been no difference in the way we have conducted our operation, merely a difference in the commodity prices we have received in our rice, sheep and cattle enterprise, together with rising costs, high interest rates and seasonal patterns. There have been no surplus funds for luxury living, and no chance in the reasonable years to put some' money aside for education-we are always. scram-ling to catch up after a poor year, or paymg tax m a better year. With a cut back of 25% in our rice acreage 1990/91 will prove extremely difficult. The value of our land has decliQ¢-\lby 40% in dollar value oyer the past five ye.arSj-. a real reductIOn of far more m.f spending power of that value. We sti 1'fall above the set limit of $200,000 for 50% of the value of Qur business. However, I believe that to establish an asset value as a criterion for assistance for students is to ignore the reality of business principles-how can we possibly sell off paddocks to find sufficient funds to edu-e our children without undermining or destr0'9ing' the viability of our enterprise? That is, in effect, what saying must be done. The farm is an economic unit, built up over the past fifty years as of supporting a family, balancing out over good and bad years, and with no aura of greed, or affiuence or luxury. To treat a farming enterprise as being of a certain value and therefore capable of generating a certain income, no doubt calculated on a Canberra-bureaucratic formula also shows a surprising ignorance of the reality and proven history of agriculture in this country. We do not make 20% return on our investment, it is more like 2%. We would in fact be better off to be earning interest on the money, sitting back and relaxing instead of working 60 hours a week and, what is more, we would then be eligible fo; full Austudy support for three children. It is a gross misconception if-you-really believe that property ownership and wealth are equated. We would be foolish indeed to sell a property worth less than half its 1982 value on a non-existent market. This is not urban - eal ... and the Japanese are not interested in it at present. Earning capacity of property is the key, and this varies due to factors beyond our control-world markets, seasons, the Australian economy etc. The .unfairness of your system of assisting students IS self-evident. People earning incomes of up to $83,000 and owning a family home worth millions of dollars, and with three children of aPI?ropriate age as ours are, are eligible for some asslsta-ce. People who own companies, and can set theIr bO,oks out to appear to be earning low family incomes can successfully apply for Austudy. Even people from overseas earning a nil A-stralian income can gain full Austudy for their ch-ldren. And we, wh- work hard to give our ch!ldren the opportumty to gain advanced secondary and tertiary education, to take their place successfully in a modern technological world, to be knowledgeable and competent adult Australians, are denied assistance. Surely education is an investment in the future of this country. These ,People who write to me say that there IS no ,way they can educate their children unless the Government d something about the tertiary assista scheme, under which eligibility has n Qpresenting been reduced to an asset value s of the $200,000, which is quite unrealistic most of the rural sector. Sydney Airport: Third Runway",97
119,Mr HARRY WOODS,ADJOURNMENT,"The undertaking of this Gove ment to construct a third runway Sydney Airport is to be congratulated you are supported. It is quite clear that this G ernment has given an undertaking to c capable struc- a third runway at Sydney Airp pendmg the successful outcome of an vironmental impact statement (EIS). we know, the release of that statem was delayed, heightening congestion pr lems at Australia's premier airport gateway for international travellers. Th are not too many of us here who do have first-hand knowledge of those del at Sydney Airport. However, the EIS now been released and, on bal-nce, offers no objection to the constructIOn of the third runway. Of course, that. statem-nt has now been released for publIc scrutI-y and comment over a three-month penod and already there has been considerable public comment. Some of - y c0.n--gues have been outspoken in theIr cntIcIsm of the proposal, as have - ome m-mbers of the Opposition. TheIr n:t0tIves .ar- 'pur-ly parochial and are aImed at mtImIdatmg those who are in favour of the runway. The net effect on residents around Sydney Airport will be a reduction in noise levels. That reduction will result from more planes approacl1ing and departing over Botany Bay. The EIS further states that if future passenger demands in the Sydney basin are to be met, then either additional runway capacity or substantial changes in traffic management will be required.· Of course 'changes in traffic management' can m'ean a number of things.· It could mean the staggering of arrival and departure times of the major airlines during peak periods or it could mean the introduction of peak period landing charges-and that is the area which causes me the greatest deal of concern. If a flat fee of, say, $200 for each aircraft using the airport during peak periods is introduced, it will have the greatest impact on people from country areas, whom I represent. If a plane carrying 200 people lands during peak periods, the fee translates into a $1 increase for each passenger. But if a plane from a country area carrying, say, 10 or 20 people wants to use the airport at that time, the cost translates into $10 or $20 a passenger. The alternative for country users is to use the airport in off-peak periods. For !hose engaged in business activities, that IS not an alternative. They may have to come to Sydney the previous day and be forced to pay the cost of accommodation for a. night. The imposition of peak period landmg fees is discriminatory against country air travellers. It is in conflict the community service obligations of this Government. The people of the north coast of New South Wales have already copped their share of cutbacks in transport areas-most are attributable to the Greiner-Murray State Government-cutbacks that have taken more than 1,000 seats a day from rail on the north coast; cutbacks that have withdrawn sleeper services from rails in that region; changes that have robbed north coast people of reasonable rail timetables and forced them to catch trains in the middle of the night. Other State government cutbacks in many cases mean country people more than ever before have to put up with lesser standards of health and education services than do people in city areas. The State Government is starting to see the folly of its ways and is attempting to perform some damage control to lessen the electoral impact of its changes. But it has downgraded the importance of country New South Wales, and I hope that this Government is not going to follow along that track. The construction of a new airport at Badgerys Creek is a long way off. Its construction will be part of a long term answer to the lack of landing facilities in Sydney. But the problem is now and solutions must be undertaken straight away. The benefits to Australia of the construction of a third runway at Sydney Airport are many. There is less noise; fewer delays for country air trayellers, for overseas travellers and for tourists; and a consequential lowering of costs to airlines to be passed onto consumers. This Government should stick to its policy for the construction of a third runway and not be railroaded by those who represent a minority of interests. Country people really do deserve to be considered on this issue. Let us not turn our backs on them. Gallipoli Celebrations",98
120,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,ADJOURNMENT,"Tonight I want to refer to a few events in Australia's history. We are still celebrating the seventy-fifth anniversary of the campaign at Gallipoli. Many people would say that that is where Australia with received its nationhood, even though it was some 14 years after the event of becoming a federation. Just last month we saw the fiftieth anniversary of .the Battle of Britain, and we re-established thevittues and the principles that were being fought for at that time. The year 1991 marks the fiftieth anniversary of the Siege of Tobruk. Many people say that at that time Australian troops reinforced and re-established the reputation of the Australian digger that wa& born out of Gallipoli. I think it is very important at this stage that we reflect on what will be happening next year. The veterans who survived that battle are now in their seventies. If we are to have a proper celebration, they need a lot of support because of their age. They think it is a marvellous achievement that they got a fiftieth anniversary postage stamp to commemorate the battle, but it is a small token .in terms of what they . have done for Australia's reputation. It was of interest to me to know that when the committee that is keeping the historical records of Tobruk approached the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) for a contribution towards the fiftieth anniversary celebrations, only $1,000 was available to the Rats of Tobruk. In contrast, the Government has awarded $5,000 to the organisers of Sydney's Gay Mardi Gras. I wonder where the association of principles is when I compare what those veterans did almost 50 years ago with the reputation of the Sydney gay festivals. It is very important for us to realise that 1941 was a year of other events' that might have overtaken the importance of Tobruk, such as Russia's entry into the war, and also America's entry into the war, on 7 December 1941. This fiftieth anniversary may need a bit more glossing. I speak on behalf of qujte a few veterans from Mackay who were proud members and Rats of Tobruk. The 2/15 Battalion has kept up the significance of the day. Five years ago a chap by the name of Bill Williams, who is a founder of the historical records. committee, visited Mackay. That was significant because at that time he was a journalist in Tobruk and was responsible for some' of the early publications. I understand that he used to put out on a weekly basis a publication called the Tobruk Truth, or' the Dinkum Oil as it became known. He was with the battalion during all that time and would have had first-hand knowledge of events. But, typical of those people, he is now dead. Very few are left. It is very important to realise that Australian casualties suffered at Tobruk numbered one-third of those lives lost in the whole Middle East campaign. A total of 776 were killed in action-only one-tenth of those lost on Gallipoli, but still a significant number among those who lost . their lives during the war. A total of 2,112 were wounded in action. The total, including those missing and prisoners, was 3,907. That contribution should be remembered, particularly because this was the first time the German blitzkrieg had been stopped. Tobruk was entered in early January and left in December, uncaptured. At Tobruk, the tommies and the diggers showed that mechanised power could be defied by resolute men who refused to be intimidated. They set an example of unfailing courage in the face of superior strength, of firm spirit in face of hardship, of cheerful defiance and of offensive defence. It is very much up to this House, the. Parliament and the people of Australia to be able to give more than the $1,000 that has been promised so far.",99
121,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Levi Jeans,100
122,Mr BRERETON,ADJOURNMENT,"ln the short time granted to tonight it is not my intention to add the woes of the honourable member Page (Mr Harry Woods) but rather to d with a matter of concern to Austral consumers, namely, the exorbitant cost the most popular brands of denim je which retail in this country. One s brand, Levi Strauss SOls, often marke as the workingman's jeans, provides good example of the extortionate pric policies to which I refer. This popu brand currently retails in Australia around $100, an outrageous amount any standard. With Australia priding self on its informality, Levi jeans are of a part of the average w.ardrobe- especially among young Austraha-s. GIven. prices, it seems that an mformal - lf-style is anything but cheap. Naturally, It IS lower income earners who suffer the most as a result. . Whilst recognising that the clot-ing dustry is one of the most heaVily pro14 tected sectors of - he Australian - usiness community, I d-clded to. engage m s,?me pricing compansons wIth the Untted . States (US) to ascertain how the AustraAmerican lian consumer is really faring. The differentials, I discovered, are truly stagchased gering. For the common Levi 501 brand a survey of Sydney and Melbourne retailand ers reveals a price range of $95 to At the· same time the comparable US brand of 501 s is retailing in Cincinnati and Los Angeles for between $US38 and tralia. $US45 or approximately $A46 to $A58. These prices are charged by major jeans retailers and are well above those prevailing in discount or department stores, where the cost is closer to bly $US30-one-third of the comparable distribution Australian price. As I was soon to dismilked cover, the Levis which retail on the Ausmorseless tralian market. are not imported; they produced at Levi's factory in Elizabeth, South Australia, a production facility which was set up with significant State Government assistance. Therefore tariff protection is not the cause of the inflated Australian prices. Denim is an international commodity and even allowing for economies of scale the price differentials which exist between the comparable US and Australian 501s cannot be attributed to production costs. Rather, it is apparent that the marketing practices employed by Levi are the reason for the excessive Australian prices. We are basically talking about greed and profiteering. For many years Levi (Australia) Pty has been limiting its distribution network to expensive jeans retailers renowned for charging substantial mark-ups of up to 100 per cent. They do so with the blessing of Levi's Australian management: It is yery cosy arrangement that keeps prices mflated and hence keeps supply limited. In so doing, it clearly involves a rip-off of thes- the Australian consumer. Some of our major retail department the stores have long sought to be included in Levi's distribution network. The Australian subsidiary of the giant US retailer K inMart has been making such request- for years. The standard response it receives is that there is insufficient supply, hardly surprising when the lack of supply is engineered by, Levi itself. K Mart's parents have experienced no price such problems and Levis can be purin 1,-OO stores throughout the US. The average pair sells for around $US30 thus undercuts the prices charged by $100. the specialist jeans retailers. It would seem that Levi is intent on preventing the situation arising in AusAs a result, our consumers are being treated in a discriminatory manner by the US local and overseas management of the company. Plainly the situation is unacceptable. To date Levi has been remarkasuccessful in preserving its selective network. In so doing it has the Australian consumer in a refashion. Australians have every are right to ask why they are paying up to three times as much as Americans for· essentially the same product. Questions also need to be asked about the licensing agreement that exists between Levi and its American parent. It is time the Prices Surveillance Authority and the Trade Practices Commission investigated the pricing policies of Levi in this country. I will certainly be doing my best to ensure that the responsible Minister initiates an inquiry in the near future. I will not sit idly by and watch Australian consumers major being ripped off in this manner. Community Service Clubs: Bulk Postage Rates",100
123,Mr REID,ADJOURNMENT,"The Ltd honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton) has just raised an issue on pricing policy. I want to address a question of pricing policy which falls into an area of concern which the Government in a fact could do something about. I refer to the recent rises in Australia Post charges relating to the registration of articles for bulk posting and the increase in the minister imum charge for this service. This matter has· been brought to my munications. attention by a community service club in Bendigo which is associated with the Young Men's Christian Association, namely the Y's Men's Club of Bendigo. I have been told by the club's bulletin edi a fortnightly bulletin which is registered for bulk postage under the provisions which I have outlined. The fee for the should be replaced registration of the club's fortnightly buling letin has increased from $50 to annum. The minimum bulk postage rate has increased from $20 to $25 per issue. Mr U nmack has been very generolJ,s his views on this matter. He has taken broad view on behalf of community service clubs right throughout not only district but the State of Victoria. ObAssistance) Act 1989. viously, his concern would apply throughout Australia. He has indicated to me the work that community service clubs perform in the community. He has expressed their concern at the cost rises which have added appreCiably to the expenses of their administration. He has come up with a suggestion which I ask the Minister for Trade Negotiations (Dr Blewett), who is at the table, to refer to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley), who perhaps could give it consideration. That suggestion is that it would be reasonable to request consideration of the creation of a special category of bulk postage rate to be applicable to community service organisations. Obviously, that could be done when a bulletin is registered and a lower rate could be given to clubs. This would provide clubs with an incentive to keep their communications at a high level. In fact, it would encourage more community service organisations to participate in the production and delivery of a bulletin to their members to help promote their own clubs or community interests. Mr Unmack has suggested that this would be an incentive to the service clubs and would indirectly help to promote the concept of volunteerism upon which they rely for their membership. I ask the Minat the table to refer that suggestion . to the Minister for Transport and Com Question resolved in the affirmative.
