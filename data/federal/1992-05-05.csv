1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. Leo MCLeay) took the chair at 2 p.m., and read prayers. NA Superannuation",10
2,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I direct my question to the Prime Minister. Is it a fact that the Treasury has today provided infonuation to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation that the superannuation guarantee levy would destroy 45,000 jobs in the first two years and 100,000 jobs after five years?",10
3,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am not aware of what the Treasury has put to the Senate today. I would doubt very much that that would be a Treasury view. I make it quite clear to the Opposition that this country should take seriously the need to develop a pool of national savings and to provide off budget for the demographic shift in the population which is going to occur when the baby boom generation turns 65. If that is not done now, it will never be done. That is why there has to be a policy not only of a decent retirement income position and at the same time being able to build upon the building block of our retirement age system, the age pension, and additions to the age pension-that is, levels of retirement income in excess of the age pension through private provision with superannuation-but, on top of that, building a pool of national savings as well.",10
4,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Read Fightback.,10
5,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You mean 'Flexiback'. I would have thought that the Opposition would have had enough sense to see that, for the first time ever under the accord processes, Government .has encouraged the organised work force to agree to take 10 per cent of its income as savings rather than as cash. It has never been done before; it has never been achieved before. The importance of that acceptance by the trade unions' membership will be a significant factor in Australia's investment future in tenns of savings and, in tenus of living standards, a better standard of living in retirement. Rather than rabbiting on again with ideological obsessions"" about the power of trade unions and about their control over investment funds and all of the other phobias, which this phobia-ridden crowd opposite have, what they should do is basically support the Government and try to see the spread of occupational superannuation throughout Australia. Indirect Tax Reform",10
6,Mr LANGMORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I direct my question to the. Treasurer. I ask: has his attention been drawn to an article in last Friday's Australian Financial ReView headed 'Seal of approval for the goods tax'? Can the Treasurer advise the House as to what the OECD's report on Australia said about indirect tax refonn?,10
7,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"J did see the article in the Australian Financial Review. I also listened as attentively as I could to what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition had to say yesterday in a debate he inspired on the OECD's report, in which he claimed that this report gave clear and un-quivocal s,upport to the introduction of a new consumption tax. Once again, we are probably in a position where the Deputy Leader did not bother to read what was put in front of him or, if he did, he certainly did not understand it, because that is not what the OECD report Eaid. The OECD report listed the pros and the cons of a new consumption tax. Amongst the reservations which were listed were 'the risks involved for macro-economic management, the disruption to business and the difficulties of adequately compensating households for the price effects of GST' . I want to turn to and particularly emphasise this area of risk to macro-economic management. The Minister for Finance, in a this statement on 16 December last year, when he produced the Treasury and Tax Office costingsof the revenue side of the Opposition's package, stressed that in the second year of the Opposition's propo-ed three-year program there would be a major .relaxation of Budget policy. It is perfectly appropriate to have a relaxation of Budget policy or fiscal policy in' circumstances where you are trying to stimulate growth in the economy but, in the middle year in which it is proposed that this relaxation should occur, the economy would already be growing fairly robustly in response to the initiatives which this Government has taken and which will continue in the course of the next couple of years. At that time my colleague said that if you were to provide this stimulus at that point, in the 1994-95 year, then this would cause the monetary authorities to have to respond with high interest rates in order to deal with this extra stimulus coming from the package. But I am advised that the budgetary relaxation that my colleague was referring to is much worse than was thought at the time that he made the statement. I have been advised by the Treasury and the Tax Office that there was an error in the calculation made at that time, and I will explain what that error was. The coalition proposed to introduce its new tax on 1 October 1994. In the arithmetic of Fightback the coalition assumed that there would be nine months of the new tax collected during that financial year. The Tax Office and the Treasury took this at face value but, although the tax may be in operation for nine months, the Tax Office would not collect nine months worth of revenue. This is for the reason that the Opposition has been running' around telling businesses that they would not have to pay the tax immediately. In fact, the Opposition says that the largest businesses in Australia would be required to submit GST returns each month and pay the tax on or before the end of the following month; businesses with current turnovers below $24m would be required to submit their returns every two months and pay the tax on or before the end of the month following that; and the smallest businesses would be able to submit GST returns on a six monthly basis and hand over the tax within a month after the end of that period. There would be a major delay in the collection of GST which would impact quite significantly on that first year of its operation. The Opposition is saying that this includes great benefits. for business, ignoring the fact that any alleged benefit for taxpayers becomes a cash flow problem for the Tax Office. So, at the absolute minimum, these lags in the collection of this new tax would mean that we would not see the generation of nine months worth of revenue, but rather no more than eight months revenue and probably less than that. So, on the basis of the Liberals' own calculation, this would see a reduction in the collections which they assume of $2.263 billion-another $2.2 billion reduction in the estimated revenue. The calculation that has been made has been very generous, and I want to make one further qualification just to err on the side of fairness as far as the Opposition is concerned. In collecting less GST, those opposite would, although they have not realised it themselves",10
8,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The Minister has continued, throughout his five minutes of answering a single question, to deal with matters that, in fact, are outside his responsibility. But I think five minutes is enough. I would ask that you, Mr Speaker, follow the precedent set so often in this place and ask the Minister to bring his answer to a conclusion.",11
9,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Minister was asked a question on taxation. The Minister will answer the question on taxation.,11
10,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I said, the collections of wholesale sales tax would be rather larger than estimated in Fightback. So the actual hole in the first year of the operation of the GST is $1 112 billion dollars. Of course, this has enormous consequences for the management of the economy at the time. It is an enormous relaxation of fiscal policy during that year and it would have implications for the monetary authorities whom the Opposition would instruct to act totally autonomously in the face of this budgetary relaxation. So the suggestion that there would be a tightening of monetary policy is even a more acute problem for the Opposition as a result of this problem. It has been my duty from time to time to draw attention to the erroneous arithmetic of the Leader of the Opposition. Once again, I find myself in that position today. As a result of this $1 112 billion extra hole in Fightback, we now see the credibility gap expanding to $5 112 billion. It is a $5 112 billion hole coming from a person who prides himself on his own particular learning. What the Leader of the Opposition has done to arithmetic is what the formerÂ· Premier of Queensland used to do to the English language. National Flag",11
11,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Before I ask my question, can I seek leave to table the document I referred to previously in relation to superannuation?",12

16,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! Leave is not granted. The Leader of the Opposition has a question. Dr HEWSON. --My question is directed to the Prime Minister. In view of the overwhelming public support for the current flag, will he give an undertaking to the House to never again denigrate our national flag",12

21,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Further, I ask the Prime Minister: when will he allow this House the opportunity to express its support for the national flag?",12
22,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This question comes from a person who blackguards Australia abroad at will whenever it suits him. I indicated in the House last week his attacks upon Australia while he was in New Zealand, the mores of this society and its performance as an economy. All of these things are subject to attacks by the Opposition when it is outside this country. It has always been the case. In fact, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition attacked the central bank Governor in front of a very large and prestigious audience of Asian bankers on the basis that the central bank was being politically manipulated. Mr Aldred- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The question asked by the Leader of the Opposition was quite specific, and the Prime Minister is now straying into many other areas not related to it. Under standing order 145, I would ask you, Mr Speaker, to have him return the relevance of the answer to the question asked.",12
23,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Prime Minister will answer the question.,12
24,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition is always at it. As I said-I am repeating myself, but as he is, I will too-in the Herald-Sun, Dr Hewson said: can The weekend of ceremonies beginning today was not the time for playing politics but then he proceeded to do just that. But then he proceeded to do just that in Papua New Guinea. Dr Bob Woods-That is Keatingspeak. What is the headline?",12
25,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"'Hewson attacks Keating in Papua New Guinea'. Dr Bob Woods-Yes, Keating!",12
26,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The House will come to order.,12
27,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"An article from the Canberra TImes states: Dr Hewson's office confirmed the comment was directed to Mr Keating and appears to be a breach of protocol raising domestic issues outside the country ... And it went on. Then there were his celebrated remarks in New Zealand about Australia. He said: We have fallen off the pace dramatically in terms of our region, the Asia-Pacific region. Dr Hewson interjecting",12
28,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will come to that in a second. We are just getting clear the integrity of your position, which of course is negligible.",12
29,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,12
30,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The House will come to order. Mr Atkinson- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order understanding order 145 dealing with relevance. The question was very specific with respect to the flag. You did ask the Prime Minister to get back to addressing the question, and I would ask that you again get him to do that or ask him to sit down.",12
31,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister is in order. Dr Bob Woods-The Prime Minister is in order.,13
32,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,13
33,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He went on to say: We have to jettison 20 lost years, if you like, of bad policy, bad attitudes and bad values by just about everyone. This is the Australian loyalist saying abroad of Australians that they have 'bad attitudes and bad values'. Dr Bob Woods-And a bad Prime Minister. Mr MCGauran-Oh, this is outrageous.",13
34,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Lowe and the honourable member for Gippsland will cease interjecting.,13
35,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"And he said that it was not just the Government, it was everybody.",13
36,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Are you going to do it again?,13
37,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition will cease interjecting.,13
38,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"So the fact is that this fellow has absolutely not a shred of credibility in seeking to direct a question tQ me about remarks made by me outside Australia about the flag or anything else. As far as the flag is concerned, I again remind . the Leader of the Opposition of what I said in the House last week, and I will say it again: it is not satisfactory for Australia to have a representational image of itself with the flag of another country in the comer of its flagfull stop. Nevertheless, that having been said, the fact is",13
39,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Put it to the people.,13
40,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the Opposition will cease interjecting.,13
41,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,This is a debate worth having. I have made it clear that the Government will not be seeking to change the flag other than by a clear majority of Australians being in favour of it. The fact is that the notion of the lickspittles oppositeMr Sharp interjecting,13
42,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I warn the honourable member for Gilmore.,13
43,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They are dressing themselves in the flag and then trying, at their unctuous best, to find some virtue in the fact that they are defending a flag which, at its inception, included drafting instructions which stated that the design: . . . should be based on the British ensigns as flags of the countries added to its fold signalling to the beholder that it is an imperial union ensign of the British empire. If you are pleased and proud about that, you are just running true to' form, as all of your predecessors in this House have. Resource Security",13
44,Mr WRIGHT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I ask the Prime Minister: is it correct that the forest conservation and major projects legislation was defeated in the Senate early this morning? Will he advise the House why the Government wanted this legislation passed and also explain why it failed?,13
45,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It is true that the legislation was defeated in the Senate. . Mr Costello-Tell us why Ros didn't want it.,13
46,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Higgins!,13
47,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Government wanted the legislation passed because it would guarantee resource security, particularly in relation to large pulp mills. Mr MCGauran interjecting",13
48,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Gippsland!,13
49,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It failed because of petty politicking by the Leader of the Opposition and his Party. The Opposition blocked the Bill, yet for months now in this House we have seen crocodile tears from the Leader of the Opposition about jobs. When he had the chance to have his Party vote in the Senate for thousands of jobs, he voted the legislation down. As late as 30 April 1992, on a matter of public importance about resource security, he said: This has particularly come to light in recent days as major government decisions go by and opportunities are lost, as in relation to resource to actually get genuine development in the form of a pulp mill in northern Tasmania; This is what he had the gall to say on 30 April. Mr Thckey Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I draw your attention to standing order 73. When the Prime Minister sits down",13
50,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourabie member for O'Connor will get to his point of order. Mr Thckey-I am; I have just drawn your attention to standing order 73, but the Prime Minister was still on his feet",14
51,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If the honourable member for O'Connor does not come to his point of order, I will deal with him. Mr Thckey-Standing order 73, which you should probably already know, says: No Member may reflect upon any vote of the House, except upon a motion that such vote be rescinded. Mr Speaker, I draw to your attention the fact that the Prime Minister is reflecting upon a vote of this House.",14
52,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I think the honourable member for O'Connor may have grievously insulted everybody in the chamber by suggesting that we might be the Senate!,14
53,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition, for petty reasons, wilfully, despicably, purposefully voted down resource legislation in the Senate, denying resource security to the forest products industries of this country and denying Tasmania, in particular, the pulp mill it needed. An article in the Hobart Mercury said: Tasmania's Liberal senators are ignoring the needs of all the major players, but when it comes to the crunch they seem ready to let down Tasmania by putting their Federal party before their State.",14

55,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Franklin!,14
56,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The gUilty senators are Senators Archer, Calvert, Newman, Walters and Watson. They are the guilty people who put the knife into Tasmania by knifing this legislation down, on the instructions of the security, Liberal Party room and the Leader of the Opposition.",14
57,Mr GOODLUCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That is only the newspaper.,14
58,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Premier of Tasmania, Mr Groom, had this to say: I have said this legislation should be supported. It is up to individual members how they vote, but I have spoken to the senators. I will not instruct the Liberal senators because they are not part of theÂ· State parliamentary Liberal Party, but I have spoken to everyone I can, from the Prime Minister to the Leader of the Opposition, to say the legislation should be passed.",14

63,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On 25 March, Mr Groom said: I have told Dr Hewson that in my view this has to be passed. There is no need for amendments. The Forest Minister in Tasmania, Mr Rundle, said he was: ... pleased Mr Keating agreed in Federal Parliament to change the title of the Bill. He added: There seems no reason why the legislation should not be passed. Mr Addis, from the Forest Industry Association of Tasmania",14
64,Mr GOODLUCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,He is a member of the Labor Party.,14
65,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He said: The Federal Opposition had the opportunity to put petty political posturing and point scoring ahead of job creation and investment. Hear, hear! Mr Addis went on to say: The Bill does offer something of substance. It does enable investment and job creation to get going. They said, 'We want it all now or nothing', and in my view that is unforgivable. Mr Ibbott, the Tasmania for the Future Chairman, said: Whilst it is agreed this legislation cannot provide everything for everyone, it at least provides support for industrial development. The facts are that if it is not supported now, with or without amendments, it is lost forever. Suggestions of an improved legislation being passed are purely supposition. They are the references from the Premier of Tasmania, the Forest Minister in Tasmania, Mr Rundle, and spokespersons for industrial groups. This piece of legislation has been wilfully and wantonly destroyed for no good reason. Mr Tim Fischer-By the left wing.",14

67,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,15
68,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,":-We put the Bill up, and for the lousiest, cheapest political reasons you have gone and defeated the thing in the Senate. Mr Rundle also said: I am disappointed in them and I am disappointed in the Goveff!.ment. Last week, as you know, we h-d a deal that had really almost been stitched up. Mr Tim Fischer-And you vetoed it.",15
69,Mr LLOYD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You reneged on it.,15
70,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Not what you were saying; what you were saying was that there was a deal stitched up.,15
71,Mr LLOYD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It was stitched up. Mr Smith interjecting,15
72,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Deputy Leader of the National Party! The honourable member for Bass!,15
73,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Rundle put the Deputy Leader of the National Party's weight right up: ... a deal that had really almost been stitched up. He said, 'almost stitched up'; there was no arrangement agreed. The one amendment the qpposition sought was to change the name of the Bill, which we agreed to. As the Tasmanian Minister said, that ought to be enough now for the coalition to vote for the legislation. But you went in there and cynically voted the thing down. The Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives said: What was on offer was some massive investment in Tasmania-and, indeed, Geelong and Melbourne. My colleague the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) and others would point out the parlous state of the Tasmanian economy, and the Government has walked away from $1.5 billion of possible investment in Tasmania; $6OOm of investment at Maryvale; and a potential $2 billion investment in south-east New South Wales and East Gippsland in Victoria. Knowing all that and despite all the bleating about jobs and development, all the crocodile tears, cynically, wilfully, wantonly, the Leader of the Opposition put resource security down and, with it, the interests of a pulp mill in Tasmania. He put down the interests of theÂ· Tasmanian people, a relatively small community in Australia by way of the State's relying upon large developments. He put asunder their interests for nothing more than grubby, shabby political motives. Resource Security",15
74,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Speaking of grubby, shabby political motives and selective quoting",15
75,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition will come to his question.,15
76,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to a recent story in the Age under the title 'Keating Stand Will Do Resources Bill', to an article in the Sydney Morning Herald entitled 'Keating Undermines Resource Law', and to a statement today by Chris Northover, Assistant Federal Secretary of the Forestry Division of the Construction, Forestry and Mining Employees Union, who said: Clearly, here is a situation where the radical Left forces in the Party, supported by the Prime Minister, have seized an opportunity to kill off a Bill they did not want. Does the Prime Minister. deny that he pulled the rug on this piece of legislation simply to honour a grubby political deal with the Left to save his political hide?",15
77,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting ,15
78,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The House will come to order. Members of the Opposition will cease interjecting.,15
79,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The demonstrable distortion and mistruth in that statement is simply that the people the Leader of the Opposition targets as being opponents of the legislation voted for it here in the House of Representatives. It passed the House of Representatives and went to the Senate. I have no greater authority than the Tasmanian Liberal Minister for Forests who said that he was pleased that the Government agreed to change the title of the Bill and could now see no reason why the legislation should not be passed. That was a simple thing. The Bill was constructed by the Government. It was passed through the House of Representatives. It was there on the Senate Notice Paper to be voted on, passed into legislation and proclaimed. It would have provided resource security for the regions of importance in terms of major forest product developments. You voted it down because you believe that you can do cynical things in here and go and do a cheap doorstop interview or give a quick kerbside radio interview and that people will confuse your position on these things. The fact is that you have been exposed for the opportunists that you are. You sought simply to embarrass the Government, to deny the legislation, but, in doing so, you have hurt this industry seriously and, as I said before, wilfully. You have hurt particularly those regions of New South Wales and Tasmania where resource security was an important factor in the development of large pulp mills. The Leader of the Opposition is always up talking about jobs. He could never create any when he was advising the former Government. He was happy to swan off into public life with double digit unemployment when we arrived in office in 1983, happy to put the 1.8 million jobs we created in the period in his pocket. He is up with crocodile tears but the moment you put up any test for him that is in any way difficult to vote for, for example, large numbers of jobs in very significant industries, it goes down. The fact is that simply no good when it comes to jobs and to the long term future of industrial development in Australia. Sugar Industry",15
80,Mr HULLS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Can the Minister advise the House whether he intends to meet soon with sugar industry leaders in order to discuss the future of the industry? Is he aware of an industry plan to increase the income of canegrowers by $8,000?",16
81,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Kennedy for his question. I will be meeting with the canegrowers' representatives this afternoon and I understand that they have already met this morning with the honourable member for Hinkler whom I have asked to chair an industry committee to develop an industry strategy. The reason for establishing this committee is that the canegrowers are but one dimension of the sugar industry, an important dimension, granted. But what we really need to do is to tackle the refiners and the millers as well as the manufacturers. This group will bring them together. Honourable members opposite as well as the canegrowers should have regard to the successful outcome in the dairy industry that has been applauded in rural sectors. It was achieved last week after I sat down over a number of months with the dairy industry to work out a plan for its future. As to the second part of the question, I am aware of suggestions made as recently as last week in this House _of a so-called $8,000 benefit for canegrowers. This was made by the Leader of the National Party when he got up in the Parliament and claimed to have been misrepresented because I had not completed a quote in relation to an interview he had with Laurie Oakes. The bit that was left out was to this effect: Cane growers also directly and indirectly will have a benefit of about $8,000 per cane growerby inference, if the GST package is introduced. The reason I did not go on to quote that was that had I done so I would have been guilty of misrepresenting the truth. he is The fact of the matter is that that $8,000 figure simply does not stand up. It is a figure that the Deputy Leader of the National Party has worked out on the back of an envelope by taking the Treasury's estimate of aggregate savings to the whole of the agriculture sector and dividing it by the number of farmers. The problem is that the number of farmers is wrong by ABARE's own analysis. The ABARE survey excludes all farms below a $20,000 per year cash value output. In other words, to start with, it excludes about 30,000 to 40,000 fanns, an additional one-third more than is used in his calculation. In addition to that, the figure that he into from the Treasury document does not include just fanners in the agriculture sector; it includes forestry, fisheries and hunting. Not only do we have a position in which the number of fanns is wrong, but the figure itself in relation to the fann sector is also wrong. The $8,000 is' an absolute fiction. Mr Lloyd interjecting",16
82,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Deputy Leader of the National Party will cease interjecting.,17
83,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Again it comes to the point that, whenever the National Party gets itself into strife, it will say anything to extricate itself. The other point that ought to be .noted is that the very Treasury document that the Deputy Leader of the National Party used to do the calculations, which his Leader has blindly followed, also says that 60 per cent of small businesses and fanners will be worse off. In addition, our own calculations suggest that, for every one per cent increase in inflation, the cost to the fann sector, not just to the canegrowers, will go up by $1,200 per fann. I tell you what: it is a great package! Why is it that those opposite deliberately misrepresent this position? The reason is simple: the coalition, and the National Party in particular, will do anything and say anything to preserve the coalition unity. They will do it at any cost because the National Party leadership has detennined that its most . effective means for winning government is to prop up the coalition at any cost. You have not been taken seriously by the Liberal Party. You were not included in the process of industry development that is contained in Fightba-k. For the benefit of anyone who needs a quote in tenns of where the Liberal Party sees the National Party, the honourable member for Bennelong as recently as 4 May in an interview V{ith Michelle Grattan said: The National Party has nowhere to go but be in coalition. What do you really stand for? You have effectively sold out and you represent no effective voice in this chamber for the rural constituency which you claim to represent. That selling out has already led to tensions divides within the National Party, with one resignation to date and a split within the National Party that is put between 10 : 9 and, giving it its best focus, 11 : 8. That is a great outcome for what you were calling for in remembrance of the great icons of your Party and the Party you have built. You have split it. You represent no-one. Mr L1oyd- Mr Speaker, are you going to let that go on after last Thursday?",17

87,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I warn the Deputy Leader of the National Party.,17
88,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will just report on an interview on Statewide on the ABC between Peter Gooch and the Leader of the National Party last week. The record of the interview states: GOOCH: But staying with the zero tariff point though-isn't that the aim of Fightback? To eliminate tariffs altogether by the year 2000. FISCHER: It is not. It is to lower it to negligible levels. GOOCH: What does that mean? FISCHER: It means as high as 5%, it depends on exchange rates and commodity prices, the extent of the differences involved, but it puts if you like a degree of flexibility in our package which is' also over a period. GOOCH: So you're really taking the Labor line which... they're much the same, too, they would negotiate on tariffs. You're saying that Fightback would negotiate on tariffs. FISCHER: No. We're saying Fightback's objective has never been clearly understood. Its objective is negligible levels. It is not a zero only tariff policy. I think if that had been better understood before this last monthThen the interviewer cut you off and said: It just sounds a little slippery, you know, because people listening in, people would be wondering where are those tariffs going with the Opposition. Well may they wonder. That is why the canegrowers are down talking to us todaybecause we are prepared to develop a strategy. We are not prepared to blindly follow the Industry Commission and eliminate tariffs. You have lost the opportunity to represent them, and you deserve to lose it. Resource Security",17

111,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"when it came to the test to pass a reasonable piece of legislation into law, he failed it for shabby political reasons. No doubt he is embarrassed; no doubt he is squirming; no doubt he is slithering around over there about the issue. But the fact of the matter is that no recital of development sites, potential or otherwise, will remove the fact that the Liberal Party, at his behest, downed that Bill in the Senate last night, and he has responsibility for it in Tasmania to the forest industries and to all the people who have put so much effort into that-the Minister included-over a very long period. There is no point in going on about the three mines policy. There is no point whatsoever. Mr Reith-Why not?",18
112,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,One of the principal reasons why the Pancontinental site was not developed was for exactly the same reason that the former coalition government did not develop it-it is in the middle of a flood plain. It is as simple as that. Dr Bob Woods-You have to be joking.,18
113,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The fact is that the Leader of the Opposition downed this piece of law, and as a result he has knoc-ed the forest products industries back, and he has killed off a major pulp mill investment in Tasmania. He has got himself to blame for it. He can slip and slide and slither around, but nothing is going to change the fact that he had the chance to do the right thing last night, and failed the test. Industrial Disputes",19
114,Mr DUBOIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Can he advise the House about the current level of industrial disputes? Is there a relationship between the level of industrial disputes and the industrial relations policy pursued by the Government?,19
115,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I can infonn the House that the latest figures on industrial disputes are for January. They show the lowest number of working days lost since monthly records were first compiled 33 years ago. Dr Bob Woods-Nobody is in a job; they are scared.,19
116,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for Lowe will cease interjecting.,19
117,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Over the whole course of this Government, since April 1983, the monthly average of working days lost is less than half the average of working days lost under the previous Government. The accord has brought a zero inflation rate now and a 'commitment to low inflation outcomes for the future, together with the lowest level of industrial disputes on record. Today under the accord we are moving cooperatively to expand the coverage of enterprise bargaining and increase national savings, as I mentioned earlier in response to a question from the Leader of the Opposition about employmentbased superannuation. There has been more workplace refonn in Australia in the last two years than in the previous 20, and it continues. But if we contrast this with the announced policy of the OppositionMr Thckey- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I refer you to standing order 142 and the responsibilities of Ministers. It has become an absolute ploy of the Government to ask a very specific question as to the perfonnance of the Government. This House gets a 30-second answer on what the Government has done and up to five minutes on what the Opposition is supposed to do. The Prime Minister has apparently answered the question. He has even stopped reading from his own notes. He should therefore bring the answer to a conclusion at that point and let even some of his own back bench get on with answering some questions in this place.",19
118,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! We do not have backbenchers answer questions to start with. The Prime Minister has' been asked a question. The Prime Minister is answering the question. The Prime Minister is in order. Mr Thckey-But I was saying that,19

121,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The evolutionary change in the labour market under the accord under this Government has been so profound that we are now moving to a broad system of enterprise bargaining. In contrast to that, under what is called the 'big bang' approach of the Opposition-meaning big for disrupting the labour market and the inflation rate-the Opposition now pursues a policy to the effect that employers can refuse to accept Federal awards and there will be no compulsory arbitration to enforce them. We saw in today's Australian that the honourable member for Bennelong revealed that he wants not only to deny employees their entitlements under Federal awards but also to prevent them from seeking alternative entitlements under State awards; He wants to deprive six million people in this countryMr Andrews- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order understanding order 145.

But, no, what the Leader of the Opposition has in store is the most disruptive industrial relations policy that this country has ever seen. The big bang which those opposite referred to will be the big bang in relations between Australian it in employers and Australian employees as six million people in this country are deprived of their current legal entitlement to wages, leave, sick leave, redress against unfair dismissal-the lot. As the lot goes, those opposite expect to be able to sell to business this country that the election of a coalition me to government will see a better industrial relations climate, more conducive inflation rates, better productivityMr Crean interjecting Mr Howard interjecting",20

153,Mrs DARLING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Can the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services assure the House that the Government is committed to a system of child-care funding for Australian families which is fair and generous? Opposition members-Come on, Sid!",22
154,Mr STAPLES,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I assure the House and the people of Australia that this Government will continue to provide the fair and generous system as described by Senator Alston back in June last year, which is the fee relief system. The Government's child-care policy provides fee relief directly t9 those in the community who are least able<to afford childcare; that is, people on low and middle incomes. We will not countenance a system that benefits the wealthy, as the Opposition would put to us. What the Opposition is really on about is destroying the child-care system and the fee relief system. In today's Sydney Morning Herald, Senator Alston said that he refused to rule out the abolition of the present subsidy system. In other words, the Opposition will not commit itself to fee relief, which Senator Alston described as fair and generous and not too far wide of the mark. Yesterday on AM the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Flinders, said: We say in Fightback that we are interested in the Tax Institute of Australia's proposal which was a 20 per cent tax rebate on child care expenditure. but we're not wedded to that. So what are those opposite wedded to? They are not wedded to fee relief and they are not wedded to a tax rebate. We want to know what they are on about. It is no good their coming out and saying that they are going to give an extra $90m in increased funding to child-care. No-one in the community is going to be conned by those opposite putting in an extra $90m; they want to know who is going to get it. People on low incomes are not going to get it through tax rebates because they are not going to get the benefits of tax rebates as they do through fee relief now. People in the community want to know where that $90m is going to be spent. They have got an idea from the way those opposite behave in all their policy areas where that $90m will be spent: it will be spent on the wealthiest at the expense of low and middle income earners. The point is that the Opposition does not have a tax policy in relation to child-care that it is game to put out to the Australian community. As with its health care policy, it has great difficulty, day after day, year after year, in putting out a policy to the Australian people that they can see would benefit those on low and middle incomes-the ordinary Australian. It is not in a situation to do so. It is the same with the Opposition's health policy: it cannot cover the game and that is why it continues to avoid it, continues to obfuscate and say that it will not support the fee relief system and talks around tax rebates. We want to see where members of the Opposition are going to spend the money as do the people of Australia. Those opposite did not con them at the last election on childcare; they will not con them now. They cannot get away from that fact-as Senator Alston tried to get away from the fact yesterday in his press release when he quoted Treasury estimates-that Fightback will see a one-off rise in child-care fees of just 4.99 per cent. No-one is fooled by averages, not when it . . comes to the policies that comeÂ· from the Opposition. The redistribution and the regressivity of Fightback is the total issue in this whole child-care package. People will not be fooled by your proposals. The sooner you bring out your - hild-care policies so that people who are now enjoying the genuine fee relief system, which is fair and generous to people who need it the most, can see the regressivity of your proposals, the better. As the Leader of the Opposition said, the truth will always cut straight through. Minister for Transport and Communications",22
155,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister and refers to the flippant - nswer the Prime Minister gave to the question from the Leader of the National Party. In the light of Senator Richardson's admissions that he accepted a directorship while serving as a Cabinet Minister, that he failed to declare his directorship in the Register of Ministers' Interests, that he made a telephone call to a foreign head of state to rescue a relative on fraud charges, that he was interviewed by the Australian Federal Police about a corruption inquiry, and that he cruised the eastern suburbs of Sydney with a known criminal to determine 'how much $100,000 would buy', I ask: is the Prime Minister completely satisfied that the Minister for Transport and Communications is a man of complete integrity and that, given that you have accepted the Minister's explanations of his behaviour at face value, are you prepared to stand down when impropriety is established against the Minister?",23

As a former official of the Labor Party in New South Wales, and as all officials of any party know, the organisational issues which involve party secretaries and officials often lead to public debate. Over the years Opposition members have sought to attack him and to diminish his 'reputation, and none of them have succeeded. The remarks which Senator Richardson made, his assurances to me that he did not participate in any Cabinet discussions which could have affected the radio station in question, were entirely adequate in terms of any influence or conflict of interests which he may have had' potentially. In relation to his relative, I went into the detail of that last week. This is simply a device by the Opposition to again try to simply resurrect the issue when it knows there is no issue.

166,Mr GORMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Health, Housing and Community 'Services. Will the Minister inform the House as to the most recent indications of recovery in the housing sector? Are those trends likely to continue? Mr HOWEYesterday's figures for dwelling approvals show an increase of almost 7 per cent in March 1992 and put beyond any doubt recovery in the housing sector. These favourable results have been brought about by an achievement of the highest level of affordability since September 1985. That improvement inaffordability has come about for two reasons: firstly, that interest rates have fallen and many home purchasers can now obtain mortgages at rates around 9 per cent; and, secondly, and as importantly, the median price of first houses has fallen. Home buyers in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth are benefiting not just from falling interest rates but also from lower house prices. On a national basis, the median price of a first house fell from $118,700 in December to $114,200 in the March quarter. That reflects increasing activity at the lower end of the market. Mr Silberberg of the Housing Industry Association said: The reduction in the medium home price reflected an increase in sales at the lower priced end of the market. Reductions in home loan rates have increased dramatically borrowing capacity enabling more lower income and first home buyers purchase a home. It is this question of afford ability that sustaining the recovery in terms of the housing market. It reflects availability of lower cost housing and that, in turn, reflects the emphasis that the Government has placed on Green Street, the Australian model code for residential development. We are increasingly seeing developed estates that reflect afford ability as a prime concern. The Government will continue to work with the States to develop programs to reduce the cost of housing. Indeed, sustainability of recovery depends on sustaining affordability. But the difference with the Opposition is quite stark. This time when the news is for home buyers and builders, the Opposition continues with its plan to increase house prices. The Parliament is now familiar with the fact that the Opposition would force up the cost of new houses by about $3,000 come to order. through the imposition of a GST. In addition, it . would lift the costs of agents' and solicitors' fees and the cost of furnishing renovations through the GST. These price hikes would wipe out the gains made home buyers after the last six months.  affordability, Brian.",23

I think it, however, behoves the Opposition not to distort those answers or to quote selectively from them. . . The answers that were provided-a section of which was passed across the table during Question Time-go to a matter which was raised by Senator Alston, I think, in relation to the alleged employment impacts of the introduction of the superannuation guarantee levy. The relevant answer commences-this is not actually the answer that the Leader of the Opposition sought to table, because this more complete answer is not quite as helpful to the Opposition's caseDr Bob Woods-What is this, Leo?",25

The answer starts by quoting an allegation contained in the F-ghtback package that the employment consequences of the introduction of the superannuation scheme will be a job loss of 70,000. The Treasury goes on to say that this is on the basis that the cost of the superannuation scheme will be fully accounted for in real increased unit labour costs. The Treasury continues by saying what would happen if that were the case. It then goes on to say this assumption is totally unreasonable. Of course, this matter was not raisedMr Aldred- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order.

221,Mr SPEAKER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The Government's abysmal failure to maintain control of entry to Australia for permanent settlement. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their places",27
222,Mr SPEAKER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Before calling the honourable member for Dundas, I will say a few words. It has always been my view that one should not use the standing order about pre-empting debate to stop discussion. For that reason, I have allowed the honourable member's MPI, notwithstanding the fact that the first order of the day is the Migration Amendment Bill. I know the honourable member for Dundas will not canvass discussion on that Bill. I remind the House that other speakers in the debate should not costs, canvass discussion on that Bill. It has always been my view, and I would - xpect that my Deputy would take the same view while he is in the chair today, that that should not prevent a wide-ranging debate. on this matter.",27
223,Mr RUDDOCK,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," Mr Speaker, I am very conscious of the specific matters that are to be raised in the Migration Amendment Bill and I will not allude to them. The issue I wish to raise is the Government's failure to maintain control of entry to Australia for permanent settlement. The speci fic matter that I wish to canvass relates to the way in which Chinese students in Australia have been accommodated, espeCially by this Government, not only by decisions taken by the former Prime Minister and his Government but compounded by further statements made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) since that time. The concern of honourable members opposite who constitute the Labor Party's immigration committee suggested to me that this matter ought to be raised at this time. The committee chairman, the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), last night had the audacity to endorse the action of the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) in maintaining the integrity of Australia's immigration program, particularly the refugee component. The committee expressed concern that the integrity of the program was under public attack with calls for Cambodian boat people who have jumped the queue to be given residence in Australia, irrespective of the outcome of their applications for refugee status. The committee's statement said: Residence in Australia should not be granted merely because of delays in the processing of applications. It states further: ... such attempts imperil the rights of legitimate refugees living in camps and other conditions hardship overseas. These refugees are fleeing from persecution the hope for resettlement for these people depends on the integrity of the refugee jeopardised by the lowering of standards. When I read that comment, I said to myself, 'Hear, hear! The hQnourable member and his committee have it right'.Â· They are basic principles that are fundamental to immigration, as is the principle that the government of the day should have the right to detennine who shall, or shall not, be able to enter Australia and settle pennanently. Another fundamental principle is selecting applicants for immigration, immigration policy will not discriminate against applicants on the basis of their race, religion or country of origin. Every time those principles have been to one side, flawed entry arrangements have occurred. The undennining of the integrity our immigration process follows. It is the case that, when the Government abandoned that deCision in relation to the 20,000 or so Chinese students who were here in Australia at the time of the Tiananmen Square maswould be undertaken. sacre, that situation arose. It was a decision that was wrong when the then Prime Minister made it, and it is wrong now. Honourable members will know because I their have emphasised it time and time again-and I might say it was emphasised also by the former Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, Senator Robert Ray-that these matters should been dealt with on the basis of individual people and not detennined on class grounds. Individual merit should have been the basis upon which these matters were assessed. Senator Ray's remarks can be found in the Senate Hansard of June 1989. A case by case detennination of the claims of the students who were in Australia at that time should have occurred. It has been argued that so many were involved that it would not have been possible their to do that. Yet we know that today we have many more than that number making claims for refugee status in Australia and seeking protection. The Government has to accomof modate that. The Government is having to detennine those claims. Most of the people and who are here now making those claims would not be doing so were it not for the original process and can be decision. Mr FergusonOh, come on!",27
224,Mr RUDDOCK,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The Minister says, 'Oh, come on!'. I will come to that in a moment. Mr Hand-It was not me. It was someone up there. You want to get your ears cleaned. I never said, 'Come on!'; I said, 'Rubbish!'.",28
225,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The Minister should not interject that, in at all across the table.",28
226,Mr RUDDOCK,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I would not want to misrepresent the Minister in any way whatsoever, but it seemed very clear to me that the comment came from his direction. Regardless put of who made the point, it was wrong. The fact is that many of those students who were of here at that time were allowed to stay on, notwithstanding the. fact that they had never been subjected to nonnal migration criteria and were never subjected to the health checks and character checks that we would expect We know that many of the students were at that time illegal immigrants. Senator Ray revealed that up to 40 per cent had overstayed visas at that time. It was not as if it was without notice. We know from freedom of information requests obtained by my colleague the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) that when the honourable member have for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) was Minister he warned the then Prime Minister in March 1988 in relation to this question. In a letter'he said: My Department has for some time been aware of anecdotal evidence that some private overseas students, particularly those undertaking short-term English language courses . . . are abusing the student program for their own advantage. Data which had only recently become available supports that view. He gave examples: ... at the end of January 1988,28 percent of 1987 ELICOS student arrivals had not left Australia despite the expiry of their entry permits and are now overstayed by up to 10 months, in part because of persistent rumours that an amnesty for illegal immigrants might occur. The data indicate that the overstay rate is increasing, and is especially high for students, from the People's Republic of China and Korea. That overstay rate compares with an overstay rate of 1.5 percent for visitors to Australia. He went on to counsel the Government that it should change the rules in relation to that matter. The Government did not change the rules. The Tiananmen Square massacre occurred. Large numbers of students were here. The Government of the day gave them temporary entry arrangements in the form of a four-year temporary entry visa, and the Government later allowed their spouses and dependent children to join them here in Australia and, of course, provided a range of services and benefits for them and gave them permission to work. This severely compromised Australia's immigration program because every other group of people who might want to make claims for refugee status believes that it is entitled to the same sort of concessional arrangement because of that decision. The fact of the matter is that people from Fiji-and there were thousands of people here from Fiji-wanted to make those claims. There were many people here from the Middle East who were concerned about their situation, and they also wanted to make those sorts of claims. We now know that many Khmer boat people whose claims are being considered properly-I do not question that in any way, shape or form whatsoever; in fact, I have given the Minister encouragement to maintain the principal way of dealing with these issues and questions-now question the Government's bona fides in relation to that and say that, notwithstanding the proper processing and its outcome, they ought to be able to stay on the same basis on which the Chinese students were allowed to stay. That decision was so flawed that it undermined this Government's integrity in terms of consistently applying the principles of refugee determination. At every turn the Government is faced with this argument because it did not make the right decision at the time of the Tiananmen Square event. But the Government had the opportunity after that, and particularly after the lessons that were learned by the way in which that matter was dealt with, to correct the situation. It was in a position to make it clear to the Chinese students that, at the end of the four-year temporary entry period, the Government would revert, properly, to determining these matters case by case on the basis of a person's need for protection. We saw what happened to the refugee program generally when of the order of 25,000 students were allowed into Australia after the Tiananrnen Square event, under what this Government loosely termed pipeline processing arrangements. Their bona fides were never checked because the Government was somewhat concerned about the demonstrations that were occurring in China at the time. One would have thought that, having then experienced about 17,000 of those people making claims for refugee status and effectively ensuring that the Government cannot deal with these matters without a substantial additional resourcing of the refugee determination process, without having to consider the framework of law under which these matters are determined, and without having to consider the additional cost to the Australian taxpayers-and I am reliably informed that, if we look at all of the areas associated with refugees, including the Chinese students, it will have cost the Australian taxpayer over half a billion dollars, three times more than the amount of money we want to allocate over time to deal with the black deaths in custody issue-this Government would have learned its lesson. I was particularly concerned, I might say, and it was a major matter of concern to my colleagues in the Opposition, when, in the aftermath of all of those events, the Government through the Prime Minister wrote to a Chinese language newspaper-not in the form of a press release to the Australian people generally through the mainstream media, but in a specific letter to a specific language newspaper, the Chinese New Migrants Magazine-indicating that he wanted to clarify the Government's policy on Chinese nationals in Australia, to put at rest concerns that might have been generated by the Opposition, concerns that might have been generated by me. I have been making it very clear that the Opposition is of the view, in relation to the Chinese nationals in Australia at that time, that if they had a continuing need for protection, substantiated by refugee type claims, of course they would continue to have that protection, but it would have to be substantiated. If they were able to make claims under the ordinary immigration criteria that any other applicant was able to make and which is consistently applied, suchÂ· as spouse grounds or occupational grounds, of course they ought to be allowed to apply for a grant of resident status. If they cannot substantiate claims for protection or apply on the same basis as anybody else for permanent residency, then our expectation is that in 1994 they should leave Australia. The Prime Minister went on to say: The Labor Government has made it clear that Chinese nationals in Australia on 20 June 1989 not be required to return to China against their willin other words, the Prime Minister made a selective announcement in the Chinese New Migrants Magazine that those students who had been granted the temporary entry permits until 1994 would not be required to return to China against their willunless they had seriously breached Australian law. He goes on to say: After 30 June 1994, subject to a need for ongoing protection, places in the immigration program and conditions in China, pennanent residence or extended temporary stay will be available to those reluctant to leave. Chinese nationals who arrived after 20 June are subject to the same non-discriminatory criteria as other temporary residents to Australia if they apply for pennanent residence or refugee status. So the same rules that apply to anybody else would apply to the post-Tiananmen Square students or nationals. But if they were those who were the subject of the special Hawke deal, they were still to be treated differently. This does not occur for any other group of nationals. When it occurred in relation to the Lebanese community, they were extensions of time of a limited duration, and the Minister brought them to an end, and those who were still here at that time had to go; in relation to the Sri Lankans, they are still of limited duration; and in relation to those from Yugoslavia, they are still of limited duration. This Government has put in place a flawed decision and it has been compounded by the actions of this Prime Minister. It puts at risk the very basis upon which we can continue to control immigration and refugee determination in this country. If the Government does not change it and does not walk away from this announcement by the Prime Minister, then the national interest is very severely compromised. That is why, in the light of the statements made by honourable members opposite, we have brought home to them once again their failure in this regard, and we are giving them an opportunity to put the matter right by fresh announcements at this time. (TIme expired)",28
227,Mr HAND,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Melbourne-Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic will Affairs) (3.29 p.m.)-I suppose responding to this matter of public importance had to occur because of the number of press releases being put out by the shadow Minister for immigration and ethnic affairs, the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), over a long period. The current Prime Minister (Mr Keating) reinforced the decision of the Government as announced by the previous Prime Minister in the correspondence to the journal that the shadow Minister talked about. I do not walk away from that at all. I am a member of this Government. I am bound, like all members on this side, by the decisions of this Government. Let me say a few things about this decision. We hear the shadow Minister talking about what ought to happen here, et cetera, but when it comes to other countries he has a slightly different view of what ought to occur. I will address that in a few minutes. Let us restate the policy. The decision was made and the Prime Minister's letter to the editor said nothing new. It did no more or less than restate the policy announced by the Government on 27 June 1990. What will happen at the end of that four-year period? I invite honourable members to go back and look at the press statement that was issued by the Prime Minister at that time. It is quite clear that there is no automatic permanency for anybody at the end of the four years because the status of people at the end of that period will depend on conditions in China. People from the PRC who were in Australia on 20 June 1989 will have to apply for either a temporary entry permit or, depending on the circumstances in China, as referred td in the second paragraph of the Hawke statement, and subject to places in the migration program, a permanent resident's permit. Such applications will have to be-and I am surprised the shadow Minister does not seem to be able to grasp this-handled case by case. That is the only way we can do it unless we have a new computer system which spits out a bulk lot. All applicants will have to satisfy certain criteria and be found a category within the permanent component of our intake. It is not right to say that X ber.of Chinese people resident in Australia at this point in time who were here in June 1989 will automatically be granted permanent residency in 1994-that is just not true. Mr Ruddock-Nobody will be returned against their will.",30
228,Mr HAND,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I will deal with that. I ask honourable members to reflect on Tiananmen Square. I can remember Tiananmen Square because I was nearly knocked off the platform in the Melbourne Town Hall by an array of State and Federal members of the Liberal Party wanting' to get up to the microphone to tell everybody how dreadful it was and how these people had to be looked after. They were joined by a whole array of peopleleaders of the business community, trade union officials and all political partiesmaking statements about what ought to happen to these people. Let us not forget that. Let us not forget the comments made by the shadow Minister with regard to what ought to happen in other countries. I take the honourable member's mind back to comments that he made on 5 January 1990 at a Vietnamese function. His press release stated: Philip Ruddock, Shadow Minister for Immigration & Ethnic Affairs, today suggested that the United Kingdom Government should rethink its policy on forced return of Vietnamese boat people from Hong Kong. It is all right to get on the grand speaking circuit and go around the other communities and say, 'It is dreadful what they are doing to your people in Hong Kong and return them to Vietnam'. The shadow Minister can offer advice to everybody else, particularly when he is at a Vietnamese function and he wants to get a big clap and a big cheer from the mob when he leaves. That is different. I ask honourable members here, as I have asked before: who in Australia wanted to return the Chinese at the time of the Tiananmen Square massacre? There were not too many people. I invite the shadow Minister to look at the editorials and at what was said by members of his own Party. The problem with immigration is that everybody is an expert, including the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MACKellar) and the honourable num- member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding), two former immigration Ministers. Everybody has a million ideas about what is the best thing to do. They are on both sides of the Parliament, I might add, something particularly clear to me because those honourable members used to occupy my seat. The problem with immigration is that too often people make a quick statement such as that. The honourable member cannot lecture Hong Kong about it being wrong to send people home to Vietnam and then say in this Parliament that it is good enough to send home people who most people here in the Australian community said were deserving of protection. I ask him again to read that statement. It refers to having to pass normal health and character checks. The honourable member mentioned character checks. Let us go back to the 1970s, to what the Liberal Party policy was in terms of boat people. Let us go back to the thorough examination case by case that those opposite implemented then. I can say to them that it was not very thorough; I have had a look at what they did and it was not very thorough. Those opposite think it is okay to throw stones at this side of the Parliament today. But it is a double-edged sword. The honourable member talked about people and independence. All long term temporary entry residents are entitled to bring their dependants here. Everybody else does. The honourable member knows that. He is deputy chairman of the parliamentary committee that constantly berates me with reports about what ought to be done on immigration. The honourable member for Dundas and the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), between them, have seen more witnesses than most other people in the history of the Parliament. Those people are entitled to bring their spouses and their children here. It happens for everyone else. But they have not been given permanency. Those opposite have to be serious about this. They have tried to score a cheap point at my expense about the way I have been trying to address the intake and the current dilemma that we have with the large number of people in the queue. The honourable member and I have no disagreement about the people in the queue and case by case. We agree totally on that and we agree totally on the stance I am taking with the Cambodians and anybody else who is in that situation. I am grateful level of support that he has given me on this issue and other issues that will be discussed in this place later today; I appreciate it. But I have to differ with the honourable member for Dundas on this. I repeat that, if he looks at the statement, he will see that there is no automatic permanent residence for people; so it is wrong to allude to that. It is a fact that they ought not to be sent home against their will. The honourable member can shake his head; but there is a significant difference in immigration law on that point and he well knows it. That is the difference in the position that we are putting. The situation is a very difficult one. I reject the argument that the honourable member has put that that decision has jeopardised our immigration program. I think a number of factors led to the large number of people here. The honourable member has touched on some of them perhaps. But there was a combination of events. There was Tiananmen Square; there were a large number of people here at the time; and of course, there was the subject matter raised in the letter from the honourable member from Melbourne Ports to which the honourable member for Dundas alluded. There was a combination of events, so it is not correct to say that the single point that brought about this so-called dilemma was the announcement. . I went to that meeting in the Melbourne Town Hall, and I think the honourable member for Calwell may have been there as well. It was a very moving ceremony, with some tO,OOO or so people present. I remember the editorials the next day. I point out that at the time when the decision was made and the extension by Senator Robert Ray given, to which the honourable member referred, a press release from the honourable member on 8 December 1989 stated: The Shadow Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Philip Ruddock, today welcomed the announcement by the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, Senator Robert Ray, to extend the temporary entry arrangements for Chinese students now in Australia. So those opposite allowed them to be extended to a point where the situation for most of those students was in fact quite a different for that situation from most others. Mr Ruddock-It was a very short extension.",31
229,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The honourable member for Dundas should not interject.,32
230,Mr HAND,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,At that point the honourable member was still caught up in the emotion of the whole damn nation; that is the trouble. Hawke was not alone in terms of emotion. The honourable member supported an extension for these people to stay here at the same time. Mr Ruddock interjecting,32
231,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! honourable member for Dundas!,33
232,Mr HAND,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I put to the honourable member that the whole nation was caught up in emotion on this issue; there was clear emotional involvement-and that goes for both sides of the Parliament. So it does the honourable member no good to come in here today and try to score a cheap political point-one that he has been doing for quite some time-on this issue. Every time we have attempted to strengthen and improve the processing, I have been bagged by some dogooding organisation for taking a stance to protect the interests of this nation. Instead of getting a back-up, I have got a shaft in the ribs from the honourable member about the Tiananmen Square students. It is about time that those opposite accepted the fact that people on both sides of politics were concerned and expressed grave concerns for the safety of these people being forced back to China; they should accept that as a fact. I put it to those opposite that if they the statement, they will see that it goes into the point about conditions that will apply in China in 1994. It says that. Clearly, if the conditions have improved in China in 1994, of course we will not forcibly send anybody home; but there is a hell of a difference between temporary entry and permanent residence. Most people interested in immigration understand that point. The other interesting point was that when the student delegations came to see me in this place, they put a very strong point to me: they ,did not want to be forced into a permanent residency situation because, as the overwhelming majority of them said, once things settled down in China, they were going to go home. They said it to other members in this Parliament too, and it has been reported in the media. I can only act on decisions that have been made by goveinment, as can the honourable member for Dundas if ever he is of enough force to have this position. By God, if he is, I will tell him one thing: I will watch every move he makes! I will be faxing him little pieces of advice from my hideaway in the hills when I depart this place. I will be in The constant contact with his office, advising him on how he should do things. I do not want to walk away from things, but I will endeavour to ensure that the Tiananmen Square people who were here on 20 June 1989 comply fully with the statement that was made at the time the then Prime Minister announced it in the following year. It does not mean automatic permanency. I tell those opposite that they will not divert me, by constantly raising this issue, from the job at hand, which is to ensure that when I leave this job we have by far and away the best refugee processing system in the world-if we do not have it now. But it certainly will be much stronger ,in the coming months than it has been, and the honourable member for Dundas and I are going to have dialogue about that. . I say to those opposite that I do not think we are under threat; we are not, and those read opposite know that. We are standing firm in saying that those who arrived post-Tiananmen Square will be dealt with case by case, so we are on track there, and the others, pre-Tiananmen Square, if they are after permanency, will also be dealt with case by case .. That is what h-s to happen. It is a natural consequence of the way in which immigration works. So those opposite are wrong to suggest that some sort of bulk granting of permanent residency is going to be issued to these people when they know quite clearly that that is not the case. I take their point, if I am totally honestand I try to be-that this was a particular dilemma for the Government at the time, and it also has caused other people to say, - Well, what about us?'. I am currently the Minister for Immigration, and while I am the Minister and where I have power over the processes, everybody will be treated equally, totally and utterly equally, with no favouring of one group or another. At the same time, however, I support the letter by the current Prime Minister to the Chinese community because I think that if we go back to the .emotions that were on hand at the time and reflect on that, and the decision his seat. that was made, we will realise that it would be a very cruel act to renege on the decision as announced on 27 June 1990 by then Prime Minister Hawke.

242,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The point. Minist-r should not interject.,34
243,Mr FILING,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The Minister's policies are becoming the laughing-stock of the region, and the Australian community is red-hot angry at the farcical processes that are being presented as the administration of those policies. Let us look at the specific case of the Chinese students who were' here before the Tiananmen Square massacre. In June 1989, 20,000 Chinese students in Australia were given four-year temporary visas to stay-to remain. This decision to grant those visas was virtually a unilateral decision of an emotionally influenced Prime Minister who, in one fell swoop, corrupted the immigration program of this country. As my colleague the honourable member for Dundas has mentioned, none of the usual checks were made, as these people were then temporary students studying the English language within Australia. This year about 14,000 dependants are expected to join the students in Australia; so we have a situation of about 34,000 people being involved. Of course, social security and other benefits were extended as a consequence. I put it to the Minister that this decision-:this emotion-ridden decision by the former Prime Minister, compounded by the present Prime Minister (Mr Keatingr-has very strongly militated against the community support for our refugee and humanitarian program. Furthermore, it has acted to encourage the belief that the due process of assessment on a case. by case basis can be circumvented at the whim of an emotionridden Prime Minister or through the calculated application of political pressure on his party. I say 'Prime Minister' without specifying whether it was the old one' or the new one, because they seem to be equally flexible on this issue. My colleague the honourable member' for Dundas mentioned a largely unsung article that was published in the April edition of New Migrants Magazine when Prime Minister , Keating made certain comments.' I would like to repeat those comments, which read: The Labor Government has made it clear that Chinese nationals in Australia on 20 June 1989 will not be required to return to China against their unless they have seriously breached Australian law. After 30 June 1994, subject to a need for ongoing protection, places in the immigration program lind conditions in .China, permanent residence or extended temporary stay will be available to those reluctant to ,leave. In other words, Prime Minister No. 2 has compounded the original 'emotion-ridden decision of Prime Minister No. 1 to destroy the remaining equity, credibility and morality of Australia's refugee and humanitarian program. In reality it is another deal, another sort of shabby abuse of power, another deal which unfortunately the Government-dominated as it is. by the New South Wales right wing of the Labor Party-has as its principal modus operandi. Here is the man who portrays himself as hard-headed, a decision-maker, firm, unswayed, who is going to bring a hardheaded, non-emotional perspective to the immigration issue. And at the first sign of pressure Prime Minister Keating caved in. In an effort to ingratiate himself with the Australhm Chinese community, he has brought the final haniiner down on the integrity of the Government's refugee and immigration program. He has put sectional interests above those of his nation. As I mentioned, it is in the same genre as the Kirribilli conspiracy; it is an effort to pander to one section of the community; it is typical of the Labor Government's general approach to policy-making in the current era. He has endorsed what many have said: it was bad policy. He has repeated bad policy by compounding it and by committing his Government to repeating it. The Prime Minister has put, his own Minister in an impossible position. I must say that the Minister has not done a bad job himself on that score. i would just like to refer to a couple of references from interviews with the Minister, in particular on 20 January on PM, when the Minister was asked: And yet the. fact that' there are 23,000 refugee applicants in Australia, at the moment, and another 56 have arrived, would indicate, would lend weight to the O'pposition's claim that the system is out of control. GERRY HAND: The system's not out of control. The system is absolutely on course-the system. will The number of people who are applying to that system has been created primarily by events in China-Tiananmen Square where people were affected by activities. there which resulted in the Government's decision to allow a number to stay. Subsequent to that, a number of Chinese people have lodged applications where they claim that they mayor may not be affected by those events there, too. I would like to contrast those comments with the comments made by the Minister to Paul Lyneham on the 7.30 Report: PAUL LYNEHAM: Meanwhile, though, you've got a . heck of a backlog, haven't you, from those who've arrived in ... ? GERRY HAND: Yes, a backlog which is really comprised of one group of people who found themselves here. . . PAUL LYNEHAM: The Chinese. GERRY HAND: The Chinese group that came after Tiananmen Square. I mean, everybody knows that. I mean, that backlog is being addressed and it's certainly created an enormous bubble in the process; but we have international obligations, obligations.... So, we oughtn't be spooked by it into something .. to do something stupid because that will have worse consequences. PAUL LYNEHAM: And by spooked, you mean starting to talk seriously about sending large numbers of them home? GERRY HAND: Well, start to take .. no, no, no, no, because people have to understand .. what I'm saying: to do something to shortcut the circus .. the circuit and to make a mistake legally, which could bring about the wrong result. What I'm saying is you stick to the process, you do, it as quickly as you possibly can ... PAUL LYNEHAM: Which can be' three or four years in some cases. GERRY HAND: Well, it won't be. It won't be. It has been and that's what I'm saying. I think that maybe I wasn't as tough. In my endeavours to be fair with the boat people in particular, I think that .. I mightn't have been .. I might have been played for a bitof a dill, perhaps. PAUL LYNEHAM: I never thought of you as a softie, Gerry Hand. Mr Hand-I tried to be fair; is that a crime?",34
244,Mr FILING,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"If that is the case, and the Minister has been played for a bit of a dill, where does that put the Prime Minister following his statement about the situation of those Chinese students who appear to have the prospect of being allowed to stay at the end of the four years, subject to their keeping their noses clean? The situation in China will apparently become one of those conditions. Of course, their dependants will also presumably be allowed to stay in Australia. The Government has lost control of entry to Australia. It has abdicated its authority with ephemeral and changing circumstances surrounding particular groups seeking residence in Australia. I ask: how does this best serve our community; how does it best serve the interests of those who genuinely seek asylum in Australia from political oppression or the rigours of warfare and destruction overseas? It is an inconsistent, even corrupted program, in the system of assessment; which delivers a compelling message to all those in the region aspiring to come to Australia via the refugee program: 'Whatever you do, get into Australia; and if you are able to stay long enough, the political leaders will eventually legal buckle and let you stay'. Where is the compassion in that sort of policy? What sort of message is that to those languishing in the refugee camps of South East Asia, patiently waiting their tum in the queue? What a cruel ravaging of the expectations of those who come and are then later sent back. (Time expired)",36
245,Mrs CROSIO,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Prospect) (3.56 p.m.)When this matter of public importance appeared on the agenda today I was very intrigued. I thought that the Opposition was finally going to acknowledge some of the changes to the immigration policy since this Government has been in power. But when I came into the House, what did I have to listen to? The shadow Minister for immigration and that ethnic affairs, the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), talked about the Chinese students, a statement that was made by a previous Prime Minister two years ago, on 27Â·June 1990, which all honourable members in this House would have to agree is even a bit old for the shadow Minister to start bringing forward to the House as a matter of public importance. I mean, it took two years for him to get permission from the coalition to raise this as a matter of public importance in this Parliament. Then we had the misinformation supplied by him and the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing). When the honourable member for Moore rose to his feet I thought he was going to speak to Â·the matter of public importance and acknowledge the changes that have occurred in the migration legislation since 1983, and particularly the changes that have been undertaken since 1990 by the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand). We did not have that. The honourable member for Moore made great to do about a television program on which the Minister appeared. Of course, the honourable member for Moore did not want to talk to us about the orderly immigration processing of persons who arrive in Australia, introduced by this Minister. The honourable member for Moore and the honourable member for Dundas did not want to talk about the complete restructuring of the immigration program. They did not want to bring into account that it was this statement. Government which updated all the migration categories. They did not want to mention to the Parliament that it was this Government that introduced the points test. They failed mention to the Parliament that it was this Government which set up an inquiry into the business migration program. I remind the honourable member for Dundas and the honourable member for Moore, who cowardly left this House in a hurry, with his cohorts, that immigration is about people, and legislation must be flexible if it is going to have up to date changes to meet the problems we experience on a day to day basis. No other Minister in the history of the immigration laws has looked at the problems associated with updating the immigration laws as they now exist in this country. Let us look at some of the things that have recently changed. Let us look at the introduction of a two-year conditional residence criterion for the grant of permanent residence on the basis of marriage, de facto or interdependency relationship-again amended by ,our Minister. Let us look at the provision of residency for those who, whilst in a genuine marriage or a de facto relationship, have become victims of domestic violence-that is in the regulations. Let us also look at the changes to the policy covering the entry of those students and further scrutiny of those students whose bona fides require testing. Let us also look at the amendments that have now proviQed the power to the Minister to limit the number of applications which may be considered within a specified class of visa or entry permit. Let us also look at the amendments to the Migration Act with regard to the new health charges on certain applications. Let us look at the amendments to the merit review provisions to extend and clarify the period allowable for applications for such reviews to be made. There was no comment on any of the above. All we heard was a statement that was put out by a previous Prime Minister on 27 June 1990 that was responded to by the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in regard to the existing policy. Nothing new was stated; nothing new was injected into that All of a sudden we had before the House a matter of public importance quoting the Government's abysmal failure to maintain to control of entry to Australia for permanent settlement. Nothing new was stated about the review of legislation dealing with migration in all Western countries that is occurring on a day in, day out basis. That was not brought before the House. As far as migration and immigration is concerned, the Opposition has no policy. It mentions very faintly in its Fightback package that Dr Hewson wants a substantial reduction in the migration intake in the short term. We do not know what the - substantial ' means. We have heard figures which vary from 50,000 to 70,000. We have not had qualified for us what the short term is. So the Opposition, to cover its inefficiency and its inadequacies as far as migration is concerned, has to come up with a motion such as this as a matter of public importance. The Opposition has to refer to a statement that was made two years ago. It has to refer to a letter that the present Prime Minister supplied which reiterates that statement and the policy of this Government. It does not want to refer to its Fightback package where it indicates that marked cut in programs. It does not want to refer to the intake of skills categories that it wants to have reduced, because it does not know how it is going to achieve that. It certainly has not informed the public at large how it is going to be done. It does not want to have elaborated that its Fightback program denies welfare benefits to new arrivals for a two year qualifying period. It does not want to have elaborated the fact that all of its migration programs are made on the run with no due consideration to the long term ramifications. They are made with no consideration of the present populations, and they are certainly made with no consideration of what it will mean to people, and especially the reuniting of families throughout the world. All we have is what the present Prime Minister stated in a previous statement. I believe that it is also time for this House to hear that it was the Labor Government which began in 1983 which was responsive to the needs of the people throughout our world who had fled their countries after having suffered abuse of their human rights or various forms of discrimination, prosecution and persecution. In this time, it is our Government's refugee and special humanitarian resettlement programs which have provided the opportunity for thousands of people to resettle in Australia free of such discrimination. The Government has also provided humanitarian resettlement to the victims of disturbances, inter-communal conflict and civil war, not only in areas as diverse as Indo-China, Poland and Sri Lanka, but also in Afghanistan and countries in Central and South America. Once migrants are in Australia, our Government does not forget them; rather, it helps them to resettle. Let us look at the programs that this Government has introduced in the resettlement of those people. We also acknowledge, since the Labor Government came into power federally, that we have increased the emphasis on economic migration. This is centred around a more tightly integrated economic immigration policy with the Government's major macro-economic and micro-economic reform packages. The National Office of Overseas Skills Recognition was established to promote national standards for skill recognition, to encourage competency based assessments, to develop counselling and referral services, and to promote improvements to occupational regulations. There have been many reports into immigration over the last 10 years. In one particular report in 1988 a committee advised on Australia's immigration policies. The Government looked into and reformed the way in which overseas skills were treated in Australia. Skills is a category that the Opposition continually reiterates we need to have more of. What it does not keep bringing into debates on immigration is the fact that, if immigration levels were to stay at the present percentage, the population born overseas in the year 2031 would be 20 per cent, which is a little below the present 22 per cent. While migration requires additional investment in productive capital and infrastructure, in the long run an expanding population historically has increased economic output in similar proportion and has therefore provided the broad capacity to fund infrastructure and investment. The Opposition never brings that before the House. It also has not brought before the House a report of the Bureau of Immigration Research which was released in 1991. It stated: With the exception of those from Lebanon and Vietnam, immigrants of working age are less likely to receive a pension or benefit than their Australian born counterparts. As well, the value of overseas pensions paid to immigrants in Australia is almost double that of Australian pensions paid overseas. These results do not confirm the opinion sometimes expressed that immigrants are over-users of the social security system. We do not hear that before the House. Since I have been elected as a Federal member of parliament, all we have had as a debate on immigration, which came before this House as a matter of public importance, is a referral to a reference of a statement made nearly two years ago. Why, I ask the honourable member for Dundas, the honourable member for Moore and particularly the coalition, did it take it this long, if it had a concern with that statement, to bring it before this Parliament. It has had opportunities day in and day out. It was not only gutlessMr Ruddock-It is obvious you haven't been listening to the debate.",36

250,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The the application. debate has concluded. MIGRATION AMENDMENT BILL 1992 original Second Reading,39
251,Mr HAND,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Melbourne-Minister for section Immigration, Local GQvernment and Ethnic Affair.s)(4.06 p.m.)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill makes changes to the merit review system established as part of the major amendments of the Migration Act in 1989. The changes are designed to enhance position of the applicants for review. The Bill also increases penalties in the Act in line with Commonwealth criminal law policy and makes a number of other minor amendments. The Government, in 1989, established a two-tier merits review system of certain decisions under the Migration Act. The first tier is the Migration Internal Review Office (MIRO). The second tier is the Immigration Review Tribunal (IRT) which is an indepenquence dent external review agency. As I noted in House of Representatives on 17 April 1991 the objectives of the review system continue to be achieved. That is to say, the review system provides independent review which fair, just, economical, infonnal and Further legislative changes have been made to enhance the review system and I refer honourable members to the Migration penalties Amendment Act 1991 which introduced a Act. number of important changes. This Bill will make two further changes to review system. Firstly, the Bill will clarify the matters which may be considered by MIRO or the IRT when reviewing an assessment under section 30 of the Act. Section 30 provides for an assessment to be made of an applicant's qualifications with points awarded for each qualification as prescribed the Migration Regulations. It is a criterion for the grant of some visas that the applicant more than a specified number of is points when assessed under section 30. At to present the Act does not indicate whether and MIRO or the IRT are required to consider of changes to the Migration regulations, prescribing points for qualifications, which occur subsequent to the original decision on It is possible that the points awarded for a paI1icular qualification may increase or decrease in the period between the decision and the review stage. The Bill will insert a new section 121A into the Act which will provide that points under 30 are to be assessed by MIRO and the IRT in accordance with the regulations in force at the time of the original decision. However, if the regulations prescribing points and qualifications which are in force at the time of the review will 'Iead to a more favourable outcome for the applicant, those the regulations will apply instead. The second change to the review system which will be effected by this Bill is a technical amendment to ensure that illegal entrants who may be invited by the IRT to lodge an application for an entry pennit under section 121 are not prevented from doing so by section 37. Section 37 is designed to prevent illegal entrants from delaying their departure from Australia by lodging a seof applications for entry pennits. That the section was not intended, contrary to what one construction of the language might indicate, to prevent illegal entrants from lodging an application when invited to do so is by a review authority. Section 37 will quick. therefore be amended accordingly. I turn now to the issue of the level of provided for offences created by the Honourable members will appreciate that the Migration Act creates a number of criminal offences dealing with such matters as illegal entry to Australia, obstruction of officers, and escaping from custody. In line with the Government's determination to reduce the number of illegal entrants in Australia, the penalties provided in the Act have recently been reviewed. The pecuniary penalties, provided as an alternative to imprisonment,Â· were found to be below the levels now considered appropriate in terms of Commonwealth criminal law policy. That policy is expressed in section 4B(2) of the Crimes Act 1914 and 'provides that maximum pecuniary penalties are to be determined in accordance with a formula whereby six months of imprisonment equates to $3,000. For example, the offence of escaping from custody in section 171 of the Act currently has a penalty of $5,000 or imprisonment for two years or both. These are, of course, the maximum penalties which a court may impose. Under the proposed amendment the penalty set out in the Migration Act will b- 1\,,:""0 years imprisonment. However, apphcahon of the, formula in section 4B(2) of the Crimes Act-$3,000 per six months of imprisonment-will increase the maximum pecuniary penalty from $5,000 to $12,000. The offences in the Migration Act ,which will not be subject to, the formula in section 4B(2) of the Crimes Act are those where no imprisonment option is provided. The majority of those penalties will also' be increased to maintain relativity with the penalties derived under section 4B(2). In addition I should mention those offences relating to the arranging of non-genuine relationships for the purpose of securing permanent residence in Australia. Persons who arrange contrived relationships to defeat Australia's migration laws will risk penalties of $100,000 or 10 years imprisonment or both. These penalties were introduced recently in the Migration Amendment Bill (No.2) 1991 and reflect the need for a more substantial deterrent in this area than would be provided by the application of the section 4B(2) formula. The BiUwill also introduce a number of other less significant, but nonetheless impor"": tant, amendments to the Migration Act to which I will make brief reference. References to powers of arrest will be removed from sections 92 and 93 and from a number of related sections to ensure that no confusion arises between the powers under the Act to take persons into what might be termed 'migration custody' and the power to arrest persons for criminal offences. Officers who exercise powers under the Migration - ct to take persons into custody do so for specIfic purposes under the Migration Act related to migration processing and/or removal from Australia. Those powers are, therefore, not subject to the restrictions set out in the Crimes Act 1914 which apply to the power to arrest persons for criminal offences. However, to make this distinction absolutely clear the term 'arrest' has been removed from a number of sections of the Act and replaced with the term 'detain in custody-. I will now deal with the proposed amendments to section 20 of the Act. Section 20 identifies a number of matters which would result in a person becoming an illegal entrant unless those matters are disclosed in a notice under section 20. For example, a , person suffering from a prescribed disease or a prescribed physical or mentalÂ· condition must disclose that fact in a section 20 notice. Ifa visa or entry permit is subsequently granted to the person who has made the required disclosure that visa or entry permit ., must be endorsed with a statement that the person is recognised to be a person to whom section 20 applies. In other words a person who has, for example, a prescribed disease, must have that fact acknowledged on their visa or entry permit. . The migration regulations currently permit the endorsement to be in the form of a code recognisable only by departmental officers. Despite this, the requirement for an endorsement can cause embarrassment or offence to some persons. The proposed amendment will provide that the obligation to endorse the visa or entry permit will be satisfied if the information is recorded in a departmental database. A number of other minor technical amendments will be made by the Bill. These are explained adequately in the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. I now wish to foreshadow major Government amendments to the Bill which I will move during the committee stage. The Government is conscious of the extraordinary nature of the measures which will be implemented by the amendment aimed at boat people. I believe it is crucial that all persons who come to Australia without prior authorisation not be released into the community. Their release would undermine the Government's strategy for determining their refugee status or entry claims. Indeed, I believe it is vital to Australia that this be prevented as far as possible. The Government is determined that a clear signal be sent that migration to Australia may not be achieved by simply arriving in this country and expecting to be allowed into the community. Australia will, of course, continue to honour its statutory and international obligations as it always has done. Any claims made by these people will be fully and fairly considered .under the available processes, and any persons found to qualify for Australia's protection will be allowed to enter. Until the process is complete, however, Australia cannot afford to allow unauthorised boat arrivals to simply move into the community. The Government has no wish to keep people in custody indefinitely and I could not expect the Parliament to support such a suggestion. 1I0nourable members will note that the amendment calls for custody for a limited period. The period provided for in the amendment is 273 days-this translates into nine months. This period is, however, restricted to that time where consideration of a person's claims is directly within the control of my Department. Where factors are outside . the control of my Department, the period is suspended. For example, where it is up to the applicant to provide information relevant to a claim, the time taken to provide that information would not be included in the period. Honourable members will understand that although under optimum conditions new procedures allow for the processing of border claimat:tts in about two months, there is at present no guarantee that the process cannot be delayed. It would be a concern if that could occur. The amendment provides the incentive for the parties involved in the process not to embark on tactics calculated to delay the final processing of claims. For its part, the Government has no desire to keep these people in custody longer than necessary and would prefer that a proper decision is made as quickly as possible. Indeed, it has acted throughout this process with the aim of expediting the finalisation of cases. Mr Deputy Speaker, honourable members, if a claimant's application for refugee status or entry is refused he. or she will have to leave Australia. The Department will be under an obligation to effect removal as soon as practicable. This will, of course, always depend on the time it takes to make the appropriate arrangements with the receiving country to properly effect removal. The most important aspect of this legislation is that it provides that a court cannot interfere with the period of custody. I repeat: the most important aspect of this legislation is that it provides that a court cannot interfere with the period of custody. No law other than the Constitution will have any impact on it. The amendment provides that those boat people already in Australia will be in the new custody from the date this Bill receives the royal assent. In other words, the 273 days will commence on that date. For those unauthorised boat people who arrive in Australia between 27 April and 1 December this year, custody will start when the person is detained. The 273 days will star): on the day that the detainee makes an application. The formula for suspending the period applies once the 273-day period starts. Designated persons not in custody on the date of royal assent may be detained without warrant and kept in custody. This will mean that persons who have escaped from custody since arriving in Australia and those who may have been released from custody must be taken back into custody. In those cases the 273 days will start to run on the day they are taken back into custody. The existing rights and status of a person in other respects of the Migration Act will be unaffected. I might say, in closing, that this legislation is only intended to be an interim measure. The present proposal refers principally to a detention regime for a specific class of persons. As such it is designed to address only the pressing requirements of the current situation. However, I acknowledge that it is necessary for wider consideration to be given to such basic issues as entry, detention and removal of certain non-citizens. It is my intention shortly to recommend to Ministers ""a comprehensive program of legislative amendment to ensure that our immigration law is the best mechanism to deal with current migration issues and needs. The program is being designed in close consultation with the Attorney-General's Department. It will be the result of careful and extended consideration of those issues and needs. I also point out to the House that it is my intention to liaise with the shadow Minister through that process of developing these proposals. I think that this is an issue where we can work towards a bipartisan approach. Mr Beale interjecting",39
252,Mr HAND,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I would expect you to make that comment, but not the shadow Minister. Accordingly, I intend to recommend amendments to the Act to, among other things, simplify and clarify the applicable law in relation to provisions governing the entry, detention and removal from Australia of noncitizens. I hope, for example, to address the present complexities of the current powers in the Act to detain non-citizens. Such a revised scheme will be of significant benefit to those responsible for administering our migration law, as well as to those subject to it, in terms of simplicity, clarity and fairness. I am also contemplating amendments to codify aspects of the process of review of refugee determination. I commend the Bill to the House and I p""resent the explanatory memorandum to the Bill.",42
253,Mr RUDDOCK,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"My comments in relation to the Migration Amendment Bill will be in three parts: I will address the Bill as originally introduced in the Senate and as introduced by the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) today; the amendments the Minister has foreshadowed-the stopgap measures that we are intending to deal with as part of this legislation; and the foreshadowed approach to dealing with the longer term problems. I move the following amendment to the Bill: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House deplores the Government's failure to reconstruct the immigration program to more accurately reflect the current needs of the national economy and to deliver a program that is in the long term interests of Australia"". Mr Hand-What does that mean?",42
254,Mr RUDDOCK,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The Minister will find out. This motion will be seconded later in the debate. Mr Hand-You support this. You have told me you support it.,42
255,Mr RUDDOCK,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am very supportive of the efforts that have been announced specifically, but, like many of these things, they just do not go far enough or quickly enough. It is a matter of some regret that, even though we sometimes draw these matters to the attention of Government members over long periods, they suddenly seem to forget that and come into the House and try to suggest that some two or three years later we are somewhat belatedly raising an issue. I want to make it very clear that a number of other things can be done, and should be done, and I encourage the Minister to undertake them as additional steps. I am always supportive and always helpful. The Bill introduces minor policy and technical amendments to the Migration Act. These amendments clarify the regulations a review authority is to have regard to in a review of a points assessment under section 30 of the Act; distinguish the power to detain a person under sections 92 and 93 of the Act from the power of arrest in the Crimes (Investigation of Commonwealth Offences) Amendment Act 1991; increase certain penalties under the Act in line with Commonwealth criminal law policy and allow consistent application of pecuniary penalties under the Crimes Act; provide that where an endorsement is recorded in a notified database, that will satisfy the obligation to endorse a an entry permit where this is a requirement under subsections 20(4) or (5); and ensure that illegal entrants are not further prevented by section 37 from making a further application, within the period allowed by the Act. The matters which were the purport of the original Bill introduced and passed in the Senate, subject to certain minor amendments, and introduced into this House today, meet with no objection from the Opposition. In relation to the amendments the Minister foreshadowed today in his second reading speech, which he will introduce later, the Opposition is very conscious that there are some 389 boat people in detention around Australia under the current provisions of the Migration Act. There are also, in contemplation, others who may arrive in Australian territorial waters seeking to enter Australia without proper and adequate documentation obtained in advance. Under the current provisions of the Migration Act, it is possible that the courts can release people into the community before any claims that. I might be making for protectionare considered or before any entry permit might be granted to a person in accordance with the law. It is our view that no court should have 'the authority to undertake the release of people into the community contrary to the express wish of the Parliament, expressed in the Migration Act, as to the basis upon which entry permits will be granted. In other words, having eliminated any discretion from Ministers and ourselves, subject to only two specific sections in the Act, I and my ,colleagues do not believe that any other body should operate'under its discretion or inherent powerS to, release people irito the cOmIliunity contrary to the law. It is a fact that the law in this area is complex and difficult. Detainees can be held under section 88 of the Act, which deals with those who have been arrested at sea and brought ashore by Australian authorities as prohibited entrants, or under section 92, which deals with those people who have landed without adequate documentation and who are otherwise illegal entrants and are visa or taken into custody after their arrival. In relation to each of those cases, there is a quite complex range of law which applies differently in each case and does lead to confusion. The confusion does suggest that there are reasons in relation to that aspect of it for the law to be reformed in this area. The amendments that the Minister has foreshadowed are designed to provide for continued detention of all current detainees, and those who might arrive at a later date, while this legislation is in operation. Such people will be held in custody under those provisions for a period of nine months. They have to prosecute any claims they might have for protection as refugees, and they have to do so expeditiously. If they fail to prosecute those matters, or fail to get evidence that is available, the time-frame in which they can be kept will, in effect, stop and the time will run from when they have done all they have to do. The time limits per se are only limits as against the Government and its authorities. The 'legislation is to provide that a court, except the High Court under its inherent power in relation to habeas corpus, cannot release people who are held in custody under these arrangements. But I am sure the court would have regard to the Parliament's wishes in relation to the way in which these matters are to proceed. I think the Minister would acknowledge that this legislation is seen as tough. I imagine it will not be unchallenged, but I think it needs to be clearly understood that it has the very strong support of the Opposition. We are of the view that the current powers of arrest and the basis on which people are detained are sufficiently cumbersome, outdated and silent as to leave doubt in the minds of some as to whether or not people held in custody can continue to be so held. If that is a weakness, it needs to be cured. This legislation is designed to cure that. It is clear from the terms of the legislation that it in no way alters the obligations we have to offer protection to genuine refugees, as defined by the UN conventions and protocols. The legislation specifically notes that those rights are not affected. The fact is, however, that along with other countries we have seen a very. significant increase in asylum claims over the last decade. As was heard in the earlier discussion-I hold the Government accountable for much of this-the fact is that we are having to deal with an increase in claims for refugee status from just on 500 claims a year toÂ· something of the order of 23,000. Although we have no land borders and are not subjected to the same pressures that are placed on other countries such as eastern Europe or the Americas, we are particularly vulnerable, particularly with new and modern navigational aids, to an increasing number of people seeking to make the journey here by sea. lf people who are held in custody are released from custody and seek not to be found, their location and removal can be extraordinarily difficult and costly. I have not seen an update of any figures recently, but I imagine they are much higher than the figure I was last given by Senator Ray some four or five years ago, which suggested that it costs in the order of $9,000 a head to find and apprehend people who are illegals and to arrange for their removal, if that is appropriate. It is clear that the Parliament, as is stated the proposed amendments, is entitled to form a view that people who enter Australia without adequate documentation are to be held in custody. I make it very clear that for those reasons the Opposition is strongly supportive of the amendments that the Minister has foreshadowed. We will facilitate the passage of the legislation to ensure that those provisions will be able to operate as soon as it is possible for the Bill to be proclaimed. I want to make something very clear, however, in relation to the third matter which the Minister dealt with-his foreshadowed further amendments. I said those matters were of a stopgap character and that there was still a great deal more to be done in: relation to the handling of refugee issues generally. The Minister says that these amendments are designed to address only very pressing requirements of the current situation. I want to make it clear that there are urgent, pressing and outstanding matters upon which we in the Opposition have consistently offered comments, and which I will talk to the Minister about. But I will emphasise over and over again the matters that I have put clearly on the public record. I refer to the backlog of over 23,000 applications for refugee status, which is unconscionable in terms of the national interest. It leads to a situation in which people believe that all they have to do is lodge an application and the Government will not be able to process it in a timely fashion. In such a way, they will be able to remain here and argue that they have been absorbed into the Australian community and never removed. I have not seen expressed any realistic timeframes as to the extent to which resources that have been applied to this task will enable these matters to be processed through all stages. I know that there are arguments about processing people's applications through the first stage, which has been given priority but, unless they are processed through all stages, control has not been established. Unless the Minister is able to guarantee that he is able to deal with these matters through all stages in within a reasonable time-frame, we have lost control. That is the bottom line, and that is why these matters need to be emphasised over and over again until we are prepared to put in place the arrangements. I make it very clear on behalf of the Opposition that as we have cooperated in relation to the matters that are being dealt with now, if the Government is prepared to take up our additional suggestions in relation to providing a requirement for people who have manifestly unfounded claims to have to obtain leave to access the further review procedures in the RSIC, the Government will have our cooperation in putting in place such arrangements. The Administrative Review Council has said that leave would not be an inappropriate provision to put in place, and other specialist advisers in this area have similarly commented. If we have several tiers of consideration and allow every case to access second and later tiers, further delay arises. Under the traditional arrangements under which Australia has operated these matters have been dealt with administratively. In addition, people can seek judicial review. Under judicial review, there is the possibility of three further stages: a judge at single instance; the Full Court of the Federal Court; and, if people get leave, the High Court of Australia. Certainly, the Opposition recognises that the High Court cannot be denied. Provisions under the Constitution enable it to exercise original jurisdiction. But we are certainly of the view that the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act, as it extends to this area"" of immigration law, ought to be amended to exclude this area. That is a matter which ought to be dealt with by this Government, and a matter upon which, if the Government is so inclined to move, it shall have our support. With respect to the area of staffing and priorities, I regard the crisis that we now face as of such severity that the Government should be prepared to free up all staff from any other area of activity, where that is possible, so that they can be involved in this assessment process. The backlog is such that if it is not reasonably and quickly handled we will remain at risk. I want to deal with the amendment that I have moved. The Minister asked, 'What does it mean?'. Earlier I spoke about the Government's inability to control entry to Australia. The issues that I want to address under this amendment are quite separate and distinct. They relate to the present immigration ""program, which has been the subject of very considerable criticism from a whole range of sources. I know that the Government is reviewing the program at this time, and I want to put on the record some of the views that we have expressed, again to be helpful and to give the Government some assistance in the way in which it might like to deal with these matters. I just mention to the Minister in relation to these matters that the Government has had a great deal of comment from the National Population Council, the Auditor-General and the departments of Treasury, Social Security and Finance. Mr Hand-Why don't you wait till next week when I announce the program? Then we can have a debate on it.",42
256,Mr RUDDOCK,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I do not know when the Minister is proposing to announce any program. Mr Hand-You've got no ideas, no figures, no nothing! Every time you're asked, you say, 'I don't know. I haven't made my mind up'.",45
257,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Mr Dubois)Order! The Minister is out of order.,45
258,Mr RUDDOCK,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I appreciate the Minister's sensitivity in relation to these matters. I simply make the observation that I certainly was not aware that any announcements were impending. But I welcome the development, as indicated by the Minister, that he will be making some announcements on the program next week. The Government's program has been the subject of very widespread criticism because it does not meet the needs of the national economy. Clearly, it does not have the support of the Australian people, and I suggest that is one of the reasons the Government will be moving to change its policy in this regard. In the middle of the worse recession in 60 years, it is clear that the Australian economy cannot sustain a large influx of new migrants. There are budgetary .constraints which mean that settlement. services are being cut back and that they are unable to meet the present needs. We have a backlog of some 60,000 to 70,000 people with few English language skills who would like to access such courses. They are already here and unable to do so. We have a program at the moment that is still delivering an outcome of a large number of low skill, non-English speaking migrants who will find it extraordinarily difficult to find meaningful employment in the present sustained and rather dreadful recession that we have suffered. Of course, when these people come to Australia they constitute a significant drain on very limited resources. It is not generally known or understood that it was this Government that took the decision to allow those people who were previously allowed entry on a generally relaxed basis in comparison with any other applicants to access welfare benefits without family members having to give assurances of support as they used to in the past. That means that when family members do not have to give those assurances, their brothers and sisters and nephews and nieces continue to seek entry and upon arrival they are immediately eligible for benefits. Mr Hand-They were never policed, and you know it.",45
259,Mr RUDDOCK,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I understand that they were never policed under this Government. The fact is that, whether they were policed or not, it had a very significant impact upon the shape of the immigration program in the past, because the program itself used to adjust to the economic circumstances. This is the first time that this country, period of recession, has had a program that has held up in the way in which it has. The reason that it has not fallen off, as it did in the past, is that the skills testing that goes is not related to the labour market. That was a decision taken by the Minister and his colleagues. Access to benefits has been liberalised by the Minister and his colleagues, to the point where people who would not be able to access benefits in their home country seek to come here knowing that they are eligible immediately. We do not argue that cutting the program will reduce unemployment; we have never expressed that view. We do not want to make migrants scapegoats, but we do believe that, in the context of the worse recession in over 60 years, we cannot absorb large numbers of migrants in the way in which this Government has insisted that we do in this recession. In previous recessions we saw the program come off very significantly. I have given those figures before. I simply note that one of the Government's own publications says that in the 1984 recession the program was reduced from a proposed program of 90,000 to 62,000 in recognition of a tight labour market and . reduced interest among people to migrate here. That reduced interest was in the concessional family categories, in particular. We in the Opposition have made the point that there are a number of decisions that can be taken by the Government to ensure that the program more effectively reflects the national interest. We have emphasised the importance of ensuring that testing of bona fides is properly carried out in those areas which are demand driven. Those areas include the preferential family stream, where we believe it is quite appropriate for the Government to introduce concessional migrant entry in the same way as concessional migrant entry is granted for people who, on spouse or de facto grounds, seek a change in status in Australia on the basis of their relationship with an Australian. Those coming from overseas could be put to the same requirement. In my view that would significantly test those who enter into marriage or de facto relationships purely in a for the purpose of migration entry. We think it is important that the testing of bona fides be conscientiously carried out in the area of employment nomination. That is on another area in which it is possible for people to try to manipulate criteria to establish entry where otherwise a person would not be eligible. In relation to eligibility for benefits, we have made it very clear that it is part of the Fightback package proposals that, save for refugees and those in the humanitarian stream, we would not provide benefits unless there had been a marked change in circumstances. That period of exclusion would be two years. The Opposition has made it very clear that in the area of concessional entry for family members who are accepted under the points testing arrangements, some testing of their English language competency is appropriate. Such testing already occurs in relation to skilled entry. We do not believe that it is inappropriate for such testing to occur in this area. In relation to skills testing, we think it is certainly very appropriate that that ought to be made relevant to the labour market requirements here in Australia. We have put these views strongly over time in a positive and constructive way with a view to helping the Government make the reductions that we believeÂ· are absolutely necessary and in the national interest. It is certainly our view that if we look at past periods of recession we will find some guidance as to the size of the program that Australia has had. Never in a period of recession of very much less severity than this one have we had programs that have exceeded 70,000 net as an outcome. On the basis of past experience and on the basis of the advice that the Government has had from its own specialist advisers-the National Population Council, the Auditor-General, the Department of Finance, the Treasury and the Department of Social Security-and from members of the Government's own back bench, there is very good reason why these adjustments should be made. The Minister said that he could not understand what our amendment was about. It is clearly intended to allow us to put on the public record the position that we believe ought to be taken in these matters, and, as always in this area, our comments are intended to be helpful and constructive. When the Minister wants advice, I am always willing and available.",46
260,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! Is the amendment seconded? Mr MACKellar-I second the amendment.,47
261,Mr CAMPBELL,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I would like to commend the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) for standing firm on the issue of the Cambodian and Chinese boat people. I know that this has been done in the face of considerable pressure from so-called humanitarian groups and sleazy lawyers who have made immigration matters their specialty. These people have not been short of bleeding-heart media support. While we are talking about bleeding-heart support, I will just deal briefly with the Opposition's amendment. In my view, it is an attempt to grandstand. If the Opposition is serious, it ought to be putting forward very firm proposals on what it will do with immigration, which clearly needs to be cut dramatically. I think that what the Opposition is about was demonstrated by its Leader (Dr Hewson) when he was very unfairly attacked by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on the ground of racism. There is nothing racist at all about what the Leader of the Opposition was saying. It was quite a scurrilous attack. In defending himself, the Leader of the Opposition said, 'Of course, when the economy improves we will vastly increase immigration'. He then added, 'If we don't, somebody else will do it for us'. So those opposite would not only vastly increase immigration, they would also give away Australia's sovereignty, which is something I thought we had invested heavily in with the FIlls, purchased by the Liberal Party, to defend our national sovereignty... That statement was one of the most unctuous, deplorable statements I have heard. It does indicate that over time the Liberal Party has historically been the party of high immigration. It is true that in recent times the Labor Party, too, has been led astray. However, historically, the Liberal Party has been the high immigration party. I am hoping that sense will prevail in the Labor Party and that we will get back to our genuine roots. Anyone who takes the time to look past his or her nose and into the so-called refugee issue will realise that the whole thing is a rort. I commend the increased penalties announced in this Migration Amendment Bill, especially those relating to immigration agents who arrange false marriages in order to facilitate legal immigration. These agents who rort the system in this and other ways are the scum of the earth. They do not give a damn about this country or its best interests; all they care about is a quick buck, and they are never slow to claim humanitarian motives. I acknowledge that under the present Minister, steps are being taken to subject these immigration agents to much closer scrutiny, but I believe much more can be done-and should be done quickly. I will return to the way that these people manipulate the industry in a moment. I have no objection to the proposed amendment to section 20 of the Act regarding diseases, so long as the health of the host co-munity is adequately protected. The information on diseases of migrants must not be allowed to just sit in some immigration department database if it is likely to impact on the local community. Information must be passed on to the relevant Commonwealth and particularly State authorities. The inquiries of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations of March this year into conditional entry made it clear that important medical information has not been passed on by the Immigration Department to the relevant State authorities. Health monitoring has been compromised as a result. I stress again that the Immigration Department must ensure that information regarding diseases is promptly passed on to the relevant authorities. I must say that the inquiries of the Joint Standing Committee were welcome, if belated. Stephen Rimmer, in his. book The Cost Multiculturalism, pointed out health screening problems, particularly in relation B and tuberculosis, in the middle of last year. I also put a question to the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services Howe) on notice at the same time. It is that the health of the host community been placed under threat in the past, largely, I believe, out of fear of being branded racist if stricter health screening and subsequent rejections had been enforced. This is only of the ways that Australian governments have been gutless in regard to immigration matters. They have placed the health of the people they are charged to protect under threat for motives that were, at the very least, very questionable. It may be that in future years a Commonwealth government will find itself under a legal claim from locals who have contracted an imported disease because of inadequate screening procedures. If that is so, it will be because of what has hllPpened in the last few years. Australians of the future will have to pay for the negligence of today in this and in so many other ways as far as immigration is concerned. Further in regard to this amendment Bill, I would state that any move to streamline administrative procedures, so long as quality is not adversely affected, is very welcome. I would go considerably further; I would speed the process of review by having only one tier of review, rather than two as at present. This should be an administrative review. The combination of administrative review and legal review that we have at present is causing undue delay and compromising the entire review process. It allows for rorts in the system to be continued. It clearly does not serve the best interests of the great majority of people of Australia. As much as possible we must get lawyers out of the immigration process. They have a vested interest in delaying and clogging up the system. I say give claimants one chance at review, and one only. We have no obligation at all to give them two goes. Government also has no right to waste public money in this way. Our absurd review process of has only come about because governments have caved into pressure from the imto hepatitis migration industry. As for the immigration industry in general, I recently gave a speech in Sydney to a group (Mr of immigration industry members, and I clear would like to share some of it with the has House. At that conference I put them on notice. I said that it was my intention to help knock their snouts out of the public trough, to continue to bring the facts on immigration to one light and to act as a representative of the Australian people's wishes on immigration. That, I said, was what democracy was supvery posed to be about. I continued: In Australia immigration policy has come to be linked with and largely driven by the policy of multiculturalism. In theory the two were supposed to be very separate, and immigration Ministers and other people tell you that they are. Anyone who has eyes to see will see that this is not so. It is ironic that the loud mouthed multiculturalists of Australia continually try to impose their values on other countries and lecture them in preaching tolerance and understanding in this country. In regard to other countries, they alternate between selfrighteous moralising and cringingappeasement-a contemptible combination. These are the very people who infest the universities and the bureaucracies and influence government. They tell us what we must be. They give us no choice in the matter. They do not really believe in democracy, yet they lecture other countries with no history or culture of democracy, telling them that they must be democratic. In Australia they also tell us that we are part Asia. That the great majority of Australians do not believe it is of no concern to them. We are Australians, happy to get on with being Australian and happy to get on with Asian countries. We do not take kindly to social engineering. We are ourselves, and proud of it, and not something that the elite would have us be. But I can assure this House that the Australian people are running out of patience. They will defend their culture and their country even against their own government, if need be. Both the Government and the Opposition should take very careful note of this. The rush to this new Australia is in large part driven by gUilt about the Australia of past. Guilt was never the basis for a sensible clear-headed policy, but it permeates our current immigration policy and attitudes to Asia. Each one of the guilt-ridden policies has been imposed from above. Multiculturalism, which was foreshadowed in the Whitlam Government by Al Grassby, was adopted as official policy in the late 1970s by the Fraser Government which followed. The Australian people were never asked. All sorts of high-sounding words were used to describe the policy of multiculturalism. No, one is denying that equality of opportunity is a noble ideal, but this has merely become a 'show. Multiculturalism is a corrupt policy in practice. It was introduced to appease select ethnic groups which claimed to represent their broader community-although there is no evidence that they ever did so. Even as a vote-buying exercise there is no evidence that multiculturalism has been a success. The policy has promoted and enriched individuals and vested interests. It has corrupted academic study and government policy, particularly immigration policy. Anyone interested in this subject should read Stephen Rimmer's excellent book The Cost of Multiculturalism and his paper on the same subject which I published under the Kalgoorlie Press title. After funding these groups-and it was mainly Italians and Greeks-the Fraser Government then found. itself under pressure from these groups to of fundamentally change immigration policy in a way that would bring more Greeks and Italians to Australia. In 1979 the immigration Minister of the day, Ian Macphee, introduced a family reunion category for which those groups had been calling. In opposition the ALP had also pushed for such a change, and in th- late 1970s had established an exclusive Greekspeaking branch in Victoria in the battle over the so-called ethnic vote. However, for all the claims that these groups represented a widespread demand in their communities, very few Greek and Italian people took advantage of the new category ,to bring out relatives. More British people took advantage of it, but the big users of the new category the were Asians. So Asian immigration increased considerably as an unintended consequence of the appeasement of Greek and Italian pressure groups. It was not until the mid-1980s that the social engineers saw the potential of such immigration and developed a deliberate policy of Asianisation. It was justified as a way of linking in with the region and increasing our trade with Asia. But as the multiculturalist lobby power grew, such things as English language testing were relaxed. This had nothing to do with what was best for the country. As a result, large numbers of unskilled people with little or no English were accepted. How they would help improve our trade with Asia, particularly when many of them were unemployed, was never explained. It is interesting to note that trade with Hong Kong has gone down over this period, and not up. The immigration industry continues to grow, and to understand its influence we have to look at and understand the network. We now have the Office of Multicultural Affairs-OMA-within the Prime Minister's Department. It was established there by Bob Hawke in 1985, and its staff were vetted by the Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils of Australia-FECCA-which itself depends on government funding. The first head of OMA was the academic adviser to FECCA, Dr Peter Shergold. He is now the head of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. I will return to this connection later. OMA acts as a propaganda unit for the policy of multiculturalism and requires all departments to submit to its discipline on so called 'access and equity' requirements. Increasil)gly, it is working, closely with the Bureau of Immigration Research, the Immigration Department's own propaganda unit, which was established under the Hawke Government in 1988. Both of these organisations are assisted in their aims by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, particularly through Commissioner Irene Moss, whose specialty is racial discrimination. She was largely responsible for a report into racist violence in Australia which only targeted those white Australians whose forebears arrived here before the Second World War, and others of basically 'Anglo-Celtic' descent, No consideration was given to inter-ethnic violence between migrant groups, which is a far bigger problem in Australia. Moss began with the intention of documenting racist violence against Asians by whites, but did not find enough to justify her inquiry. So she turned to relations between whites and Aboriginals. The bulk of her report turns on this aspect and largely duplicates the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, which was already under way. Incidentally, the Royal Commission was agreed to in 1988, the Bicentennial year, when the Hawke Government feared that Aboriginal groups might disrupt the celebrations. In the previous years there had been considerable publicity given to a number of Aboriginal deaths in custody. It was widely believed that far more Aboriginals died in custody than whites. In fact, it was soon discovered that proportionally more whites died in custOdy than blacksnot only numerically, but proportionally. This, of course, did not stop the Royal Commission. Both the Moss report and the Royal Commission have been used by professional multiculturalists to press for increases in their own powers and the power of bureaucracies. As far as Aboriginal affairs goes, Aboriginal activist Gary Foley has remarked that what Nugget Coombs said in 1974-that about three-quarters of Aboriginal affairs money goes to. white bureaucrats-still holds good, although a lot of these white bureaucrats have now been joined by what I would term professional Aboriginals. So the multiculturalists and their bureaucracies use Aboriginals to expand their own empires and have for some time wanted. to make Aboriginal affairs part of their empire. Although this has met considerable hostility from Aboriginals, the appointment of the former head of OMA, Dr Peter Shergold, to head ATSIC shows that they have at least been partly successful. The Moss report and the report on black deaths in custody have been repeatedly referred to as reasons why restrictive racial vilification legislation should be introduced. Both of these reports basically revolved at all around Aboriginals, but they are used to justify the expansion of bureaucracies which have nothing to do with Aboriginals. That is just the excuse. The Law Reform Commission, headed by Justice EHzabeth Evatt, is also in the process of making recommendations which would compromise the integrity of our legal system in order to take account of so-called multicultural considerations. Her draft report recommends an increased role for all the old favourites-the Office of Multicultural Affairs, the Bureau of Immigration Research and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. Very cosy indeed. It gives us an idea of how the network operates and how each group supports the other getting increased powers. . There are also State anti-discrimination boards which act in a similar manner. In the universities there are a number of immigration and multicultural units which chum out propaganda and act as power bases for the policy and the immigration program. They also act as watchdogs within the universities. Churches also fund their own similar bodies which link in with the network. There are strong connections, for instance, between the Catholic social justice unit and the trendy of the Australian Labor Party. At the fringes are a host of other groups which get government funding and are connected with the multiculturalism/immigration industry. There are also private sector immigration agents and lawyers with a vested interest in maintaining high immigration. The industry is very well connected to the media and has no problem in getting its viewpoint across. It gives honourable members some idea of the power of the lobby and its potential to influence immigration policy. Anybody who seriously wants to understand immigration policy in Australia should closely study the immigration industry and see how it uses its influence. To pretend that the Government has progressed with the national interest as its sole criteria, as the Economist magazine has done, is quite farcical. These groups have a vested interest in maintaining high immigration, whatever the economic circumstances. With our money they actively work against the adoption of an immigration policy which will serve the best interests of the nation. The honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), head of the Caucus immigration and ethnic affairs committee and head of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations, is one of the specialists in this area. He has put forward a proposal for immigration zones which is .clearly designed to give more weight to immigration from southern and eastern Europe. This has been pushed once again by Greek and Italian professional ethnics. It is ironic that, in spite of all the influence they have exerted, they still think that the immigration program works against them. It is also ironic that vested interest groups need a cover to push their own demands. One migrant pressure group, in order to get what it wants and appear non-discriminatory, has to allow other migrants from different groups to come in under the same category; Quite often these migrant groups have no time for eachÂ· other. So immigration appeasement is a blunt instrument. If the Government gives into one group, it faces demands and potential Left demands from others and so offers im. migration concessions to them. The result is that we import conflicts from abroad and our policy of multiculturalism encourages them to continue. To many of these people, Australia is just a funding base rather than a country which they should identify with. In fact, there was a nice irony which came to light recently regarding inter-ethnic rivalry. Recently Greek and Italian pressure groups claimed that they were being discriminated against by SBS radio programming which gave less weight to their programs. The vast bulk of these people can speak English, so such programs are mainly a status symbol. But it was - heir pressures which changed the immigration policy and allowed many of the more recent migrants to come here in the first place. Now they feel they are being pushed aside by the very people whose entry they facilitated. And they now complain that they are being discriminated against once more. What a farce!Â· The Government numbers man in the Senate, the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Richardson), in his usual manner was very quick to attempt to appease the protesters by offering another radio band. This is the way that governments have proceeded when it comes to multiculturalism and immigration. In short, the history of both major political parties in recent times has been gutless. The Prime Minister has recently assured Chinese pressure groups that 20,000 Chinese students allowed to stay in Australia after the Tiananmen Square massacre will be granted residence. Mr Hawke }lad tearfully assured them that they would not be sent back to China against their will, although there is little doubt that there was not one genuine refugee amongst them. Anyone who has followed this affair knows that there are grave doubts about the legitimacy of claims of many of these people even to be students. They used private English language classes which were established under the control of an inept and incompetent section of the department of education as a way of gaining back door entry to Australia. The department was only concerned about a quick and easy way to gain foreign exchange, which it thought private English language schools would provide. The Prime Minister has now assured the Chinese students who arrived before the Tiananmen Square massacre that they can stay. They will, of course, bring out relatives under the family reunion scheme. It is interesting to ask ourselves: how did the Prime Minister make his announcement? Did he do it in parliament or in an address to the Australian people? That is not the way these things are done. In the time-honoured way of appeasement for perceived electoral gain, he went to an ethnic pressure group. He wrote a letter to a local Chinese magazine. Representatives of Cambodians applying for refugee status were quick to demand similar treatment. Most of these Cambodians were initially rejected as refugees, but enormous pressure has been placed on the Minister for Immigration by vested interests and chest thumping humanitarians to allow them to stay. I say again: 1 believe this Minister has done more than any Minister in my memory to resist these pressures This is the way we conduct immigration policy in Australia these days. It is not very inspiring. If the people of Australia think out of control, I would say that is a very good guess. I must stress that the ethnic pressure groups I have referred to do not represent the bulk of Greeks and Italians or ethnic communities in Australia in general. Most of these people want what is best for Australia. If the Government had the guts to stand up to the multiculturalist industry it would find this out. Although I might add that it is no good just the Government standing up, the Opposition has to stand up as well. I see no evidence that the Opposition is prepared to bite this bullet and in a bold way take on the problem of the multiculturalist industry in Australia. Unfortunately, there are not enough John Howards on the front bench of the Liberal Party of Australia. (TIme expired)",47
262,Mr MACKELLAR,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have great pleasure in seconding the amendment moved by the shadow Minister for immigration and ethnic affairs, the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock).1 was intrigued by the contribution from the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell). I am always intrigued by his contributions on a number of subjects. In some ways he reminds me very much of the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) because both come from Western Australia and both have the capacity to speak at length on a multiplicity of subjects with apparent absolute authority. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie raised some issues which I think are of great significance to the debate on the migration intake of Australia. There are a couple. of things that I would like to discuss with him. The first relates to the 'diseases of migrants'. This is one amendment which has been foreshadowed and which is to be included in the legislation before the - ouse. There is a proper concern amongst the Australian people about the possibility of exotic diseases being brought to Australia and transmitted to the Australian community by unscreened migrants. This is a very difficult area because it is an emotional one. I noticed that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie talked about hepatitis B and tuberculosis. One of the medical checks which was in place for it is many years was a requirement for intending migrants to be screened for tuberculosis. One of the things that have come about in recent times to a much greater degree is the capacity for visitors to come to Australia in ever increasing numbers. At this stage we have Government Ministers encouraging tourism to Australia just as hard as they can go. In fact, the tourism industry is now the major export earner in Australia. Tourism involves visitors from all over the world-visitors who are unscreened. The suggestion that there is a greater danger to the Australian population from a restricted immigration intake-restricted to an extent which, of course, the hono-rable member for Kalgoorlie thinks is not nearly enough-than from the literally millions of visitors who come to Australia each year unscreened, I think, on reflection, does not hold water. When people are discussing this aspect of the immigration program, they need to consider the full range of people coming to Australia and not to stir up unfounded fears within the Australian community in an area which, I agree with the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, does need attention, but certainly needs to be assessed with the complete range of people coming to Australia taken into account. Another thing that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie said was that lawyers should be kept out of the immigration process-and I say 'Hear, hear' to that. Mr Hand-We all do.",52
263,Mr MACKELLAR,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"One of the great problems that have occurred, particularly . since this Government has come to power, is that the immigration program has been taken over by the lawyers. Successive Ministers for immigration have found it extraordinarily difficult to administer properly their responsibilities under their oath of office, simply because the lawyers and the courts have assumed an ever increasing role and to that extent in many ways have taken control of the program away from the Minister and the government of the day. We do need to make sure that the legal system does not preclude the government of the day and the Minister of the day from exercising their responsibilities properly. I think that has occurred to a very great extent, and I am very pleased to see that the amendments coming before the House today go at least some way towards resolving that problem. Another area that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie talked about was the protection of . the Australian culture, as though the Australian culture is something written on tablets of stone and has not been altered over the many years since European settlement in Australia, which is again simply nonsense. Again, in this immigration debate we do need to understand that culture, if it is to have any significance at all, is a living, breathing and changes as the community changes and as time passes. If it did not, we would be in a very difficult situation indeed. I place on record my belief that immigration programs of the past-not just since the Second World War-have had a very significant and beneficial effect on the development of Australian culture, and I hope will continue to do so. It always intrigues me when those people within Australia who are themselves migrants or the descendants of migrants want to lock the door and say, 'Nobody else can come in. We are all right, Jack. Pull up the ladder and let's stop everything here'. I do not know the family history of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie but I will bet London to a brick that it is not very long since his family or he was a migrant to Australia. When looking at this total migration debate, one has to keep very much in mind the development of migration procedures and an understanding of those people already inÂ· Australia, of course, but also those people wishing to come to Australia. Having done that, it seems to me that we are really facing in the future a situation which we have not faced as a nation before. The potential for refugee arrival in Australia is at a level which we really have not faced before. Our refugee procedures need to take into account the potential that lies around us. One of the saddest issues in the world today concerns the fate of refugees. One cannot go to any continent in the world-with the exception of Australia-where there are not significant refugee problems and an increasing number of people who come into the category of refugees. Australia simply cannot deal with all those who seek asylum and resettlement, and therefore any government needs to make very clear decisions as to what can be achieved, how many people can be catered for in the refugee category and who they will be. At this stage I do not believe that we have a clear delineation from the Government as to how that selection procedure is to be handled; it is an area which needs further attention. I would hate to see a situation develop in Australia where we needed to have refugee entity camps. That would be a dreadful thing, and I hope that procedures are put in place that will obviate this necessity. But I think-and the evidence is clearly before us-that the current situation cannot be supported. Here again I agree with the honourable member for Kalgoorlie; although I would not use the phrases that he did, I certainly agree with sentiments when he said that one of the great problems that we face came about because an emotional reaction by the previous Prime Minister to the events in Tiananmen Square. It is disgraceful what has occurred as a result of that. It has been very unfair. I acknowledge the attitude and the words the Minister for Immigration, Local Governdas, ment and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand), who is the table, when he said that it was an extremely emotional time. It certainly was, and one of the most difficult things to do an emotional time is to keep in one's head clear-headed rationality and approach to immigration questions. Once an immigration decision has been made, it is immensely difficult to reverse it-and the ramifications of a decision can extend well into the future, which has occurred in the case of the Chinese students. There is no doubt that that decision has distorted the immigration program, and continues to so do. I for one was extremely disappointed by manner in which the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has written a letter-not a public statement about it-to a Chinese paper, as I understand it, making a further decision on this matter. He quite rightly is subject of criticism, both from our side of the Parliament and from the honourable member for Kalgoorlie. Another point I make is that mistakes ""ave been made in the past, particularly since Government has come to office. Those mistakes have particularly centred around takeover of the immigration area by the legal profession. I am glad to see that the respect Government is at last doing something that, and I agree with the honourable member for Dundas when he says that it is too late and what we are encouraging is a more rapid addressing of these problems. What we need to understand is that the present situation really has led to a more rapid inflow from low skilled, low resourced who have a very difficult time in integrating successfully into the Australian community than we should have had. That has been the practical result of the implementation of the policies of this Government. That needs to be his changed and the Opposition is making a very determined effort and a very clearly stated of effort to reverse that situation. I welcome the changes that have been outlined in the original Bill and the amended Bill, as mentioned by the Minister in this chamber. But, in speaking to the amendment of moved by the honourable member for DunI say that the attitude that the Minister at has displayed goes some way towards meeting the real problems that have surfaced in this immigration debate but it does not go far at enough or quickly enough. He says that he is a always getting advice from people. I know that as Minister for Immigration one thing one never lacks is advice; one gets it from everywhere. But I urge him to look carefully at the advice that has been proffered, with the very best will in the world, by the Opposition. If he accepted that advice, I believe we would get this thing under control. It certainly has it been out of control until the present time.",53
264,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We have had a rather wide ranging discussion this afternoon in relation to the made amendments contained in the Migration Amendment Bill 1992 and, in particular, the recent amendments proposed by the Govern the ment. It is quite clear that, notwithstanding the MPI earlier today, the Opposition persists in peddling a number of false and somewhat mischievous claims in relation to the immigration program and the work of the this Government with respect to immigration. I regret very much that in recent times we the have had a considerable breakdown of the bipartisanship on some keyÂ· matters with to immigration. It is interesting that about the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) has made a number of statements accusing the Government of wanting to break the bipartisanship when in fact it was he, and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), who first initiated some very key divergences from the previous bipartisan positions that we people had on immigration. I totally reject the amendment moved by the honourable member for Dundas in which he says that he 'deplores the Government's failure to reconstruct the immigration program to more accurately reflect the current needs of the national economy and to deliver a program that is in the long term interests of Australia'. What an extraordinary statement to be coming from a gentleman who thinks it is in the interests of the national economy to slash immigration. Mr Ruddock-You were not listening to my speech, Andrew.",54
265,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I am basing my comments on all your other press statements over a period of time.,55
266,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! Remarks should be made through the Chair.,55
267,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I include the press statements which were contrary to the spirit of the assurances that he has given me over a period about the position of the Opposition. The whole tenor of this is essentially hypocritical because there is no doubt that the Government, in its reconstruction of the immigration program, has been looking very closely at the needs of the national economy. But, as the honourable member for Dundas knows, there is disagreement in the community and amongst experts about the relationship between immigration and the national economy. Indeed, the long term interests of Australia must surely lie with a sustained and substantial immigration program, not with panicking in the face of some recessionary pressures and slashing immigration for opportunistic reasons, which is the position which has been advocated by the Opposition. It is not only that, of course, because the long term interests of Australia include, and have always included, achieving an immigration program which is supported by the Australian people. An immigration program that is supported by the Australian people is a program that is seen to be fair and just by the Australian people. The honourable member for Dundas is not interested in such a program. In recent times he has been particularly angry with me for suggesting that his calls for the introducprogram tion of English language requirements into concessional family category are in fact discriminatory. I repeat in this House that to introduce an English language test into a family reunion program is essentially to introduce a discriminatory criterion with respect to some families vis-a-vis others. The honourable member for Dundas issued a press statement a little while ago saying that I have a fixation with the family reunion program and cannot get away from it. The reality is that the family reunion program, sociologically, my dear colleague, has proved to be the most successful aspect of our immigration program. I challenge the honourable member to give any information to the contrary. The family reunion program involves people bringing their relatives here. When they bring them here they work very hard to put together assistance for them. They help them find jobs, they help them to look after their children, they help them to learn English, and they help them to fit into the community. That is an undisputed fact about our settlement patterns in Australia that has been commented on for many years by people who have studied this matter. Australia has had one of the most successful immigration programs in the world. The key aspect of it has been the family reunion program. So I make no apologies for wanting the retention of the family reunion program. The fact that I want to keep a balance between the independent immigration program and the family reunion program is considered by the honourable member for Dundas to be a fixation which is against the long term interests of Australia. What rubbish! If there is anything that is against the long term interests of Australia, it is the recent opportunistic behaviour of the honourable member for Dundas and the Leader of the Opposition in attacking the family reunion program and suggesting that, somehow, migrants who come under the family reunion program are far inferior to those who come under the independent program. That is absurd, and it is not borne out by the facts. The reality is that the family reunion has brought to this country people the . who have made massive contributions, including in the economic area. Let me take one of the suggested criteria. Some of the most distinguished Australians who migrated to this country-some of the biggest achievers in this country's history-could not speak English when they arrived. Under the proposal of the honourable member for Dundas we would introduce that criterion into the family reunion program and such persons would never be able to come here, irrespective of the fact that they already have to meet under the family reunion program educational criteria, job skills criteria and age criteria. other words, they have to be young, educated, dynamic people, but we say, 'We are sorry, but because you don't speak English you can't come under the family reunion program'. The honourable member for Dundas would have us believe that one could actually introduce such a system and claim it was not discriminatory. The reality is that, after the 1987 report of the FitzGerald Committee to Advise on Australia's Immigration Policies, this Government accepted a compromise, on which we based our immigration program. The compromise was very clear. It said that the family reunion program would not have an English language requirement, but we accepted that the independent category would have an English language requirement. There was a balance reached between those who wanted an English language requirement for all immigrants and those who wanted it for none. We reached a compromise, a balance. We said that, in the independent category, because these people were coming for specific jobs in specific areas in the Australian economy, it was fair enough to bring in the English language requirement. But it was made perfectly clear at that time that the concessional family category would not have an English language requirement. For the honourable member for Dundas to be putting forward this claim is to introduce a discriminatory criterion. I must say that I reject that approach, and I also reject his claims about the long term impact on the current balance. The current balance has worked well for Australia and it should continue. The Opposition in recenttimes has seemed to grab onto whatever it can find in order to appear different from the Government, so it has picked on this idea of the English language requirement. It has decided to attack the family reunion component. Unfortunately the people who are affected do not have sufficient voice in the House of Representatives, in the Senate and in the whole Australian establishment. But they are the people whose families will be seriously affected because they wi11 not be able to In reunite with their relatives. It is fine for us who have all our families here to say to other people, 'We are going to set down these criteria, and it is too bad if you cannot reunite with your families'. I personally think that to proceed with such an approach would end up creating very severe social tensions in this country. It would not be in Australia's best long term interests. I return for a moment to the economic argument. One of the interesting things about the economic argument that ought to be put on the record is this: when the Minister went around the various groups discussing immigration, a number of the key business groups-the Housing Industry Association, for example-pointed out to him the importance of continuing witli a reasonable level of immigration in this country for economic reasons. It is interesting that those groups, with the exception of the Housing Industry Association, have not decided to say very much about it publicly. They have talked to the Minister about it, they have talked to other people and other members of parliament about it, including myself, but those business groups have not been prepared to come out and say what they have said privately about the economics of immigration. They have not been prepared to do so. One wonders whether that is because the Leader of the Opposition has taken such a strong anti-immigration stand and they do not want to embarrass him. If we are to have an honest debate about the economics of immigration in this country, two things become perfectly clear. Firstly, there is absolutely no evidence-none whatever-that any respectable academic is prepared to put up that immigration contributes to unemployment. On the contrary, the evidence is either that the effect is neutral or that it can contribute in a positive way to creating employment. Yet the myth persists throughout the whole of this community that immigration is a negative for employment. It is a myth which continues to be peddled as a result of the sorts of statements that have been made by the honourable member for Dundas and by the Leader of the Opposition. Frankly, they ought to be ashamed of themselves, because on their own economic theory, the economic theory of the Murphy model which they used in Fightback, immigration is a positive for the economy. They have ignored all that. They have decided to use one model for Fightback, but they have ignored the immigration aspect and what the Murphy model says about immigration. Instead, they have peddled to the popular myth. When leadership on this question was required in this country the Opposition peddled the popular myth that immigration was a negative for the economy. That argument has probably been lost; as a result, there will probably be a reduction in immigration. I hope that those' people who feel that they have made a contribution to this worthy goal, as they see it, will feel that they have achieved something. But I tell them this: not very much will be achieved for the Australian economy. From a positive point of view, hopefully we will get out of this recession very quickly and restore a reasonable immigration program to this country. I hope that next year, when we are debating this issue, we will be in a position to say that both ,parties have at least reached agreement to restore immigration to a reasonable level. Let me conclude with some comments in relation to the refugee issue. I support the amendments to be moved to strengthen the provisions with respect to refugees. I have made it clear to the Minister that I support those provisions in the following context: it is very important for us to send a message overseas that we will not tolerate people simply arriving here on the basis of trying to jump the refugee queues. That message is fair enough; I approve of that. The Joint Standing Corr..mittee on Migration Regulations has taken evidence in relation to what happened to the Cambodian people in the first two or three boat groups. I have said this in another place; I repeat it here: 'I am absolutely appalled that these people had to wait for such a long time before their applications even went in. I know that the majority of the fault lay with the people who were advising the would be refugees. Some of those lawyers and other people were delaying the process in the hope that the longer the refugees stayed in detention the better would be their chances of staying in Australia. That was incorrect. I also believe that we as a society, seeing this process taking place, could have taken more action. We, as a society, could have said, 'Look, these people are in detention for this period; how about we do something?'. And we did do something. The Minister tried to do something shortly after taking office. The lawyers then went to court and delayed the process even further. There was further delay for these refugees when the Minister was trying to process the matter quickly. Those people who are critical of the actions of the Minister are mistaken. If they look at the totality of the Minister's actions, they will see that he tried to get this processing done as quickly as possible, but the delays that kept occurring in the courts have contributed to the suffering by these people. It is important that we take that on board. We must make sure that that does not happen again. To prevent that happening again, the Committee recommended a change to the regulations to ensure that persons arriving illegally now must get their forms in within 28 days. That is very important. We do not want a repeat of what happened with those three Cambodian boat groups. We want the applications by these people to go in quickly and have them looked at. They will have a fair go during examination by departmental officials and later if they want to go to the Refugee Status Review Council. Admittedly, this process should have been put in place earlier, but unfortunately we could not do it earlier. I am very happy that the process is now in place so that everyone's claim can be considered as quickly as possible. Once the claims are either accepted or rejected by the relevant bodies, those people can either be asked to leave Australia or accepted into the fold as permanent residents. The Committee will shortly be presenting a report on the refugee situation and all those issues will be discussed. It is important to emphasise that we have to get this process right in relation to our international obligations to genuine refugees and our obligations towards ensuring that the integrity of the immigration program is protected. The amendments to be moved by the Minister today and those moved on previous occasions are very important in achieving that goal.",55
268,Mr HAND,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"MelbourneMinister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs) (5.40 p.m.)-I will take a few minutes of the time of the House to make a couple of points. Firstly, let me thank those honourable members who took part in this debate-the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MACKellar), the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) and, of course, the shadow Minister for immigration and ethnic affairs, the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock). A couple of points were made which I would like briefly to address. Firstly, there was an offer of assistance in the next stage, which I alluded to in the very carefully crafted second reading speech. The reason for that careful approach is, I think, known to honourable members in terms of the status that speech has in proceedings that may occur in places other than here. I take seriously that offer by the Opposition and other members who took part in the debate to assist in the next stage of looking at this whole question. I can assure the shadow Minister that-as we have already had at least, I think, two meetings on this question leading up to this urgent amendment that we are putting through today-I intend to have a number of other meetings with him as we proceed towards the Budget session. I would also like to thank him for the Opposition's agreement to the proposed amendment to this issue that is before us now. Let me say to the honourable member for Calwell, before he goes, that I will not be as flamboyant in my response to him this evening as I was the other night. I would not do that in here and you, Mr Deputy Speaker, probably would not let me get away with it. It is an interesting tape. Let me say this: as I have said before, there are a lot of experts in immigration. I have never necessarily claimed to be one. I try to get things right. I have the interests of the applicants and the interests of the nation at heart when I make these decisions. Perhaps when this saga of the current boat people is concluded, I will have my day to relay what has occurred in this whole process. I want to allude to one point that the honourable member for Calwell made. It is unfortunate that this has taken so long. I think the point that I made on a television program about how I had been conned by people was missed by a member of the Opposition who used it in an earlier debate. My motive for being scrupulously fair was to ensure that the Cambodians, the PRCs and the few Vietnamese who happen to be in custody at this point got the fairest possible opportunity to present their case. Legal procedures prevent me from elaborating on what, in fact, occurred. But let there be no mistake-I have the interests of this nation in mind. I go back to an earlier debate today where I said, 'Where I have the ability and control over matters that I am concerned with, I will be scrupulously fair and firm'. The problem is that I have not always had that ability or control over certain things. Where I have control I will be fair, but firm, in the interests of the nation and in the interests of the applicant. In the case of the Cambodians, I repeat again in this chamber that I do not accept fault in terms of the slowness of this processing by the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, the officers or necessarily by me-but I am secondary. I am fed up with people having a go at the Department and the officers that work tirelessly in extraordinarily difficult situations, particularly regarding these boat people, where they cannot defend themselves, they cannot come in here or they cannot go to the media because of some legal constraint or some threat of legal action by some slick lawyer. It is a very difficult situation. So I make the plea to the community that we are trying to process these people quickly, and we will. But the process is going to be adhered to. Let everybody understandlawyer, churchman, citizen and applicantthat there will be no deviating by anybody from the process. This is the first time that I have had the chance in here to say that. All the pressure, all the deceit and all the manipulation is not going to make me shift one centimetre in terms of the process. I give two examples. First, a woman was shown on television stumbling out of a car. She was encouraged to run to the fence to embrace her son through the wire. But the departmental officers had made arrangements to have the gate open 50 yards down the road so that the car could drive in and she could embrace her son in a proper way. But that was not good television; that was not good copy. People not associated with the Department at Port Hedland were appalled at the behaviour of the TV crew trying to entice this unfortunate woman faced with this dilemma to be used for a cheap shot. Secondly, a bishop goes on television and alleges that the Department and I are engaged in some sort of compulsory abortion process, and then he carefully backs away. That is another outrageous lie-bishop ot no bishop. That was never going to happen. These are the things that will come out, but there will be no shifting or moving away. I will defend my officers vigorously because I have worked closely with them. Everybody had better be on notice. We are acting in the best interests of this nation and the applicants. I expect support for that. But I will not be pressured by anybody where I am in control of it. What others do is another matter, and I can be hung for that too-and I have been in both portfolios, I suspect. But in this situation where we are in control of it, we are going to end up with the best process in the world. The press can have its cheap shots and honourable members can have their cheap shots, but few of them. I suspect have any real understanding of how complex and difficult this whole thing is. The fact that we are dealing with people's lives does not make the job very easy. We are subject to all the experts, all the advice and, as I say, all the manipulation. But we are not shifting, and both sides of the House should make no mistake about it. I will leave the job before I engage in a manipulation or sleight of hand of this process. So the House had better be on notice about that. It is not going to be done. I have the first opportunity perhaps to defend myself and my officers from the constant barrage of misinfonnation and cheap shots that have been portrayed in the media over a period of time. It is not going to be tolerated any more. Amendment negatived. Original question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee Clause 1 agreed to. Clause 2.

270,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SUPERANNUATION GUARANTEE,"I understand that it is the wish of the House to debate the Superannuation Guarantee Charge Bill 1992 concurrently with the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Bill 1992 and the Superannuation Guarantee (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1992. There being no objection, the Chair will allow that course to be followed.",62
271,Mr CONNOLLY,SUPERANNUATION GUARANTEE,"Bradfield) (5.53 p.m.)The Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Bill 1992 and related legislation introduces. a new system of compulsory superannuation into Australia. It is precisely because of the word 'compulsion' that the Opposition's amendment calls on the House to withdraw this legislation, which would introduce a compulsory superannuation scheme for Australians. Following the revelations contained in recent Treasury evidence to the Senate inquiry into superannuation, it is clear that there are no economic, financial or social justifications for the Government's proposals which, if implemented, would cause even higher unemployment, reduce real wages, add to inflation and do nothing to provide genuine retirement income for the majority of Australians. The Bills are designed to implement the Government's decision announced in the 1991-92 Budget to impose a non-tax deductible levy on employers who fail to provide superannuation support at a minimum percentage level of employee's earnings, which would automatically and progressively increase over time to reach at least 9 per cent by the year 2000. The proposal in this new regime ultimately will complement, but not replace, award superannuation. In fact, it will introduce a complex four-tiered process. We have award superannuation; employer-funded superannuation schemes; personal schemes, such as 23FC; and, finally, we have the superannuation guarantee scheme, which is also built into this legislation. Is it any wonder that we therefore tell the Government that it is introducing at this stage yet another level of massive complexity and cost at the very time the Australian employers, as well as employees, do not need additional restrictions on the capacity to employ? As far as the Opposition is concerned, this is not a bona fide retirement incomes proposal. It is, in effect, an attempt to use retirement income to solve what is nothing more nor less than an industrial relations problem relating to the ACTU and the implementation of the accord. Award superannuation was introduced in 1986 when the Industrial Relations Commission agreed to sanction consent awards requiring the payment of 3 per cent of wages into specified funds. In most cases, these were nominated union-sponsored industry funds agreed upon by unions and employer representatives. Trustees were made up of representatives of both of these groups, but no trustees represented the interests of the employees themselves, not were they ever appointed or elected by thoseÂ· employees. Effectively, therefore, this new procedure was introduced in 1986 without any consultation with the Australian work force. The decision applied only to Federal awards so that employees with no award coverage, or those that were covered by State awards, were not covered by the decision. Despite the fact that there had been a relatively high level of non-compliance-in fact, according to Senator Cook, it is currently running at the rate of some $700m a year-in the run-up to the 1990 election, the Government announced that it would support an ACTU application for a second round of 3 per cent award superannuation. Contrary to expectations, in its April 1991 national wage case judgment, the IRC refused to approve the application and, instead, recommended that the Government should convene a national conference on superannuation and, more generally, on. retirement incomes policy. Not unreasonably, the business community of. Australia and the Opposition welcomed that recommendation. Regrettably, the Government refused to debate the issues in public and ultimately decided to reject the recommendation. Since then, we have had the establishment of a Senate inquiry, which has already uncovered considerable, very interesting information. This underlines precisely the purpose of the Opposition, which is to condemn and oppose this legislation. The Senate Select Committee on Superannuation was established by the coalition and the Australian Democrats to put pressure on the Government to convene a national conference. As I have said, at to date, that has been to no avail. Nevertheless, the Government simply announced its support for a compulsory scheme to give the ACTU, effectively, by the back door what the Industrial Relations Commission had refused to give it byÂ· the front door. As the Business Council of Australia has pointed out, employers are being compelled to fund a system which has more to do with holding the accord together than developing a genuine retirement incomes policy for Australia. In social policy terms, the Opposition is of the view that a genuine and worthwhile retirement incomes policy, in the context of a greying Australia, is undoubtedly one of the most important areas of social policy to which this Government should address itself far more than it has. It is to be imposed on top of award superannuation, thereby compounding the current inequities and complexities in the present system. It is also scheduled to start from 1 July this year, despite the fact that the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) has now committed the Government to the release of a White Paper before the end of the present financial year. Surely, that White Paper will canvass a number of fundamental issues. No doubt it will also consider in detail our retirement income policy, which is on the table. This is something that this Government has failed to compete with. It particularly has to consider whether there should be a cap on lump sums, whether annuities ought to be more freely available and whether the reasonable benefits limit regime should be replaced by a nominal cap. If the Australian Financial Review of 6 April 1992 is to be taken at face value, it would appear that the Government is .looking very seriously at having a cap of $375,000 on concessionaIIy taxed lump sum superannuation pay-outs, and that it also intends to install a flat 15 per cent rebate for all employees' superannuation contributions. What I found particularly interesting was the suggestion that the Government may be looking at a proposal to introduce what it calls superannuation retirement accounts. In our 1986 policy we announced that the least Opposition parties would have retirement savings accounts. If they emerge, at least something will have been achieved. One of the fundamental failures of the Government policy is that it has been grossly unfair to women, and particularly to part time workers, the vast majority of whom are women. A group of welfare, women's and community groups, including ACOSS,Â· APCO, ACOTA, APB&PW and AP&SP, as well as the Association of Civilian Widows, WEL and WIN, wrote to the then Treasurer, the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin), in October 1991 and said: We would regard it as completely unacceptable if the major anomalies, inequities and inefficiencies ... were not addressed prior to further entrenching the current system in legislation. However, as usual, the Government has chosen to ignore the views of that very important group of people. At a hearing of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, senior Treasury officials poured water on the alleged justification for compulsory superannuation by admitting that they were not in possession of any information which would support the usual arguments for such a system. The Treasurer, in his second reading speech on this legislation, emphasised that the very fundamental purpose of the Bill was to overcome two major problems: firstly, the need to boost national savings; and, secondly, the need to arrest the rising costs of age pensions. The Senate evidence, which has come from the Treasury, makes it quite clear that there no substance in either of the arguments which have so far come forward in that place. The main provisions of the legislation to be introduced on 1 July 1991, in respect of the 1992-93 financial year, will affect employers with annual payrolls of more than half a million dollars. They will be required to contribute 5 per cent of each employee's earnings, up to a maximum level of $80,000, to any complying fund. ThatÂ· represents a contribution cap of some $4,000 a year per employee. The point should be emphasised that we are far more generous than the Government in this area, because we have a contribution cap of $6,000 per employee. In addition, we will provide a further $6,000 to support, in superannuation terms, wives and spouses of employees-or employers, for that matter. In addition, we are providing a 25 per cent tax rebate on all contributions up to that limit. Overall, the evidence suggests that the changes the Government is ultimately likely to introduce will be very similar to the proposals we have put forward. For employers with payrolls of less than half a million dollars, the prescribed starting rate will be 3 per cent. This rate will rise progressively so that it reaches 9 per cent by the year 2000, and it will be fully employer funded. No contribution from employees is taken account of in these proposals. In addition, a further 3 per cent employee contribution could be considered, taking the prescribed rate to 12 per cent by the year 2000. That has to be negotiated on a basis which will take account of wage trade-offs over that time. Therefore, if the Government policy is applied, the real prospect facing hundreds of thousands of Australian middleto low-income workers is that they will have very little, if any, increase in wages over that time. Employers who fail to pay the minimum contribution will be required to pay a nondeductible levy to the Taxation Office. So this superannuation guarantee scheme, which I referred to earlier as the mechanism the Government intends to use, is bizarre. Whereas in all other aspects of this proposal employees have no right of choice what is soever, we are told that under the superannuation guarantee scheme employees will have some degree of choice in relation to the funding of their superannuation contributions, taken on a compulsory basis from their employers. Existing contributions will be able to be offset against the above-mentioned contributions and the amount of the levy will be distributed by the Taxation Office to a superannuation fund for the employees to whom it relates. Proposals of this nature quite obviously have major macro-economic impacts, especially on employers' capacity to pay. While Australia still suffers from the deepest economic recession in 60 years, with unemployment at over lO per cent and at least one million Australians out of work-and there are all sorts of estimates as to the level of underemployment; it could well be half a million-the last thing businesses need is policies which will undermine further their capacity to expand their enterprises and increase employment opportunities. . Even the hapless member for Werriwa, when he was Treasurer, was forced to concede publicly that these superannuation changes were essentially and basically an additional cost. This regime will add an extra $3 billion to $4 billion a year to labour costs, irrespective of the state of the international or the domestic economy, let alone the plight of individual employers and those employees who will be unemployed because of these proposals. Even ardent advocates of compulsory superannuation such as NationalMutual have been concerned enough to say: The legislated contribution levels make no allowance for the capacity of various employers and industry to meet the requirements. The legislated approach assumes everyone can pay higher rates the same point in time. How absolutely ridiculous it is to suggest that small businesses in particular-which will be the major losers under these proposals-are now to be forced to have a further impost on their wages bills, which will make them that much less economic and less able to survive in a very difficult market environment. The impact on small business, where the great bulk of the burden will undoubtedly fall, will therefore be even more severe. The VACC estimates that, for an average award employee, total on-costs will rise from 31.5 per cent to 37 per cent of labour costs, and even more for staff not covered by awards. Like the training guarantee levy, the SGL is a de facto payroll or employment tax, imposed regardless of profitability. But, unlike the TGL, it offers no prospects of productivity improvements. Here, once again, the Opposition parties stand in direct contrast to the approach being taken by the Government. We support a voluntary superannuation scheme. We support the removal of all taxes such as payroll taxes. We.support employment. We support getting people off the unemployment lists and giving them back the self-respect which employment gives when people can make a contribution to themselves, their families and the nation. That is why we find this legislation so absolutely abhorrent. Against all the evidence from the Treasury, from the Department of Finance, from the private sector, from the superannuation industry itself and from all the major employer organisations, the. words are crystal cle!lr: Australia does not need, and cannot afford, these proposals at this time. Perhaps the saddest thing of all is that hundreds of thousands of workers are going to lose their jobs because of this. These are not just my words. It is not just the hyperbole of the Opposition; it is the evidence given to the Senate Committee by the Treasury itself, which 'was referred to in Question Time today. Surely it is the responsibility of the Government-as we have said in our second reading amendment-to think again and to reexamine in detail precisely what the implications are. As I said initially, one of the other purposes at of this legislation, according to the Treasurer, is .to increase Australian domestic savings. Undoubtedly, there is an urgent need to boost national savings in this country. Household savings have more than halved from a peak of about 15 per cent of disposable income in the mid-1970s to just over 6 per cent in 199091. But it does not follow that forcing workers to go without wage increases will help the cause. Overseas experience has shown quite conclusively that, unless there is rising output and productivity, compulsory savings in one form will simply lead to a rundown in savings elsewhere in the economy. Even the Treasury 'has repeated and supported this position. It is particularly conscious of this switching effect. Most of its claims are not in favour of the SGL. It says: Higher superannuation savings would not be fully offset by reductions in other savings because many employees have equivalent levels of non superannuation savings and superannuation savings are not a perfect substitute for other savings ... Treasury went on to say: . . . some substitution . . . can be expected, however. . . there is unlikely to be complete substitution. No estimate of the likely magnitude of this effect is available. Paddy MCGuinness said in his article in the Australian: The weight of economic evidence is that impOsing compulsory superannuation on individuals does not increase total savings. It simply causes people to save less of their residual income, their take home pay. Or worse still, the real risk is to go into debt. Professor John Freebairn was right when he said: The key to providing high income in retirement is the pursuit of policies promoting high economic growth. Those policies should be first and foremost. According to Peter Griffm, Managing Director of Rothschild, a compulsory system is unlikely to increase national savings 'and will lead to lower returns to savers as well as a big distortion in the allocation of investment capital and the workings of the capital market. The cost of the age pension, which is the second objective of the Government in this legislation, is obviously a matter of considerable long term concern to us all. There is no doubt that Australia has a retirement savings problem. Whereas there were 1.9 million people of age pension age in 1984, there will be over four million in the year 2021. This translates into a drop in the ratio of Australians of working age to those over 65 from 5:1 to 3:1. However, the increasing cost of pensions with the greying of the population will simply be worsened by maintaining the double-dipping gap which currently exists. The Opposition has had the courage, totally lacking in this Government, to face up to this fundamental problem. The double-dipping gap has encouraged people to .retire early-to take their entitlements and then qualify for the age pension in due course. What is the outcome of this? Some 77 per cent of people of age pension age are currently receiving a pension at a cost to the Australian taxpayer of more than $12 billion a year. The Government and the ACTU are obviously determined not to close the double-dipping gap. The age pension bill must therefore certainly rise steeply in the years ahead. The Minister in this House has boasted about the great reforms to superannuation which have been introduced since 1986. They have certainly had the effect of increasing taxation on superannuation by over 1,000 per cent and have made millions for people who are trying to explain to those who have superannuation how the new, complex system works. Despite all of that, the Government has totally failed to face up to the fundamental fact that there are real administrative problems here which it must address if its intention to introduce a worthwhile retirement income policy is to have any credibility at Moreover, the cost of tax concessions, currently almost $3.5 billion a year, is set to double with the implementation of compulsory superannuation. I would say here that if this Government succeeds in getting in place a totally compulsory superannuation system, . it will be only a question of time before the left wing of the Labor Party, those people on the right of the Labor Party and those in the' centre of the Labor Party will other ways to spend $3.5 billion of forgone revenue. The response will be crystal clear. The Government will simply say, 'We've got everybody caught now. They're in our compulsory system. We will now proceed to whittle away the tax deductabilities and remove the incentives to go into superannuation, because the people now have no choice whatsoever.' The people will have no choice about not only where their superannuation should go but also whether they should have superannuation at all. That is what we will see. Ultimately, that is what is at stake in this legislation. The fundamental questions are: what is the hidden agenda of this Labor Party; what are the changes it intends to introduce in the future; and how is it therefore going to establish the very basis of an effective retirement income system? Such a system must surely be based upon two principles: firstly, the capacity of employers to pay; and, secondly, the capacity of individuals to take at least the minimum steps necessary to safeguard themselves in retirement. Regrettably, the Government has failed on both counts. Let us regard again the question of who pays. Unlike every other compulsory system in the world, the superannuation guarantee levy legislation puts the burden entirely on employers, many of whom will be expected to find 12 per cent within eight years. The Government's timetable ostensibly requires employers to pay 9 per cent by the year 2000, but it is clear that they will be expected to pay the last 3 per cent as well. The all. Government has said only that it will give consideration to using employee contributions and tax cuts. But if employees believe-as they have been encouraged to do by some trade unions and certainly by the Government's approach-that the overall responsibility for retirement income rests absolutely with employers, of course they will take the easy option. But the question which has to be addressed is: is that the right direction for Australia? We are firmly of the view that the find all sorts of answer must be no. The employer-pays approach will invariably encourage many employees to take the view that superannuation is no longer their responcurrent sibility, therefore ensuring the lowest common denominator. The saddest fact of all isÂ·. that low income Australians and many middle income Australians under the proposed sysAs tem, may find themselves in the position pany. where they will still qualify for at least part pensions. The principle which the Minister enunciated at the beginning of his remarks about reducing the cost of pensions will be thwarted by the very failure of this legislation to address effectively that fundamental ciple. If we want people employed, we must encourage them to contribute to their Apparently retirement income. By all means we should continue tax deductions for their contribuinvolved. tions, and for employers as well. But it is absurd to suggest that a universal superanthough nuation scheme, especially a scheme of this nature, will effectively cover all Australians. Let us examine who some of the real losers fees. are going to be. I refer specifically, as I did earlier, to part time and casual employees. They will do worse out of a compulsory doing superannuation system because there are two with my wages. million of them, mainly women. Not only will they be forced effectively to forgo very me, substantial wage rises; the amount set aside future for them in the name of superannuation also be decimated by administration, insurance and taxation charges, leaving a small cash pittance and effectively no As retirement income. I refer to evidence which was tendered the Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation. It was submitted by a lady in Queensland who is a part time worker works for one day a week. Her name is Mrs Belshaw. I seek the leave of the House incorporate in Hansard her submission.",62
272,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SUPERANNUATION GUARANTEE,It may be incorporated if it confonns to the rules laid down by the Speaker of the House. It will be considered and incorporated later if it does.,67
273,Mr CONNOLLY,SUPERANNUATION GUARANTEE,"The short and sad story is simply this: Mrs Belshaw's employer has contributes $29.72 a month to her superantax nuation. The costs already are $11.40, so effectively she has only $18.32 left. As the system works, if she does not continue her employment indefinitely, those administrative costs will continue, her capital sum will fall, and, to use her own words: you can see, I could be in DEBT to this comMrs Belshaw said a few other things which I would like to put on the record. She sai-: I work one day per week under the M.T.lA award doing all types of general office work, and since day one (1) my employer has participated in the prinscheme and has done the right thing. my employer has worked out my 3% award rate over a monthly period and this amount has been forwarded to the insurance company Since my opening balance from 31.12.89, even I know the amount is very small, there has compulsory been a steady declinenote 'decline'caused by very high accounting and administration . These fees are outrageous and all my employer is is keeping the insurance company viable, I know this 3% award scheme is not going to help at my age, but anyone younger, working casual or part time, will not have much of a balance in the either, the fees associated with handling the will scheme will see to that. them with I quote what I read before: you can see, I could be in DEBT to this company. to What wage rise can that woman expect under the award provisions which are now in place? The sad fact is that the answer is probably and none at all. Mrs Belshaw is but one of hundreds of thousands of part time workers, to especially women, who have been grossly mistreated by this proposal and who will be real losers under these arrangements. May I make some other observations about the legislation. There is no evidence toÂ· indicate that it will in any way arrest the rising costs of age pensions, which, as I said, are currently $12 billion a year. The Government no idea of tl1e cost to revenue of rising concessions as a result of the legislation, nor does it dispute that low income earners, particularly part timers and casuals, will get virtually nothing from the new regime. If employers are not to bear the full cost of the rising level of contributions, employees will have to go without wage rises. There is very little evidence to suggest that the legislation will result in significant increases in national savings. There is no financial justification for not closing the double dipping gap by raising the preservation age. These concessions go to the heart of the case and m-ke it clear that this legislation is not a retirement income policy; rather, it is an ACTU industrial relations solution toÂ· the problemsÂ· of non-compliance \lnder e,xisting award superannuation arrangements. Consequently, I move: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'the House calls on the Government to withdraw this Bill and not proceed with the introduction of a compulsory superannuation scheme for Australians in light of the revelations, in evidence by Treasury officers to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, that there is no economic, financial or social justification for the Government's proposals, which will lead to even higher unemployment, reduce real wages, add to inflation and do nothing to provide genuine retirement income for the majority of Australians'",67

275,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TOTAL,"Is the motion seconded? Mr Ruddock - I second the motion, and reserve my right to speak.",72
276,Mr WEST,TOTAL,"I strongly support this Superannuation Guarantee Charge Bill and related Bills. It imposes a tax on employers who fail to pay designated levels of superannuation support to their employees. The tax will not, of course, be applied if an employer's contributions are paid to the minimum level of an employee's earnings base; The maximum level of the earnings base is $80,000 per annum, indexed annually. The minimum levels of employer contributions are, as set out in the Bill, for employers with a payroll of $500,000 or less, 3 per cent for 1992-93 and 1993-94, rising to 7 per cent by 1997-98 and to 9 per cent by the year 2000. Employers with a payroll of more than half a million dollars will be required to pay 5 per cent in the next two years, 6 per cent in the ensuing two years, rising to 7 per cent in 1996-97, at which point the smaller employers' contribution will have caught up with that of the larger employers and will progress in tandem to 9 per cent by the year 2000. It will be seen that small businesses-those with a payroll of less than half a million dollars-will, as I jus- said, from 1997-98 basically be paying the same level as the larger employers. There 'Will be a number of exemptions for employers. The following arrangements are set out in the Bill. Employees who earn less than $250 a month will be exempt and employees under 18 years of age who are not working full time will be exempt, as will be employees aged over 65 years age, nonresident employees who are paid solely for work undertaken outside Australia and resident employees who are employed by nonresident employers and are paid solely for work undertaken outside of Australia. Honourable members will see that there are a series of exemptions for employers. The tax that employers will be liable for, if there is a shortfall in their contributions, be equal to the shortfall itself plus interest, plus administrative charges of $50 in total, plus $30 for each employee for which there is a shortfall. Of course, if there are no shortfalls the employer will not be liable for tax payable, and, importantly, the tax will not be a deductible expense for income tax purposes. The first stage of the Government's move towards increased superannuation cover for all employees was made in the 1986 national wage case when the decision was that 3 per cent of salary should be paid by employers in superannuation to cover all workers under Federal awards. In 1991 the Industrial Relations Commission, I think mistakenly, refused to extend that 3 per cent to 6 per cent. In the 1991-92 Budget, the Government announced legislation to extend the coverage. The reasons for this decision last year are very easy to see. Firstly, it is necessary to ensure compliance with the original IRC decision, that is, the 1986 award based superannuation decision. Secondly, it is to extend coverage to increase employer support over an extended period. Thirdly, it is meant to reduce the number of future total dependants on social security pensions, to improve living standards for retirees and to reduce outlays from the Budget in future years. Fourthly, it is expected to increase national domestic savings, involving less reliance on foreign savings and overseas borrowings in future. Since 1988 superannuation coverage of workers in this country has risen from just over 42 per cent to just over 72 per cent; however, by July 1991-five years after the 1986 decision-there was a 30 per cent non-compliance rate with that decision by employers, mainly those with fewer than 100 employees. In addition, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission last year in its national wage case decision refused the application of the Government and the ACTU for a staged 3 per cent increase to award superannuation. In other words, some employers had failed their employees, and the Industrial Relations Commission had failed will the nation in its decision inasmuch as its decision did not increase award superannuation by 3 per cent staged over a number of years. It became necessary to legislate to ensure full coverage and increased contributions by employers to national superannuation in this country. Another reason why this had to be implemented is that the ratio of working age persons to aged persons will increasingly reduce over the next 20, 30 and 40 years.",72

278,Mr WEST,TOTAL,"Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner, I was saying that the ber of aged persons over 65 years was increasirig and the ratio of working age picture. people to those of retiring age was decreasing, obviously, at the same time. In .1991 the percentage of the population aged 65 years and over was 11.4 per centor 1.97 million. the year 2031 that same category is projected to increase to 5 million or 20 per cent of the. down. population. The ratio of those working to those retired in June 1991 was 5.5:1; in June 2031 it will be only 3: 1. These simple figures illustrate the danger of relying on pay as you go funding for pensions as distinct from invested superannuation. All else being equal, the outlays on age pensions will multiply by a factor of 2:2.5 nothing is done to correct this situation meantime. In 1991-92 the outlays on age pensions was $9.7 billion; in the year 2031 expect that Budget outlays to fund age sions could increase from $9.7 billion $14.6 billion. Honourable members should remember that is at a time when the ratio those working to those retired has declined from 5.5:1 to 3:l'. The question is: what would be the extent of savings to budget outlays if we implement the legislation under discussion? I think it deplorable that no Treasury estimate exists. Treasury has inflicted a great disservice this Government in not making these projecincreased tions sooner. Nevertheless, common sense dictates that there will be savings. Given similar income and assets tests in only 30 to 40 per cent reduced eligibility would be required for age pensions to effect a saving of between $4.4 billion and $6.6 billion in 1991-92 dollars. Certainly there will be year by year for example, tax concessions-but they will be spread over time and we will still effect major net savings. Posterity simply cannot afford pay as you go pensions any longer. Reliance over the years on pay as you go pensions is simply out. The message is really clear: we must commence national superannuation arrangements for the future now. We also need to increase domestic savings. Private sector savings, unfortunately, are down from 4.1 per cent of GDP in 1982-83 numto 3.3 per cent of GDP in 1990-91. A current snapshot of the economy shows a mixed On the positive side interest rates are falling and bank bills are now down to 6.6 per cent and, hopefully, they will be down even further tomorrow. Inflation was zero in In the March quarter, housing approvals were up 5 per cent and external deficits are trending On the negative side, GDP was only 0.3 per cent growth in the December quarter; investment will be minus 6.5 per cent for 199192; unemployment, of course; is at 10.5 per cent-up to 20 per cent in some electorates like mine; and, as I just said, savings are down as a percentage of GDP. The conclusion if that one draws is this: One Nation forecasts in the will be met regarding low inflation and external account projections through the I 1990s, but I am very doubtful about us penmeeting the 4 per cent plus GDP and job to growth projections. But there will be a recovery, even if it is only a modest one, and of with that recovery will come increases in demand. Australia will require increased savings to fund increased investment, so there will be less reliance upon foreign savings and overseas borrowings in future. We would then is avoid the higher interest rates which come with the need to aUract foreign capital in ever to increasing amounts. In other words, with savings, we would have lower real interest rates and probably a lower dollar, which will benefit exports and import real terms, replacement industries. The question is: what will be the extent of these savings if we implementÂ· universal superannuation? Again, I deeply regret the absence of Treasury projections, but still we costscan make some common sense general assessments. Firstly, we need to understand that the employer contributions are a substitute for wage increases that would otherwise have been achieved. Secondly, it is reasonable to assume that future wage increases probably will not exceed CPI increases. If the consumer price index projections are low in the 1990s, as I believe they will be-in a 2.5 to 3.5 per cent range-and the mean increase to the superannuation contributions effected by this legislation is about 7.5 per cent over time, then I expect the extent to which wage increases are substituted by contributions to superannuation will be about 33 per 'cent of the total wage increases that would otherwise have occurred. The question is: would this have been saved if it had been taken in wages? The answer is, 'Of course not', and I say that to the Opposition. We have only to look at the decline in the general percentage of savings to GDP in the private sector, which I just mentioned, to understand that. The best guesstimate of the increase in savings could come from comparing the current growth in accumulating superannuation investment portfolios with the estimates of growth if we legislate general superannuation coverage. At the moment the funds are increasing by about $5 billion in their investment portfolio per quarter. At that rate they would reach about $300 billion, if nothing was done"" by about the year 2000 AD. But we expect that if something is done, such as this legislation, investment by the funds would increase to between $450 billion and $600 billion. So there is every chance that, as a result of what we are doing, accumulated investment by the funds will increase by between $150 billion to $300 billion by the year 2000 AD as a result of the move to universal compulsory superannuation"" through the private sector. This is a very important step forward. Given that there is an element of compulsion in all of this-and certainly there is-and an element of wage substitution, the Government must impose more stringent prudential supervision than exists at present and it must consider again the question of investment controls. Currently the Government and the industry oppose investment controls. I believe they should think ,again. Surely Australians will expect a maximum effort from the funds to stimulate domestic growth; that is, jobs for the workers who invest in the funds, their children and their grandchildren. In the 18 months to December 1991 overseas assets invested by superannuation funds rose from 11.7 per cent to 14.5 per cent; that that is, to $21.3 billion as it stands now. There should be a future portfolio limit of 20 per cent on funds, invested outside Australia by superannuation funds. This could be achieved via the tax system. I say that without fear of contradiction by ,the Australian workers. A further issue is this: the majority of investments of the major funds-and most of the minor ones-are in either property, bonds or blue chip shares to the detriment of new growth industries. Superannuation funds and approved development funds outside life assurance offices investing directly now have 18 per cent of their portfolio in land and buildings as at December 1991. The AMP Society out of a total $53 billion investment has $11.2 billion in property and, of $7.6 billion in Australian listed ordinary shares, most are old established blue chip. There is no adventure, no foresight for investment in the so-called brave new world in Australian industry. If one runs one's eye down its annual report one sees the investment in shares, in building materials, food and household goods, property trusts, chemicals, engineering, paper and packaging, retail, transport, media and banks, but unfortunately one does not see very much investment in some of the so-called new growth in value added export industries. Despite the rejection by the Government of investment controls up to this time, I think we should consider requiring a small percentage, say 3 per cent or so, of portfolio investments by funds over an agreed threshold size to be made in certain designated growth industries. This could also be achieved via the tax system. Three per cent of accumulated growth by 2,000 AD could generate domestic equity in such industries to about $10 billion. That would be a very important step forwardÂ· for future employment. I also mention the need for improved prudential supervision. This matter is covered by the statement put out by the former Treasurer last year and by the report of the Law Reform Commission released recently. It goes without saying that the prudential supervision situation as it stands at present not nearly stringent enough. There is support in this report from the Law Reform Commission and the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee for a whole range of new prudential requirements. I support most of them, but I do not' support the' recommendation regarding no investment controls whatsoever, and I have doubts about the recommendation which restricts the insurance by these funds of benefits to members simply to advice for insurance against fraud and negligence. Frankly, I do not think that goes far enough. This will be, in effect, a national superannuation scheme involving compulsory contributions totally invested in the private sector in a multiplicity of funds and we will be the only single nation in the world that has national compulsory superannuation with the investment in the private sector not guaranteed and not insured. Most of the international compulsory national funds, of course, are run by the Government and guaranteed by the Government. In the absence of government guarantees or insurance of benefits by the funds, insurance against fraud and negligence should be mandatory and not simply a piece of advice to each of the single funds. Once again, the Opposition has adopted a carping, negative, short-sighted, ultraconservative approach to this Bill. It has no vision or foresight whatsoever. It is opposing this progressive legislation. I urge the Opposition to reverse its position and I appeal to the Australian Democrats in the Senate to support the legislation. (TIme expired)",73
279,Mr ROCHER,TOTAL,"I wish we could accommodate the previous speaker, the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West), and come to terms with the legislation the Government has placed before the Parliament but, unfortunately, in his and earlier remarks from that side there have not been any compelling reasons for doing that. The superannuation guarantee levy was announced in the 1991-92 Budget and is intended to come into effect from 1 July of this year. The levy provided for in these Bills aims to reinforce the existing award superannuation arrangements by extending superannuation is coverage to as much of the work force as possible, which has, of course, been the Government's stated objective for some time. Under the superannuation guarantee scheme, the Taxation Office will collect revenue from employers who do not provide a minimum level of superannuation coverage for their employees. These revenue collections will then be redistributed to complying superannuation schemes for the benefit of those employees for whom the Government deems inadequate superannuation support has been provided. These distributions will have the administrative costs of running the superannuation guarantee levy deducted from them. So super funds will not fully benefit from the extent of the Australian Taxation Office's collections on behalf of employees. Administraave costs are expected to be in the vicinity of $130 per person, and that should not be overlooked. It should also be noted that many part time and casual employees on whose behalf these funds are collected will never derive any benefit from these distributions. Perhaps the most odious feature of the superannuation guarantee levy is that it will apply to all employers regardless of their individual capacity to pay. The prescribed minimum level of employer superannuation support to apply from 1 July 1992 will be 5 per cent of earnings for employees of employers which have annual payrolls larger than $500,000 and 3 per cent of earnings for all other employees. The Government will eventually increase the prescribed minimum level of superannuation support to 9 per cent for all employees by the year 2000, with the Government leaving open to itself the option of increasing that level to 12 per cent of earnings within this time-frame. Although award superannuation will count towards the prescribed minimum level of superannuation support, employers will still need to fulfil all of their award obligations to employees, with particular regard to awardbased superannuation. Employers in default of their award superannuation obligations will still need to satisfy those obligations, even they have paid the superannuation guarantee levy. By all accounts, the superannuation guaranAustralia's tee levy will have a disastrous impact on business in Australia. This levy will need be paid out of companies' profits or retained earnings or on top of wages. They are the only three sources of the levy. This will in a reduction in the capacity of Australian businesses to invest for future growth, or will reduce the immediate standard of living of those employees who are meant to be the beneficiaries of this scheme. Senator Bob MCMullan, in an article for Canberra TImes on 29 March of this year, argued that the levy would not act as a cost to employers since increases in the levy would be paid 'instead of pay rises'- attack something which may come as a surprise to the many Australian workers who are meant to benefit from this scheme. In terms effects on jobs, the superannuation guarantee governments. levy will act as another form of the iniquitous payroll taxMr Bruce Scott-Tax on jobs.",75
280,Mr ROCHER,TOTAL,"A tax on jobs, going back to the future as only the Australian Labor Party can. When the proposed superannuation guarantee levy is run through Access Economics' .Murphy model it shows that the levy will increase the number of unemployed by between 45,000 and 70,000, depending which assumptions are used. The model also shows that inflation can be expected to rise by over 2 per cent as a direct result of the levy. We heard the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) waxing eloquent today at Question Time telling how every .one per cent increase in the cost living represented a $1,200 loss to farms. This little lot will cost those farmers-those sugar cane growers whom he purported to represent in his heart-rending explanation today-an extra $2,500 a year. Where is the Minister fOl,' Primary Industries and Energy? He is duckIt ing for cover, and I do not blame him, because he has perpetrated a great untruth. The compliance burdens that the levy will if impose on employers will be considerable and will probably result in costs in eXcess of those already mentioned. According to some of leading actuarial firms, the legislation and the manner of its implementation to are wholly inadequate to the needs of business. One actuarial firm has gone so far as to describe the legislation as currently result drafted as deficient and shoddy. Employers will need to begin complying it with the superannuation guarantee levy from 1 July this year, but, as yet, there is no certainty as to the final form the legislation will take. The Australian Democrats have the been making noises about what they perceive to be the inadequacies of the legislation as currently drafted. The State and Territory rate governments have just launched a major on this legislation, based on the Federal Government's failure to consult with them on its implementation and on the financial of its burden that it will place on State Not only do employers lack the firm legislative basis on which they might proceed to implement the levy, but also they lack the accompanying regulations, the details of which have not been provided to this Parliament. As far as we know, they have not even been prepared by the Government. All this adds up to considerable uncertainty, which is compounded by the confusion over how this scheme will interact with existing on and prospective award based superannuation . arrangements. This uncertainty will result in many small and large firms making expensive mistakes in the discharge of their obligations under the superannuation guarantee scheme. The superannuation guarantee levy reflects the failure of the Government's retirement us incomes policy over its nine long years in of office. It is designed to redress the massive non-compliance on the part of employers with the terms of award superannuation and the failure of the Goverrtment to make superannuation an attractive option for employees without access to award based superannuation. also reflects the refusal of the Industrial Relations Commission to endorse the secondround 3 per cent increase in award superannuation as sought by the Government. The IRC has refused further increases in award superannuation without the Government taking further steps to clarify the role of award superannuation and in its approach to wages and retirement incomes policy. The IRC recognises that the Government is deficient in those areas. The Government has for some time now expressed its preference for superannuation to act as Australia's main savings vehicle and is the foundation of its retirement incomes policy. It has therefore sought to extend the scope and level of superannuation coverage for the Australian work force. Having failed to secure these objectives through award superannuation and through generous tax concessions for superannuation fund contributors, the Government is now seeking to coerce employees and employers into meeting the Government's preferred level of superannuation coverage. In seeking to extend the coverage of superannuation to include most of the work force, however, the Government has shown a complete disregard for the quality of that coverage. In particular, it seems that the level of superannuation support for employees to be provided under the superannuation guarantee levy will be inadequateÂ· to meet either their retirement needs or to reduce Australia's age pension bill in the short to medium term; Even if the superannuation guarantee levy reaches the upper range of 12 per cent of earnings that the Government has flagged as a possibility by the year 2000, it is unlikely that many workers would be completely disqualified from receipt of the age pension without having made substantial additional contributions of their own to their superannuation fund. Estimates of the level of contribution needed to sustain a pension-free retirement vary considerably, as we all know, but it is clear that the superannuation guarantee levy is unlikely to make a significant dent in Australia's age pension bill in the years to come. It is generally considered necessary for a worker to put away 12 per cent of his or her income over 35 to 40 years in order to be able to retire on a benefit equal to 50 per cent of average weekly earnings. So it will be at least 50 years before the superannuation levy has a major impact on the age pension bill in this country. It was recently revealed in hearings before the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation that neither the Treasury nor the Tax Office had made any attempt to calculate whether the superannuation guarantee levy would reduce the Commonwealth's pension bill or increase national savings in the next century. This is in sharp contrast, Mr Deputy Speaker, as you would know only too well, to the detailed analysis the Treasury has performed on the impact of the Opposition's superannuation proposals in the Fightback package and up to the year 1996. At the present time it seems that the Treasury is more interested in modelling coalition policy than in further developing Government policy. These revelations have now forced the Government to rather belatedly set up a task force to model the effects of Government superannuation policy on the Australian economy. But this has not stopped the Government proceeding with this lamentable set of Bills. It is becoming increasingly clear that the Government's attempts to extend the coverage of superannuation as widely as possible are having perverse effects on Australia's national savings effort. The proportion of national savings held by life offices has increased dramatically in recent years, but only at the expense of other savings vehicles. In fact, the household savings ratio has fallen considerably in recent years to around about 4 per cent, and it is continuing to fall. Clearly, many people are using superannuation as a substitute for, rather than a complement to, their personal savings for retirement. Indeed, why should people provide for their own retirement when they are under the deliberately imparted impression that the Government has done this for them through award superannuation and the superannuation levy? It promises the kind of Medicare levy mentality whereby many in this country still think that that impost-the Medicare levycovers all health costs. That is what the Government is repeating here again; it will create a mind set which will cost this country dearly. The Government can mandate minimum levels of employer superannuation support for employees until it is blue in the face, but it will not succeed in increasing the overall level of savings in this country, which is widely recognised as one of our major economic problems. The massive flow of funds into superannuation may also have the effect of reducing incentives to fund managers to maximise returns on contributors' funds. With award based superannuation and now the superannuation guarantee levy ensuring that superannuation fund managers are in receipt of a guaranteed flow of funds to manage, there will be less competition from other savings vehicles to keep superannuation fund managers on their toes. In other words, there will be an absence of normal competition. Another factor motivating the Government in its imposition of this levy is that the taxation regime and the administration arrangements that the Government has established for superannuation have failed to provide incentives to low income earners and many others in the work force to take out superannuation. In fact, they contain many positive disincentives. The tax concessions that the Government has made available for superannuation, which cost the revenue some $3.35 billion in 1989 -90, have acted as a tax shelter for the well-off, at the cost to revenue that may very well be greater than the prospective cost of providing the age pension to beneficiaries under these arrangements; it might very well exceed that. Under the current taxation arrangements for superannuation a person paying the top marginal personal income tax rate obtains a tax break of 33.25c in the dollar from superannuation tax concessions. By contrast, a person on the lowest marginal tax rate gets a tax break of only 5c in the dollar or 6.25c if the Medicare levy is payable. Yet it is people whom we most want to encourage to provide for their retirement. Many high income earners have been able to claim individual tax deductions for superannuation contributions in excess of $100,000 per annum, resulting in tax benefits in excess of $33,000 a year for those people. The inequities generated by the current arrangements for superannuation are not just the result of the skewed nature of the tax benefits that they confer. The enormous complexity of current superannuation taxation and administrative arrangements also discriminates heavily against low income earners. This was something that was recently conceded by Treasury officials in evidence given before the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation. Treasury officials then noted that the current complexity in the administration and taxation of superannuation serves to reduce the benefits payable to contributors, acting again as a deterrent for low income earners to take out superannuation. When this Government first assumed office, there was only one tax on superannuation; today there are six such taxes. This Government has increased taxation on superannuation savings by 1,000 per cent. These imposts include a 15 per cent tax on employer contributions, a 15 per cent tax on the income of funds, a 16.25 per cent tax on lump sums, a 21.25 per cent tax on lump sums for people under 55, the pre-1983 tax arrangements and the application of capital gains tax on superannuation fund assets. That is not a bad collection. We are one of the few countries in the world to tax superannuation at virtually every level. In addition to these taxes, we have the reasonable benefits limit which is both complicated and costly to administer. The net result of these administrati ve and taxation arrangements is that superannuation is almost impossible to understand for many people contemplating retirement. Mr Les Scott-Particularly the honourable member for Curtin.",76
281,Mr ROCHER,TOTAL,"It is difficult, if not impossible, for many people-including the these honourable member opposite who cannot keep his mouth shut-to make the right decisions about superannuation in the face of all this complexity. The result is that many people have been discouraged from taking out superannuation or from topping up their existing contributions in favour of less complicated retirement arrangements. So clearly this Government has failed at encouraging. Australians to provide for their own retirement. Otherwise, this compUlsory levy would simply not be necessary. But the levy is no answer to this failure. Indeed, it will' create entirely new problems of its own. The way forward in the area of retirement incomes policy is provided for in the superar1the nuation arrangements of the coalition's Fightback package which, among other things, will freeze this levy at the level at which we find it when assuming office. (Time expired)",78
282,Mr LES SCOTT,TOTAL,"Oxley) (8.33 p.m.)Boy, am I tempted to get . stuck into that bloke! Really, the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) has just shown us here tonight what little understanding the coalition has of superannuation and what little regard it has for Australian workers and providing superannuation for them in their retirement. Those opposite want to take us back to the days before this Government came to office. They want to take us back to the days of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard)-back to the 1950s. That is what they want to do. It was a disgraceful performance from the honourable member for Curtin and I suggest that he leave the chamber and go out to do a bit of homework on what superannuation is all about and what the basic principles of superannuation are. They are very simple: they are about providing for people in their retirement. He needs to look at those, and obviously he has not. Despite all that, I am very pleased to have the opportunity to support the Superannuation Guarantee Charge Bill,. the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Bill and the Superannuation Guarantee (Consequential Amendments) Bill as proposed in the 1991-92 Budget. The Labor Government's record in the area' ofÂ· superannuation policy is something of which it is justly proud. The percentage of Australians covered by some type of superannuation has risen by 32 per cent since the Government took power in 1983. When this Government came to power a decade ago superannuation was reserved largely for management, workers employed in the Public Service and a number of employees in the white-collar area. Very few blue-collar workers, especially women, were covered by superannuation. However, the Labor Government's hard work in the area has ensured that a whole new generation' of ordinary Australians-not the rich and famous or whatever they want to call themselves and management people-has been given' an opportunity to prepare for their own retirement and to give themselves greater independence in retirement. This significant achievement would not have been possible without the cooperatiye atmosphere that has existed in the industrial relations system over the past decade and the constructive role that the trade union movement has played within that system. The union movement has played an important role in the realisation of many of the superannuation benefits now afforded to the workers of this country. Of course, the coalition has made no contribution whatsoever. All it wants to do is to tear down those things that we have tried to do for the Australian workers. It is only via this consultative process between government, business and organised labour that genuine improvements can be made to the overall wage outcome for our . workers. Under the Opposition's proposals in the areas of industrial relations and superannuation, many of the advances made during the Labor Party's term in office would be lost. It is no wonder that there is widespread concern within the superannuation and insurance industry at the prospect of a Liberal Party government led by the Leader of the Opposition coming to power. Of course, I am sure that Australians are smart enough to realise the dangers of letting that happen. The purpose of the superannuation guarantee levy, which will be introduced with the passage of these BilIs-I hope that the coalition and the Democrats will give the legislation that passage that it justly deserves-is to ensure that all Australian employees will be able to enjoy a certain minimum standard level of income when they retire. This retirement income will be made available through encouraging the private sector to play its part in providing retirement through such measures as superannuation, and through the public sector and its social security system for those still not covered by superannuation. The extension of award based superannuation to large sections of the work force has done much to increase the role played by the private sector in the provision of a secure retirement income for its workers. The superannuation guarantee levy legislation will be a further important step in this process. It will result in the level of employer contributions to retirement income being increased over time, with the economy's capacity to pay being taken into account-a very responsible action. Under the legislation, where employers fail to meet their superannuation obligations to employees, the Australian Taxation Office will impose a levy on the employer involved. These funds will then be passed back to the employees through payments to the relevant superannuation funds for the employees for whom inadequate superannuation provision has been made. In effect, the superannuat!on guarantee levy will result in a minimum acceptable level of superannuation support for every Australian worker. Employers will be able to provide superannuation support for their employees by any superannuation scheme which complies with occupational superannuation arrangements and related regulations. The levy will in no way affect employers' existing award superannuation responsibilities to their employees. The superannuation guarantee levy will apply to every Australian employer, with individual employers being exempt in relation to only a few limited categories of employees. For the moment, the self-employed will not have to be bound by the conditions of the levy as they are assumed to be making sufficient arrangements for their own retirement income. This is not to say that the levy will not be extended to this group if that is found to be necessary at some time in the future. There will be four major categories of employees who will be exempt from the for provisions of this legislation. These include employees who are not resident in Australia, employees who are under the age of 18 years and not working in full time employment with one employer, employees who are receiving income that is exempt from income tax under section 23S of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and employees whose income from the one employer is less than $3,000 in one financial year and less than $300 in any week during that financial year. The exemption for casual employees under the age of 18 is a consequence of the fact that such employees are very unlikely to accrue superannuation of any significant amount. If the superannuation guarantee levy were to be applied to such employees, a large number of small contributions would be required with high administrative costs resulting for both business and government. The introduction of the levy will have the effect of replacing some employees' personal superannuation arrangements with employer sponsored schemes. This is necessary to ensure that all employers give their employees a minimum level of superannuation support. This levy is in no way meant to replace award based superannuation arrangements which have become particularly widespread over recent years. It may be possible that employers have not satisfied their award obligations in spite of having paid the levy. Such employers will still have to comply with existing award compliance mechanisms. This legislation will not alter the Australian Industrial Relations Commission's existing ability to intervene in disputes relating to superannuation. The improvements that have occurred in the area of superannuation will, of course, be an important factor in any future wage negotiations with the trade union movement. The significant improvements that have occurred in superannuation of recent times would be greatly undermined by the coalition's proposals in this area were they ever to be introduced. The coalition parties, of course, have never really understood, as I said earlier, or accepted the need to increase Australia's national savings pool. As a consequence, they have never come up with any workable proposals in this area. This is because they are still trapped by the same outdated thinking that superannuation the preserve of the rich, of those in management positions, and definitely is not for those in low to middle income areas. When they last held office in 1983, the overall proportion of workers with any type of superannuation entitlements wasÂ· only 39 per cent, with the rate being 50 per cent for male workers and a miserable 24 per cent for female workers. A disgraceful thing that they should be ashamed of! Today, these figures have risen to 72 per cent for the workforce as a whole, with 80.6 per cent of male workers and 78.5 per cent of female workers now covered by some form of superannuation-something that this Government is justly proud of. The Opposition's draconian proposals for the superannuation industry would do much to undermine the advances that have been made. The Leader of the Opposition's superannuation policy seeks to limit contributions to $6,000 a year, and to set a ceiling of $300,000 on lump sum payouts. This would mean that most people would be forced to take part of their payouts in the form of a self-funded pension. He is also seeking to increase the tax rate on fund earnings from 15 per cent to 25 per cent. So much for the dribble from the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) before, and what he was saying about taxation on superannuation funds. The Opposition would actually increase it by 10 per cent. Of course, we do not take into consideration the effects . the GST will have on all employees. The underlying principle of the coalition's superannuation policy is that people should not be forced to save for their retirement. aim of the policy is to encourage savings through Jhe provision of tax concessions. And we know who benefits most from tax concessions-it is always the people on higher incomes. However, the overwhelming evidence suggests that this approach will not work. An analysis undertaken by the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia, quoted in a recent article in the Australian Business Review, found: There is no country where the provision of tax concessions has resulted in the general population is solely saving more. And yet this is the savings model which the coalition is seeking to introduce in Australia. In relation to the overall effect of the changes to taxation arrangements for superannuation that would flow from the Fightback package, the AS FA study also found: The coalition's proposals reduce current concessions by more than half. In relation to the $6,000 cap on yearly contributions by employees, ASFA found: The limit on rebatable contributions will prevent most people from making adequate provision for retirement through superannuation. It appears to have been based on a premise that a member would make contributions at this level throughout his career. The ASFA found that the changes would mean: Most people would have little more than 20 years to save for retirement and, at $6,000 a year, will not be able to produce sufficient benefit to support them in retirement. What a great sort of policy that is. I wonder where we got that one from. It is little wonder that the Liberal Party's proposals for superannuation have come in for considerable criticism from within the industry. Such criticism is typified by the remarks of the Chief Executive of North Broken Hill, Mr Peter Wade. Mr Wade recently said: Superannuation is developing as our most important savings medium. The coalition should have a policy that makes it possible for that savings pool to grow very large. We need those savings to help fund economic growth in this country and it makes no sense to set limits on the amount people can put into long-term savings. The Other people have come forward with comments but I will not go into that tonight. Rather than any concrete proposals for ensuring that all Australians, regardless of their level of income, are covered by some form of superannuation support, the Opposition continues to mouth the same free market slogans about allowing greater choice for individual employers. In the place of the ordered and structured system of award based superannuation, the Opposition proposes a confused system of individual and employer funded superannuation, schemes. The undermining of the great advances that have been made in the area of superannuation is all in the name of not forcing Australians to save for their retirement. Well, what a negative thing that would be. Rather than being an incentive, the tax changes proposed by those opposite in the area of superannuation would provide a huge disincentive to savings. In the cause of some vague free market ideology, the Liberal Party is prepared to see a reduction in the important role played in recent years by superannijation in increasing the national savings pool. Through earlier reforms by this Government, such as dividend imputation, incentives have been given for superannuation funds to invest in Australian companies, Australian products and Australian ideas. Via the process of award based superannuation, average Australians are being given the foundations for greater independence when they enter retirement. This Government has repeatedly demonstratedits ability to plan ahead for the multitude of changes that will face Australia into the next century. This has not only become the Government's hallmark in the area of retirement incomes;' it has also stood it apart clearly from those members opposite. Its goal has been to strike the correct balance between income adequacy for those in need and incentives for all Australians to maximise their retirement incomes. This legislation which will put in place the superannuation guarantee levy will ,be a further important in encouraging the growth of superannuation as a form of savings in this country. I am very pleased to be able to stand here tonight and support it.",79
283,Mr MCARTHUR,TOTAL,"The honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) is starting to' believe the Government's propaganda in relation to superannuation. Firstly, I would make the point that he places great, emphasis on the employer making the contribution. As we, all know, the Government's proposition will not provide real superannuation for retirement. He raises the point of those higher income earners who receive greater tax concessions. The honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) addressed that problem and we address it in Fightback. The Government's proposals do not address that issue. The honourable member for Oxley skated around that issue without any positive alternative. The Superannuation Guarantee Charge Bill and the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Bill seek to impose an extra charge on employers-the very point that the honourable member for Oxley does not fully understand-who fail to meet the new standards of superannuation support that the Government has set out. I would like to begin in a different way to other speakers and have a look at the practice in other overseas nations. Most governments regard retirement incomes as a very important area, because the policies that guide individuals through their working lives impact so heavily on government expenditure when members of the community reach their early sixties. A number of the more prosperous, or in some cases fast growing nations, are sometimes held up as models for Australia. These countries often ensure that tht1re is a clear link between the level of superannuation contributions made by the employee and the amount the employer puts in-the very point that the honourable member for Oxley fails to understand. Switzerland makes both employers and employees contribute 4.8 per cent of total earnings to a pension fund. Austria has a contribution level of 12.25 per cent for step employers and 10.25 per cent for employees, noting that both parties are contributing. The economic powerhouse of Japan is a country where social pension contributions are shared equally between employers and employees. In South Korea, which has been recording a GOP growth rate in excess of Australia, the present contributions are 1.5 per cent for the employer and employee. The Malaysian economy is expected to grow at an average rate of 7 per cent per annum until the tum of the century. In that nation employees pay 9 per cent and employers pay 11 per cent, maintaining the nexus between those two groups. Australia now proposes to go against what these other economically successful nations practise. Even more importantly, these Bills are not in the individual economic interest of Australia, especially with the nation being in its worse recession in 60 years-a recession that we had to have, as is so well known by members of this House. I have many concerns about these Bills, with the massive 74 points in the explanatory memoranda, and the most important effect it has on the level- of employment. I also note that in Singapore over the past few years the country's Central Provident Fund has been gradually extended. That particular scheme now has a level of contributions from the employer of 15 per cent, but a much higher payment from the employee of 23 per cent. The most salient point is that during the 1980s, when there was a recession, the. nuation Government allowed a reduction of contributions from the employers, a completely different situation to what we have in this country, where the Government during a recession is asking the employers to pay more. Australia should compare the Singaporean scheme with the moves in this Bill by the Keating Government to impose further pulsory superannuation contributions on employers, no matter what the individual company's circumstances are, let alone what the national circumstances are. Perhaps is why Singapore has advanced economically relative to Australia. This Keating Governlowance ment now proposes to load onto employers additional cost with little thought as to consequences. The honourable member for assumes Oxley showed no consideration for job opporpoint in time. tunities. Unlike the training guarantee levy, the superannuation guarantee levy offers little, any, prospect of the employers being able to negotiate offsetting productivity agreements. Interestingly, as the honourable member for Curtin mentioned in his speech, a deputy secretary of the Treasury recently let the cat out of the bag when he commented to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation that these extra superannuation benefits to employees would be partly funded by cancellation or a reduction in wage increases. The Committee made the observation; it has the understanding that there will be an offset on genuine wage increases. Is this what individual Australians want? I would have thought that most employees want the freedom to choose what they themselves do with their after-tax earnings. Many employees under the age of 35 may wish to pay off their mortgages more quickly rather than have access to increased superannuation. However, this Bill will deny them that option, because their real earnings will decline over the next eight years if Australians are forced to accept these superannuation increases as a substitute for wage increases. That is the thrust of the ACTU policy. Bill Kelty and the Prime Minister, in advocating that point of midview, have on the record made superana substitute for wage increases, either in the level implicitly or up front. The second largest provider of superannuation to Australians is the National Mutual Life Association. I would expect that, like other insurance companies, it is broadly in favour of any measure that would improve its revenue, as this Bill will do over the. next eight years. However, National Mutual has commade the following comment about this the Bill-and I ask honourable members to note that this is not coming from the Opposition or any industry group of employers unconnected that with the superannuation industry: The legislated contribution levels make no alfor the capacity of various employers and an industry to meet the requirements. the It goes on to say that the legislation: everyone can pay higher rates at the same What a very important observation that is. The Government is presuming that every if business in Australia will be equally as profitable. That last proposition, which is enshrined in the legislation, is an absurd proposition, as every businessman knows. For instance, in Victoria the construction industry is at a much lower ebb than food proces-Â· sors-although I note that Pacific Dunlop Ltd, with its Edgell closures in recent days, commented on Australia's lack of competitiveness and said that its rationalisation was not as a result of tariffs. In this Bill, the Government suggests that every employer has an equal capacity to pay superannuation, which is the very point that I am making. This, of course, is an essential difference between the freedom in the coalition's industrial relations strategy and compulsion in the Government's policy in both the industrial relations arena and the superannuation arena, where the Government is legislating to force employers to pay superannuation contributions. The coalition recognises that individual circumstances vary for employers and business and for employees. No two people have the same fingerprintS; no two firms have the same opportunities, level of profits or problems-although all Australian companies share one thing: some of the burdens imposed upon them by this Keating Government. The coalition says that it should be up to employees at each work site to determine their pay and conditions. However, in deference to the administrative difficulty that any removal of this Bill might cause, we will honour the levy in place at the time of the election of a Hewson government, although it will not be increased any further. It is very important for members of this House to note that we will honour any levy that has been legislated for, if by chance the Senate passes this legislation. Australia's low household savings ratio of between 4 and 6 per cent is of great concern, especially when it is compared with the average in many other countries. A good example is Germany, which has a rate of around about the 12 per cent. That is up to three times Australia's pathetic effort to increase its savings ratio. However, there is little evidence that an increase in the flow of superannuation fromÂ· employers will lead to higher savings from households. It is appropriate for the Government to abandon this legislation. Individuals should be allowed to temporarily withdraw superannuation contributions to pave the way for a deposit on a first house, as the coalition's visionary Fightback package proposes. In Corangamite, for instance, there are many firms with between 10 and 20 employees which, depending on the levels of salary they pay to their staff, are very close to the $500,000 threshold in this legislation. If they suddenly find themselves to be over the limit, their costs will in the next year suddenly rise from 3 to 5 per cent on the superanthe nuation side. This is just because they move across the threshold owing to some legislative consideration imposed upon them by this Keating Government. Most businesses in Corangamite are finding it very difficult to hold both sales and profits at the level of last year; hence a sudden and probably unexpected increase in their costs will give them every incentive to dismiss staff. This is the point that the honourable member for Curtin made, that is, that jobs will be at risk because of this impost of the Keating Government. The Australian Taxpayers Association represents both business and personal taxpayers. In the light of its public position on the goods and services tax so far, it cannot be accused of being an Opposition stooge. The Australian Taxpayers Association had this comment to make recently in its journal: We believe Treasurer Dawkins must withdraw his superannuation guarantee bill. It creates an administrative nightmare for every employer . . . down the track, with a 9 per cent requirement. It went on to say that the Bill: makes today's payroll tax look 'pussy'. What a wonderful comment that is! It is a very powerful statement that sums up the administrative problems that will be facing all employers both now and in the future. The Government has gone in with an ideological fix because the ACTU-the 'Keltic' club, as perhaps it should be calledhas decided that Australian workers need their bosses to provide a higher level of superannuation contributions and it should be provided, no matter what the consequences are. What justification is there for a requirement within the legislation that, if a business has a shortfall in its superannuation contributions below the stipulated levy, it could have to pay interest on 52 weeks or more of contributions plus an iniquitous administration charge of a flat $50 plus $30 for each employee? That is coercive legislation if ever we have seen it in this House. In the Australian elect()rate, the real is security of employment and the stability that it brings, not additional but illusory superannuation benefits that the Confederation of Australian Industry estimates will result in between 45,000 and 60,000 fewer job opportunities across the nation. Again that supports the honourable member for Curtin in his observationMr Rocher-That is shown by the Murphy model.",82
284,Mr MCARTHUR,TOTAL,"And the Murphy model-about the lack of job opportunities because of this extra impost. The impact of this Bill on part time and casuals within the work force is remarkably little, except in the further restriction or outright loss of job opportunities. In fact, there are only two major beneficiaries. The first is superannuation fund administrators, assuming of course that the typical administration charge of just under $130 per annum for a casual worker includes a profit margin. The second big winner is the paper and printing industry, together with the computer companies, which will have to provide more services to financial consultants as well as the companies that will be struggling to keep up with the new administrative workload. I thought the focus should have been on creating jobs in these difficult times. The many hundreds of young people who are employed by retailers in Geelong, which is in my electorate, will not see any gain from this legislation. It is common for these young people to work on Friday night and Saturday morning and, as 16-year-olds, get paid approximately $55 for their weekly labours. They will be outside the ambit of the superannuation guarantee levy, as are all of those who earn over $250 a month. Each month, the typical 20 to 25 casuals at a supermarket such as Coles in Belmont, in my electorate,. will accrue an extra $12 in superannuation benefit. But the administration charge will eat up about $10 of that. So there is $2 left. What a mockery this is of the superannuation that is being proposed by this Government! Their extra benefit will be $2 per month, as I have said, which I am sure will set them up for life and increase Australia's household issue savings-especially since when each young person leaves after the typical period of two to three years, the benefit will have to be taken in cash as it is under $500. A number of those in the shearing industry and other industries where casuals are employed have commented about the ridiculous nature of the administrative procedures, the compulsory pressure from the award superannuation, and the. final outcome which, because of these outrageous arrangements, does not benefit either the employer or the employee. The saddest thing is that, like the large Melbourne and Sydney retailer David Jones, Coles Myer might decide to reduce its 135 casuals by 2 per cent simply because of the introduction of this Bill here tonight. I note that the Australian Taxation Office is already suggesting that it will spend $3.4m this year on promoting this levy, despite the possibility that it might not see the light of day if we can convince the Australian Democrats in the Senate that the points of view we have been putting forward on this side of the House are valid and that Australians will not be better off. We can look forward to the Tax Office zealously prosecuting small businessmen or women, as they try to keep on, staff members as profitability declines and so neglect to pay the compulsory superannuation demanded under the legislation. When their day of reckoning comes, these businessmen and women might find they cannot afford the interest and the administrative charges which are levied. What will then be the future of thousands of small Australian businesses? The ACTU's philosophical position on superannuation is quite interesting. Not so long ago in October 1991, a senior ACTU official, Brian Daley, the assistant secretary of the Federated Miscellaneous Workers Union, said: The ACTU does not support the need for a further enquiry into a national retirement incomes strategy. That is an interesting position for the ACTU to take. I concur with that, at least for the moment; that is also my position. Mr Daley went on to say: The Government's policy is well documented and has been for at least two years. That statement must have been superseded by some evidence taken at the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation over the past few days. Not only did the Australian Taxation Office and the Commonwealth Treasury not have any figures as to what benefit lower income earners and casuals would derive from this new levy, but also they could not say whether there would be any increase in national savings. I agree entirely with the honourable member for Curtin who made the same point. Here we have the Treasury being unable to cost the Government's own proposals in any meaningful manner. These two major government bodies were also unable to say how much in additional tax concessions to superannuation this new impost would cost in terms of government revenue. They could not produce any evidence to back up claims that this Bill would result in a lowering of the number of Australians presently on the age pension. What an indictment on those two bodies; with all of the hype and with all of the power that the Government has bestowed on this proposition, they cannot produce any evidence to say that the liability for future governments will be reduced in the pension area. The Bill before the House must be opposed because it adds to the cost structure of all Australian business. Australia should instead be reducing business costs by $20 billion. coalition's Fightback package will achieve this. We will reduce that cost; our position has been well documented. With the abolition of payroll tax, we are getting rid of a taxunlike this superannuation tax. We propose to abolish petroleum excise, the wholesale sales tax and the training guarantee levy. We also propose to stop any superannuation guarantee levy at the ruling rate when a Hewson government comes to power. The coalition's superannuation policy rejects the notion that a government should impose a particular level of contribution on employers, whatever a firm's individual circumstances may be. A proper retirement incomes policy must regard superannuation as a way to prepare for retirement. Most working Australians want their superannuation to achieve the maximum possible growth each year. They want to be able to decide which fund they can contribute to, as has been shown in Queensland where some 90 per cent of retail staff did not choose to join the union-established industry superannuation fund. What a remarkable turnaround for the unions in that State. The coalition's ceiling on lump sum funds and the restriction on the total annual rebate available to anyone individual of $1,500 has been criticised by some commentators. It is important to note that spouses will also be eligible for any such rebate. It is also inappropriate for very high income earners to use superannuation as a milch cow and then, in some cases, arrange their affairs to qualify for pension entitlements. The coalition's approach will give younger Australians access to a better system than they have at present. Not only will the coalition's refusal to increase employer contributions further enhance job security-and that is important with up to 45 per cent of young people jobless at present-but also they will be able to use up to 75 per cent of their accumulated superannuation benefit for a home deposit. The Government's inflexibility and willingness to hit employers hard, even when they lack the capacity to pay, contrasts with The the coalition's superannuation policy, which will restore some sanity to this area but, most importantly, will not allow blinkered ideology to preside over a further loss of jobs.  week the results of a Morgan gallup poll showed that an overwhelming majority of Australians believe that tackling unemployment is the most pressing task faced by the Federal Government. In fact, 74 per cent of Australians ranked unemployment as one of the three most important political issues in Australia-and no wonder. In recent times, unemployment in Australia has reached its highest level since the Depression and close to one million people are now out of work. Clearly, the overriding priority for the present Government to generate new job opportunities, particularly by fostering industries, small business and the farming communities. It is almost unbelievable, therefore, that the Superannuation Guarantee Charge Bill, the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Bill and the Superannuation Guarantee (Consequential Amendments) Bill should be so totally at odds with this vital objective. It has been calculated that this legislation will result in nothing short of a massive increase in unemployment due to the impact it will have on business costs. Indeed, as many as 100,000 Australians will lose their jobs because of this legislation. I, for one, cannot think of one reason why the Government should be prepared to introduce any policy which will put so many Australians out on the streets, which will create so much misery amongst Australian families, and which will drive another nail in the coffin of the Australian economy. One of the Government's recent Treasurers, who lost his seat when the music stopped playing, summed up the looming difficulties by saying: There are five people in employment now for every person over 65 years of age; in 20 years time will be only three. Eleven percent of our population is now over 65 and in 20 years time it will be 18 percent. In this financial year alone, the provision of pensions will cost Australian taxpayers some $12 billion. Clearly, something must be done immediately if we are to prevent a massive blow-out in the nation's pension welfare budget in the coming years. Of course, the most appropriate option is encourage Australians. to provide for own financial needs in retirement. Greater reliance on superannuation, along with other investments designed to give people income during their retirement, will result in reliance on the pension and, consequently, less strain on the taxation system. Both of nation's major political parties acknowledge the desperate need to reduce the overall dependence on pension support. However, the Great ways that we have gone about planning to achieve this vital objective could not be any more different, as this legislation before the must be House demonstrates. This legislation builds on the Government's . policy of providing superannuation entitlements for some employees by forcing the employers to pay the premiums for them. It sets the scene for a new form of payroll taxto be called the superannuation guarantee levy-which would come into force on 1 July this year and would compel all employers to make compulsory superannuation contributions on behalf of their employees or be subject to a tough new tax. The cost to business of this new super tax would depend on its total payroll. Whereas small businesses with payrolls of $500,000 would pay 3 per cent, bigger businesses would be forced to pay 5 per cent of the value of their annual payroll or meet the new tax requirements. Over the next eight years, these rates will be steadily increased to 9 per cent of payroll, regardless of how big the business might be. In this way, the 'Government argues, Australians will become increasingly less dependent on age pensions in their retirement years. The current Treasurer (Mr Dawkins), like his predecessor, argues that the new super tax will increase the level of national savings, there thus reducing our reliance on the savings of foreigners to fund our development. In other words, the Government is saying, 'Trust us, this new tax will help reduce the nation's foreign debt'. How can anyone take this seriously-especially when we consider that the present Government has presided over the worse blow-out in foreign debt in Australia's history? In June 1982, gross foreign debt stood at $24 billion. In June last year the to figure was $173 billion. That is an increase of their just on 140 per cent over the period. Only recently, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) put his so-called One Nation less statement on Bankcard. He committed the Government to spend an extra $2.3 billion the which the Government simply does not have and, as a result, must borrow to fund. When the Treasurer says that his legislation will help reduce foreign debt, forgive me for being a little sceptical. Interestingly, as this objective is supposed to be so important to the Government, it seems strange that the Treasurer's second reading speech contained only a brief mention of it. There was absolutely no detailed explanation of the extent to which this new super tax would increase the nation's savings. The reason for this is now well known, thanks to the probing of my colleagues in the Senate, which revealed that there is very little evidence that the new super tax would result in significant increases in national savings. Under questioning by my colleague the shadow Minister for social security, child-care and retirement incomes, the Deputy Secretary to the Government's Treasury Department, Dr Alan Preston, admitted that there is no hardcore evidence supporting the contention that the Government's new compulsory superannuation policy would boost national savings significantly over time. This contradicts the line persistently pushed by the Government in support of its draconian legislation. Two Treasurers ago, we were told by the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin) that the super tax: . . . is about the mobilisation of savings; it is putting to one side, once and for all, the savings task that needs to be taken on by the Australian population. Now we have the latest Treasurer repeating the same claim, despite a total lack of evidence to back it up. This says a lot about the lack of integrity of this Government. Only now that the Government has been caught out in this way has it decided to establish an economic modelling group to examine superannuation issues. This is nothing short of a blatant admission by the Government that the legislation before the House has no factual basis whatsoever and that respective Ministers have tried to con the Australian public by saying that its new super tax would achieve results-for which, as they knew, there was no factual support. What about the Government's other major justification for this far-reaching legislationthat it will reduce the cost of age pensions? Again, Treasury's answers to questions in the Senate reveal that there is no objective basis for this claim either. When asked what calculations or predictions had been done to determine this legislation's effect on the number of people on the pension in 20 or 30 years time, or the financial savings to the Government owing to this legislation, Treasury's deputy head said: We do not have any demographic modelling available to us that would allow us to provide such answers. We certainly are unable to provide precise or approximate evidence on what the effect might be 20, 30 or 40 years down the track. This means that neither of the Government's two main arguments in support of this legislation stacks up. And yet, despite a total lack of evidence about the long term impact of the new super tax, the Government is prepared to push ahead with its plans. Despite widespread opposition to the legislation around the nation, the Government says its new super tax is essential in order to achieve ongoing benefits, without being able to prove that those long term objectives will ever be realised. Now that we have determined that the legislation will not necessarily achieve the aims set out by the Government, what impact will it have? The most obvious concern is that about the new super tax would be a very significant additional cost to small and big business alike. As it is based entirely on the business payroll, the new super tax would be nothing short of a Federal payroll tax. More importantly, once it is completely phased in, the superannuation levy will be almost double the average prevailing rate of State payroll tax. Importantly, there will be no exemptions to this new tax for small business. If a small business does not take out the required amount of superannuation for each employee, the business must remit a levy to the Taxation Office in its place. This levy will not be tax deductible. It is no wonder the coalition, the Taxation Institute of Australia and every major business group around Australia has slammed the Government's new legislation. The Australian Bureau of Statistics, in its latest survey of business labour costs, confirmed that payroll tax was the biggest labour oncost by far in every State, with the Victorian and Western Australian State governments heading up the list of big taxes. Around Australia, 9.8 per cent of business labour costs were due to payroll tax, comthe pared with 10.7 per cent in Victoria and per cent in Western Australia, both of which are renowned for their addiction to high taxes. Many people seem to thi-k that business sector is exempt from payroll tax, but this simply, is not true. The ABS found that small businesses as a whole, being those with less than 20 employees, paid 7.2 per cent of total labour costs as payroll tax, which is not far behind the average of 9.8 per cent for all businesses. Clearly, the States payroll taxes are a major burden on small business, which is why the coalition is com850,000 mitted to scrapping payroll tax altogether. Despite the existing cost burden of ting State payroll tax system, the Federal Government wants to impose its own kind payroll tax at a much higher rate. The ABS survey found that, on average, businesses paid over $900 in pay toll tax every employee, which is equivalent to over 3.2 per cent of their wages bill. Imagine the impact this new legislation would have forcing businesses to pay nearly three times that amount to the Federal Government in form of its new superannuation levy. On average, businesses already pay the equivalent of 3.4 per cent of their costs to superannuation. The impact of eventually being forced to pay a further 9 per cent of their payroll is obvious. Incidentally, these Treasurer figures are important for another reason: they demonstrate that the business sector already pays, on average, the equivalent of 3.7 per superannuation cent of total earnings in the form of superanconsistent nuation. This is well in excess of the 3 cent compulsory contribution imposed in 1986 and demonstrates that, whilst some businesses cannot afford and are not required to pay superannuation on behalf of their employees, the business community as a whole is pulling its weight. In my discussions with business leaders individual proprietors, I have found that there is a widespread recognition of the. need encourage people to take out private superanparticularly nuation and to provide for their own year retirement. We cannot squeeze blood out of a stone. The business' community, especially small business, simply cannot afford to pay cost involved in achieving this aim, nor 10 should it. This extra cost burden will send many businesses to the wall and. will force others to layoff staff to reduce their exposure the small 'to Labor's new super tax. It is common kflowledge that the managing survey director of one of Australia's major department store chains, currently employing around 10,000 Australians, has warned that the proposed increase from 3 per cent of its payroll to 5 per cent would result in a 2 per .cent reduction in employee numbers and a further 200 people out of work. There are businesses across the nation and it is easy to see how Dr Murphy's economic the exismodel demonstrates an increase in unemployment of up to 100,000 people. of Businesses, especially small businesses, cannot absorb the extra cost of this new levy. The recession engineered by the present for Prime Minister has tightened consumer just demand and forced small businesses to become leaner and leaner. Today, those by businesses which have survived years of high interest rates, punitive taxes and low levels of the consumer demand are not carrying any fat whatsoever. In fact, there could never have been a worse time to impose any additional total labour costs on small businesses: What is even more curious is that the has said that this legislation provides: ... an orderly mechanism by which employer support can be increased over time, with the economy's capacity to pay. per Despite. this statement, made barely one month ago, the Government is pushing ahead with its plans at a time when the Australian economy has hardly had the capacity to pay a one-way bus fare out of Victoria, and despite the fact that small businesses are still shell-shocked as a result of the worse recesand sion in 60 years. Clearly, the Government accepts that its new superannuation levy will to be a major cost burden for small business, as it changed its mind earlier this and allowed an extra year for businesses with payrolls under $500,000 before their levy obligation is increased from 3 per cent to 4 per cent. Across Australia there is widespread recognition of the importance of helping to make small businesses more competitive, and in particular of reducing business costs. Unfortunately, instead of working towards removing taxes on business, such as payroll tax, the Government is going to add to them quite considerably. Compare this with the coalition's plans to scrap seven business taxes and to cut business costs by $20 billion across the nation. Instead of introducing a new tax based on employers wage bills, we are committed to scrapping payroll tax so that the costs are reduced for those businesses which currently pay this tax, as well as for businesses that do not pay the tax directly but which buy goods from businesses which do. Ultimately, the Government's new super tax will cost business a massive $122 billion over the next nine years, as the top rate of tax is phased in. Small business will pay $21.9 billion of this, much of it from businesses which currently do not have to pay payroll tax or a superannuation levy. In addition to the cost of this new scheme, small business will become bogged down with paperwork as it tries to keep pace with the complicated new requirements it imposes. The Taxation Institute of Australia said that the Government's scheme would: . . . result in unwelcome paperwork small businesses . . . The Australian Taxpayers Institute has slammed the way the new levy must be met on a monthly basis from 1993-94 onwards. The employer will be able to pay his or her year's super levy in one go without incurring huge penalties. This means that employers will have to make all their wages and superannuation calculations every month to ensure they know the minimum required level of superannuation support for each employee, as well as the level of actual employer support for the month. If the minimum level is not met in anyone month, the employer will have to pay an interest component as well as an administration fee of $50 flat, plus $30 for each employee concerned. This is exactly the sort of bureaucratic nonsense that Australian small business owners do not want or need and they should not have to put up with it. What about their employees? Will they benefit a great deal from this legislation? Clearly, they will not. In some cases employees will actually lose out. Obviously the 100,000 or so who stand to lose their jobs will not welcome the Government's plans. But there is reason to suspect that employees as a whole have every reason to suspect the Government of foul play. On 21 August last year, the then Treasurer, responding to a question in this Parliament, said: There is one point which everyone seems to be missing-we do not necessarily have to assume that superannuation is going to be an add-on to wages. During questioning at a Senate committee hearing, the deputy head of Treasury let the cat out of the bag when he said that the only way in which employers could avoid paying the full cost of these measures was for employees to go without wage rises. Asked whether the superannuation levy would be at the expense of wage increases, Dr Preston confirmed: ... wage increases will be lower than they would otherwise have been. However, the Government has not done its homework on this particular aspect of the issue and cannot tell us the extent of wage increases that will need to be forgone to fund particularly for the new super tax . It is ironic that this legislation is supposed to provide a long term benefit for employees, yet it will put many out of work. Those lucky enough to hold onto their jobs stand to suffer further reductions in real wages that will be put aside because of this Government's new super tax. Of course, certain groups of employees would be affected more than others under this legislation, particularly part time employees and women. For example, someone employed on a part time or casual basis by a small business and earning $250 a month will have $90 a year set aside as a superannuation contribution under this legislation. However, the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia has confirmed that the annual cost of administering an individual superannuation entitlement is over $127. This demonstrates that the employee in question would be left with no accrued superannuation benefit whatsoever. Coles-Myer, the nation's largest private employer with 135,000 employees, has also stated: Not only would there be a significant administration burden for both the company and the funds if such employees are to receive employer funded occupational superannuation, but there would be no real gain for the individual in terms of a retirement income. Furthermore, as this legislation does not apply to employees under 18 years of age, I suspect that some employers will be forced to consider laying off staff when they tum 18, because this legislation makes their employment far more costly than before. In conclusion, this legislation does not guarantee any significant benefits in terms of increased national savings or reduced pension payments. Worse still, the Government's new super tax will have a severe impact on the business sector, especially small business, which would have to pay the extra cost of this levy and comply with new paperwork requirements. Even the very employees who are supposed to benefit from superannuation stand to be the big losers, as many will lose their jobs if this new super tax is introduced, while those still in the work force will have to forgo pay rises in coming years. For those reasons, the coalition strongly opposes this legislation.",85
285,Mr REID,TOTAL,"The purpose of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Bill and the Superannuation Guarantee Charge Bill is to introduce a new system of compulsory superannuation in Australia. The latter Bill is very brief; its purpose is to comply with section 55 of the Constitution which requires a Bill imposing a tax or charge to deal only with that maUer. The Bills are designed to implement the Government's decision announced in the 1991-92 Budget to impose a non-tax deductible levy on employers who fail to provide superannuation support at a minimum percentage level of employees' earnings, which will be automatically and progressively increased over time to reach at least 9 per cent by the year 2000. I am pleased to follow my colleague the shadow Minister for small business, the  because obviously his phone has been running as hot as mine. It feels as though every businessman in my electorate is ringing me at this time. My staff have been inundated with complaints as people register their protest at what the Government is trying to achieve with this legislation. I think it is very interesting that only three members of the Government are prepared to speak on the legislation in defence of the actions being taken by the Government. Obviously their phones have been ringing hot too. They have been receiving the same sort of input that I have been receiving from my area. I think the important thing that should be noted is the level of contributions to be imposed-it starts off at a minimum of 3 per cent in 1992-93 and moves right up to 9 per cent in the year 2000. In fact, this may be changed in future amendments to the legislation. But I think what we are looking at is a proposal by the Government which is only going to add to the unemployment problems in this country. The Confederation of Australian Industry has come out in very strong opposition to what .the Government is proposing. It is strongly opposed to the levy, and its main arguments are based on the effect it will have on investment and unemployment. It stresses the unemployment aspect. The CAl argues that enterprises currently not providing superannuation will be required to meet the only cost of contributions or the levy from their retained earnings. The reduction in retained earnings will reduce the amount available for enterprises-and that is all businessesparticularly small and medium sized enterprises. I guess in the electorate of Bendigo most of the businesses would fall into that category. Most of them are small, family owned businesses; there are some medium sized enterprises; and there is only a handful of large ones. But alI of them have been in contact with meÂ· expressing their concern about the imposition of a further cost. The CAl argues also that the amount available. for enterprises, particularly. small and medium sized enterprises, to reinvest in the enterprise will be limited, and this will result in lower investment back into the business. The alternative will be for these firms to borrow the funds at a high cost for investment, but the funds likely to be available for small to medium firms may not increase to offset the reduction in retained earnings. This is due to the practice of superannuation investments being channelled into the larger, blue-chip firms. As the proportion of available capital invested in these bodies increases, there is a reduction in the proportion of capital available to small or medium firms. That would be disastrous for many firms, particularly in Victoria where the state of the economy is the worse it has been for 60 years or more and the level of economic activity at this time is' extremely low. ' As well, according to the CAl, the small to medium firm will face the increased costs associated with that borrowing. However, these effects may be offset by the fact that not all retained profits are reinvested, so that funds need not be channelled from investment but may come from other uses of retained earnings and the additional cost of borrowing may not be sufficient to effect many rational investment decisions, which are based on many criteria. I do not quite agree exactly with the Confederation of Australian Industry on that point, but I am sure that its next point will hit home with the Government. The Confederation of Australian Industry makes the point that the superannuation guarantee levy will impose an additional cost on employers that, in the current recessed climate, will force them to reduce costs by shedding labour. That is what I am being told right now in the city of Bendigo. In the Bendigo electorate, the unemployment rate is high. It is running at 25.9 per cent in the of Bet Bet and 16 per cent in Bendigo and Maryborough. Youth unemployment is running at a rate of 46 per cent. Almost 7,000 people are out of work in the Bendigo area at present. The Government through this levy is forcing additional costs onto employers, whose only alternative will be to reduce costs by shedding more labour. The additional cost will be sufficient to drive some small to medium enterprises into liquidation. I would have thought that the Government would have realised the damage that it has' done, particularly to the Victorian economy, in view of the number of small businesses which have gone into liquidation and receivership over the past two or three years. The. CAl argues also that the superanlluation guarantee levy will result in increased unemployment. It has estimated that the effect of the superannuation guarantee levy, the SGL, will be to put at risk between 45,000 and 60,000 jobs. I know for a fact that it will have a dramatic impact on my electorate. The figures I have quoted show that every business there is looking very hard at its work force because of the depressed economic conditions. It is not a matter of putting people on; they are asking, 'How can we reduce staff and maintain a business and keep it viable to get us through the recession?'. It should also be noted that superannuation contributions made by an employer are tax deductible, while the superannuation guarantee levy will not be deductible. I mentioned unemployment and the impact that the levy will have on businesses in my electorate. The criticism. that I have of this legislation is that the Government is imposing this levy on businesses without any regard for their ability to pay. In fact, the Government is saying, 'You will pay this levy whether your business is, operating profitably and irrespective of the level of profitability that your business is running at'. Another criticism of the superannuation guarantee levy-it also applied to the training guarantee levy-is that it resembles a payroll tax. It is a disincentive to take on additional employees. In fact, it is an incentive to reduce shire the number of employees. The levy is imposed regardless of profitability, as is payroll tax. The enterprises, as I have said, are just hanging on now. They are finding it extremely difficult, not only because of the recession, but also because of the difficult times the rural sector has had. Bendigo is a shopping centre for many people from the rural areas far to the north, east and west and has a shopping population of about 150,000. All the businesses in the retail sector, the commercial area, of Bendigo are feeling the impact. This proposal by the Government to add further costs will be very detrimental to the economic operation of those businesses. One thing that the Government really has overlooked relates to national savings. It has provided no incentive at all for employee contributions. There is no requirement for an employee contribution. I would have thought that any superannuation scheme would have had a higher value and would have been much more attractive had a contribution been made by the employee as well as by the employer. It has been argued that this would, in fact, reduce the value of the contribution made by the employer, as perceived by the employee, while reducing the end benefit available and increasing the employer's costs, compared with a situation where both the employer and the employee are required to contribute to their superannuation. Self-employed people are some of the losers under .this legislation. I want to bring this matter to the attention of the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis), who is sitting at the table. It is a very difficult time for selfemployed business people to operate their businesses. They work long hours. Of course, they choose to do that; but in the past three years, particularly in the Bendigo area, those pay. self-employed business people have been working extremely long hours for little or no profit. The fact that the superannuation guarantee levy legislation does not require any level of contribution for self-employed persons may be a blessing. But what does it do with the Government's proposal to try to increase national savings? It really misses the mark on that aspect. There are a tremendous number of selfemployed people who run small businesses in country areas. I am sure that the Minister would recognise that. What opportunity do they have? They have to take out a private superannuation scheme, which we encourage. It is part of our policy to encourage people to take out those private superannuation funds so that they can make provision for their future. My comment to the Minister is this: if it is so important to force retirement income down the throats of the work force, there is no good reason why the self-employed should be excluded under this legislation. I fail to see what the Government really has in view there. If the whole idea is to have retirement income provisions, why is the Government leaving out self-employed people in this legislation? I want to refer to some further comments about Treasury and what it had to say particularly about the impact of the Government's efforts to encourage savings. The Treasury is particularly conscious of this. The most that it claims in favour of the superannuation guarantee levy is: Higher superannuation savings would not be fully offset by reductions in other savings because many employees have equivalent levels of non superannuation savings . . . They might be in real estate, or property, or land, or whatever the case may be. Treasury further states: . . . superannuation savings are not a perfect substitute for other savings ... Some substitution. .. can be expected, however ... there is unlikely to be complete substitution. No estimate of the likely magnitude of this effect is available. As Paddy MCGuinness has argued: The weight of economic evidence is that imposing compulsory superannuation on individuals does not increase total savings. It simply causes people to save less of their residual income, their take home These are the sorts of things that make people in the community concerned about what the Government is trying to do. Access Economics also had some very interesting things to say about this legislation, particularly on the matters of inflation and unemployment. It has predicted that the Government's proposals will, if passed, lead to a 5 per cent increase in inflation and the loss of at least 60,000 jobs through the 1990s. So it concurs with the Confederation of Australian Industry. The only way such a scheme could possibly succeed, without putting thousands out of work and refuelling inflation, would be for the increases to be at the expense of wage rises-in other words, to require Australian workers to forgo significant wage increases over the next decade in order to disqualify themselves from the age pension. The more likely outcome is that the cost of superannuation will be met from funds which would otherwise have been used by businesses to reinvest, generate new jobs and expand activities. There are some real losers in this legislation, too. It is a very bad deal for part time workers. Part time and casual employees really miss out in this legislation and do worse out of the compulsory superannuation. More than two million of those employees are women. Not only will they be effectively forced to forgo very substantial wage rises, but as well the amount set aside for them in the name of superannuation will be decimated by administration, insurance and taxation charges, leaving them with a small cash pittance and no retirement income, or very little, at the end of it. What we are seeing here is the deduction of money from people's earnings as a compulsory superannuation levy. It will be paid into that fund, and it will sit there and attract all those administrative and other costs. At the end of it, there will be very little value for part time and casual employees in their contribution to the superannuation guarantee levy. The CAl really summed up the situation in a submission that it made to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, when it said: The very last thing the Australian economy needs at this time are further increases in business costs. . . which will make the recession deeper more intractable. . . add to unemployment and put upwards pressure on inflation. It has summed it up very neatly. I think the Minister for Finance, who is to respond for the Government in this debate, has to reflect on the cost in terms of unemployment and of further closures of small and medium sized businesses adding to the already one million people who are out of work in Australia, and the impact that it will have on part time employees as well. We have probably almost another million people in Australia who are only working a few hours a week or maybe a couple of days a week. They are underemployed. We have "" almost another million people who want to do more work in the Australian economic community but are not able to get into it. These are the people who will be affected by the Government's legislation. That is why the coalition so vigorously opposes it.",91
286,Mr TUCKEY,TOTAL,"I have had a long history in the racing industry, and one of my more favourite statements is that I have never been able to work out which is the worse type of jockey-the stupid or the dishonest. I have to say of this superannuation guarantee legislation that both terms fit; it is both stupid and dishonest. It is dishonest because it has been presented to the Australian people as being beneficial to their long term future as taxpayers and beneficial to their long term future as contributors, as they will be, through lost wages to this scheme. So it is dishonest. It is stupid because it has not been properly researched, and it has not considered the benefits that it might deliver to Australians. . We have to look at why the Parliament is debating this particular Government proposal this evening. We are aware that we already have 'award superannuation', once called 'vocational superannuation'. It is made up of funds managed by trade unions. We are aware that the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) has said that, wherever possible, the Government will facilitate the continuation of these additional compulsorily contributed funds by employers going to those same union funds. It is a matter of fact that, as Treasurer, the and now Prime Minister (Mr Keating) visited a conference of the Australian Council of Trade Unions in Sydney some years ago at which he informed it that its industrial muscle was in decline. Might I add that by his actions he has been the principal contributor to that, notwithstanding that neither he nor his union mates at the ACTU are yet aware of it. By deregulating so many aspects of the Australian economy, he has forced upon Australia the deregulation of the labour market. Government members will bury their heads in the sand on that issue, but it would occur even if they were to remain in office. What did the Prime Minister, the then Treasurer, tell the ACTU conference? He said, 'You are losing your industrial muscle. I have given you the opportunity to take on financial muscle. You will get that through your superannuation funds. It is time you entered self-management; that you even abandoned the ""good advice that might be available from some fund managers, and managed the money yourself'. We wonder why that happened. Of course, we recollect the visit of the ACTU to Sweden when it was going to discover how to run Australia in the future. The ACTU came back and prepared a document called Australia Reconstructed. I refer the House to page 21 of that document, where the ACTU made some passing remarks about superannuation. It said: Given the favoured taxation treatment of investment through superannuation funds, a lever exists to redirect part of their investment portfolio tenn growth and expansion objectives. This can be achieved by diverting some proportion of the future income of such funds into a National Development Fund managed through the Australian Industry Development Corporation (AIDe). For quite some time the ACTU has had its eye on some substantial amounts of money coming from superannuation, and it has this wonderful plan as to how government might manage that in the national interest. We have "" had a rash of examples in the last decade of how government has managed the people's money. It is probably not more obvious than in my State-although, in tenus of money lost, Victoria leads by a country mile. The simple fact is that had the ACTUbeen able to achieve this at about the date of its publication, it might have been contemplating putting Brian Burke in charge of these funds, just as this Government was contemplating making him our next Prime Minister. People are sitting there waiting to retire on these princely sums that are going to come forward, on the misrepresentation that they will be substantial, and one wonders whether they would be happy about having such captains of industry and such men of economic and funds management expertise looking after their money. Might I add that if it were Mr Kelty or some of his union colleagues, I would be equally afeard. That is the situation we are in. That is the background to this legislation tonight. It has nothing to do with achieving satisfactory retirement incomes for Australians. It has very little to do with protecting the tax base. The most simple piece of evidence to support that remark is the fact that these funds are going to be available when people tum 55. How much of that will they have when they become eligible for the age pension at 65? We do not need to speculate on that; we have only to look at the reality of what is happening today. So it is a fraud. It is being proposed for one set of reasons but, in fact, is being developed for another set of reasons-to replace the fast-declining industrial muscle of the trade union movement with this so-called economic muscle. But do not think that is new: one only needs to read the novel Hotel to find out how at one stage to longer the proprietor of a hotel which was not unionised was forced to go to the union pension fund to raise funds to ward off the entrepreneur who was trying to take his hotel over. The condition was quite simple: he would unionise his entire work force. In other words, business will have to pay money which will come under the control of the trade union movement, and at the end of a period of time those same business people will have to go back to that trade union to borrow the money they have contributed. "" As the previous speaker, the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid), pointed out, history does not support these large funds investing in small business. If I have time before my speech is concluded, I will bring some evidence to the Parliament on that matter. What I want to talk about is the fraud, the deception and the dishonesty that is being practised upon the Australian work force. Firstly, by the Prime Minister's own admission today, the work force is to forgo a 10 per cent wage increase. He did not say he would convince the people who have to take a pay packet home to a wife and tell her how to feed three or four kids, pay the rent, mortgage or whatever; he said, 'We have convinced their leaders'. A large percentage of those workers do not agree with their leaders, do not want the people they have as leaders and do not want to be forced into being members of their trade union organisations. In the past day I have had three separate phone calls from people in Western Australia telling me that they are unable to get work driving their own trucks without joining the Transport Workers Union. I got off the phone to the last one just half an hour ago. It is a disgraceful situation when people are denied the right to employment if they do not join a trade union, ostensibly to protect workers, when these people are self-employed. These people do not want to join; they do not want to be in the organisation, but they have agreed with the Government that they will forgo 10 per cent of their wages to get this investment miracle of superannuation with the wonderful lump sums, et cetera, that will be forthcoming in the years hence. Superannuation and similar forms of insurance and assurance policies have been available throughout my living memory. I know numerous people a little older than me, retiring at this point, who are the subject of either employer-type-and, might I add, generous employer-type-retirement policies or personally purchased superannuation or other life assurance lump sum policies. Each and every one of them had some decision to make 20 or 30 years ago as to what sort of lump sum or pension they might like, as in most cases they personally contributed part or all of it. They made decisions in dollar values. To quote one person, 'When we concluded our arrangements in my employment package, the superannuation pay-out I was to receive when I left work at 65 was going to allow me to buy a block of flats, live in one and let the rest for an adequate retirement income. But when I got the money 30 years later it would not buy one flat'. What are we offering people today? When the poor old employer levy gets to 12 per cent, what will it deliver? Luckily, it might deliver an overseas holiday and a few presents for the kids, but it will not deliver a retirement income at the inhated costs of those days. Superannuation never has, if it is an ordinarily funded arrangement. I concede that some of the more generous government ones do because they are not funded, but they just become a burden on the taxpayer of the day and are linked to the salaries of the retiree's replacement, if you like. When one puts money into a fund and that money accumulates the pay-out is peanuts, because one is not protected from inflation. Not long ago we were reading about the remarkable performances of fund managers, earning 20 to 30 per cent. Might I add, that was not 20 or 30 per cent on an employee's or the manager's contributions; that percentage was always declared on what was left after the Government had taken out its 15 per cent, after the union had taken out its dollar a week and after the fund managers had taken out their particular percentage. The return was calculated on what was left which, as we have discovered, was not much. I have already brought evidence to this Parliament of part time and casual workersgood supporters of the Labor Party-shearers and shed hands, who have discovered after a couple of years of involvement in this wonderful vocational award superannuation that the net value of their policies is about 50 per cent of employer contributions; it is worth only half of what the boss put in. How can one possibly support that sort of arrangement? We saw in the Australian Financial Review of 29 April-just a few days ago-that CML has been obliged to dramatically cut its bonuses to cover its Australian business, which is generating a return on capital of less than one per cent. We did achieve zero per cent inflation for one quarter, but we are not claiming that for the year. But at the moment that fund is not even achieving inflation, and neither are many of the others. How do these funds deliver above average performances in better times? I have been in business all my life, and by personal hard work and many long hours I have generally made profits. I was never able to imagine how some entrepreneurs could get so rich so quickly because we always have another partner in every business, called the tax man. It is my experience that if I had a particularly good year he very smartly evened it out for me. We all know that in business one cannot deliver profits of 20 or 30 per cent at any point in time. But the funds were doing it. How did they achieve that? They already have huge amounts of money and the purpose of this legislation is to funnel another gigantic amount of funds-$3 billion or $4 billion a year-into their coffers. What has been the practice of the funds with this money? Their practice has been to ramp the share market and the property market. Unfortunately, that is an unnatural process. Eventually it comes to a cyclical peak and the whole thing collapses in a heap, creating great problems of economic management and resulting in the recognition that in the end there is a real value for everything. How do these funds make their profits by that ramping? 1 will give honourable members one simple example of one of the major funds to whom this Government is going to deliver all these additional moneys. Let us take, for example, a fund with a holding of $100m or $200m worth of BHP shares which are trading at, say, $10-1 do not know their current value. The fund manager has a look at the old balance sheet and realises that it is not getting on as well as it should, so he goes out and buys another couple of million dollars worth of BliP shares at, say, $11. He will be a bit more cunning than that and will probably push the shares up 20c a day for one or two weeks, at the end of which he will have got them up by about $2. He then revalues $200m or maybe $500m of the shares he is holding and declares that a profit. It has done nothing for the nation; it has not built one extra factory. In fact, it has not laid one extra brick. Of course, the fund was doing the same thing in the property market: if it owned 10 top skyscrapers it would buy another one for 20 per cent more than it was worth and revalue the other ones by 20 per cent. 1 wonder whether the wizard across the road with, 1 think, some academic degrees has ever thought how that works. One can ask oneself how else it would work. There is only one means by which businesses increase in value, and that is by producing more profits. Those opposite can look back and see that throughout the boom, other than with this ramping process, very few of them did: it was not by productivity. We find within the Australian economy a very interesting graph situation when we put productivity growth and GDP growth on the same page, with GDP growth flashing away in an upward direction from productivity growth because in the 1980s and the early 1990s this country has run on debt, not on productivity. If those opposite think they are going to force people to save money by putting it into these funds, with the ambition of the ACTU to have most of it reinvested in Australia, they should look at the Business Review Weekly of 4 August 1989, which lists the 10 top fund managers. It tells us where they invested their money. Bankers Trust had more than 40 per cent-nearly half-of its investments in Australian. equities. National Mutual had all its funds in BHP, WMC, NAB, Elders, CRA and BTR. AMP Balanced had its money in the top 10 banks, ColesMyer, CSR, Amcor, MIM, CRA, North Broken Hill and Caltex. I ask the Minister whether he has heard even one middle sized business' mentioned yet. How much more money does he want to be put into these people? How much higher does he want the value of their shares to go while they produce not one whit more? That is where the Government's national savings are going to go. As we know, things have been so bad economically in Australia that the opportunity-which this Bill will not assist-to make profits with the present wage structures, et cetera, is such that the AMP, the largest of these funds, has now gone offshore and has started to buy itself insurance companies in England. It will get a return for the shareholders, for the contributors, but it will not reinvest in Australia unless the returns are adequate. Primarily, the purpose of such funds, because of their huge holdings, is to participate in the share market in a way that delivers nothing. We do not see them coming in when someone else has a new float, unless it is the floating of the Commonwealth Bank or something. When somebody comes up with a bit of a risky investment we will not find these funds being ripped off employers in the so-called interest of the employee; we will not find any of that being invested in greenfield propositions. These big funds will sit back and wait; they are almost obliged to do so. Why would the Government be forcing people to put part of their earnings there? The Prime Minister has said it is coming; it has being paid by the employer but there is 10 per cent that employees will not get-the Government's own constituency. What are people going to get for it? They will get an investment in the AMP, an investment in the ramping of the share market and the property market, but no investment in the growth of Australia. It is just forcing up the value of existing companies. If the Minister thinks that is smart, he is stupid. That is where I started my speech and that is where I will finish it.

Fiuthermore, he did not bother to speak in the debate; nor did he bother to comment on remarks made by me and various other members of the House from both sides. It merely demonstrates yet again what we see in this House time and time again, which is a iotal unwillingness by members of this Government to face up to their responsibilities as parliamentarians to this House and all members of this House. It is simply not good. enough for the Treasurer once again to leave the chamber during what is his legislation. How does he expect theÂ· people of Australia to regard this legislation? They know that ,it is of such fundamental importance that it will affect the lifestyles and the saving capacity-and in fact the very employment-of hundreds of thousands of Australian citizens who have no control over their destiny, who have no say in what happens to them under this legislation. This is simply a sordid deal between the Government and the ACTU. Throughout all the elements of thi!? debate those words come through: a deal has been struck and it will be consummated in this Parliament. It is my belief and it is certainly the belief of the Opposition that when the legislation gets to the other place the Government will find the going far more difficult because it has failed during the inquiry of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation to demonstrate any case whatsoever which would support the very principles upon which it alleges this legislation should be based. For example, it has moved failed to demonstrate to the Senate and certainly to the House of Representatives why these proposals will not have a major cost in terms of employment in this country. At Question Time today we had evidence put forward to demonstrate absolutely that in the words of the Treasury alope in the next five years over 100,000 jobs will simply not exist because of the additional costs brought on employers as a result of this legislation. Clearly, one has to assume that these are mere bagatelles; they are not matters of great significance. Who is going to care? I - an tell the Government who is going to care: the Australian people. I can tell the Government who is going to speak for them in this place; it will be .members of the Liberal and National parties. It is we and we alone who stand up at this time to demonstrate as well as we can that compulsory superannuation legislation of this nature: is, fundamentally flawed. It will do nothing to overcome the real problems about which we have heard so much from all members in this debate tonight-the problems of a greying society and the problem that by the year 2020 we will have a ratio of 3: 1 compared with the current rate of 7: 1. These ,are fundamental issues. Where .is the Treasurer? Why is heÂ· not here? Why is he not taking through this legislation? ,Why has he not spoken in this debate? We are now on tIie third reading of this legislation. I trust that at this late stage the Minister will take the opportunity to take his place at the dispatch box and explain to the House-as he endeavoured to do but failed to do after Question Time today-why the comments made by the Treasury officials at the Senate committee inquiry, in response to the very sensible questions put to them by the shadow Minister for social security and by other members of the Senate, were of such a nature that we are now absolutely convinced of the veracity of our cause. We are pleased to see that members of the Australian Democrats are also very concerned about the quality of that evidence. It is simply not good enough to come up with a deal, put together by the Government and the ACTU, based on a range of propositions which, when they are tested, are found to be fundamentally flawed. These are important decisions. They are matters of great moment. I earnestly hope that we will not see a continuation of the arrogance of the Treasurer as we have in the last few hours, that he will enter this debate and he will answer the fundamental issues which have been put to him by me and by other speakers in this debate this evening.

Since the introduction of the Bill on 2 April 1992, the Government has received a number of representations concerning various aspects of the Bill. In response to those representations the Government has decided to make amendments to the Bill. Some terms used in the Bill are also to be clarified. Prepayment of contributions The first significant change will be to allow prepayments of superannu-tion cont-i-utioto be taken into account m determmmg, m certain cases, whether superannuation guarantee charge requirements have been met. Under the existing Bill, for the 1993-94 and subsequent years of income, contribution- m-de within 28 days after the end of a contnbuhon period-that is, any of the 12 months of the year-may be taken into account - or .that contribution period. However, contnbuhons made prior to a contribution period cannot be taken into account in that period. The amendment will enable contributions paid prior to a particular contributio- period t? be taken into account for that penod, provlded the contribution is made within 12 months of the beginning of the period. Foreign executives The second important change is to introduce a further category of employee who is excluded from the superannuation guarantee arrangements. The category is to be set out in regulations and is to include those employees who are overseas executives of international corporations who come to Australia on a temporary basis to establish a branch Of. the to any company or to join an existing branch m a managerial or executive capacity. The effect of the amendment will be that superannuation contributions do not need to be made by an employer on behalf of these overseas executives. Exemption for certain payments made by the Commissioner of Taxation The amendments also propose to provide an income tax exemption for certain payments made by the Commissioner of Taxation in the law of the event of an employee's death or early retirement due to illness. The proposed amendment will provide that where the Commissioner pays the 'shortfall component' of the superannuation guarantee charge to an employee under 55 years of age. who has retired from the work force due to tllness, or to the legal personal representative of an employee who has died, the payment is exempt from income tax. Minor technical changes In addition to these important changes, the amendments will also amend the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Bill 1992 to correct some minor technical problems which have been identified since its introduction. Full details of the amendments are contained in the supplementary explanatory memorandum which has been circulated to honourable members. I now wish to table a copy. I commend these amendments to the Committee.",100
289,Mr CONNOLLY,SUPERANNUATION GUARANTEE,"As this has been a cognate debate, I would like to make a few observations about various aspects of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Bill 1992. Firstly, I was intrigued to notice that the SGL legislation does not require any levels of contribution for self-employed persons. This is a matter, among others, which I would have hoped the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) would have been able to explain to us: how it is possible to argue a case for a so-called universal scheme, but at the same time ignore the realities that many hundreds of thousands of people are self-employed and are as entitled as anybody else, therefore, to access the welfare and the pension system upon retirement. Therefore, it is not unreasonable to presume that the system should also encourage them to be in it, whether it be through the 23FC funds or, perhaps, to join the schemes which may already be on the marketplace. Nevertheless, as I have regrettably made my remarks in the third reading debate, the opportunity to seek this information is apparently not open to us. No doubt the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Johns) will do his best to answer what we all know is an extremely complex matter. The other matter I would like to refer to is the question of part time and casual employees. As I said in the second reading debate, the evidence is fairly clear: there be those who will do worse out of a so-called compulsory superannuation system; in fact, some two million people fit that category, and most of them are women. Most of them, even under this legislation, are going to be in a situation where they may well be excluded because of the very low levels of their income. The argument that the Government, presumably, has put up is that their exclusion is due to the fact that the administrative costs of handling such small amounts do not make their inclusion worthwhile. On that point, therefore, I have to draw attention to the Opposition's policy in relation to the provision of what we call retirement savings accounts. We like to think that the retirement savings account is one of the great initiatives of the last few years in terms of the Opposition's contribution to the debate on retirement income. They would work basically the same as bank accounts and b- as simple as bank accounts. They would have an advantage in that a part time worker coming in and out of the work force would be able to make contributions when he is so able. The funds would remain there and they would go up with the normal efflux ion of time and the accumulation of interest. The administrative charges would be extremely low, if at all; in fact, they would probably compare with the same charge rates currently applying to savings accounts with banks. I was intrigued, therefore, to notice a reference in the Australian Financial Review of a few days ago that the Government is considering the introduction of what it calls superannuation savings accounts. All one can say is 'a rose by any other name'. But one would hope, of course, that, should the Government go down this way, it will at least note that the idea did come from us. I think it would be a major contributionMr J ohns-It has been in the air for a long time.",101
290,Mr CONNOLLY,SUPERANNUATION GUARANTEE,"Yes, but it still came from us; it does not matter how long it has been in the air. As a matter of fact, I first announced it in 1986, so it has been around for some time. Nevertheless, it is an initiative will that would be of some definite value in that context. In relation to overall employees, I would like to draw the attention of the House to the problem of the effect of this legislation. For example, Coles Myer, is the country's largest private employer with 135,000 employees and will certainly be required to fit the payroll category of $500,000 or more. Therefore by the year 2000 and subsequent years it would be in a position where it would be expected to fund at least 9 per cent. It is interesting to note that, of that significant number of employees, 32 per cent are regular casuals under the age of 21. Coles Myer had this to say: Not only would there be a significant administration burden for both the company and funds if such employees are to receive employer funded occupational superannuation, but there would be no real gain for the individual in terms of retirement income. Of course, that fact is based on its assessment, which is correct, that the administrative costs of funding such a scheme would, in most cases be well over 11/2 per cent of notional contributions. Consequently, whether one is refeJ;Ting to people in that category or, as I said, in relation to women-and we are talking about no less than two million nonworking women in the work forceConsideration interrupted.",102

292,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Dubois)Order! It being 10.30 p.m., i propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Mr Johns-I require that the question be put forthwith without debate. Question resolved in the negative. NA (ADMINISTRATION) BILL 1992 In Committee Consideration resumed.",103
293,Mr CONNOLLY,SUPERANNUATION GUARANTEE,"One of the fundamental weaknesses of this legislation-and they are many, a myriad-is the reality that the Government has ignoredÂ· the presence in the Australian community of over two million non-working women who have Qeen denied access to the alleged benefits despite the fact that women not only live longer than men, but they are also particularly financially vulnerable in their retirement years in the event of early widowhood or divorce. That is, incidentally, an observation made by no less than the ACTU itself. Therefore, I am surprised, if not shocked, to see, since the ACTU has regarded itself, rightly or wrongly, as being the dynamo, the driving force, behind all of these legislative changes, that it has totally ignored the realities of the need for retirement income for over two million Australian women. Again, the Opposition has faced up to this problem. We have made a fundamental change in the whole structure of superannuation funding with the effect that we would permit people to have a tax deductibility of 25 per cent up to annual contributions of $6,000 a year. I might add that under this legislation the Government is offering only $4,000 a year. So there is a signifi-antly greater advantage in our proposals than m the Government's. But, side by side with that, we are effectively saying to a married couple that, if they wish to finance the superannuation and retirement income of their spouse, that woman, or man as the case may be, would also be entitled to be funded up to $6,000 a year. So effectively the combined family contribution rate would be $12,000, to all of which the 25 per cent tax rebate would apply. That is an extremely generous package and it is far beyond the very narrow boundaries of this ridiculous piece of legislation that we are debating here tonight. I will not hold the House up any longer on this particular Bill save to say that the response which employers have made to clauses in this legislation-particularly in relation to their concern about whether they are in the half a million dollar or less category, where their funding rate will be 3 per cent in 1982-83 going up to 9 per cent in subsequent years after the year 2000, or in the payroll category of half a million or more where the rate would start off at 5 per cent and go up to 9 per cent in the year 2000 and beyond-has been unanimous. It is simply that this legislation will cost jobs at the very time when Australia, like most other developed countries, regrettably, appears to be going into a phase of our economic development where periods of unemployment in excess of 12 months may well be the norm. This, unfortunately, is a statistical fact. If one analyses the last 20 years, one will see that at one stage unemployment over three months was regarded as long term. Then it went to six months; then it went to nine months; and now it is out to 12 months. One can look at the reality of how long it took to work through the unemployed from the period of the 1983 recession; the answer is that it took nearly s-ven years. I wonder how many years it is going to take the million-odd people who have lost their jobs in the last 12 months or so in Australia to find jobs. I wonder how many of them are going to be told that one reason why they cannot find jobs is that they are too expensive to employ. Why are they too expensive to employ? it is because of the myriad of taxes, and charges which, are levied on big and small business alike. It is at this time that those charges should be removed. The Fightback package is directly aimed at doing precisely that, that is, removing seven fundamental taxes from - he Australian taxation system and, above all, removing taxes, on wages and taxes, on employment. The sad fact about this legislation is that it is, indeed, an additional tax employment.",103
294,Mr LES SCOTT,SUPERANNUATION GUARANTEE,"I do not want to take too much time either because I know that the hour is late. I want to support the amendments that are before the Chair at the moment, which the honourable member for Bra'dfield (Mr Connolly) obviously did not address. I thought that was why he rose to speak. He amazes me when he talks about what the Opposition has done in relation to women in the work force and, particularly, women in relation to superannuation. I spoke on the Superannuation Guarantee Administration Bill earlier tonight, but I will repeat it so that he, will hear it because obviously he did not get it right. When the Opposition was last in office in 1983, the overall proportion of workers with any type of superannuation entitlements was only 39 per cent, with the rate being 50 per cent for male workers and a miserable 24 per cent for female employees. 'I remind' the honourable member for Bradfield that today these figures have risen to 72 per cent for the work force as a whole with 80.6 per cent of male workers and 78.5 per cent of female workers. That is an increase from24 per cent to 78.5 per cent of female workers, and that is a pretty fair effort in itself. This legislation before us tonight will further improve that because so many women, particularly, will benefit from the employer superannuation fund. The honourable member for Bradfield also needs to realise that in providing the superannuation obviously there will be a need to negotiate, through the industrial arena, ways of implementing the increase in the superannuation fund. Employers have failed, of course. They had been given the opportunity, under the superannuation provisions, under the award provisions, to respond in a positive way. This legislation is now necessary because they have failed to respond, and it is necessary now to force employers who have failed to provide sensible superannuation for their employees. So it has got to this stage for that simple reason. The honourable member' for Bradfield talked about self-employed people. Surely, the on self-employed people have enough bra iris to provide for their own retirement through their own superannuation funds. What we are talking about here is providing superannuation for employees. That is the important part. If, of course, the self-employed people do not provide for their own superannuation or their own retirement,somethi'1g will be need to be done with that, I do not doubt, in the longer term. But this particular legislation relates to employees. I think we need to clearly understand that. For many years, before this Government took the action it did in improving superannuation for so many people in the work force, there was the big incentive for self-employed people to go into superannuation funds, mainly as a tax concession. I think we all realise that. One of the fastest growing industries under the previous ,Liberal Government was the tax avoidance industry. We used to see all this money being channelled into superannuation funds purely for tax benefits. I think most self-employed people are smart enough to realise that, and I think the honourable member for Bradfield is putting them down somewhat by suggesting that they need to be included in this in any way. I wanted to correct a few misunderstandings by the honourable member for Bradfield, and I hope that we will get these amendments through quite comfortably. Amendments agreed to.

295,Mrs SULLIVAN,ADJOURNMENT,"Jn the adjournment debate two years ago I quoted the following extract from an article in a May 1982 edition of the Bulletin magazine: The most neglected date on the Australian calendar is May 8. While it is fitting that our war dead should be honoured on April 25, it is surprising there is no celebration on a similar scale to mark our national survival. .. Never in Australia's history has the nation stood in such peril. At the time. I made that speech there was virtually no public awareness that the fiftieth anniversary of the Battle of the Coral Sea was only two years away. As I stated in my speech, my purpose in raising it then was to urge the Government to give this anniversary the recognition it should receive as a critical event in our national history. All honourable members will be aware that over the past few days the United States Secretary of Defense, Mr Cheney, and Secretary of Education, Mr Alexander, have been in Australia as official guests for the Coral Sea anniversary celebrations and ceremonies. In addition, a number of US Navy ships are paying goodwill visits to various Australian ports. However, I believe that it should be placed on record here that, as well as the substantial contribution made by both the Australian and US governments to our commemoration of the Battle of the Coral Sea, a significant contribution has been made by ordinary Australians-a number of whom have for many years put considerable personal effort into maintaining within this country an awareness of the importance to Australia of its American alliance. This afternoon at the Australian War Memorial, Secretary Alexander unveiled a new display in the 'War in the Pacific' section, dedicated to the Battle of the Coral Sea. This display was a community initiative. Various individuals-both American and Australian-and organisations contributed approximately $100,000 towards its cost. I hasten to add that the War Memorial itself contributed an amount more than equal to that. Furthermore, notwithstanding the community support-notably through the Australian-American Association-that the project attracted, its successful completion owes a great deal to the enthusiastic support of the War Memorial Chairman, Dame Beryl Beaurepaire, and the Director, Brendon Kelson. The display is a reproduction of the bridge that of the US Yorktown, one of the two aircraft carriers involved in the battle. Much of the equipment in the display was provided by the US Navy. It graphically portrays, including through the use of military archival film taken at the time, the military tactics of the Japanese fleet-namely, to secure Port Moresby from the sea, to attack allied bases at Thursday Island, Cooktown and Townsville, and, at the least, to force Australia out of the war. It is now a well-documented part of history that the damage inflicted on the Japanese Navy in the Battle of the Coral Sea was a decisive factor in the United States Navy's victory in the Battle of Midway less than one month later. From that point on, Japan had no chance of winning the war. The battle indeed turned the tide. We owe much to the courage and skills of the American sailors in the Battle of the Coral Sea. It is particularly fitting that we should acknowledge the 543 Americans who lost their lives in that battle. This landmark display at the Australian War Memorial will serve to make future generations of Australians aware of how great was the peril of our country in those days referred to as Australia's darkest, and how important strong alliances are to our national security. Settlement of Australia",106
296,Mr HOLDING,ADJOURNMENT,"Over the last few days the Australian press has carried details of race riots in American cities, principally Los Angeles, following the decision of the jury in what has become known as the Rodney King case. This has led to a wide range of leading articles in Australian newspapers, some adverse journalistic comment about the inadequacy of the American jury system, and questions as to how, within the framework of the American legal process, a jury of laymen could make such a grievous error. While many of the propositions advanced in the editorials are soundly based, I advise our editorial writers, before they get too moralistic and start reOecting on the US judicial system and its impact on race relations, that they would do well to pause and consider why, over some years, many of those writers have not felt the same level of editorial erudition and moralising when it comes to our own judicial system. . If laymen on a jury in the United States can in the light of the available evidence get it so wrong, to use the popular term, what do we say of a High Court composed of Australia's most distinguished lawyers when, in the light of all the available evidence to the contrary, they endorsed and accepted the doctrine of terras nullius? Terras nullius was the notion that some 200 years ago this island continent was unoccupied and nobody owned it by right of prior occupation. Because it was an empty place and unoccupied, its annexation was therefore legitimate. Not only was Australia occupied; scientific evidence suggests a continual occupation for some 60,000 years. As Aboriginal legends and religious belief make no reference to migration, there is no scientific evidence to contradict the Aboriginal belief that Australia as they knew it was the ultimate source of their origin. At the time the British, French, Dutch and Portuguese visited our shores, this island continent was divided by boundaries well known and understood by its own group of Aboriginal peoples and by their neighbours, and supported by religious and spiritual beliefs centred upon their occupation of their own land. There is no legal concept as perverse, myopic and riddled with the mores of the occupying colonial power as terras nullius. We may well ask, in the light of the enormous and ever-expanding body of research, how our distinguished judges got it wrong. Even now, compared with Canada, Mexico, the United States, New Zealand and even South Africa, Australia continues to refuse to legally recognise the prior occupation and possession of this land by its indigenous people. Australia, as a multicultural society, prides itself on its capacity to absorb people of mixed background, religion and origins. However, Au-tralia in 1992 has yet to come to terms with the'rights of its own indigenous people. The maintenance and continuation of the concept of terras nullius within our legal structure shames not only our judicial system but also our nation. It is a concept that should be rejected by this Parliament and by our High Court. The legal doctrine should attract at least some of the same attention of our editorial writers as the recent events in Los Angeles. Perhaps it is easier for journalists, as it is for the rest of us, to moralise about the event in the United States and to proffer advice rather than to face the reality of our own history. The sad and tragic fact of the history of the second settlement of Australia is that the genocide of and the denial of fundamental human rights to our indigenous people-the first Australians-not only has distorted and falsified our history, but some 200 years later has recorded them as the most deprived of all our citizens. If the process of reconciliation now being undertaken by this Parliament is to become at all relevant to Aboriginal Australia, it should begin by clearly rejecting the concept of terras nullius, and hopefully in so doing it will have the support not only of our editorial writers but also of our judiciary.

297,Mrs GALLUS,ADJOURNMENT,"As I foreshadowed last night, I would have liked to take the adjournment debate tonight and every night this week to give the story of some of the carers of people with disabilities in my home State of South Australia. Unfortunately, time is not with me tonight and I have only one minute in which to speak. In that time. I shall refer briefly to a letter I received from a couple in South Australia who live not in my electorate but in the area of Berri. I shall skip over some of the letter to get to the point of the story. The mother writes: We have 2 severely intellectually disabled boys... I am constantly exhausted from caring for the boys who have a mental age of 2. She describes how the boys, at the age of 17 or 18, wander from home and need constant care, their food cut up, toilet assistance and assistance in everything that needs to be done. She talks of her own tiredness. She finishes by saying: There has to come a breaking point. Either the Government has to recognize the plight of the intellectually disabled in regard to accommodation or parents end up in hospitals suffering total physical and emotional fatigue. That is the story of many families in South Australia who have children with intellectual disabilities or head injuries. The present Government has not come to their aid. They are worse off than they were before. With the current philosophy of de-institutionalisation and normalisation, they are being forced into the community when there are no community services to assist them, and once again it comes back onto the families.",108

The following answer to a question was circulated: Training for Aboriginals Program (Question No. 1203) Dr Wooldridge asked the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, upon notice, on 7 November 1991: (1) Did the accounting firm Peat Marwick recently conduct a review of the Training for Aboriginals Program (TAP) for the Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET); if so, (a) what were the terms of reference and (b) what are the details of the cost of the review. (2) Did DEET commence a nationwide intensive internal review of TAP after the Peat Marwick, review; if so, (a) why, (b) did any aspects of TAP which were not addressed by the Peat Marwick Review prompt the DEET review; if so, what aspects, (c) what are the terms of reference of the DEET review and (d) has the DEET review been completed; if so, what are the results. Mr Tickner- The ,answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) KPMG Peat Marwick have been contracted to review various components of the Training for Aboriginals Program (TAP) including: a review of the Aboriginal Employment Action (AEA) program. a survey of former participants and employers included in the Job Skills Training and the Work Experience Program elements of TAP as part of the TAP Private Sector Evaluation being undertaken by the Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET) and the Department of Finance. (a) The terms of reference for the AEA review are as follows: to obtain agreements with a minimum of six member companies of the Business Council of Australia or their designated subsidiary, velop implementable Aboriginal employment and career development strategies; to complete a stocktake of companies that have signed agreements under AEA including an assessment of the current status of Strategies NA and details of employment of Aboriginals in the organisation since participating in the program; to detail and assess different corporate structures and recruitment practices, assess the role of DEET staff at all levels in negotiating and monitoring strategies and develop models to maximise the links between DEET and private sector companies; conduct workshops to train DEET staff in consultation with DEET, in the presentation of the slide kits, prepared by the consultant, on the program; and train DEET staff and Aboriginal Employment Co-ordinators employed by participating companies in the overall objectives of AEA. The terms of reference for the survey of former participants and private sector employers involved in elements of TAP are as follows: to find out what former participants are doing three months, and twelve months after they finish their placements. If employed, what is their income, occupation, industry, career prospects, etc. to collect information on the attitudes of both employers and participants towards the placement: for employers, information on the adequacy of both financial and other support available from DEET; the value of TAP and problems encountered; and . the success of the placement from their point of view. for participants, information on the perceived value of TAP (eg. problems benefits); training received ie. duration, quality, skills obtained. (b) Costs for the AEA review which was comto depleted in March 1991 were $170,000. Total costs outlined in the agreement with KPMG Peat Marwick for the survey of former TAP participants and employers was $200,000. However the contract has now been terminated by mutual agreement at a renegotiated cost of $130,000. The analysis of the results of the survey is being completed in-house. (2) Yes. (a) DEBT commenced an intensive internal review of the management of TAP which has led to the development of the TAP Management Improvement Strategy (TAPMIS). The internal review was necessary because of the high level of deferred payments carried into 1991/92, a continuing high level of demand for program assistance and problems with the management information data base. During the review the Department carried out an overhaul of the program planning, monitoring and reporting arrangements. (b) As the answers to (1) and 2(a) indicate, the scope and purposes of the internal review were quite different from those of the KPMG Peat Marwick review and survey. (c) The terms of reference for the review of TAP were to overhaul the total program planning, monitoring and reporting arrangements and generally improve the management of the program. (d) The bulk of this work is now completed and TAP is now operating under stronger management arrangements.",108
