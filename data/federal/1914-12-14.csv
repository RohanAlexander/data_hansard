2,Mr FINLAYSON,MINISTER OF EXTERNA L,"In connection with the Christmas holidays, does the Prime Minister propose to arrange for the granting this year to temporary employees of the Public Service the same privileges as were arranged for before the last two Ohristmases.

3,Mr RODGERS,MINISTER OF EXTERNA L,"Will the Minister of Trade and Customs inform the House whether, before establishing Free Trade in wheat between Australia and the cheap labour countries of the world, he received representations from the Trades Hall by deputation or correspondence; and, if so, whether he will place before the Chamber a minute of the statements of the deputation, or the correspondence.",4
4,Mr TUDOR,MINISTER OF EXTERNA L,"It is possible that wheat may be brought here from Canada and the United States; but, so far from those places being cheap labour countries, the rates of wages there, particularly in the rural industries, are at least equal to those prevailing in Australia. No representation was made by the Trades Hall Council which affected our decision in this matter. We decided last Tuesday on the action which has been taken.",4
5,Mr RODOEKS,MINISTER OF EXTERNA L,Did the Minister the resolution of the Trades Hall Council,5
6,Mr TUDOR,MINISTER OF EXTERNA L,"I saw it on Friday morning, but the Bill to ratify the decision of the Government was in "" my pocket two days before that report was published.",5
7,Mr MASSYGREENE,MINISTER OF EXTERNA L,Will the Minister consider the advisability of imposing a duty on wheat imported from countries where it is grown with black labour?,5
8,Mr TUDOR,MINISTER OF EXTERNA L,"The statement. I made on Saturday, that from the time of my announcement wheat would be admitted duty free from all countries, still stands good. DELIVERY OF MAGAZINES. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Is the Postmaster-General aware that every month several magazines and newspapers which should be delivered at my house by his Department are lost? I have here the wrapper in which a paper was enclosed; it was delivered, but without the enclosure. As I pay for these papers, I should like ceive them, instead of, as at present, losing most of them. On several occasions the magazines have been lost between the offices of Messrs. Gordon and Gotch and my house. The wrapper which I produce contained a statement regarding the American elections of 3rd November, which I particularly wanted.",5
9,Mr SPENCE,MINISTER OF EXTERNA L,"If the honourable member will give me the wrapper that he has produced, I shall have a full inquiry made. NA COMPANY .",5
10,Mr BOYD,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,"If the Attorney-General has completed his inquiry into the operations of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company, whose offices were raided by the military some time ago, can he make a statement to the House of the result?",5
11,Mr HUGHES,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,"I was under the impression that honourable members had gathered from what I said last Thursday that no offence against the law had been disclosed by the examination of the papers of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company. That company has committed no offence at all. I saw one of the directors of the' company, and made certain suggestions to him, which he has put before his board. Those suggestions were on the lines of the see statement which I made to the House. ? He assured me that the directorate was in favour of action along those lines, an assurance which I regarded as quasi-o&\cial, because this gentleman, though not the chairman of the company, had been its chairman. As he has had ample opportunity to put the matter before the board, and has done so, and has seen me subsequently, I assume that the company is favourable to the suggestion that,, if by any means we can open up new markets for it, and rid it of the control of the German capitalists, it will readily fall in with our views.

15,Mr SPEAKER,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,"There is no objection on my part to the right honourable gentleman getting all the information it is possible to get, but my duty is to try to carry out the procedure of the House. I remind the right honourable gentleman that if he is going to raise a question of privilege he must conclude his remarks with some motion in keeping with the matter concerning which he thinks he is aggrieved.",5
16,Sir JOHN FORREST,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,"I intend to move that if the information is not supplied, the HOUBB will take action in the matter.",5
17,Mr SPEAKER,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,"The right honourable gentleman must do something more than that; he must take some definite course, and, if he does, of course I cannot interfere with him.",5
18,Sir JOHN FORREST,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,"How can I get the information, sir?",5
19,Mr SPEAKER,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,"I am merely addressing these remarks to the right honourable gentleman so that when he concludes his speech he will submit a motion. If he sat down without submitting a motion I would naturally have to take exception to his conduct, and I do not want to do that.",6
20,Sir JOHN FORREST,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,"Will the Prime Minister be prepared to place on the table of the House the plans and specifications accompanying the - report of Sir Maurice Fitzmaurice on Cockburn Sound 1 The reply I received from the Minister was that the plans and specifications had not been considered by the Government; but that does not prevent me from asking that they be placed on the table of the House, as is usual when important reports are received. I hope that you, sir, will allow me to say a few words, as I cannot get anything out of the Minister. Reports are always laid on the table of the House even before they are considered by the Government.",6
21,Mr SPEAKER,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,Order !,6

25,Mr SPEAKER,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,Order ! The right honourable gentleman is now going beyond a question. He must either ask a question or take some other course.,6
26,Sir JOHNFORREST,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,I appeal to the Prime Minister to give the information and so expedite the business of the House; otherwise I shall have to take other steps.,6

28,Sir JOHN FORREST,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,Thes e threats; we are only asking for what we are entitled to have.,6
29,Mr FISHER,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,I ask the right honourable gentleman to address his question to the Minister representing the Minister of Defence.,6
30,Sir JOHN FORREST,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,I have done so without success. I shall have to move the adjournment of the House.,6
31,Mr FISHER,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,I only wish to remind the right honourable member that a certain report by Mr Swinburne is not ' y e t on the table of the House.,6
32,Mr JENSEN,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,"I desire to inform you, sir",6
33,Sir JOHN FORREST,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,"I move the adjournment of the House, sir.",6

35,Sir JOHN FORREST,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,If he will place the papers on the table; no less will satisfy me.,6
36,Mr SPEAKER,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,"Will the Assistant Minister resume his seat? I point out to the right honourable member ""for Swan that, since he asked a question, I have heard nobody but himself speaking.",6
37,Sir JOHN FORREST,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,I asked a question of the Prime Minister.,6
38,Mr SPEAKER,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,The Prime Minister said that the matter comes within the Department of the Assistant Minister of Defence.,6
39,Sir JOHN FORREST,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,"All right, sir.",6
40,Mr SPEAKER,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,"If the right honourable gentleman wants information he must listen, and try to get it .",6
41,Sir JOHN FORREST,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,"Than k you, sir.",6
42,Mr JENSEN,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,The r i g h t ' honourable member for Swan did ask a question last week.,6
43,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,"On a point of order, sir, I submit that no honourable I member has addressed a question to the Assistant Minister of Defence.",6
44,Mr JENSEN,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,"No , but I have been brought into the matter.",6
45,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,"I submit, sir, that the Assistant Minister cannot make a statement without getting the leave of the House.",6
46,Mr SPEAKER,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,The Leader of the Opposition has pointed out that no honourable member has asked a direct question of the Assistant Minister of Defence.,6
47,Mr JENSEN,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,"I have been brought into the matter, though.",6
48,Mr SPEAKER,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,"Honourable members are no are not always aware of the proper Minister to be addressed. . On this occasion a question was put to the Prime Minister, and he said that the matter comes within the Department of the Assistant Minister, and'required his* colleague to reply. In the circumstances, the Assistant Minister must have ample opportunity to answer the question.",6
49,Mr JENSEN,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,Las t week the right honourable member for Swan did ask a question.,6
50,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,"We have had quit* enough of your bluff, you know.",6
51,Mr JENSEN,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,I am going to answer the question. Last week the right honourable member for Swan did ask if these plans and specifications would be placed on the table of the House.,7
52,Sir JOHN FORREST,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,On two occasions.,7
53,Mr JENSEN,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,Yes . Let me inform the House and the right honourable gentleman that the plans were not unpacked until Saturday morning.,7
54,Sir JOHN FORREST,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,Whose fault was that?,7
55,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,More shame to you to say so.,7
56,Mr JENSEN,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,The plans only arrived in Melbourne on Friday last.,7
57,Sir JOHN FORREST,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,You said days before then that you had the plans ,7
58,Mr JENSEN,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,I did not.,7
59,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,You did.,7
60,Mr JENSEN,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,"I said that the plans arrived on Friday, and that we received the bill of lading concerning them two days before then. Seeing that the Navy Board and the Government have to deal with these plans and specifications, I think it is right that the Navy Board and the Government, and the Minister especially, should have the right to peruse them before they are placed on the table of the House.",7
61,Sir JOHN FORREST,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,Mr Speaker. beg to move,7
62,Mr SPEAKER,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,"Order ! Will the ""ight honourable member be seated ?",7
63,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,I wish to ask the Assistant Minister of Defence whether he will be prepared to let us have the plans relating to Cockburn Sound before the House rises for the special adjournment ?,7
64,Mr JENSEN,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,I shall be very pleased to comply with the right honourable gentleman's request provided that the Minister of Defence and the Naval Board have first the opportunity to peruse the papers.,7
65,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,When are they going to do so?,7
66,Mr JENSEN,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,"They have not yet had time, because, as the right honourable gentleman is aware, Parliament has been sitting every day.",7
67,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,The plans have been in the possession of the Government since Friday.,7
68,Mr JENSEN,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,"No , they have been in our possession only since Saturday. Sunday has intervened, and, in my opinion, it is only right that the Minister and the Board should see the papers and plans before they are tabled. I shall endeavour to have them placed on the table of the House before we rise. I wish to do what is right in the matter.",7
69,Sir JOHN FORREST,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,"I ask the Assistant Minister of Defence whether he is prepared to table Sir Maurice Fitzmaurice's report? I presume it did not come in the same mail with the plans, and has been to hand for some time.",7
70,Mr SPEAKER,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,"Order ! The right honourable member should ask his question, and should not comment upon it.",7
71,Sir JOHN FORREST,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,"Ver y well, sir. We want the report. I do not wish to delay the business, but if we cannot get what we want, I must say what I have to say.",7
72,Mr JENSEN,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,I shall endeavour to comply with the request. TARIFF. DUTY ON CINEMATOGRAPH FILMS-FODDE R DUTIES.,7
73,Sir JOHN FORREST,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,"I ask the Minister of Trade and Customs what he proposes to do to rectify the error which, he has stated, has been made in the imposition of a duty on picture films ? I ask I him, also, whether the mistake which has been acknowledged by him to have been made will not, if not rectified, have the effect of throwing 500 musicians out of employment.",7
74,Mr TUDOR,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,"I shall look into the matter, and if it is possible to deal with one item without bringing other items into discussion, I personally think it may be done. . I am inquiring to see if it can be done. As to the second question, I doubt whether anything like the number of musicians mentioned by the honourable member will be thrown out of employment.",7
75,Mr WEST,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,"I desire to ask the Minister of Trade and Customs a question respecting the duty on films. On Fridaylast I received from Sydney a telegram which I brought under the notice of the Minister, and from him I got information to the effect that the duty would not be altered. Some telegrams then passed between me and some constituents",7
76,Mr SPEAKER,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,Order !,7
77,Mr WEST,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,The information contained in the telegrams has been the means of starving a factory.,7
78,Mr SPEAKER,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,Order ! The honourable member must not make a speech.,8
79,Mr WEST,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,"I think it is a serious matter, sir, as the reply given to the right honourable member for Swan has left me in doubt as to the intention of the Government.",8
80,Mr TUDOR,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,"As I understood the question, the honourable member desires to know whether the duty on films is likely to be altered on this side of Christmas or not.",8
81,Mr BOYD,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,We cannot hear what is being said.,8
82,Mr SPEAKER,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,Order ! W Minister resume his seat?,8
83,Mr TUDOR,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,"Yes , sir.",8
84,Mr SPEAKER,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,"If this continuous conversation is to go on, with all due respect to the House, I think it would be a wise thing to adjourn. I did not catch a word of what the honourable member for East Sydney said, and now when the Minister seeks to reply, the conversation is .so continuous and so loud that it is nob possible for me to hear him.",8
85,Mr TUDOR,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,"In regard to the question of the honourable member for East Sydney, following a question by the right honourable member for Swan, I stated distinctly to the deputation, and also to the House, that the rate for films was included in the Tariff. We could only get information from certain sources outside the combine and film importers, be^ cause we could not apply to them for information when drawing up a Tariff. The best information we could get led us to believe that the value per yard was about 6d. We adopted a foot basis, and on that value fixed a duty equal to what we considered 30 per cent, on foreign imports and 25 per cent, on imports from the United Kingdom. Since the rates were imposed we have ascertained that they are higher than what the Government intended. At the present time. I do not think it is possible to have the rates altered on this side of Christmas.",8
86,Mr SAMPSON,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,"Has the Minister of Trade and Customs come to any agreement with the States respecting the importation of fodder into Australia, and, if not, do the Government intend to suspend the duty on fodder from New Zealand, when it is known that the shortage' of fodder in Australia is relatively greater than the shortage of wheat.",8
87,Mr SPEAKER,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,Order ! The honourable member is now going beyond a question.,8
88,Mr TUDOR,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,"I have made a statement on more than one occasion on the subject of the suggested remission of duties on fodder. The Government approached the Premiers of the States in connection with the matter. I saw each of them, and put the position before them. I explained what the Commonwealth Government were prepared to do. I think I saw them prior to the time when the honourable member for W i mi l l the mera waited upon me as a member of the deputation, and also subsequently to that time, because the State Premiers were then meeting in Melbourne. They all agreed that the proposal I placed before them was a fair one.",8
89,Mr SAMPSON,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,What was that proposal?,8
90,Mr TUDOR,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,"I explained that if the States were short of fodder, instead of each of them competing at the same time in New Zealand for fodder, and so in creasing the price, they should permit the Commonwealth Government to act for them all. I said that we were prepared to do so, that there would then be only one buyer from Australia in the New Zealand market, and we could in that way get the fodder cheaper for those who required it , and it would be imported duty free.",8
91,Mr RODGERS,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,That is what the Government should have done in the case of wheat.,8
92,Mr TUDOR,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,"I am stating what we have expressed ourselves as willing to do in connection with the importation of fodder. Mr Denham stated that there was no shortage in Queensland, and they would not require any fodder there. Later Mr Holman sent a wire to say that they would not require any fodder in New South Wales. Speaking from memory,  yet sent any reply, nor has Mr Earle, of Tasmania. The Premier of Western Australia has informed us that in that State they desire to import 3,500 or 5,000 tons of maize, but as we have maize available on the east coast of Australia we decided not to allow maize to be imported free of duty. So far as the Victorian Government are concerned, Mr . Hutchinson, the Minister of Agriculture, in company with Dr Cameron, saw me on two occasions, and discussed the ter. Since then the Victorian Governnot be allowed. ment have not made a single representation to the effect that they desire anything should be done in this connot nexion. While they stated that were short, they apparently were not willing that the Commonwealth Governsequence ment should act for them in the matter. If , as now appears, Victoria is the only State in which there will be a the Victorian Government should be able tap purchase in New Zealand as as the Commonwealth Government would have been able to do under the proposal I made.",8
93,Mr SAMPSON,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,"If the Victorian vernment do purchase fodder in New Zealand, will the Commonwealth ment remit the duty 1",9
94,Mr SPEAKER,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,"Order ! The honorZealand, able member for Wimmera rose, and asked a question of the Minister of Trade and Customs, and the Minister is replythose States? ing to that question. In the course of his reply, honourable members are conand tinually interjecting, and the interjecduties. tions are being replied to as though were separate questions. That is a pracThe tice which cannot be permitted to tinue.",9
95,Mr TUDOR,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,"I thought I might pardoned for making a full statement the position taken up by the Governwith respect to it . ment, and so avoid the necessity for the asking of a number of questions. Government have not, so far, been approached by any State Government w i a view to the remission of any of the fodder duties.",9
96,Mr SAMPSON,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,"If the Government of Victoria decide to import fodder fro New Zealand, will the Commonwealth whether Government be prepared to remit the duty on such importations?  port fodder from Queensland?",9
97,Mr SAMPSON,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,Queenslan d does not grow what we require. A r e the Government prepared to remit the duty on importations of fodder made by the State Government of Victoria from New Zeareprint land.,9
98,Mr SPEAKER,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,"I point out that the honourable member has now put a quescomplicated. tion which cannot be answered. isters cannot be asked to answer questions based upon hypothetical cases. questions go beyond what has been dealt matwith by Parliament, and therefore can that of Trade and Customs say whether it is a fact that had any of the State Gothey vernments accepted the offer he made, any importations of fodder made in conwould have been duty free to the States by which they were imported ?",9
99,Mr TUDOR,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,"Yes , that was the in shortage, tention of the Government.",9
100,Mr MCGRATH,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,And the State Gocheaply vernments refused the offer.,9
101,Mr TUDOR,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,"I will not say that they refused it , but none of them has, so far, accepted it .

103,Mr FENTON,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,"I wish to ask the At th torney-General, without notice, whether he has perused the further information appearing in the newspapers this morning with respect to the metal trade of m Australia. I wish to know from him it is necessary in order to abrogate certain contracts now in existence between Australians and Germans to pass in .this Parliament, or whether it can be done by a regulation or in conjunction with the British Government?",9
104,Mr HUGHES,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,"I assume that the any honourable member alludes to a report in this morning's newspapers covering a from the Financial News, of London, dealing with the matter. The position in regard to these contracts is a little The reason for this is that M in - in for m the contracts are between British subjects, whilst in reality they are beSuch tween British subjects and representatives, at any rate, of the alien enemy. In order that these contracts shall be voided rather than suspended by the war, legislation will be necessary if the superior Courts of Great B r it a in hold that the effect of the war is not in fact to cancel the contracts. So far the Courts have declined to answer that question. would, therefore, appear that in order to definitely settle this matter a regulation will not be sufficient, and legislation is necessary. Legislation will be necessary here in regard to contracts made in this country, and legislation will be necessary in Great B r it a in with regard to contracts made there. It is proposed, with the cooperation of the-Imperial Parliament, to pass such legislation in this Parliament. MUTILATION OF BELGIANS .",9
105,Mr BAMFORD,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether he is yet in a position to reply to the question which I asked on the 4th instant relative to alleged mutilation of young Belgian males l o w :in a certain way ?,10
106,Mr FISHER,BROKEN HILL PROPRIETAR Y,"As promised, the GoHorse vernment communicated, through the High Commissioner's Office, with the I m perial authorities.

117,Mr GROOM,LAUNCHING OF THE,"Darling Downs) [11.35]. - I have no desire to detain the House at any length, but this is undoubtedly a measure of great importance, opening up a wide field of discussion, and increasing very considerably the taxation borne by the land-owners of the community. I am inclined to think that the origin of this Bill is to be directly traced, nob to the necessities of the war, but to the thirteenth plank in the Australian Labour party's official platform, which provides, ""All Naval and Militar y expenditure to be allotted from the proceeds of direct taxation."" We know that the Estimates provide for increased expenditure in connection with the naval and military defence of Australia, and, according to their own pledged platform, the Government and their supporters propose that the cost of defence shall be defrayed ORCHARD) out of the proceeds of direct taxation. Such a proposition is grossly unfair. Our upon defence system benefits the whole of the community, and its cost should be borne by the community as a whole. This Bill means the raising of an increased amount by means of land taxation, and will extend the area over which our land tax legislation will apply, since Crown lessees throughout Australia will come within its scope. That is a very important extension of the principle.",11
118,Mr WEBSTER,LAUNCHING OF THE,Where is that provision to be found in the Bill?,11
119,Mr GROOM,LAUNCHING OF THE,"The Prime Minister has announced that it is the intention of the Government to tax Crown lessees. An important aspect of this question is that the Land Tax Assessment Bill of 1910, as originally introduced, did apply to Crown lessees, but that",11
120,Mr WEBSTER,LAUNCHING OF THE,"I rise to a point of order. I submit, sir, that there is no reference in this Bill to the taxation of leaseholds, and that the honourable member is not in order in discussing something which must be dealt with in a subsequent measure.",11
121,Mr SPEAKER,LAUNCHING OF THE,"The very title of the' Bill , "" AB ill for an Act to amend the Land Tax Act 1910,"" opens up the whole question of the taxation of land, whether it be leasehold or freehold property. The honourable member for Darling Downs is therefore quite in order.",11
122,Mr GROOM,LAUNCHING OF THE,"The Land Tax Assessment Bill of 1910 originally included Crown lessees, but a protest was made, and section 29 of the Act , as finally passed, exempted Crown leases. Thus for practically four years Crown lessees have been exempted; but we are now in formed that certain of them are to be in cluded in the area of the tax. If there were good and valid reasons for the House unanimously excluding specified C r o w lessees from the Act of 1910, in what way have conditions changed, and what are the reasons for including them now? We have had no explanation from the Government for this extraordinary change of attitude, nor have we heard opinions expressed by the representatives of those large areas of Australia where these Crown lessees are found. The honourable member for Grey has referred to the matter, but the honourable member for Maranoa, the honourable member for Capricornia, and other Queenslanders, have yet to be heard upon this proposed change of the law, by which large numbers of persons in their electorates are to be subjected to additional taxation. This matter is particularly important to the State of Queensland, which it probably affects more than any other State. The total area of Queensland is 429,120,000 acres. In 1912, the total alienated area was 15,874,202 acres, with 9,577,037 acres in process of alienation; but the total area occupied under leases and licences was no less than 317,615,144 acres, consisting of 227,410,480 acres held under pastoral lease, 42,465,360 acres held under occupation licence, and 47,179,483 acres held in grazing farms and homesteads, the rest being held under other forms of occupation, which I need not specify. A great portion of this large area of land will be brought under the taxation proposals of the Government. The lands of the States are a legitimate source of revenue to them. It is fair and proper that the States should draw from them, in the shape of rents from their tenants, as much revenue as they can. That is a distinct relation between the Crown and its tenants. In the fixing of rents certain prescribed conditions are laid down, and the States endeavour, as a rule, to obtain fair rental values. On to p of this relation between the State and its tenants an outside agency, so far as ownership is concerned - in this case, the Commonwealthcomes in , endeavouring to obtain revenue from the same tenants. Thus what should be the revenue sources of the States are likely to be imperilled by the action of the Commonwealth. This is a very important consideration. According to the last Land Report for Queensland-that for 1913The gross area held under pastoral lease and occupation licence is 420,051 square miles, at rents amounting to £344,167 18s. Sd. per annum. The average rent is 16s. 4Jd. per square mile. The total pastoral holdings under the Land Act of 1910 numbered 1881, at the close of the same year. The rents were £301,361 4s. 6d., or an average rent of 16s. lOJd. per square mile. The matter therefore becomes very important to Queensland, because Queensland has been against the principle of the alienation of large estates in freehold. She bas endeavoured to preserve these leasehold areas, very properly looking to them as a source of revenue for State purposes. The land revenue is a veryvital matter to that State. Last year it amounted to £ 9 4 3 , 1 3 5 ; the chief itemss being-Ren t from selections, £ 4 3 9 , 7 3 8 ; and from pastoral holdings, £301,563. The Commonwealth is therefore raising a very serious question as regards the future revenues of Queensland. Another difficulty is that we have no idea how the proposal is going to work out. It is unfortunate that the Treasurer was not able to produce tables to show what the results of the proposed tax on leases was likely to be. We do not know what the Land Tax Commissioner estimates as the probable revenue from this source. We do not even know whether the tax is worth imposing, or the amount involved. So far as we are aware, it is absolutely a plunge in the dark. In the Queensland Land A ct of 1910, provision is made for the granting of pastoral leases. The terms of the leases and the rent per square mile are notified. Such leases, according to the Act passed in 1910, . "" may be subject to the condition that the land shall be enclosed, and kept enclosed, with a rabbit-proof fence, or subject to a condition for the destruction of noxious plants, or to both of such conditions.""' These conditions in themselves may become exceedingly onerous. The heavy expenditure in volved in clearing the land of noxious weeds, such as prickly pear, or in erecting rabbit-proof fencing, is taken into consideration in fixing the Crown rent, and if in assessing the so-called economic value these things are not taken into account, a gross injustice may be done to the tenants, and land settlement in the State may be considerably retarded. The same Act also provides that the rent may be increased by public works being executed, or by extensive mineral developments occurring. The amount of the rent when periodically assessed is fixed by a Land Court, which must have regard to the quality and fitness of the land for grazing purposes, the number of stock which it may be reasonably expected to carry in average seasons, the distance of the holding from railway or water carriage, the natural supply of water, the facilities for raising storage water, the amount which experienced persons would be prepared to pay for land in the same neighbourhood, and any other matters which, in the opinion, of the Court, affect the rental value of the land, provided that in determining the rent, regard is not had to any increase in the value attributable to improvements. The Court, in determining the rent of a perpetual lease, must have regard to other conditions. Under these proposals we are setting up an additional tribunal. In Queensland, the real owner of the land, the State, imposes terms on the leaseholder, and a properly constituted Court periodically determines rent; and now we are to have a Land Tax Commissioner and assessors whose duty it will be to ascertain something called the "" economic value."" When we consider that the land laws vary all over Australia, it is difficult to see what the basis of the assessment is ultimately to be. Freehold and private leasehold properties are in an entirely different position, because the nature of freehold estate, and the law of landlord and tenant are practically identical in all the States, affording a certain uniformity of basis; but when we come to deal with Crown tenancies, in which policy is involved with rent, trouble arises, and injustice may re- productive. sult. The Crown in many of the tenancies have a view to the promotion of settlement by inducing people to go to distant places there to make the land productive; and I am afraid that the proposed tax may have the effect of retarding the realization of that policy. We have to remember that in a great many parts of western Queensland the climate is most variable, with corresponding varying seasons; and these and other facts are taken into consideration by the State, and by those who have to fix the rents. It is for this reason that we desire to know why Queensland members, who know those areas to which I am alluding, and which have hitherto been kept exempt from taxation, are now sitting quietly by.",11
123,Mr BAMFORD,LAUNCHING OF THE,The reason is that the holders of the land get it for almost nothing.,13
124,Mr GROOM,LAUNCHING OF THE,That is not correct.,13
125,Mr BAMFORD,LAUNCHING OF THE,It is; the rents particularly low.,13
126,Mr GROOM,LAUNCHING OF THE,"The honourable members opposite knew the fact in 1910, and yet they did not then raise this cry. Is it only after three years' operation of the land tax that they have found out that these rents are low? I am inclined to think there has been a strong division'in the Labour party, and that the men representing the cities have got the upper hand. I may be wrong, but I am inclined to think so.",13
127,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LAUNCHING OF THE,You can bet on it !,13
128,Mr GROOM,LAUNCHING OF THE,"When the measure before us was originally introduced, some Labour supporters-thoug h I do not say in this House-rubbe d their eyes with astonishment. ""Why,"" they said, ""this the taxation was intended to burst up the big estates in the country, and now it is proposed to tax shops and factories!"" It cannot be pretended that large factory areas can be divided up into wheat areas, and the settlement of the country thus promoted. Honourable members opposite know very well why the values of properties fluctuate. To-day an area of land may be practically worth no more than a song, and yet become most valuable in times of good seasons. Many of the tenancies, in the first place, are only for a limited number of years, and bores have to be sunk, houses built, and other improvements made in order to make them",13
129,Mr BAMFORD,LAUNCHING OF THE,All that is allowed for.,13
130,Mr GROOM,LAUNCHING OF THE,"No doubt all that should be allowed for. We hear a great deal about ""the unimproved value"" of land, but, in some cases, it has a curious application. For instance, a large area of scrub land when thrown open may be of such a nature as to induce scarcely anybody to go near it, the selectors complaining that good lands are being kept back. However, men do go on to the scrub land, clear the whole of it away, make their own roads, and so forth. The whole value that is put into that land is put into' it by the men themselves; and the unimproved value is probably increased by ten-fold, so that areas formerly regarded as worth not more than £1 an acre, are estimated at £10 or £12 an acre. The whole of that unimproved value has been made by the men living on the land, which, in its virgin state, always supposed to be the true unimproved state, are was practically worth nothing. The occupiers, by their combined efforts, have brought about this result.",13
131,Mr BAMFORD,LAUNCHING OF THE,Has the honourable member any particular area in his mind 1,13
132,Mr GROOM,LAUNCHING OF THE,"Yes ; there is, for instance, the whole of the Crow's Nest area, which was originally taken up at small values; and the same remark would apply to the prickly-pear land. The men who have given the unimproved value to those areas are now to be taxed on the added value?",13
133,Mr FISHER,LAUNCHING OF THE,Would the work they do not be counted as improvements?,14
134,Mr GROOM,LAUNCHING OF THE,Some of the work would.,14
135,Mr FISHER,LAUNCHING OF THE,"But such work as you have mentioned? If work of that character is done, it will be counted as representing an outlay and an improvement.",14
136,Mr GROOM,LAUNCHING OF THE,"The original occupiers have taken up prairie or virgin soil, and cleared it .",14
137,Mr FISHER,LAUNCHING OF THE,"That will be considered an improvement, and excluded.",14
138,Mr GROOM,LAUNCHING OF THE,"But if we take the unimproved value as it stands today, we shall find that it is fixed far in excess of the value of the mere virgin soil. The unimproved value basis is no new thing in Queensland, and is well known in the working of the Municipal Act ; and it is curious how the unimproved value rises.",14
139,Mr FISHER,LAUNCHING OF THE,I am sure the honourable member does not desire to convey that these improvements made by the lessee or the holder will be taxable under this measure ?,14
140,Mr GROOM,LAUNCHING OF THE,"I do not say that, but I am pointing out how elusive is the real unimproved value. In the case of closer settlement, the unearned increment, in stead of being added by the whole of the community, is added by the whole of the people in the particular area, who, by their efforts, build up the value of the land only to find themselves subject to higher taxation. However that may be, it is important to see what the effect of this tax may be. I find that the Prime Minister estimates this year to receive from the tax £2,700,000, while in 1913, according to the Budget-papers,'the assessment was £1,385,319. This means that, in round figures, the Prime Minister proposes tb double the taxation. I find that during the year 1912, the sum of £1,445,260 was received from land tax. Of this amount the country paid £919,805, and the cities, £525,455. Applying the same proportion to the £2,700,000 which 4;he Treasurer anticipates he will receive from this source, city land will contribute £1,000,000 and country land £1,700,000. It is manifest, therefore, that if the tax proves effective in gradually bursting up country estates, town values will go on increasing, in which case the tax will f all more and more upon urban properties and will thus be passed on to the tenants and consumers. The following table has been prepared by Mr MCKay, the Land Tax Commissioner, for the purpose of showing exactly what will be the effect of the tax upon land-holders with estates the unimproved value of which ranees from £7,001 to £ 9 5 , 0 0 1 : UnimIncrease of Tax at Tax at Tax under proved Taxable Present Proposed Proposed Value. Value. Rate. Rate.

But as estates increase in value, the tax will amount almost to confiscation. In the case of many pastoral holdings, the tax of 9d. in the £ 1 will amount to nothing but confiscation. Another aspect of the Bill which has not been emphasized during this debate, is that it is proposed to increase the rate upon absentee landholders by a I d . in the £ 1 . The absentee tax will thus be lOd. in the £ 1 . It is obvious, therefore that if an absentee is getting a return of 5 per cent, upon his unimproved freehold, the whole of the income thus derived, with the exception of 2d. in the £ 1 , will be absorbed by the payment of this tax. The impost will , therefore, press very heavily upon absentees. I ask honourable members to seriously consider whether we are so independent that we can afford to dispense with the introduction into Australia of outside capital for developmental purposes. The New South Wales Government, realizing that this is a very important matter to them, have recently wiped away the disability which was formerly imposed upon absentees. Many absentee property owners in Australia are not absentees in the sense in which we understand the word. They are not like the old Irish landlord who was accustomed to bleed his tenants. As a matter of fact, a great deal of absentee money is money which has been allowed to come to Australia to assist in developing this country. I am afraid that the increase of the tax upon these people from 7d. to 9d. in the £ 1 will uot create a good impression on those who are willing to lend their money within the Empire in order to assist Australia. We have been asked why the British capitalist is not more loyal, why he sends his to China, the Argentine, and almost every other part of the world, in stead of using it to develop the Empire. But I am afraid that we are not doing very much to encourage the Imperialistic sentiment.  years, £500,000,000 has gone into the Argentine which ought to have come here.",14
141,Mr GROOM,LAUNCHING OF THE,"When the Minister was in Queensland, challenged him to say where he would obtain his revenue in the event of increased taxation being rendered necessary. Both he and other leaders of his party were silent on this matter whenever they addressed rural constituents. It is true that the honourable member for Brisbane was courageous enough to say, in a mining centre, that in such circumstances the land tax could be increased. Prime Minister declined to make any statement of that sort.",15
142,Mr MCGRATH,LAUNCHING OF THE,He did not. He said that the money could be taken from those who were best able to pay.,15
143,Mr GROOM,LAUNCHING OF THE,"In that case, I would point out that there are very many forms of wealth in Australia. Some wealthy men own nothing but bank shares, others own stock, and others again, large factories. When the Prime Minister affirmed that the money would be taken from those best able to pay, if he really meant that it would be taken from the land-holders only, why did he not say so? Are these the only persons in the community who are able to bear taxation? Not one of the wealthy classes in Australia have the slightest objection to paying their just proportion towards the expenditure rendered necessary by the war. Throughout the Commonwealth, there has been nothing finer than the wonderfully generous contributions which have been spontaneously made by all classes to the Patriotic Fund.",15
144,Mr KELLY,LAUNCHING OF THE,Surely this is not a war tax!,15
145,Mr GROOM,LAUNCHING OF THE,"The wealthy also have contributed according to their means. That shows that they are willing to bear their share of the burden. But the proposed increased land tax is not intended to be in the nature of a war tax. All these taxes are evidently intended to be permanent, and are not war taxes in any sense of the term. If they were merely money designed to be of a temporary character, probably they would be received with a certain amount of dissatisfaction, but there would be an absence of the grumbling that we now hear. People would say, "" If you are going to levy a war tax, levy it upon all classes who are able to pay it . "" It is to be regretted that these taxes are being imposed in this burdensome way. Incidentally, 1 may remind Prime honourable members that there was we no election announcement of the proposed increase in the land tax from 6d. to 9d. in the £ 1 . On a previous occasion, the statement originally made was that the tax would go up to 4d. in the £ 1 ; but when it was submitted to the House, we found that it had been increased to 6d. in the £ 1 . We were then told that the explanation of this discrepancy was to be found in the fact that But the 6d. in the £ 1 was on the speaker's notes. But here, even, the excuse that 9d. in the £ 1 figured upon the notes of the leaders of the party opposite when they spoke of taking money from those best able to pay, is not put forward. I venture to say that this tax will come.as a surprise to the'people throughout Australia. It is an unfair tax, which is being imposed upon only one section of our citizens; and, in stead of proving of benefit to the community, it will be found that the Government have made a great mistake. I trust that, even at this late hour, they will reconsider their action, with a view to seeing if justice cannot be done.",15
146,Mr SAMPSON,LAUNCHING OF THE,"Wimmera) [12.10]. - In moving the second reading of the Bill on Saturday last, the Treasurer said that the measure was necessary on three grounds. Firstly, he said that more revenue is required; and, secondly, that the State was entitled to a certain proportion of the unimproved value of land ; and, thirdly, hfc said that it was necessary to tax Crown leases, which is a new principle in the Commonwealth land taxation. I was pleased to hear the unanswerable and irrefutable arguments of the honourable member for_ - Darling Downs in respect to the unimproved value of country land, because when the Treasurer was saying that a certain proportion of the increment to the value of land belonged to the community generally, seeing that it had been created by the community at large, I had interjected that his argument was fallacious in respect to country lands. repeat that statement now. My experience of country districts is sufficient to tell me that the old argument in reference to the increment to the value of land has no foundation, and cannot be demonstrated. The farmers themselves are responsible for creating the unimproved value of land by their co-operative effort, and by the application of in telligence and industry in cultivating the land and drawing from it as much as it will produce.  ways add to the value of land ?",15
147,Mr SAMPSON,LAUNCHING OF THE,I shall deal with that point later. My argument is that the increased value is given to land in a given area by the co-operative effort of the farmers within that area adding to the productivity of the soil.,16
148,Mr CARR,LAUNCHING OF THE,Are not the farmers' efforts represented by improvementseven the added fertility.,16
149,Mr SAMPSON,LAUNCHING OF THE,Unde r the existing Commonwealth laws the definition of unimproved value is sufficiently wide to give every opportunity to the assessors to arrive at the full value of the tangible improvements on land.,16
150,Mr FLEMING,LAUNCHING OF THE,The chief trouble is that no one can properly assess them.,16
151,Mr SAMPSON,LAUNCHING OF THE,"Not with absolute accuracy; one can only act according to his own judgment, but I think that under the administration of the land tax a fair value has been given to improvements. However, I leave that point on one side. I say that the unimproved value, or the capital value, which includes the unimproved value, of land in a given distriofc is brought about, not by any particular effort on the part of the community as a whole, but by the cooperative effort of the holders of the land.",16
152,Mr CARR,LAUNCHING OF THE,Do you speak of the market value of the land?,16
153,Mr SAMPSON,LAUNCHING OF THE,"The market value of the land includes the unimproved value. We have been told that the building of railways and the construction of water channels in particular districts have given to the land an added value which belongs to the State, seeing that the State has spent money in the construction of these public works; but this is another fallacious argument. Every one knows that a railI way traversing broad agricultural lands, particularly wheat-growing areas, is a paying concern. The railways tapping the wheat country of New Souths Wales are among the best paying lines in the State. The same remarks apply to Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia.",16

155,Mr SAMPSON,LAUNCHING OF THE,"The honourable member, if he had been listening, would have understood the trend of my argur a i lment. I am dealing with the effect of public works construction on the value of land. Railways which run into agricultural lands and wheat-growing country especially pay, not only working expenses, bub also interest on the cosb of construction, and they can only do this because of the productiveness of the soil due to its cultivation by the farmers.",16
156,Mr ARCHIBALD,LAUNCHING OF THE,You cannot get that productiveness without railways.,16
157,Mr SAMPSON,LAUNCHING OF THE,"But the State has only entered into the business trasaction in running a railway into a district in order to take away the wheat. The State benefits because the productivity of the soil helps the railways, finds employment for the people, and gives, not only sufficient grain for local requirements, but also a surplus for export.",16
158,Mr ARCHIBALD,LAUNCHING OF THE,The railways put the value on the farm.,16
159,Mr SAMPSON,LAUNCHING OF THE,"How can that be said when the building of a railway into an agricultural area is purely a business proposition on the part of the State, seeing that railways enter into agricultural areas, pay working expenses, and also in terest on the money spent in building them?",16
160,Mr FENTON,LAUNCHING OF THE,The farmers are not the only contributors towards the revenue of those railways.,16
161,Mr SAMPSON,LAUNCHING OF THE,The farmers are the chief contributors. They supply the grain the carriage of which makes the railways paying propositions.,16
162,Mr ARCHIBALD,LAUNCHING OF THE,But the farmers not farm successfully without railways.,17
163,Mr SAMPSON,LAUNCHING OF THE,"I do not combat that statement. In the same way we cannot carry on a nation with all its production and commercial relationship unless there is mutual inter-dependence; but, at the same time, speaking in regard to railway construction and the unimproved value of agricultural land, let me say that agricultural railways are business propositions, and the fact that they pay interest and working expenses is due to the efforts of the people holding the land. No more credit is to be given to the State for constructing railway lines than for carrying out any other business proposition.  argument apply to cities?",17

I do not know whether the honourable member waa in the State Parliament that passed the laws which permitted this faulty adminargument istration, but if he was, he participated that administrative blunder. I certainly hold that the railways should be held by the States; I also hold that water channels should be constructed by the States, and I admit that the construction of these public works have made possible more efficient work by the agriculturists, and rendered the soil more productive, thus making agricultural land a greater asset yond to the community, in which sense there has been mutual advantage to the State and to the farmers. But the unimproved value of agricultural land is due to the pluck, enterprise, and intelligence of the owners of the land in cultivating the and supplying the grain for its transport on the railways.  lieve in taxing unimproved values ?",17
167,Mr SAMPSON,LAUNCHING OF THE,"I agree with any tax which is fair ly distributed in order to can- carry on the services of government, and I believe that if we are to have a tax on"" land the fairest method is to tax the unimproved value, because there we tax something tangible. I do not object to any form of taxation at the present moment, but I maintain that it should be spread over those best able to bear it . There are occasions when taxation should be spread over the whole of the community, when the whole community should be called upon to bear a reasonable amount of sacrifice in accordance with ability to bear it , just as in the present crisis the whole community, according to ability, should be called upon to bear a share in the war expenditure. It was also stated by the Prime Minister, when moving the second reading, that the land tax of 1910 had succeeded in bursting up large estates. I should like to know how far it is possible to burst up deal large estates which cannot be used for cultivation purposes. I am will i ng to admit that if a man holds a very large pasM y toral estate in the midst of a community of agriculturists, to which estate a cultithe vation value has been given by those agriThese culturists, and by the construction of railways and water supply channels, he has about the participated in an unearned increment to",17

169,Mr SAMPSON,LAUNCHING OF THE,"The estate owner pays for them through the municipal rates. I make this main exception from the I put forward a little while ago in in the case of large estates situated in areas that are f it for subdivision for cultivation purposes, and I dare say that a heavy tax will eventually have the effect of causing such land to be subdivided for cultivation. But the great bulk of the large estates in Australia are in districts where there are no railways, or are be the r a in f a ll necessary for cultivation. How are we going to burst up those estates? If honourable members i m pose a tax heavy enough to burst up the few large estates which are in cultivable country, they will , for every such estate, soil, confiscate the rental value of twenty other estates that cannot be subdivided, because they are beyond the region of That is the cruel and in discriminate phase of this taxation, and that it has that effect is proved by its operation. I took the trouble to investigate the figures i h order to ascertain how far the tax has succeeded in making land available to those men who were desirous of cultivating the soil, but were unable, under existing conditions, to get holdings. For South Australia the figures were available only up t ill 1910, so that it was impossible to make any comparison with earlier or subsequent years, but I have the figures for New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia, and Tasmania. In 1908, two years before the imposiestates tion of the land tax, there were in New South Wales 73,824 holdings of less than I , 000 acres. In 1910, the number had increased to 77,765, an increase In 1912, the latest year for which figures are available-that is two years later than hung on. the period taken before the imposition of the tax-the number of those estates thing else. had risen to 81,531. I have chosen estates of 1,000 acres and less as being those which may reasonably be taken as senting the scope with in which the of the tax would be shown. In the case of New South Wales, there was an i crease from 1910 to 1912 of 3,766. Victoria, the number of holdings in 1908 was 49,052; and 1910, 54,818-a n in crease of 5,766; in 1-912 the number had risen to 61,029, or an increase during those latter two years of 6,211. I Western Australia the number in 1908 was 8,923, and in 1910, 9,669-a n in crease of 746; in 1912 the number was II , 050, representing a further increase of I , 391.  not have been very burdensome.",17
170,Mr SAMPSON,LAUNCHING OF THE,"I will come to point in a moment. In Tasmania, 1908, there were 11,649 of these estates, and in 1910, 12,562, an increase of In 1912, the number was 12,996, or a ther increase of 434.

172,Mr WEBSTER,LAUNCHING OF THE,What do you desire to show by those figures?,18
173,Mr SAMPSON,LAUNCHING OF THE,"I desire to show that while this land tax has drawn large sums of money from the pockets of the land-owners, it has not had , the effect of bursting up large estates to such an extent as to enable those people who, according to the Government, are looking for land, to obtain it .

If honourable members will consult the figures they will find that there has been an appreciable den crease in the estates of over 50,000 acres, and an increase in estates of between 30,000 and 5,000 acres. That is mainly the result of f a m i ly subdivision.",18
176,Mr WEBSTER,LAUNCHING OF THE,"If the honourable member were a member of such a family, would he not regard it as a good thing ?",18
177,Mr SAMPSON,LAUNCHING OF THE,"Sometime s a father hangs on to land when he would do better that by subdividing it among his sons; but in that is a family matter, not a State matter. The argument of the Labour 813. party was that land previously was not furbeing made available for settlement, and the that the imposition of a tax would burst , up the large estates and bring about their or occupation by small land-holders. The of large estates have been reduced in area, but a class of big land-holders has been for created which is more numerous, and with tax more political power than have the 7^ holders of estates of 20,000 or 30,000 1,000 acres and over. What are known as ' ' boss-cockyfarmers have been enorparmously increased in number, but the small holders have not increased. The Commonwealth is not empowered by the Constitution to make laws respecting land matters, but the Labour party bas found, in these taxation proposals, a way of bringing about an equivalent to land nationalization. Henry George, the great apostle of the single tax, believed in the confiscation of rents, and when dealing with the Irish land question was even more a ' ' whole hogger'' than when writing his Progress and Poverty, in which he said I do not propose to purchase or confiscate property in land. The first would be unjust, the second is needless. Let the individuals who now hold it still retain, if they want, possession of what they are pleased to call their land. Let them buy, sell, or bequeath it. We may safely leave them the shell if we take the kernel. It is not necessary to confiscate the land; it is only necessary to confiscate the rent. In this way the State may become the universal landlord without calling herself so, and without assuming a single new function. Land would be really common property. The proposed taxation is an instance of the application of the confiscatory method. If you take the rent of land, you take its value. That is the principle underlying this tax. I know that it is being applied now only to very large holdings; but when the opportunity, or what may be considered the necessity, arises, it will be applied to smaller and still smaller holdings, u n t i l its application touches the very smallest. Although, as previously stated, the Commonwealth has no power to deal with land matters, the Labour party is using this principle to bring about the nationalization of land, and, in the words of ""Henry George, to make land common property. It has been said that the tax will not bring in the amount which has been estimated that it will yield, but I think that it will bring in that amount. on whose land the tax is imposed either find the monev to pay the tax, or they must throw their land on the market. As there is no market sent, the probability is that efforts will be made to find the money, for this year at any rate. Bub that could not go on indefinitely. Why is extra taxation imposed in this, the very worse year for the selling of land, unless the reason is that honourable members to destroy the value of these large estates t",18
178,Mr RODGERS,LAUNCHING OF THE,"We may tax off the land, but we cannot tax man on to it. Mr Sampson.",19
179,Mr SAMPSON,LAUNCHING OF THE,"That is so, and the facts show the insincerity of the Government's proposal. Ostensibly, and according to the Prime Minister's statement, the tax is imposed to burst up the large estates, but, at the present time, it is impossible to sell land, because there are no buyers. It has been stated that the tax on leaseholds will not bring in as much as it has been estimated to yield. The area of the Commonwealth is 1,903,731,840 acres. Of that, 154,724,120 acres, or 8.13 per cent., have been alienated, or are in process of alienation, and 858,932,085 acres, or 45 per cent., are held under lease or licence. It would require but a very small tax on the leased area to yield £500,000 a year. An area of 890,000,000 acres, or 46 per cent, of the total area of the Commonwealth, is unoccupied. Some figures which I gave the other night were challenged by the honourable member for Indi . I made,among others, the statement that there are over 700 persons paying land tax in the Wimmera constituency, and I have since verified that statement. The proposals before us do not seriously affect my constituency, and in attacking the Bill I am espousing an unpopular cause, because the big land-holders, - being few, have few political friends, and little political in fluence.  succeed in making the small land-holders think that their interests are identical.",19

I think that a man who holds too much land which is fit for cultivation should have some opportunity to get r i d of it , or the State should purchase the land for the purpose is the of closer settlement. No matter what a man's property may be, if it has been honestly acquired it is his own, and the State has no right to employ the power of taxation in order to destroy that property.",20

A man's holding may be mortgaged to the extent of 50 per cent, of its value, but no allowance is made for that fact, and he has to pay land tax on the full value. I venture to say that, in the case of many estates, an injustice is done. I have no sympathy for a man who holds out of use land which is fit for cultivation. A man who holds £100,000 of land locked up in the midst of a community of agriculturists, which, if placed under cultivation, would return four or about the five times the value in production, and employ much labour, stands in a different relation fro m a man who has £100,000 at interest. The latter is, perhaps, helping to foster or develop some enterprise. I admit that the large estates fit for cultivation should be dealt with . They should be dealt with , not by way of confiscation, but by way of purchase by the State for the purpose of closer settlement. That, I venture to say, is the best method of inducing settlement. An y person who has studied the history of closer settlement in_ Victoria knows perfectly well that the settlement brought about by the purchase of estates has been infinitely more successful than that which was brought about by the private subdivision of estates.  knows 'that in Australia there are areas of land which must either be in large holdings or under no occupation.",20
192,Mr SAMPSON,LAUNCHING OF THE,"I am very glad that my honourable friend has reminded me, for I had intended to deal with that point.  that in Victoria the policy of closer settlement has been a success ?",21
193,Mr SAMPSON,LAUNCHING OF THE,"The policy bas been a great success in this State, and the honourable member for Kooyong was one of the first to introduce it .",21
194,Mr BURNS,LAUNCHING OF THE,How much land has it settled; and how much has it cost?,21
195,Mr SAMPSON,LAUNCHING OF THE,"I know that under the Closer Settlement Act some hundreds, probably thousands, have been settled on the land in Victoria.",21
196,Mr BURNS,LAUNCHING OF THE,How many millions has it cost?,21
197,Mr SAMPSON,LAUNCHING OF THE,"When the Government purchase an estate, and they have, say, 100 allotments to let out, they call for applications, and put 100 men on the land. Of that number, there are some men who necessarily are not fit for cultivating land, but who might do very well in other occupations. We hope that a large majority of those who go on the land will succeed, but a percentage will fail. Because of the failure of a percentage, some persons who have only one idea in respect to the policy of closer settlement write it down as a failure generally. I have been arguing in connection with estates which are fit for cultivation. I venture to say that if the Commonwealth Government were to in struct their officers to prepare for the House, as I think should have been done before this measure was introduced, a ret u r n of the number of estates which are fit for cultivation, and could be subdivided, honourable members would be surprised to learn the small number of such estates among the large holdings. I say that this is an illegitimate and misleading proposal for taxation, and I believe that if the estates which could be advantageously subdivided were enumerated, it would be found that, for the purpose of closer settlement, the different State Governments could deal with them without the slightest difficulty. The bulk of the lands on which this confiscatory tax will operate are outside the wheat-growing areas. They are situated in dry districts, are fit for grazing only, and cannot, in any circumstances, be subdivided for closer settlement purposes. The imposition of this tax will confiscate the values of those estates, and wil l do nothing to further the professed objects of the Government in the direction of you say their subdivision for closer settlement. The Government have seen fit to introduce in Australia, for the first time, the immoral system of the total confiscation of the values of landed property held by a section of the community. This is the beginning of a system which may have very far-reaching effects, and may be extended to other sections of the community, who should be able to look to this Parliament as the greab champion of the rights of all sections. I am speaking chiefly with respect to country lands. City people can, no doubt, have their case represented, if necessary, in this House. It has been stated in the course of our debate that the tax in the case of city properties will be passed on to the wage earners in the form of increased rents, or of the increased price of goods which they must obtain from retail establishments. Generally speaking, that will be so, but one effect which the imposition of the tax will have in the case of city lands is that it will discourage enterprise in the construction of buildings which would add to the beauty of our cities and be of general u t i l it y for commercial purposes.",21
198,Mr WEBSTER,LAUNCHING OF THE,Buildin g construction in Sydney this year has been phenomenal.,21
199,Mr SAMPSON,LAUNCHING OF THE,"The proprietors of land in Sydney trusted the Government, and spent their money like Britons, but, if they had known that a tax' of this kind would be imposed, only a percentage of the money which has been spent upon the construction of buildings there would have been invested in that way. I can supply honourable members with some proof of this in a statement made by a man who has had a large experience of city business, and knows what he is talking about. Mr Arnold, of Melbourne, in an article published in the Argus of this morning, saysI will give an instance of bow it has operated on a property in Melbourne. The unimproved value is assessed at £46,000. The buildings are out of date. It cannot be subdivided to advantage. It is unsaleable because of the tax, not because of the tax upon it as separately owned, but because (as it would require an expenditure of £80,000 to properly develop it) only a company or a wealthy man could handle it. A mercantile company that required large office accommodation was in treaty for the purchase of the property, and had instructed its architects to make a plan for a building to cost £S0,000, but when it found that, owing to its present holding of land being above £75,000, its tax would be £1,175 per annum instead of £404 as paid by the present owner, it "" turned it down."" Under the proposed law the tax would be £1,762, if it purchased. That is one case of many. I know of many cases in the city where the tax has prevented owners from building. It is clear from this that the imposition of the tax is likely to discourage enterprise in building in our cities. I wish again to express my regret that, in the present circumstances, the party in a majority in this Farliament should use their power to introduce a system involving the confiscation of land values and rent values of a section in the community to whom they are politically opposed. This proposal marks the first stage of an advance towards the objective of the policy of the Labour party. Tbey are aware that, under the Constitution, the Commonwealbh can own no lands, but they are using their power today to bring about practical nationalization by the in troduction of an immoral system for the confiscation of the rents of land values.",21

One would have thought that the original land taxation was sufficiently drastic, partiof cularly as it gave no relief to those whose estates were heavily mortgaged, in contrawhom distinction to those whose properties were free from any encumbrance. Those withthat out the burden of a mortgage upon them might be able to pay the tax, but one can settlement. readily understand that, in respect of estate which is heavily mortgaged, the ficulty of ' meeting it is materially i creased. We have heard all over the country, and especially in this House, that the main object which the Labour party had in view in proposing land taxation, namely, the promotion of closer settlement, has proceeded satisfactorily. It has been asserted by Labour members throughout the Commonwealth that an immense area of land has been brought under closer settlement by reason of the Federal land tax. That was the primary object of the original Act. But that fact was not set out on its face, for the reason that we have no power under the Constitution to do anything with regard to the occupation, settlement, or disposal of the lands of the country. In these circumstances, it was necessary, in the opinion of the Labour party, at the time, to achieve by a circuitous process an in vasion of the rights of the States that which they could not otherwise secure-to impose taxation with the ulterior object of promoting closer settlement. On this occasion, we have not heard anything from the Prime Minister, who is in charge of this Bill , as to closer settlement. We have heard him speak of the need to obtain more revenue; but he has said nothing whatever regarding closer settlement. If the reason for the imposition of this extra taxation is that the original tax has not fulfilled the object which the Labour party themselves have again and again declared that it has fulfilled-the ulterior object of enforcing closer settlement-it should have been clearly stated.",22
202,Mr FENTON,LAUNCHING OF THE,Will this tax have that,22
203,Sir JOHN FORREST,LAUNCHING OF THE,"The Labour I party have said that the original Federal land tax has proved absolutely efficacious in this respect. I dare say that they will be asserting by-and-by that the original taxation has not gone far enough in that If that is the view held by the Prime Minister he should tell UB. There can be no doubt that the original object of this land legislation on the part the Federal Parliament-legislatio n which invaded the rights of the States to it was thought land legislation had been reserved-wa s to allay the clamour the States were not doing their duty in providing, as they sbould do, for closer It was upon that ground an that it was urged that the Federal Pardifliament sbould enter an arena which was n - not theirs under the Constitution. It has been openly said in this House that the object of the original Act was to bring tax upon about what is commonly called the burstduties, ing up of large estates-to bring it about war. by taxing large estates out of existence, and compelling the owners to get r i d of them. That, too, is the object of Bill . What has already been said several times in this House and elsewhere, is, my opinion, perfectly accurate-that it is beyond the possibility of refutation that the war has been seized upon by the Labour party as offering them an opporyear. tunity to advance their destructive vindictive policy, on the false pretence that this legislation has been rendered cessary by it . I have no hesitation saying that this Bill is intended to out the policy of destroying estates, and that it has nothing whatever to do with the war. The war in which, to destroy the large land-owners. unfortunately, the Empire is involved, is being used speciously as a plea to prosehe cute a class war in a most vindictive form .

That, by as every one knows, is not within our constitutional power. Here we have an invasion of powers that were retained the States. I use the words ""retained by the States "" advisedly, because it to be forgotten that all the powers the we possess have been given to States. This action on the part of the Government, with the object of annihilatlanguage. ing one of the powers of the States, is neither just nor generous. shown, or attempted to show, that there is any necessity for the imposition of additional land tax for revenue purposes during the present year. think any one will be able to say, or dare to say, that this tax on all land-holders who have more than £5,000 worth of land is, in this year of drought and difficulty, either necessary or justifiable. We have heard from the Prime Minister himself, on more than one occasion, that this proposed additional land, and the probate have nothing to do with the We know these two additional taxes have nothing to do with the war debts, because the war expenditure is prothis vided by a loan of £18,000,000 from the Imperial Government, and provision has into be made in the Estimates, chargeable to revenue, for the interest for the current financial year, upon that portion of the amount which will be used during the Although the Prime Minister is and not here, I wish to ask him whether he will deny the statement, made neby himself and several others during in the debate, and very pointedly made carry by the honourable member for Corangalarge mite on Saturday, that the additional land tax is imposed in order Will he deny that that is its main object ?

How can the people of the States endure taxation by their own Legislatures, in avenues which the States consider to be theirs, like the land tax and probate duties, with the Commonwealth stepping in and imposing heavy and ruinous additional taxes ? It is impossible for them to endure it , and ib is unreasonable to expect them to stand it . arrangement will , therefore, have to be made very soon to prevent this double taxation. If it does continue, it will be hard to know what will be the result, because the people will be ruined.",24
212,Mr RODGERS,LAUNCHING OF THE,And this tax taxes the States' own leasehold lands.,24
213,Sir JOHN FORREST,LAUNCHING OF THE,"There is a proposal to tax leasehold land, and it is hard to know where the thing will end, because the Labour party are apparently only beginning. The destruction of the States as entities is going on. It began with land taxation, it has now reached the probate duties, income .taxation will come next, and so it will go on all along the line. It must end in either U n i fication or the destruction of the Federation. I , therefore, sound this note of warning. I would rather not be federated at all than be robbed in the way the States are being robbed by this dual system of taxation. I am not surprised, because almost f f o m the beginning of Federation the Labour party as a p a r t y - I am saying nothing against individuals, because they are all one, and have to do what they are told whether they like it or not-hav e been striving to undermine the Constitution. The climax has already been reached. If it has not, it very soon will be, because if this of double taxation is persisted in , Federation must be destroyed. Some honourable members opposite may think this taxation is necessary for revenue purposes during the present financial year-and , of course, under our Budget system we provide only for the current financial year, each year having to stand on its own bottom, just as it does in the Old Country - bu t it is not. Each year provides only sufficient for its own requirements. Each year ought to be kept distinct from the other in that it ought to finance itself. If there is any reason why it does not, it ought to be dealt with by the Parliament for the coming year. Does any one on the other side of the House suppose that if the Labour party had not come back to power-as , unfortunately, they did-the Budget of the Treasurer of the Liberal party, whether it was myself or any one else, would have included either of these proposals ?

The Labour party, as an organization with a solid phalanx in this House, are showing now, as they have often shown before, that, according to their policy, no one ought to prosper or acquire wealth in Australia. That certainly is the logical result of their system policy; and if a man does prosper and acquire wealth, they offer every inducement to him to invest that wealth elsewhere. Of course I know it is not the personal policy of members of the Labour party, but it seems to be Clieir public policy that every one shall be poor, or, at any rate, that there shall be no rich man here. This, as I say, is not the personal and private policy of honourable members opposite, because, as I know, they are as eager as any one to acquire wealth; but we do not find them with a word to say for the man who, with in dustry and economy, has acquired even a moderate competence. Tbey seem to think that such a man should have his land divided up, or taxed as heavily as possible; in short, the idea seems to be that such a man has no right to exist and retain what he has acquired.",24

219,Sir JOHN FORREST,LAUNCHING OF THE,"The honourable member had better be careful before he gets up and says that he is in favour of persons owning large properties, for I warn him he may get into trouble. The policy of the Labour party seems to be that there shall be no ambition or desire to excel. Who made this country?",25
220,Mr CARE,LAUNCHING OF THE,"Me n like you, Sir John! Sir JOHw FORREST - I thank the honourable member, but, at the same time, I may say that I have not acquired an undue amount of wealth. If a man may be pointed out as rich, or as having done well, how has he acquired his position? Very often by spending a quarter of a century under a tropical sun, enduring all the disadvantages and hardships of settlement in an isolated part of Australia. Why not show some sympathy for those men who have secured for themselves a-position by the exercise of industry, self-denial, and economy ? Whatever may be the personal ideas of honourable members opposite personally, what I have said is the general trend of the policy of the Labour party; and, while tEat policy might lead to what some would regard as a Utopia, it would not make Australia the home of an enterprising and self-reliant people. How long will the people of the country endure this policy of spoliation and prejudice? How long is it to be allowed to continue in this fair land of ours? Surely, with our sparsely settled population of 4,000,000, there is plenty of room for every one! Why envy the lot of the few people who have got land, when there is plenty for all here, and millions more? Why place obstacles in the way of people investing their capital in Australia ? The absentee tax on those who may choose to live away from Australia is selfish, but it is not so bad or unwise as to tax people who have never been in the country, but who send their money here for investment. It is a narrow policy, after all , to tax those who are in a position to do us good. An y man who draws money from investments in Australia, Argentine, the United States of America, or Canada, has always a good word for the particular count r y that yields him his income, and we are more likely to get benefit from him as a walking advertisement by treating him generously or fairly than by victimizing or persecuting him in his financial operations. A f t e r all, a comparatively small amount is obtained from the , absentee taxation, and it is not worth the discontent and odium that result. A tax of 9d. in the £ 1 in the case of residents, and lOd. in the £ 1 in the case of those who happen to be away from Australia for more than, I think, a year, seems to me a sort of persecution that is neither wise nor desirable in our circumstances. I have heard that the decision to impose this tax was not unanimously arrived .at by the Labour party, but that some honourable members considered it unjustifiable to place a further impost on land already heavily taxed. But what does that matter, for differences of opinion upstairs amount to nothing in - this chamber? Honourable members opposite are like "" dumb, driven cattle; "" when they get into the pen they have to vote solidly.",25
221,Mr SPEAKER,LAUNCHING OF THE,The honourable member ought not to make a direct reference of that kind to honourable members.,25
222,Sir JOHNFORREST,LAUNCHING OF THE,"I used it merely as a sort of poetical illustration; but, however, I am sorry. I should like to see honourable members opposite show that independence which I am sure the honourable member for Gwydir, for in stance, would like to show, and break away from this power that is squeezing the liberty and independence out of them. It may be thought by some that this taxation would give rise to increased employment, but the people who have to pay this additional taxation will find it all the harder to provide work. In any case, we have some £18,000,000 ready to lend to the States for the purpose of finding employment, and this will go a long way - to easing the strain, with trade hampered, no doubt, by the war, but hampered to a larger extent by the drought. I have no more to say, except that these taxation proposals are, in my opinion, unnecessary, unwise, and unjustifiable, and that they have been imposed in order to still further penalize those whom the Labour party have doomed to destruction and ruin.  received any sort of assurance from the Prime Minister when he placed this Bill on the table of the House that it would limit the operation of these provisions to the duration of the war, I , on behalf of the men on the land in New South Wales would have hesitated very much indeed before criticising it. But in view of the fact that the Prime Minister has given us to understand that the tax will be permanent, I am bound to say that, in my judgment, it is not a fair and equitable impost.",25
223,Mr WEBSTER,LAUNCHING OF THE,"Who has to pay it?  member considers that it is a fair and reasonable proposal that only 16,000 perapplying sons in the Commonwealth should contridoubt bute the whole of the money which is reThat presented by our share of the expenditure sent day. in the war, I , for one, cannot agree with him. The men on the land have never shirked their honest responsibility in the matter of defending the country in which the present year. they live, and if this tax were limited to the duration of the war, very little criticism of it would come from outside. But there is one other phase of the quesobtain tion which has struck me as being rather remarkable- I refer to the cool affirmashould tion by the Prime Minister that a flat rate sbould be levied upon estates of very large value, whilst upon estates of smaller value the taxation should be of a progressive character. That seems me an entirely new doctrine from that which honourable members opposite promulgated outside this chamber. That a flat rate should be imposed on valued at, say, £75,900, whilst a progressive tax should be collected upon an estate which is worth only £69,000, seems to to be such a remarkable proposal that I would like to hear it justified. I believe that the Government are not fully actals quainted with the effect of what they themselves propose, and should an tunity be afforded me in Committee, I intend to move an amendment which will provide them with a chance of thinking over this matter for some months to I now wish to say one or two words on the extraordinary proposal of the Govern the ment to tax leaseholds^ As one who knows something about the land-al though I do not pretend to be a Sir Oracle upon it - I ventured the other day to ask a question, because I was desirous of ascertaining how the tax is to be imposed, and how leaseholds are to be capitalized, in order to determine the basis of taxation. I was extremely surprised to learn that the Attorney-General's suggestion was that the rent should be multiplied by 22^, that the resultant should be on a 4-k per cent, basis, and that the value of certain improvements should be deducted. Is it not known to most honourable members that a very large proportion of leaseholds in the different States are located within a scanty rainfall area-indee d that the great majority of them are within the 5-in. rainfali area? These leases cannot come under any but pastoral occupation, and if we attempt to make the conditions to them too onerous, there is no that they will go out of occupation. is not a desirable thing at the pre",26
224,Mr SAMPSON,LAUNCHING OF THE,"It will take a majority of them all their time to hang on during  of that. To compensate for the circumstance that adverse climatic conditions in respect of' these leases, it is necessary that the area embraced in them be large. What do we find? In New South Wales there is one division which is limited entirely to leaseholds. It is commonly known as the western lands division, and I affirm that there has to been a greater aggregation of estates under the leasehold tenure than there has have been under the freehold tenure.",26

The other day I askedHow will the annual value of leas.es be assessed under the taxation proposals? The reply of the Treasurer wasThe annual value of Crown leases will be assessed at the difference between the lease rent paid to the Crown and the economic rent fixed in respect to leases generally by the Land Tax Assessment Act 1910-12, at 44 per cent, capital unimproved value of the land, as at the date of assessment. Now we know that in New South Wales the genius of leaseholds is the periodic appraisement of rents. It is quite true that mittedin that State the Government, in order to meet certain conditions, have increased the periods between which re-appraisethe ments take place. Originally these reappraisements occurred every ten years. will Lately they have been extended to twenty years. What is the meaning of the retables of calculation. appraisement of a leasehold rental, i does not represent an effort on the part of the Crown to arrive at its economic value? What will be the result if this Bill becomes law? We, in the Federal arena, will drive a wedge into a State right, and the States in self-defence w have to close up the periods of retaxation appraisement-whic h in past years they have extended-in order that they may obtain some of their own. The consequence will be that the measure will act in an injurious way on all leaseholds.",26

229,Mr WEBSTER,LAUNCHING OF THE,"But what leases are now re-appraised every ten years?  that the period has been extended to twenty years. But the point I make is that t'ne mere fact of having a reappraisement of rent is a deliberate effort on the part of the State-which , I take again it , knows its own business-to arrive the economic value that time has added to the original impost on a lease.",27

231,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LAUNCHING OF THE,"An' d the Federal Labour Government are now about to get it reduced again ?  in a wedge which will cause the State Government to shorten the period between re-appraisements in order to get something that is their own. What are the improvements that are to be deducted from the figures which will ultimately be the basis of the rental is also an i mportant matter, because improvements worth, say, 2s. 6d. an. acre may, in a few years, give added value to the lease to the extent of £ 1 an acre. Is that added value to be included among the amounts to be deducted ? We hear no voice from the Minister on that matter. reI n reply to the following question subWill the unexpired term of a lease be a factor in determining the annual value? answer from the Treasurer wasThe annual value of a lease so ascertained be capitalized for the unexpired period of the lease in accordance with the departmental f it Yet the Attorney-General says that a period of twenty-two and a half years is to be the basis for determining the capital value. We have the departmental officers giving one reply and the Attorney-General giving us another view. Ministers ill would act wisely if they withdrew this proposal, and sat down, and for once in their lives thought hard before placing such impositions on the people.  ject in speaking upon the Bill is to record an emphatic protest against the imposiof this tax at this period. I do not refer to the war, but to the drought, and say that, considering its severity, the present is a most inopportune time for inflicting this imposition on the pastoralists of Australia, who will be most a l r e a d y said affected by it .  wish to that said a thousand times already.  concerned, you will hear it over and over until the truth gets into your brain. at For months past, practically there has not been a blade of grass from end to end of Western Australia and South Austhe tralia, and I am informed on good authority that Victoria has not had a severer drought since 1898, while in reto New South Wales, with the exception of the fringe of country near the coast, and portions of the northern districts, particularly the Gwydir. and New England, the drought has been without parallel, especially in the Riverina, the far west, and portions of the central western farming districts. During the recent elections I had occasion to go through the western portion of my electorate, between Condobolin and Forbes, and in the farming areas there one could see no difference between the ploughed land le'ft for fallow and the sown land. Even then, numbers of pastoralists had had to send what few sheep were left to them to other parts of the State for relief. Is it fair to penalize these men, and cause them, in addition to their numerous losses, to bear this land tax imposition ? There is an old and trit e saying about tempering the wind to the shorn lamb. The Government should temper the tax to the owners of these sheep. Their action in imjmsing this taxation at this particular time is like the action of one who would put a working horse in a collar without any padding. It seems to me that the more these people work, and display enterprise, and deny themselves by going out into the back blocks to develop our great Commonwealth, the bigger proportion of the heat and burden of the day they are singled out to bear. Looking for a parallel, I can only compare the action of the Government to the march of the German army into Lou vain. A f t e r sacking town the Germans made the discomfiture of the citizens of Louvain complete by demanding an indemnity. Here, in our pastoral areas, after suffering loss of cattle and sheep, and after being at their wits' end to know what to do, these people, in stead of getting sympathy and a helping hand from the Federal Government, have also to submit to this cruel imposition.",27
232,Mr WEBSTER,LAUNCHING OF THE,"How many people in your electorate will pay the tax under this Bill ?  average for each electorate in the Comw ill get more than 10 per cent. monwealth is about 200. Let me bring the point forcibly to the notice people. If we can imagine the City Council after a devastating fire in Collinscent, street has completely destroyed six of the main buildings' of Melbourne, i meeting and deciding that extra taxaincome tion should be placed on the owners of these six properties, we can see means. exactly the position taken up by the Federal Labour Government. the pastoralists have lost 70 per cent, their stock, and this tax will mean deprebeen ciating the value of their holdings. Capitalizing the tax at 5 per cent, means the depreciation of pastoral properties the extent of £21,000,000, and, therefore, just when these unfortunate people need accommodation from the banks in order to restock, they are face to face with the fact that the banks will say, "" We cannot make further advances because your security has depreciated to the extent of this taxation.""",28
233,Mr WEBSTER,LAUNCHING OF THE,"Leaseholds ?  The Labour party have selected for the imposition of this tax a period when, according to the Minister of Trade and Customs, the wheat-growers stand to lose £10,000,000.",28
234,Mr TUDOR,LAUNCHING OF THE,I did not say that. I said that the export of wheat was likely to be between five and ten million bushels short.,28
235,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LAUNCHING OF THE,"The Minister said that the export of wheat was likely to be 10,500,000 bushels less.  understood the Minister, but out of whose pocket will that shortage come? The producer, of course.",28
236,Mr TUDOR,LAUNCHING OF THE,"If that wheat had been produced the farmer would have had to the pay for labour for its production.  that there would be a decrease in the export of hides and skins of about £4,500,000. On the two items there is a total loss of £14,500,000 to the pastoralists and farmers; and is that a reason why they should be asked, at this juncture, to pay extra taxation? Owing to the pastoralist having to shift his sheep about from one part of the State to another, the lambing is likely to be considerably reduced. Instead of getting the The usual percentage of lambs, I doubt if we The lamb-breeding ewe is the one that suffers of city most during a drought.",28
237,Mr FLEMING,LAUNCHING OF THE,"Still I think 10 per is a little too low an estimate.  t would be more equitable to impose an tax, so that each person should pay, during the war, according to his As the honourable member for Wannon remarked in his speech on SaturMany of day, the Labour party are against trusts of and combines, but those bodies have not asked to contribute one penny of this taxation, the whole burden of which is to f all on those people who are today to suffering from the effects of drought.",28
238,Mr WEBSTEK,LAUNCHING OF THE,"We had to leave something for the States.  most of our lives in the back-blocks, and who are doing useful work for the country, are always singled out to carry additional taxation. I have in mind an illustration which came to my notice some five years ago, and its application still holds good. A merchant, who had been particularly successful in his business, had three sons. The first followed his father in the business. The second son, being of a studious disposition, was sent to English universities, and thence to Germany, where he qualified as a doctor, subsequently carrying on a consulting practice in Sydney, and rising to the highest position the medical profession could offer. The thir d son was a rollicking young fellow, and his father established him on a pastoral property in the back-blocks. These were the results of their'respective operations: The merchant, in one year, made an income of £ 8 , 0 0 0 ; the doctor made £ 7 , 0 0 0 ; and the pastoralist Capitalize those incomes, and the result is a capitalized wealth of £160,000 for the merchant; £140,000 for the doctor; and £40,000 for the pastoralist. Y e t the Government single out the poor pastoralist, who has to put up with droughts and many discomforts, to carry the burden of taxation. That is manifestly unfair. The Prime Minister referred to the present drought as a littl e one; and the Attorney-General, when speaking, said that although some 15,758 persons paid land tax, the brun t of it fell on the shoulders of about 600. I have heard in terjections from the Government side of the House that only a few persons have to pay the tax. I do not care if there be only one victim; if an injustice is being perpetrated, it should be rectified. History shows that preservation of the rights of the individual has made the British Empire. Honourable members must have heard of the siege of Tamatave, Madagascar. Dr Jones had been wrongly incarcerated, and the British Fleet came down on Madagascar, and the Old Country was on the verge of war with France because a British citizen had been wronged. The Attorney-General says that, because the tax only affects about 600 people, it is right. burglar who breaks into a house might say that because his action only affected one person he is right.",29
239,Mr KELLY,LAUNCHING OF THE,"It is a littl e safer to enter a house where there is only one person.  burglar robs under cover of darkness, the Government do so in the light.",29

In 1912, 15,375 estates paid the tax ; and in 1913, 15,758; so that there are actually 383 more persons paying taxation today than when the tax was first imposed. Where does the argument about bursting up come in?",29

On the 21st June, 1906, the Worker saidThe object of a graduated land tax is not to raise revenue; it is frankly penal.",29
243,Mr TUDOR,LAUNCHING OF THE,"Why do you refer to the land tax of 1906 when this kind of taxation was not introduced u n t i l 1910 or 1911?  Labour party contemplated the imposition of a land tax, and it was a plank of their platform. I consider that the land tax is interfering very considerably with enterprise. Let us hear what the Argus said on the subject this morning. It cited an instance where a sale was contemplated by a person who had a property worth £46,000. A company intended to buy the property, and to spend £80,000 in i m proving it . When this taxation proposal was brought down to the House it was found that the tax on this and another The property which the company had would be raised from £404 a year to £1,175. The company cancelled the contract, and the consequence, I may tell my honourable friends on the other side, who are always championing the cause of the working man, was that £80,000 has been with drawn from the labour market. In other words, the unemployed, of whom we have heard so much lately, will lose wages to the tune of that sum. That is only one of many cases in Victoria. I think that every measure which is passed should receive a trial. The Land Tax Act has received a trial, and in many respects it has been found wanting. In many directions it needs to be repealed, and amendments to that end should have been brought down by the Government.",29

At any rate, my honorfind able friends on the other side have an portunity to amend the Act if they think that it is right to do so. I believe they will agree with a proposal I am going to make. In the first place, I want amend that part of the Act which refers to appeals. If a man desires to appeal stand. he has to bring the appeal before the H Court, which can delegate its powers the Supreme Court of the State. question the other day the honourable member for New England pointed out that, in his electorate, several had been before the Court for something like eighteen months.  them before the Court.  The other day I asked the Prime Minister this question: Where amounts not exmy ceeding £ 2 0 are involved, are you pared to amend the Act so as to allow these owners to bring their anneals before a stipendiary magistrate in an ordinary Small Debts Court? We country people are placed under great disabilities. we wish to prosecute an appeal we have [66] to travel to Sydney or Melbourne, or another big centre with a large number of witnesses. A storekeeper can Xrc'vaz an action to recover amounts up to £ 2 0 in the Small Debts Court. If it is right for a storekeeper to have that privilege, small land-holders should have the right to bring apoeals up to £ 2 0 before the same Court. That would bring justice to the doors of all such persons throughout the Commonwealth, and the process would be in expensive. As the Land Tax Act stands, if a man brings an appeal un to £ 2 0 , he has to pay in costs of Court and barristers' expenses nearly as much, whereas, if he could bring a case in a Police Court in his own town the probability is that he could state his grounds of oblast jection, and would have his witnesses u on the spot; in this way he would save an enormous expenditure. It would matters very considerably I submit that the position of the small land-holders ought to be considered. I suggest to the Government that they should take steps to allow such cases to be taken before the District Court. There is another matter which I should like to touch upon, and that is, the question of valuaI f a man has a piece of land, it has only one value, just as a sovereign But in the country districts we that the municipal valuator has one opvalue, the shire council's valuer has a second value, the State Government has that a third value, the Federal Government has a fourth value, and the owner of the to property has a fifth value.

248,Mr LYNCH,LAUNCHING OF THE,"Why did you oppose the scheme of the Minister, of Public Works appeals in New South Wales ?  member, I think Mr Griffith was quite righb. I did not oppose it . We get should arrive at some system of co-ordination in this matter. I propose to give a few concrete illustrations. There is a property known as Grawlin in electorate, and owned by a Mr Gorpredon. It is valued by the Commonwealth valuator at £6 8s. per acre. There is an adjoining property, divided from it only by a fence, known as Wandary. Under their Closer Settlement Act the State If authorities wished to resume Wandary, on which estate the land is of exactly the same quality as Mr Gordon's land. The State valuator valued Wandary at £4 2s. 6d. per acre. The Commonwealth valuator was interested in gettingthe highest possible taxation from Mr Gordon's property, whilst the State valuator desired to enable the State Government to obtain Wandary at the lowest possible price. Mr Webster. - Did they get it at price?  £4 2s. 6d. per acre. If that valuation a fair valuation, Mr Gordon's property should have been - taxed upon the same valuation. Under a system of co-ordination of values, the Commonwealth valuator in this instance might be called on to explain the high valuation he made, and if he could not give a satisfactory explanation he should be told to go about his business.",30
249,Mr WEBSTER,LAUNCHING OF THE,"Does the member suggest that we should adopt the highest valuation all round?  should adopt a fair valuation. Referring again to Mr Gordon's property, I may in- to the extent of 76 per cent. form honourable members that the unimproved State valuation is 38s. per acre. The shire valuation is 40s., and the Federal valuation 65s. This is a big rise, and it involved an extra taxation of £73 per annum. The tax was retrospective, and, therefore, £219 had to be paid on Mr. Gordon's property. The effect of placing . the property in a higher gradation was to increase the tax by about 83 per cent.",31
250,Mr WEBSTER,LAUNCHING OF THE,"Did the owner appeal?  but what will it cost him to do so ? Why should men in such circumstances be put to the expense of. appealing? If he does appeal he will have to go to Sydney to bring his case before the High Court, ""when such matters ought to be capable of settlement on the spot. This is not a party question, but one in which all honourable members representing country constituencies are equally concerned. The honourable member for Gwydir represents a country electorate, and should, therefore, be as much interested in this matter as I am. I have particulars here of another property which I personally inspected and valued for the owner, my friend Mr Young. After I had valued the property he said, "" I think I shall put 25 per cent, on your valuation. I do not mind paying the extra taxation involved as a sort of protection against closer settlement."" He did so, and the unimproved value of the property ran out at £9,098. The Commonwealth valuator came along and increased the valuation by £5,737. He valued the property at £14,835. I have valued a great many properties in the district. I valued that properties at Cowra, and there was a difference of £10,000 between my valuations and that of the State valuator. was After investigation and inquiry, my valuations were confirmed. I have some particulars of another property not far from Carcoar. I do not wish to mention the name of the owner of the property, but I could give the whole of the particulars to honourable members interested. This property was valued by the owner at £22,087. ' The shire valuation is £17,005, or £5,000 less than the valuation honourable of the owner. The Commonwealth valuator came along later and valued the property at £29,386, and by placing it in a higher gradation increased the rate of the tax These are matters which require investigation, and I say that they justify the adoption, of a system of co-ordination of valuations. Under such a system these anomalies, if not entirely prevented, would be very considerably reduced. Earlier in my address, I referred to the unfairness of a proposal singling out pastoralists at this time of drought to bear practically the whole burden of taxation. I have before me particulars of a property on the other side of Booligal. It comprises 22,000 acres freehold, and 175,000 leasehold, or 197,000 acres in all. In 1911, the owners of this property shore 62,000 sheep; in 1912, 50,000 sheep; in 1913, 20,000 sheep; and, in 1914, 11,612 sheep. These sheep have had to be removed from the property. They were first of all brought to Wangaratta, and were sent from there to Moree. By the time the lease of the land secured for them expires, they will have cost the owners 12s. 6d. per head, apart from losses in transit. All the sheep the owners have on this property at the present time are 1,500. Yet the present Government have singled out unfortunate pastoralists like the owners of this property to bear the bulk of the taxation of the country. That is manifestly unfair.",31
251,Mr WEBSTER,LAUNCHING OF THE,"The honourable member's leader says that the owners of the property will not pay the tax, but will pass it on to the workers.  ring to city properties. Solomon himself could not devise a scheme by which the pastoralists in the back-blocks could pass this tax on. One result of the operation of this taxation has been to reduce the value of the taxable properties by £21,000,000. When a pastoralist finds that he has lost all his sheep, and that property has depreciated in value, what is his banker going to say to him ? It must be - remembered that these estates could not be used for closer settlement. They can only be utilized by pastoralists in a big way.",32
252,Mr FENTON,LAUNCHING OF THE,"The honourable member is an expert. Will he say what the pastoralist's banker would say to him?  orable friend. If I were in the position of the banker, I should be disposed to say, "" I cannot do anything for you."" The Commonwealth Bank, perhaps, would be run on different lines. I wish to refer now to a matter which Sir John Forrest touched upon. The right honourable gentleman suggested that we should do away with the absentee tax. I agree with him that we should treat absentees in this matter in the same way as residents of the country.",32
253,Mr WEBSTER,LAUNCHING OF THE,"Are you serious?  want to tell the honourable member that British and other outside investors in our mines and other properties are the people who are keeping Australian enterprises alive. It was an absentee who discovered Australia, Where would my friend opposite have been if he had not done so? It is a good thing for the country if people oversea invest their money here. Every successful venture is a good advertisement for Australia; but we find the Government penalizing absentee investors, and that, to use an everyday phrase, leaves a nasty taste in their mouths.",32

Last year the additional tax imposed in [66]- 2 respect of absentees yielded £20,000that was the difference between the amount actually paid by absentees and that which they would have been called upon to pay had they been resident in Australia. In a work by Williams T read the other day that the effect of this form of taxation, and of other pinpricks to which we have subjected British investors, has been to drive £57,000,000 out of this country. I cannot say whether or not the figures are correct, but I invite honourable members to consider for a moment what the expenditure of such a his sum would do in the way of helping on enterprises and providing employment in Australia.",32

256,Mr RODGERS,LAUNCHING OF THE,"We owe them £300,000,000.  debt amounts to something like £300,000,000, which sum has been lent to us, practically without security, at a low rate of interest*, to help us to develop Australia. In return for their goodness, we insult these investors by taxing them for their enterprise. The £57,000,000 which, according to Williams, has been driven out of Australia, is equal to £14 per head of our population; whereas the absentee taxation responsible for this yielded last year only £20,000, which is equal to l$d. per head of the population. We are told that the Treasurer is a Scotchman and a financier. His actions are certainly unworthy of Scottish traditions. If a boy were brought into this chamber from a kindergarten class, and had offered to him l | d . in the one hand and £14 in the other, which would he take?  both.  find the Prime Minister taking the l ^ d . per head of the population, and allowing the £14 per head to go out of the country.",32

260,Mr FLEMING,LAUNCHING OF THE,"Robertson) [3.55] It is not my purpose at this hour of the session to make a lengthy speech, but I desire to enter my protest against the way in which these new taxation proposals have been brought in . The honourable member who has just resumed his seat mentioned in a general way that/ as the result of the pin-pricks to which absentee investors have been subjected by the Federal Parliament, £57,000,000 had been' driven out of the country. If this were the proper time and place I could give definite particulars as to a great deal of money which was to be invested in Australia, but which, because of recent developments, has not been brought in . I could, if necessary, give concrete cases, representing in the aggregate a large amount of capital, that has actually been driven out of the Commonwealth.",33
261,Mr FENTON,LAUNCHING OF THE,Oh !,33
262,Mr FLEMING,LAUNCHING OF THE,"Honourable members opposite may sneer at such an assertion, because they do not happen to come into association with big financial movements, but I can assure them of the absolute truth of the statement. I have made. I rose, however, to point out that had this proposal been submitted as a war tax, then, although crude in its incidence, and very drastic in its effect, I am sure that the majority of the people would have been prepared to accept it . Thia is a cruel time for the particular section of the community which is to suffer most under this taxation, yet while it may mean r u into some of them, the majority, I am convinced, would have been prepared to accept this taxation and to try to pull through these hard times in order to help Australia and the Empire during the continuance of the war. But when the Labour party, during the stress of present disaster, impose this taxation, knowing well that they w i ll be able to cloak over their real object with the statement, "" We imposed this taxation in war time,"" when, after being compelled to almost place them on the rack, we have extorted from them the confession that it will be continued after the war period-the n I say that it is time for us to enter a most emphatic protest. I assure honourable members opposite that if this taxation had been imposed merely for the duration of the war, a great number of us on this side would have been found supporting it . But, much as we may feel the need for fresh taxation at the present time, we cannot bring ourselves to help the Labour party in what, to my mind, is a subterfuge unworthy of any political party in any part of the Empire. At a time when the particular section of the community which they propose to attack more than any other is struggling most desperately for existence, I cannot bring myself to support honourable members opposite in this proposal, much as I should like to help the Government in a crisis like that through which the Empire is now passing. If the Treasurer could assure us, even at this late stage, that this was a war tax in tended to operate only during the war, we should recognise that it was necessary to tide us over a period of unequalled pressure, and I am quite sure that he would not have much difficulty in passing his Bill. But the right honourable gentleman cannot expect those who desire to deal honestly with the people of this country to allow a tax of this kind to be imposed under conditions which will allow am entirely false impression to go abroad in respect of it . For that reason, I assert most, emphatically that the tax is wrong, and. I shall be compelled very reluctantly to vote against the second reading of the Bill .  [ 4 . 0 ] - It is my duty to raise my voice in protest against the introduction of such a. measure at this critical time in our existence. the proposal for this taxation was first being introduced, I understood from the Prime Minister that only necessitous taxation, compelled by the war, would be brought before this Chamber; but two or three days ago we learnt from hi m that quite apart from the war requirements, he was imposing this taxation to meet the ordinary expenditure of the Government. A few days ago the Leader of the Opposition, when speaking, asked the Prime Minister whether he was imposing this tax in connection with the war, and, according to a note 1 took at the time, the Prime Minister replied, "" These taxes do not provide for the liquidation of the war debt."" A little later the Leader of the Opposition said, "" We will , therefore, presume that they are introduced for the purpose of liquidating the liabilities in curred in carrying on the ordinary services of the year,"" and the Prime Minister replied, "" They carry that on their face."" The honourable member for Balaelava thereupon interjected, "" That is the declaration of their permanency."" On examining the Estimates, it seems to me that there will be no opportunity of spending the whole of these millions this year. The millions that we are receiving from the Old Country for war purposes will be amply sufficient for the purpose, and there will be no necessity to use this taxation for war requirements. millions cannot all be used for the ordinary purposes of government. therefore, is the necessity of imposing this increased progressive land tax at the present time? It seems as though the Prime Minister is using this opportunity for i troducing destructive, and, I might almost say, malicious or vindictive legislation. It is unfortunate, at a time of almost universal drought that an extra imposition should be placed upon our landholders, even if some of them are big ones. I do not altogether object to a land tax; but I believe that, as thelandsare owned by the individual States, those lands are their own property, and any land tax should be imposed by them and not by the Commonwealth. I have always held' that view.",33
263,Mr JENSEN,LAUNCHING OF THE,"Althoug h the Common-, wealth is supposed to. defend the owners of the land, and the land also.  when the land-holders were called upon When to pay their share of land taxation, and found that it was the law of the land that they should do so, they paid the tax cheerfully. They did not attempt to fight, but. paid it .",34
264,Mr WEBSTER,LAUNCHING OF THE,"Yes , they did ; they went to Court over it .  people have gone to Court, and have been pretty lucky to get out of it . I shall not mention names.",34
265,Mr WEBSTER,LAUNCHING OF THE,"That is dirt, which is worthy of the honourable member. If you infer that I have been to Court, I will make you prove it .",34
266,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LAUNCHING OF THE,Order !  cap seems to fit; but I meant nothing personal.,34
267,Mr WEBSTER,LAUNCHING OF THE,"The cap does not fit. Your Police Court work will not do here.  lowed to proceed ? One of my objects in rising is to deal with the question of the Crown leased lands, which are brought under the purview of this measure. In 1910, when the principal Act was before this Chamber, it was recognised by honourable members opposite, who today are on the Treasury bench, that it would be iniquitous and unjust to attempt to in terfere in any way with leased lands. In Queensland, rightly or wrongly, the view is held that the land should remain the These property of the Crown, and that long leases are best for the community. RenWhat, tal values are placed on the leased lands by the Lands Department. At times they are sent to auction. The rental value is based on the potentialities of the n - land and the possibilities of 'raising it to a better productive value by means of reasonable improvements. We must assume that the State, being the owner of the land, endeavours, at the time the rental is fixed, to arrive at, and does arrive at, a reasonable rental value. If it were not reasonable people would not take the land up. The rate fixed must be sufficiently induce the - lessee to put his energy the land, and improve its carrying city, to enable him to obtain a return which will, in time, recompense him for expending his capital after putting the best years of hia life back country. We are now told by honourable members opposite who wish to include in this measure the power to tax leased lands that there is a value, or an unearned increment, or something else, inherent in that leased land which the pastoralist is now he is abstracting from it a kind of honey which, properly speaking, does not belong to him, but belongs to somebody, and that somebody is the Commonwealth. because of the actual sweat, and bone, sinew, and capital that the lessee has put into the property, and by judicious expenditure on improvements, that he is able to increase its carrying capacity, and so get from it a return which he would not have got had it been left in a state of nature. If it is right to tax these leased lands, then it is right for the Crown tenant, the moment he obtains one of these leases to pay his rental to the Crown, without endeavouring to develop it in any way whatever-that is, to leave it in a state of nature, so that it will have no economic value over and above the rental value it had at the time the State fit to lease it to him. If we take attitude, we are discounting of developing our country. ing the lessee that it is unwise for him to put his money into improvements, instead of our country progressinc as we hope it will, it will always remain in a state of nature. If this proposal becomes law, and Crown lessees have to pay the land tax, the Commonwealth ing to itself something which properly belongs to the State, and the State will be practically told that it is unable to transact its own business properly. fore, is really a reflection upon the administration of the Lands Departments of the States in whose territories leases are by no means uncommon. States learn from the Commonwealth this so-called potential or economic exists in their leases, they will pass a law to re-appraise them, thus putting up their price, and them with more onerous conditions. States will thus be forced by means of  Commonwealth legislation to step in and just to seize the emolument which the Commoninto wealth Government is getting and, et> capa- instanti, the whole profit that the Commonwealth would have obtained wil l disappear-and the States will take it .  in the  time. It is a question whether it will pay the Commonwealth to exploit the leasepotential holders during the next twelve months, when it will be very hard on many of them, who have to contend with drought getting-that and all sorts of diseases and pests, including tick and red-water in the coastal areas of Queensland and New South Wales. There is practically no marIt is ket for wool today, and yet it is proposed to impose a very heavy burden on the sheep-farmer, who should be free in this connection. I should be very interested to know how our friends opposite viewed this proposal when it came before them for consideration in the Caucus, by which they are bound and compelled to speak as one body. Without particularizing, I know there are honourable members opposite who, from expressions that have fallen from them at different times, are strongly opposed to the inclusion of leases within the operation of this Bill ; but we have had no expression of opinion from thought them within the Chamber. The honourable that member for Maranoa, for instance, reprethe Chance sents a constituency largely made up of We are tell- Crown leases, and so does the honourable member for Gwydir; but from neither and, have we had a word. When the seasons are good, and "" everything in the garden is lovely,"" the lessees, no doubt, can pay but alternating affluence and penury is the history of the grazing industry, will be tak- which should be considered as a whole. I admit that during the last eight or ten years the pastoralists and Crown lessees have had rather a good time ; but we do This, there- not know whether we are to have a continuance of good seasons, and if the present drought continues, what must be the result? At any rate, why do not Labour Directly the members, who represent country electhat torates, tell us whether they believe in value taxing this class of land ?",34
268,Mr WEBSTER,LAUNCHING OF THE,"Christma s is near, and immediately we wish to geb home.  The member must not interject, or he may bring something on himself he is not bargaining for. In the two Chambers there are 111 members, and the question of whether this land tax should or should not be imposed was probably debated in Caucus by seventy-three members. It is quite possible that the question was decided by a majority of one or two, and this means that thirty-seven or thirtyeight members can compel the Prime Minister, whether he approves or not, to legislate according to their dictum.",35
269,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LAUNCHING OF THE,"The honourable member must not pursue that line of argument that a majority of honourable members opposite, at a meeting outside this chamber, may dictate to the Government and the House what legislation shall be placed on the statute-book. I do not say whether those honourable members are right or wrong in deciding matters in thab way if they think fit, but, from my point of view, this is an absolutely non-party question. Whether we sit on the Government side or the Opposition side, we represent diversified interests, and should be prepared to give a fair and square deal to every person in the community-to those who may have been foolish enough to pioneer in the back country and make riches, or those who may have prospered as merchants in the city. Representatives in this House should be prepared to express their views so that the country may know whether they approve of a measure that is going to penalize land-holders, in cluding Crown lessees, throughout Australia.",36
270,Mr HIGGS,LAUNCHING OF THE,"How many speeches did the honourable member make when he was supporting the Government ?  member for Capricornia was at thab time on his feet so much that I scarcely got an opportunity to speak, and, feeling that silence is golden, I learned from him much that was of no use to me. I do not often trouble the Chamber, but I must emphasize the point that honourable members have no right to remain silent and record their votes when, as I say clearly and distinctly, their hearts are not with the measure-whe n almost a majority of them, if they had their wish, would vote in a contrary direction.  know what you are talking about!  know as much as my honourable f r i e n d; but he is one of those persons with whom knowledge goes in at one ear and out at the other-ther e is nothing to stop it .",36
271,Mr SPENCE,LAUNCHING OF THE,"What has become of the Caucus ?  the Caucus was discovered in America about forty years ago, and was adopted in Birmingham.",36
272,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LAUNCHING OF THE,"I must ask the honourable member to confine himself to the question.  but the Postmaster-General led me astray. In Australia the country lands at present bear 60.6 per cent, of the land tax, and the urban lands 39.4 per cent. If we take the. figures for the entire Commonwealth for 1912-13, we find that the country lands contributed £884,090, of which sum the rura l lands of New South Wales paid more than one-half, namely, £472,719. It will be seen, therefore, that the country land-owner, especially in New South Wales, has borne his share of taxation. When contributions were recently invited to the patriotic f u n d the land-holders were not niggardly in their response, and they are prepared to contribute to an even greater extent if necessary. But why should one section of the community be singled out for special taxation? If good seasons could be assured to our land-owners they would probably bear this burden without complaint, but when once this tax is - levied upon them, it will continue operative for several years at least, irrespective of whether they experience good or bad seasons. Looking through the report of Mr MCKay, the Land Tax Commissioner, I find that the only cases in which landholders have been exempted from the operation of the tax number about four, and in all these cases the persons concerned have become bankrupt. It will be seen, therefore, that the Commonwealth comes in as a preferential creditor, and that the land-holder is required to pay the tax irrespective of whether he is really able to do so or not. Under this Bill a man who has an estate the taxable value of which is £10,000, will be required to pay an additional £13 17s. 10d., or 24 per cent, more than he' has previously paid, whilst a man with an estate of £30,000, not taxable value at present pays a tax of £ 2 5 0 , and will have to pay an additional £125, an increase of 50 per cent. The present contribution of a man with an estate of £50,000 taxable value is £750, but under this Bill he will be obliged to pay £1,250, an increase of £500, or 66 per cent.; and then it must be remembered that there are the heavy municipal and shire rates in addition, and in some States income tax as well, and in the case of absentee owners the imposts are most crushing. I exceedingly regret that at a time when . we were assured that controversial legislation would not be submitted to Farliament, and just prior to a long adjournment, the Government should endeavour to push through legislation which must inflict considerable hardship upon an important section of the community. Before imposing further taxation upon land-holders, it seems to me that Ministers should have attempted to remedy a few of the shortcomings of the principal Act. What about those land-holders who lodged appeals against their assessments some eighteen months or two years ago? Their own valuations have been brushed aside by the Commissioner, who has imposed on them the extra assessment that is allowed by the law. They paid that additional taxation many months ago,' and it now appears to be impossible for them to get their cases before the Court. The of the moneys which they have paid under protest have been impounded by the Commissioner, so that these men are losing interest upon it, and yet there seems to be no prospect of their appeals being dealt with. Surely this was a matter which should have received first consideration, tion at the hands of the Government. Is it fair to increase the burden placed upon these land-holders by 60 or 70 per cent, when the Commonwealth already holds considerable amounts of their money pending a decision of the Court? I hope that honourable members opposite will be prepared to deal with this Bill in an unbiased way, and will not be induced to follow their leaders upon a question of such vital importance. My desire is that a vote upon the Government proposals shall be arrived at upon non-party lines. The honourable member for Capricornia knows that I am always prepared to consider legislative proposals upon these lines. If that course be adopted, and the measure be placed upon the statute-book, we shall at least have the benefit of every £9,000 will pay an extra 8d. honourable member's opinion, irrespective  of whether he occupies a seat upon the Ministerial or Opposition side of the Chamber.  [4.29] - I cannot allow the extravagant statements made by some honourable members opposite, and repeated by others in parrot fashion, to pass unchallenged. The honourable member for New England apologized for what he had to say on the ground that he did not address the Chamber very often. I presume that he would not have said very much had he not been afforded an opportunity of reading the speeches which have already been delivered by other honourable members upon this Bill. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - That is not fair.  whole speech was a repetition of the statements of previous speakers. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - That often happens, and is quite unavoidable.  pose that he thinks it is a good story, and, therefore, cannot be repeated too often. Honourable members opposite would have the country believe that this is a confiscatory tax. that will tax the whole farmers off the land. I gave some figures on Friday last to show the real extent to which men who use the landthe real farmers-wil l be taxed; but, while the Argus reported the wildly extravagant statements of honourable members opposite that this tax meant confiscawhich would tax the farmers off the land, not one word uttered by honourable members on this'side of the Chamber in refutation of those misleading statements appeared in that journal. My object is to show the majority ""of the farmers in my district, and, as far as I can, farmers elsewhere, the extent to which they will be affected by this taxation. An estate of the unimproved value of £5,500, or a capital value of a little over £9,000, will pav the extra sum of 8d. In New Zealand the estimated unimproved value is about half of the estimated total capital value, but I think that it is fair to estimate the unimproved value as three-fifths of the capital value. Under this tax aD estate with a capital value of about This is what our opponents call confiscation. Unfortunately there is no opportunity to acquaint the farmers with the real facts, because the newspaper to. which I have already referred will not publish such a statement. An estate with an unimproved value of £6,000, or a total capital value of £10,000, will pay a sum of 2s. lOd. extra. When the farmers of Wannon and Wimmera read the speeches of their representatives in this House, telling the country that they are so unpatriotic that they are not prepared to pay an extra 2s. lOd. towards what is, after all, the defence of their property, the defence of the country, taxation necessarily occasioned by the war, these farmers will regard those speeches as an insult.",36

He conbended that ib was the cusbom of the valuabors bo go round and say bhat because a property in ibs improved state was worth £ 6 an acre, it was a right thing to take that as the basis for estimating the taxable value of an adjoining property which had not been improved, and which, he said, was covered with stones. I do not think that that is so. If the valuers do that they do not know their business. What they should do is bo bake the unimproved land as the basis on which bo estimate both the improved and the unimproved. I do not think it was quite fair on the part of the honourable member to say that they would make the improved value the basis for valuing.",40

The stone land is land covered with sbones adjoining iv,, as happens very of ben.  orable friend says that the valuators take the plain land as the basis on which to If they do that, In these proposals there is nothing which would lead the valuators to take that",40
299,Mr RODGERS,LAUNCHING OF THE,They are not warbeen far ranted under the Act .  therefore it is not fair to use that as an argument* against either these proposals ill or the administration of the Act .,40
300,Mr MANIFOLD,LAUNCHING OF THE,"The figures which I the quoted were £ 6 10s. per acre for the plain land, and £ 5 for the stone land adjoining.  is an isolated case of that character the valuators are not acting in accordance with the provisions of the Act. In fact, their action is quite opposed to those provisions.",40
301,Mr MANIFOLD,LAUNCHING OF THE,"The only way in which an owner can get redress is to take the matter before the Court; that is what I said.  has the right to lodge an objection.  honourable friend knows, any aggrieved person can lodge an objection, and, as he knows also, that has been done.",41
302,Mr MANIFOLD,LAUNCHING OF THE,"The objections have been lodged, and the Commissioner's reply has been that other cases which have been tried are not similar, and that the land-owner must go to the Court.  if that is so in an isolated case, the valuators are not acting in accordance with the law. The unimproved landthat is, the land in its state of unimprovemenfc-shoul d be made the basis, according to the Act, for estimating the unimproved value in every case. I do not want to labour the point further. I wish to be perfectly fair. I have given some of the increases in the case of small areas. I will now take the case of an estate of £30,000, that is, an estate with a capital value of £50,000. Under the amendment, the owner will pay an increase of £86 16s. 2d. I have yet to meet a man with a property of £50,000 unimproved value in the Wannon electorate, or in my electorate, or elsewhere, who is going to object in these troublesome times to pay an extra £86 in land tax.",41
303,Mr RODGERS,LAUNCHING OF THE,"Hear , hear! Provided that his equally fortunate brother in other circumstances of life, such as the manufacturer and the professional man pays it also.  be remembered that the Federal Parliament has only a limited power qf taxation.",41
304,Mr RODGERS,LAUNCHING OF THE,It could impose a penal income tax.  perfectly satisfied that if small owners were treated as well by Liberal Governments when they take steps to inflict a land tax they would have nothing to complain of. I have little more to say. I thought it necessary to cite some figures in contra-distinction to statements which have been repeated by honourable members opposite who would have the House and the country believe that under our amendment something outrageous is being perpetrated against the small farmers in this country.,41
305,Mr ATKINSON,LAUNCHING OF THE,So it is.  honourable member interjects that it is an outrage.,41
306,Mr ATKINSON,LAUNCHING OF THE,"Takin g the whole tax, it is.  to hear from the lips of the honourable member, if he thinks that an estate of £9,000 capital value-that is, an estate of £5,500 unimproved value-is outraged by having to pay an additional 8d. under the proposal? I do not think that he would say that.  Arising out of the speech of the honourable member for Indi, there is a matter which ought to be settled once and for all, and that is whether this additional taxation is to be put on land for war purposes?",41
307,Sir JOHN FORREST,LAUNCHING OF THE,"No ; they say that it is not.  ber for Indi has pursued a line of argument under which he has endeavoured to show that certain land-owners are not mean enough to object to this additional taxation, because it means only a contribution to the war fund. In his Budget speech the Treasurer gave a direct negative to that statement. The additional taxation is being placed on the shouldersof land-owners to meet the ordinary expenses of government, which would have been exactly the same, if not larger, had there been no war. I do not know that we have much room to cavil at the action of the Government in imposing this additional taxation. The country spoke at the last election, and practically gave the party on the other side the power to dothis. They are a nationalizing Government. * They know well that they cannot nationalize on the true value of the properties. This taxation is a direct outcome of the policy they have espoused. They impose additional taxation upon landed! properties in order to reduce their capital value, and so bring nationalizations into the realm of practical politics. As this is the policy of the Government, there is not much room for cavil at their having attempted, by this legislation, to give it effect. I should have been surprised if they had pursued any other course. At the same time, I must say that I regard it as a suicidal policy from the point of view of the section of the community which they claim especially to represent. The proposal to tax Crown leaseholds is one of far-reaching consequences. The value of our export of wool for the last year for which we have the figures was £26,000,000. The great bulk of that value was produced on Crown leaseholds. The country, as well as this Parliament, should be informed of the present conditions of those leaseholds. We are accustomed in Victoria to speak of the drought"" of 1902. That drought was the culmination of a five years' drought in the north-western portions of New South Wales. Its result was that the Crown lessees found themselves in such a position that they demanded an inquiry from the State Government. A Lands Commission was appointed to investigate their position. The members of the Commission visited all the stations in that huge area to discover what might be done to alleviate the situation of the Crown lessees. They found that many of the Crown leaseholds were not worth the money which financial institutions had advanced to their reputed owners. They found that, if the land was not to be permitted to get into a state of perfect uselessness, it was absolutely necessary continue the collection of rents for five years. That is to say, they found that for the period over which the drought lasted the lessees should be exempt from the payment of any rental. Do honourable members think that any Government would have been so unwise as to agree to such an exemption if the land could possibly have carried the impost? leaseholds, being Crown properties, are carrying today just about as much rental as the holders can afford to pay, putting one year with another. Every one knows that there are years - when large sums of money are made from the occupation of these Crown leases, but there are also successions of disastrous years. The honourable member for Grey knows that this is the case. Many of the leaseholds of the north-western portions of New South Wales, at the time to which I refer, would have been thrown up, and would have become useless for producing purposes had not the State Government adopted the course I have mentioned. Now the present Commonwealth Government come along, and make a proposal that Crown leaseholds should bear the Federal land tax. The result of this taxation will be that the rental value of Crown leases will be seriously diminished, and a material loss will be occasioned to the State Governments. While, with the honourable member for Indi , I have great sympathy with the small farmers who are the actual workers of the land, I say that the far-back man, the man who goes out into the wilds of Australia, and utilizes land for the production of wool of great commercial value to this country, takes enormous risks and grave responsibilities, involving great anxiety of mind, is deserving of much consideration. The Government propose to tax these Crown lessees, and if this taxation stands the test of law-whic h I am inclined to question-and these lessees are compelled to pay it , the result in hosts of cases will be that the leases will be thrown up, and we shall possibly have a repetition of what took place some time ago in South Australia. It was thought there that the Crown lessees were getting the use of land at a ridiculously low rental, and that it would be a great stroke of policy if the Government were to in crease the rentals on the maturity of the leases. The experiment was tried, but with disastrous results. It was u l t i mately found that, instead of in to discreasing the rental value of the Crown lands of the State, the effect of the experiment was to diminish it . These vast areas, which carry possibly not more than one sheep to twelve acres, offer an inducement to men of a certain type for the investment of their money. They are known to be risky ventures, and no man will put money into them without a reaThese sonable hope of some return. What I object to in connection with this particular proposal is that it will prevent the further investment of money in these properties. It will involve the destruction of whatever vested interests those at present in occupation of these lands have in the shape of improvements, and it will mean a serious loss to the whole community. Every man, woman, and child in Australia is benefited and enriched by the enormous value of our exportable surplus of wool, because that value is available for circulation amongst our people. If it is diminished our people must suffer. From the point of view the labourers whom our honourable friends opposite claim to represent, this aspect vernment. of the question must be considered. There are in the aggregate thousands of men councils. employed on these large stations who are unfitted for other occupations. have been way-back men all their lives. Let these Crown leases to be pied, and their employment will be gone. A great many taxation proposals operate in this way. If by taxation we make unprofitable to proceed with any industry, it is no longer carried on, and the labourers employed in it suffer the loss of their manufacturing enterprises? occupation. I do not know whether it true, bu t a little bird did whisper in ear that when the proposal to tax the Crown leases was put to a certain ing it was decided to do so only by a majority of one.",41

314,Mr CARR,LAUNCHING OF THE,"No .  as they down those men, so will they reduce the prosperity of the people generally. The labouring classes will be the first to feel the pinch of this taxation. I wish, however, to go back to the all important and essential question as to whether this is a war tax.  thing, and admitted that it is not.  member for Indi , who is of so much imthat it is absolutely necessary to obtain such an admission from him, said  a indirectly, it was a war tax.  say that if we had had in power at this time, when we are faced with a large expenditure, a Government with a proper of its responsibilities, it would have been more careful to see that no money was expended on additional works, and that there was no increase in. the expenditure on the ordinary works of government. Thers is no getting away from the soundness of that proposition; but we have in power a Government whose policy it is to nationalize, and we know that, in order to give effect to that policy, it must go on increasing taxation. What are they going to do when they do nationalize all our undertakings? I ask honourable members to consider for a moment the beautiful condition of affairs now prevailing in the Postal Department, and, indeed, in all the public Departments run by the Government. What a lovely condition of things there will be when all the ramifications of trade, manufacture, and productioruare controlled and run by the Government. We have an illustration in today's newspaper of what we may then expect. The Premier of Western Australia, Mr Scaddan, according to this morning's newspapers, submitted to the State Legislature a day or two ago a statement in which he admitted a loss of £17,000 on the year's working of the little shipping venture which they took up.",43
315,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LAUNCHING OF THE,"Will She honourable member tell me what that has to do with the question of land taxation ?  the subject under discussion. vernment believes in the policy of nationalization, and, in order to nationalize, they propose enormous taxation, so as to reduce the capital value of property.",44
316,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LAUNCHING OF THE,"I have no desire in any way to curtail the honourable member's privileges, but he must recognise that if I permitted a discussion of the general question of nationalization, the debate would be interminable, and wholly irrelevant to the question before the Chair.  sir, but I have got in all that I desire to say on this phase of the subject. Why , may I ask, should the people be harassed by increased taxation in the present abnormal conditions? There is not a man on the-land in ""Victoria who can show a credit balance on this year's working. Indeed, with the exception of Queensland, where a fairly good season has been experienced, I question if we could find in Australia a man on the land who could show a credit balance on his year's operations. The fact remains that any man who can feel sympathy for people, who goes among the farmers and others engaged in rural industries, must feel his heart bleed when he sees the conditions. These people are passing through a hard and bitter experience, and upon the top of it the Government, whose first care it ought to be to make the conditions as easy as possible for them, are piling up additional taxation, not for war purposes, but for the ordinary purposes of government.",44
317,Mr RODGERS,LAUNCHING OF THE,"Wannon) [5.21] This debate shows the necessity for candour in introducing legislation. Ha d the Prime Minister, when introducing his land tax proposals, taken this House into his confidence, he might have lessened the wide range of the debate, and enabled honourable members to direct their attention to the particular object for which the legislation was introduced. As it is, the debate covers the whole wide range of the original taxation proposals which were so exhaustively debated in this chamber in 1910. I have looked up much of that debate, which was one of the finest that have ever taken place in this Legislature. We were assured just before the last elections that during the continuance of the war the late Government, which I supported, would not, because it would be wrong, deal with This Go- anything contentious. An appeal was made to the country to create a Government that would take full cognisance of the war conditions and provide peace conditions within Australia, if it could not do so abroad. Mdy I ask the Prime Minister and his party if this is the first instalment of the peace proposals of this peace Government? If it is, they are courting war to the knife, and war they will have. So far as I am able to keep the thing going, I shall do my little b it . We may take it that, instead of this being a peace proposal, or the Government a peace Government, we are now in the hurricane season of the taxation proposals of the Government, introduced at a time when those against whom they are directed are least able to bear them There has never been in the history of Australia a period when the people on the land have been less able to bear the burdens sought to be imposed upon them by this Government. That fact cannot be emphasized too often. The honourable member for Indi said that the honourable member for New England had repeated the criticisms on many phases of the question offered by previous speakers. He could hardly help doing so, and would not be doing justice to his electors and to his own conscience if he were not to record an emphatic protest on behalf of the people who sent him to this Chamber. I give the honourable member for Indi credit for the manner in which he sought, from his point of view, to show the people of Australia that a mere additional contribution of 2s. lOd. per annum was not going to k ill the farmer who owned land to the improved value of £10,000, but with a taxable valne of £5,000, and that he would be unpatriotic if he failed to hand it over in this time of war. That is a specious argument, on the face ofi t ; and were that the only aspect of the Bill affecting that farmer, he could take no objection to it , unless he were an unworthy citizen of this great country, in such a time of crisis. B ut the honourable member very cleverly and astutely side-tracked the other effect of the Bill , namely, that, if lieve some members of the Labour party, who are sufficiently candid to put the truth about the measure forward, its real object is to burst up large estates. It is an inescapable doctrine that if we reduce the value of the broad acres, the value of the small farms must come down also. I defy the honourable member, with all his astuteness, toprove to the farmers of Indi that if he brings down the value of the large holdings he can still keep up the value of the small holdings in his electorate. The life of these men are wrapped up in their littl e properties, and the honourable member cannot prevent them from suffering from the shrinkage in value which will be the effect of this tax.  been the effect in any country where the land tax is in operation. Take New Zealand,, for example.",44
318,Mr RODGERS,LAUNCHING OF THE,"It is the inevitable effect. I have been concerned a good deal with land, and venture the opinion for what it may be worth that, with the exception of land such as is to be found around Colac and in the Tower Hill country, and the rich river flats in the districts of the honourable member for Richmond and the honourable member for .Cowper, where the lands can hardly be brought down in value, because these rich volcanic lands are limited in area and the population keeps in creasing, values throughout the broad range of our country generally have been reduced as a result of the land tax. Let me place on record the view of one member of the Commonwealth Labour party.  reconcile your statement with Senator Millen's declaration in another place that the Federal land tax had not lowered the value of land ?",45
319,Mr RODGERS,LAUNCHING OF THE,"It is not my concern to reconcile my views with those of any other honourable member. I make the statement from my knowledge of the country. A fair amount of land goes through the hands of the firm with which I am associated during the year, and we ought to know something about the question, seeing that the operations spread well over Victoria. We are indebted to Senator Stewart for a very candid expression of opinion oa tha subject. On 14th October of this year he made, on the floor of another place, the following clear and we can be- most definite statement - In 1910 the Labour party was so seized of the desirability of increasing the opportunities",45
320,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LAUNCHING OF THE,Is the honourable member quoting from a speech made in the Senate on this question 1 ,45
321,Mr RODGERS,LAUNCHING OF THE,Yes .,45
322,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LAUNCHING OF THE,Then the honourable member will not be in order in doing so.,45
323,Mr RODGERS,LAUNCHING OF THE,"Then I will give the effect of the speech, which was that the party imposed land tax legislation, earnings and that, notwithstanding that it had brought in an aggregate revenue of between £5,000,000 and' £6,000,000, it had failed to secure the object which the Labour party had in view, namely, the bursting up of large not estates. He went on to say that that was the real object of the party. If there is one man in that party who is acquainted with the subject of land taxation, and with the objective of such taxation, it is the honourable senator fco whom I have referred, and I should like the honourable member for Indi to reconcile his views with those of that honourable gentleman. According to the honourable member for Indi , the Bill will impose upon the holder of an estate, the improved value of which is £10,000, or a taxable value of £5,000, a tax of only 28. lOd. If that be so, the unconstitutional object which the Government is by this indirect means trying to achieve will not be achieved. orable member for Indi may be able to explain away his statement when before his constituents, but the contrary view will also be put before them when he seeks re-election. The Bill will increase country. the taxation on freehold lands, and impose taxation on lands held under lease. I shall not enumerate the various forms of leasehold in Australia, which are numerous, but I wish to point out that the leased land is the property of the Grown, and under the direct control of the Governments of the various States. Each State, since it was granted constitutional government, has had to carry the baby in respect of its leasehold land. It has only been by offering premiums that it has got this land taken up, sometimes in large areas, and sometimes in small, and sometimes under lease, and sometimes under licence. Each State, too, has made reservations for its own purposes. Thus we have timber reserves, mineral reserves, and even, as the honourable member for Barker pointed out, oil and salt reserves. The tax which the Labour party seeks to impose is a tax on the Governments of the States. The lessees of these State lands have merely the limited rights of user. The Attorney-General thinks that be sees a taxable margin between the rentals of - these lands and their true economic value, but whenever a State chooses to turn the screw a little, and put up the rent, this taxable margin must disappear. As to the proposal to impose land taxation to burst up large estates, J would say in the first case that, so far as it applies to the lands of Western Australia and New South Wales, it is an absolute condemnation of the Labour Governments in power in those two ""States, because, having absolute cont r o l of the land policy of those States, they have neglected to provide adequately for settlement. It seems to me, however, a preposterous thing that the Commonwealth should try to dictate to the States on the question of land policy, .seeing that the sovereign rights of the States in respect * of land matters were reserved to them by the Constitution. The Governments of the States have, in some instances, bought back large estates, subdivided them, and resold them to in crease the facilities for settlement. They have sent agents abroad, and have agents - within their borders, whose business it is to get men to settle on the land. While the Labour party may tax the present The hon- large holders off the land, it cannot tax new men on. It is impossible, by imposing taxation, to secure men possessing the requisite knowledge, grit, and inclination to settle on the lands of the",45
324,Mr LYNCH,LAUNCHING OF THE,"An y number of men are desirous of settling on the land, but cannot do so.",46
325,Mr RODGERS,LAUNCHING OF THE,"The honourable member supporting the Government is a wheat-grower in New South Wales, and he, in effect, tells this Chamber that the Labour Premier of that State is neglecting his duty to the people by failing to make land available for settlement; that there are many persons there who wish to take up land, yet the Holman Government will not provide land for them. But the Commonwealth has no constitutional right to interfere in matters of this kind. It is, however, proposed to do indirectly, by means of land taxation, what constitutionally we cannot do directly. The honourable member for Echuca spoke about a little bird whispering abroad the real object of this tax, but it has whistled aloud from every tree that the object is to burst up the large estates to secure closer settlement. We gather from the declarations of honourable members opposite that that is the intention of this measure, though the Leader of the Government has not said that it is a Bill to provide for closer settlement. If , as seems to be the case, its genuine and bond fide, object is to in crease settlement, why does not the Government propose a common-sense method of dealing with the land? The first step needed is to classify the land according to its quality. The classification might first be directed to valuing the lands suitable for settlement close to public u t i l ities, by which I mean railways, water schemes, and so forth . But there is another class of land, which, far removed from railways, is absolutely unsuitable for cultivation, and which, even in large areas, could not, under any process of taxation, be put to much better uses. It is a cruel wrong and injustice to tax land-holders, who have taken their families out to inferior country in distant parts, and who, in many cases, have to do without the advantages of civilization.",46
326,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,LAUNCHING OF THE,And many of whom are heavily mortgaged.,46
327,Mr RODGERS,LAUNCHING OF THE,"That is so; in many cases more than half the necessary capital has been obtained from financial institutions in order to enable them to found homes.. This Bill cannot assist in the slightest the settlement of such country, but will merely confiscate a value that has taken years of labour and industry to build up. There is an aspect of the case which I hope to be able to place before honourable members on behalf of the large land-holders of Wannon particularly. There is no land-holder in Wannon that I know, big or small, who in this time of stress would not make his contribution, according to his means, for the defence of the country. This is a time of great t r i a l, when the fate of the Empire is at stake, and when, from day to day, we watch' anxiously for news across the water. Farmers, large property-owners, dairymen, and orcharSists have sent their sons to the front , and today old men may be seen in the fields doing the work of their boys. A r e these the sort - of men likely to be found skulking when it is a matter of making financial contribution to the defence of the country ? I disclaim any desire to stand specially for the large land-holders, and if the Government will take their courage in both hands, and renounce their plan of unconstitutionally dealing with the lands, and surrender to the States the just rights of land taxation, I pledge myself to assist in introducing and passing a Federal income tax which would make a levy on every citizen, including honourable gentlemen opposite, who are not called upon to contribute under this measure. 1 never have been keenly in favour of a land tax. The honourable member for Indi did some of us, at any rate, justice when he said that we were loud in declaiming against the Federal land tax, but did not object to a State land tax, because, personally, I did object to a State land tax. I find that the great need in Australia is to obtain population to use our lands, and for that population we look all over the world. If we single out our land-holders for special taxation, and exempt their more fortunate brethren, we make an unjust distinction-w e place a special impost on the wood and water carriers of the country. I have always been an advocate of an income tax, and at the present time. I am prepared to tur n this machine of taxation to the very l i m it to assist in the defence of the country and the Empire. burden of defence should be equitably and fairly spread all over Australia. This system, which is what I migh t call reprisal, and vindictive reprisal at that-whic h picks out 14,000 persons as subjects of special taxation at war time-is absolutely unworthy of the Government. There is no mandate for such taxation, and honourable gentlemen opposite, if they intended to impose it , failed in not informing the country of the fact. I challenge any member of the Labour party to show me any declaration before the elections that it was their in tention, if returned to power, to impose a land tax in order to finance Australia in the ordinary sense of the word, or even to finance it for defence purposes. I wish to put a further aspect of the question. The Minister of Trade and Customs has, on several occasions re1 cently, dealt with the question of the wheat duty.",47
328,Mr TUDOR,LAUNCHING OF THE,"And dealt with them very well, too!",47
329,Mr RODGERS,LAUNCHING OF THE,"The honourable gentleman has dealt with them in a way that will cause him to be known aa "" Cobden "" for the rest of his life, for he has renounced his Protectionist policy, and thrown over the farmers. It was pointed out to the Commission which in vestigated the matter that many men were going to make fortunes on the wheat market, and that one man in particular would make £90,000. If that be true, will the Minister of Trade and Customs tell me how, under the taxation proposals before us, that man will contribute one penny of this large sum which, it was said, he has unjustly and u n fair ly extracted from the an in - people of this country?",47
330,Mr TUDOR,LAUNCHING OF THE,I never said any man had made any such sum.,47
331,Mr RODGERS,LAUNCHING OF THE,"I did not say that, the Minister had made the statement, but members of his party have, and it has been recorded in the newspapers.. Can this be a fair basis of taxation when a man, who, in one season, and within a few weeks, and at wartimes, can make a fortune of £90,000, i * not called upon to contribute one penny of it to the defence of the country ? This form of taxation, if it goes on, may have one effect. It may return to power a party which will take a view more fair and equitable; but, in the meantime, it The will be responsible for the ruin and destruction of the best interests of the country, and the breaking of the hearts of many people who have slaved for years to help its progress.",47
332,Mr WISE,LAUNCHING OF THE,"Gippsland) [5.48] - Were it not that time presses, I should be sorely tempted to reply to many of the inconsistent arguments that have been used on the other side in connection with this Bill .",48
333,Mr MASSYGREENE,LAUNCHING OF THE,The honourable member bas not been here to listen to them.,48
334,Mr WISE,LAUNCHING OF THE,"If I had been here, I should probably have more inconsistent arguments to reply to. I rise for the purpose of saying that the objections I had, when the original land tax proposals were before us a few years ago, hold good now. These objections were two; the first, that so far as the object of the legislation was to burst up large estates, however laudable and desirable that object might be, it did not come within the jurisdiction of this Parliament; and the second, that when taxing wealth for revenue purposes it was unjust that only one kind of wealth should be taxed. I am aware, of course, of all the taking arguments used in favour of the single tax ; but they have never convinced me that the man who invests in land should be taxed, while the man who invests in Government debentures should go free. In Victoria the hard-working farmer about whom wo hear so much from the other side is taxed on the income he derives from his land, but the man who invests in Government debentures pays no in come tax at all. That is the result of so called Liberal legislation in this State.",48
335,Mr WATT,LAUNCHING OF THE,"The small farmer in VicCook, Joseph toria does not pay income tax on the produce of his land.",48
336,Mr WISE,LAUNCHING OF THE,U pfcorecently he did so. It was only when the land tax was imposed that a concession was made.,48
337,Mr WATT,LAUNCHING OF THE,Yes . When the land tax was imposed we remitted the income tax in the case of land-holders.,48
338,Mr WISE,LAUNCHING OF THE,"Exactly ; up t ill then the Ozanne, A. T. Victorian Government made a man pay Catts, J. H. income tax upon the income which he Watkins, D. derived from land, but they did not make Charlton, M. the individual who invested his money Eiley, E. in Government debentures pay income Mahon, H . tax. When taxation of wealth for Thomas, J. revenue purposes has been rendered Howe, R. necessary, I have never yet been able to see why land alone should be taxed. Por that reason I opposed the Land Tax Acts when they were originally introduced into this Chamber, and for the same reason I opoose this Bill . So far as expenditure for war purposes is concerned, I am strongly of opinion that there ought to be one general war tax. If I had my way, I would impose a surplus wealth tax, and T would make the exemption the amount at which it ceased fco pay the Commonwealth to collect it . In regard to war expenditure generally, I think that we should all contribute according to our ability, and that taxation should stop at the minimum at which it would not pay the Commonwealth to collect it .

In addition, some of the areas are in danger of infestation by prickly pear and rabbit, and although rental may be 5s. or 10s. a mile, or higher sum, there are other conditions which have to be complied with under improvement covenants.

347,Mr FISHER,RATE OP TAX WHEN AN OWNER IS NOT AN,"Yes , but not very much of it .",50
348,Mr GROOM,RATE OP TAX WHEN AN OWNER IS NOT AN,"That fact has to be taken into consideration. trouble arises in this way, that the Crown in Queensland is dealing with the tenants as Crown tenants, and they have their Land Courts, which, after the grant, assess periodically these values upon the principle I referred to this morning. Section 125 of the Queensland Land Act provides1. The Court, in determining the rent of a pastoral holding or grazing selection, shall have regard to(a) The quality and fitness of the land for grazing purposes; (b) The number of stock which it may reasonably be expected to carry in average seasons; (c) The distance of the holding from railway or water carriage; (d) The natural supply of water, and the facilities for the raising or storage of water; .(e) The amount which experienced persons would be willing to pay for land of square similar quality in the same neighbourhood ; and ({) Any other .matters which, in the opinion of the Court, affect the rental value of the land. Those are the different elements which the Court has to take into consideration in fixing rents. On the top of that, the Commonwealth is coming in as a sort of superior authority to try to get something be which it is said has not yet been got out of the pastoral tenant. For getting that extra contribution, the figures supplied by of the Land Tax Commissioner show the basis on which the tax is to be worked out. Honourable members are introducing into this Bill an entirely new principle. is I would like to reiterate the statement when the Bill of 1910 was introduced, it did apply to these leaseholds. Then Parliament decided to specially exthe empt them. Now, for some unknown a reason, the Government are reintroducing this very big problem, and the Committee the have no explanation as to why this is being done. As I have said, it will create and I believe it will burden only the tenants. The policy of the Queensthe land Government is to induce people to go into the outlying districts and make them productive.  I discuss this point when we are dealing with the Assessment Bill .",50
349,Mr GROOM,RATE OP TAX WHEN AN OWNER IS NOT AN,"When once we have passed this Bill , it will apply to leasehold and freehold alike, - and both will be added together to produce a cumulative effect.

In any case, the discussion now will save discussion at a later stage. I hope the Treasurer will give some explanation of how what appears to be an artificial rule fixing the valuation of private lands before the commencement of the Act , is now to be applied to the tenants of the Crown all over Australia.",50
350,Mr MASSYGREENE,RATE OP TAX WHEN AN OWNER IS NOT AN,"Richmond) [6.17] - I would like some explanation of the reason for imposing these very heavy rates of taxation on leaseholds. is common knowledge that are considerable areas of Australia which can only be worked in large holdings. Men with small capital, who could only work a limited area of this land, are bound to fail, as has been proved by repeated experience in different parts of the country. There are areas hundreds of miles away from the centres of civilization, which are so situated that the cartage of material and provisions and the conveyance of stock are very costly. They are very often subject to severe drought, and the conditions generally are such - that they can only be worked by men with large capital. They take up large areas of this land, and with their capital they are able to conserve water and put down bores. In as much as great parts of the Commonwealth can only be occupied and made productive, so far as we know at the present time, by citizens of considerable means, why should they be called upon to pay a tax which honourable members opposite advocated as a bursting-up tax? Five years ago our honourable friends came along and said that they desired to place a very heavy burden of taxation on large land-holders. Why? Because they wished to. see those lands occupied by small settlers. However one may object to their methods, there is no difference of opinion in this House as to the desirability of getting closer settlement wherever it is possible. But when ""we find answer "" Yes "" or "" No . "" our honourable friends applying this taxation to huge areas which they must admit can only be occupied, developed, and worked by men of large capital, I ask why should such men be singled out for taxation,, which it is admitted is penal in its character, and is intended to have that effect? Is there any justification for applying the taxation to that class of holdings? Surely we are entitled to hear from honourable members opposite what is the object they desire to attain. They cannot burst up these holdings, but they can tax the holders off the land provided that it is possible to adopt the method of valuation which is indicated in the table read by the honourable member for Darling Downs. I do not know whether that is possible or not, but it seems to me that it is not practicable to value on a freehold basis, which appears to be the basis that the Commissioner chooses to use as an illusIt tration, huge areas of land which there the Crown has for various reasons laid down shall never be alienated. How are we to arrive at a freehold basis of valuation for land which can never be made freehold? It seems to me, as the Attorney-General indicated in his second reading speech, that there can be only one method of arriving at "" the economic value,"" as he termed it , and that is to ascertain bow far the rental demanded by the Crown falls short of the value which it should have demanded. I would like to hear from the Treasurer, now that he is here, what is the reason for taxing the leaseholds and using the penal provisions of the Land Tax Assessment Act? Is it the desire of the Government to burst up large leaseholds? Surely he can say "" Yes "" or "" No . "" He is looking at me, but why is he silent when a simple, straightforward question is asked ?",51
351,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RATE OP TAX WHEN AN OWNER IS NOT AN,He might look at you pleasantly.,51

Can the right honourable gentleman tell me? I venture to say that he cannot, and, what is more, he dare not answer the question in a straightforward way, because he knows that the moment he opened his lips it would be to condemn his own policy.

Yet the Government come along at this particular period and endeavour to tax these men off the land, for that is what it means. If the Commissioner is going to set to work to value the lands on the basis which the table he supplied to the honourable member for Darling Downs would lead us to believe, and which, I venture to say, is quite an impossible . system, there is not the slightest doubt that it will lead to very heavy indeed on the leaseholds.",52

358,Mr MANIFOLD,RATE OP TAX WHEN AN OWNER IS NOT AN,"Corangamite) [8.0]. - There are some points in connection with this measure which I wish to bring under the notice of the Prime Minister. I hope I shall be able to convince some of his supporters that this tax will seriously affect the leaseholders of Australia. It should be remembered that the portions of Australia held under leasehold are being developed to a very great extent by people who hold other property, and it may be freehold property, in States other than those in which they hold leasehold property. These people have lost a very considerable amount of money in years of drought in the past. I feel certain that the Prime Minister does not expect that this taxation will have the effect of breaking up leasehold properties in remote districts of Australia for purposes of closer settlement. We are endeavouring today to induce people to go with their capital to the Northern Territory to develop that country by taking up leases under the Crown. The people who of will do so must be the forerunners of closer settlement, as those who have deveMinis- loped the outlying portions of Australia in the various States have been in the past. The Administrator of the Northern a very Territory tells us in his report that the small farmer is practically of no use there. We must, in the first place, have the large leaseholder, who will prepare the way for the small farmer. In New .South Wales, and particularly in Queensland, there are some very large Crown knows leases in connection with, which the Crown invested has the right of resumption. From time to time certain portions of these leases are resumed, and the lands balloted for under a modified system of closer settlement. I should like the Prime Minister to say whether he desires to penalize the people who have put their money into these Queensland leaseholds. If the object is to impose a revenue tax, it is quite right that these people should be taxed, in common with all other holders of leases, but the holder of a small leasehold should be required to pay proportionately the same tax. We have been told by the honourable member for Darling Downs that, in the case of a person who owns no other land in the Commonwealth having a property the unimproved value of taxation which is £20,000, according to the calculations of the Land Tax Commissioner, the taxable value of that property would be £ 9 , 3 0 8, and the leaseholder would have to pay a land tax of £ 2 3 2s. 2d. That would be a very reasonable tax ; but if , as is frequently the case, the owner of this leasehold is also the owner of freehold in any part of the Commonwealth, the value of his property is reckoned together, and if the total value comes up to £75,000, the taxation upon the leasehold would be under the 9d. rate, and, instead of being £ 2 3 2s. 2d., would amount to £344 Is. Is that a fair proposition ? Is that a fair way in which to tax leaseholders in Queensland, who are subject to a right of resumption by the Crown? This is distinctly a class tax upon people who have done their best to develop Australia. I have often thought that some of the gentlemen who advocate this kind of taxation should have put a little of their savings into Queensland It should not be forgotten that the men who went out to Western Queensland in the early days had first to learn what was to be done with the country. The honourable member for Darling knows fectly well that those men had no experience in the district. lieved at first that they would a great success in pastoral tion by sinking wells to water their stock. They found that that was absolutely useless. Then the system of overshot dams on the creeks was adopted. Where a hole 30 feet or 40 feet deep was found, it was thought that, by putting up a bank of 20 feet, 50 or 60 feet of water might be conserved. But the soil being loose, it was found that, in a dry season, instead of having 40 feet of water, they might not have more than 20 feet in the dam. Later the pumping system with a circular dam was tried. These were three stages of development of the western country, during which the holders of properties Queensland invested a great deal of money, which was absolutely lost. came the system of artesian boring, and the artesian bore made a comparative success of pastoral occupation. Crown lessees put down bores for 3,000 feet, at a cost of £5,000. Some of these bores have not been the success that many persons think they are. Some bores sunk, on the higher lands have ceased to be artesian; water has sunk aa much as 60 feet in the casing, and it is necessary now to pump it. If honourable members will consider what the people who went out into Western Queensland and took up Crown leases have had to go through, they will realise to some extent the enormous losses that many of them, have suffered.. I. take, for the purpose of further illustration, larger leasehold than that referred to by the honourable member for Downs. Multiplying the honourable member's, figures, by four, I. take the case, of a leasehold property the unimproved of whioh is £80,000. The taxable value of that, property would be. £37,232. rental payable to the Crown is £1,200 a year,, and, deducting that, we have a taxable value of £36,032. If that comes, under the 9d. rate, because, the holder of Mr Manifold. the lease is also the possessorof freehold land of value in some other part of the Commonwealth, he will be required to pay Federal land tax on that leasehold to the amount of £ 1 , 3 5 1 , or considerably leaseholds. more than the total rent he is called upon to pay for the land. I do not think that any one will contend that that is a fair proposition. There would not be so much to object to if it were proposed per- to tax a leasehold on its own basis, but when the 'value of the lease is added to They be- the value of other properties held by the make lessee, and the total value brings it under occupa- the higher rate of tax, it becomes a very severe impost indeed. The Government may believe that they will obtain a certain amount of money ab the expense of persons holding Jeaseholdls in Western Queensland, the rentals of which may be reappraised from time to time. What will be the natural course of events under a tax of this kind? The State Government of Queensland will in all probability double the present rentals, and there will then be practically no taxable value left on which to impose this Federal tax. Surely honourable members supporting the Government do not contend that these in leaseholds should be broken, up. There can be no question of closer settlement in Then the western districts of Queensland, and the Government proposal is really to tax the owners of these leases off the land, especially in a bad season. I have been referring chieflyfcoportions of Queensland comprised in the higher downs country. There are no rabbits or other pests in that country, but the leaseholders are the called upon to pay considerable taxation to cope with the rabbit pest. They have to pay towards the cost of the wire netting fences which are run across Queensland in the endeavour to prevent the rabbits going further north in that State. What is to happen to these waste lands of the State, which can only be profitably used atfche'present rentals imposed a. upon them? What is to be done, in the case of the prickly-pear country? Darling Are people likely to gothere, and to spend their money in an. endeavour to improve that country, if. they know that value they are to be taxed in this way ? I think that the Prime Minister, before this de1 The. bate closes, should, dealw it h this; question of. leaseholds^ and inform Australia whether it is the intention of the Labour party to practically cripple the leaseholders, in the outer portions o i the Commonwealth. If it is, the right honourable gentleman will be able to set a bold policy before the people. He will be able fco say, "" We will not allow you to have large leasehold properties in the States; but come along to the Northern Territory, and we will treat you differently. "" That, I contend, is not a fair proposition to put before the people.  silence of the Prime Minister and his followers leads me to the conclusion that, as representing the men on the land in our constituencies, we, on this side, have very little hope of obtaining sympathetic consideration for the very many cases that have been made out in their interests. I desire to make a final appeal to the Prime Minister. I wish to point out the great disability under which the man on the land will suffer if this clause be allowed to pass. I am quite satisfied that the first schedule to the principal Act, and now in force, is all that should be enacted in the present circumstances. of the drought and the troubles from which the men on the land are suffering-and they are by no means out of the wood y e t - I think that the amount which the Government expect to realise from the imposition of this taxation will not be easily obtained. In the first place, we find that the estimate of £2,700,000 is about £1,090,055 more than was realized in 1913-14. If this tax on leaseholds produces what I am told it is estimated to prodnce, namely, £500,000, this means that the existing taxpayers will have to pay an amount equivalent to 36 per cent, or 37 per cent, more than they are now paying, although their position today is much worse than it was last year or the year before. I therefore moveTliat the word "" fifteen,"" twice occurring in the first schedule be left out with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words ""twenty-five."" I am not prepared to retreat for one moment from the position I take up, that the present imposition is quite sufficient in existing circumstances, although it seems impossible to get the Government to see it , but I propose to test the feelings of the Committee, and to see if the Labour party's boasted plea of voicing humanitarian doctrines is a mere farce, or whether it has any deep significance, by asking them to exercise a humanitarian judgment in this matter, and to vote for this amendment.  port the amendment, believing that some relief should be given to way-back settlers. On several occasions I have had the pleasure of visiting the western districts of New South Wales, especially the Darling River country. About six or seven years ago I visited a big station there known as Winbar. I was informed on that occasion that the station comprised 500,000 acres on lease extending over a period of forty-three years, and that, since the signing of the lease, certain portions of the property had been available for settlement, but that not one block had been taken up. In support of the statements made by. the honourable member for Corangamite, I should like to point out that the area to which I refer is not suitable for closer settlement. It is essentially country for the big pastoralist. There is hardly an acre of land cultivated in the district. I noticed that there were eight or nine boundary riders employed on In view the station, and that they were using a single-furrow plough in an effort to cultivate a small area. They know nothing about the work, being essentially sheep farmers, and I was satisfied that no effort had been made fco grow wheat there, unless it might be sufficient to supply their own requirements. Coming to the question of the economic value and the rental value of the land, in New South Wales, so far as settlement and improvement leases are concerned, the owners have to appear before the Land Boards from time to time, when values are entered into very carefully and re-appraisements made. If there is any disparity between the economic value and the rental value, it is a matter for adjustment by these Land Boards. An y difference between the two is immediately filled up by the Board, so that there would actually be no rent for the Commonwealth Government to levy upon, since the whole difference would have been adjusted by the States. Por this reason, I think some relief should be given to these men. The wayback settlers have denied themselves the privileges and luxuries of civilization, and are acting as the outposts of Australia They are just where we want men, and surely our experience of the Northern Territory should lead us to extend sympathetic consideration to them. Although the Northern Territory is as big as England, Scotland, Ireland, Germany, and Prance combined, we have not yet been able to settle there more than a thousand people. If - we impose these disabilities on people, who desire to develop country that is not required by others, we shall place a stumbling-block in the way of the true progress of Australia.",52
359,Sir JOHN FORREST,RATE OP TAX WHEN AN OWNER IS NOT AN,"Swan) [8.19] I should not like to allow this clause to pass without expressing my strong objection to it . My surprise is that at any time, and especially at the present, the Government should desire to interfere with Crown lessees in the States. The Government seem to have forgotten that Australia is very sparsely settled by pastoralists. Only the fringe of the country is occupied by them, and we ought to do all we can to give them the opportunity to extend their operations further inland. Instead, we are placing more burdens on them, apparently in the hope that this will encourage people to go out into the far back lands. From my knowledge of the interior, the advance of settlement must be slow, whatever inducements are offered. The natural obstacles in the way are very great. One-fourth of Australia-the interior-ha s no river system at all ; but this added burdens on those whom we want to go into that interior to advance settlement. We have done very little with the Northern Territory since we took it over, and if this policy is pursued it will not be settled for many years. I suppose the Bill will apply to the Territory ; but there is not much settlement there yet, and I do not sunoose there is more stock on the Victoria River and the Barklay tablelands today than there was before the Commonwealth took over the Territory.",55

There is not much difference between one twenty-five-thousandth and one thirty-thousandth.

362,Mr FISHER,RATE OP TAX WHEN AN OWNER IS NOT AN,"Wide Bay-Prime M in ister and Treasurer) [8.25] - The amendment does not seem a very serious proposal, but the purpose of the Opposition is, of course, to prevent the Government, if possible, from carrying out their financial policy, and the amendment, therefore, can have no other object. I do not complain of what the Opposition do, but they cannot take up two attitudes. They are entitled to resist our proposals, but the Government consider that this revenue is necessary. The amendment would have a lessening effect on the revenue to the extent of the difference between one fifteen-thousandth and one twenty-five-thousandth, and it would break up the whole scheme. A great deal has been said about this being wholly a ""breaking-up "" tax. It has never been so with myself, and I have never concealed that view of mine from the public at any time. A tax on the unimproved value of land is not a tax on industry; it is a tax on value, created, not by individual owners, but by the community as a whole. The honourable member for Richmond challenged Bill puts me to say ' ' yes "" or "" no "" to a question on that point. I do not need to do so. The breaking-up effect is only incidental to the tax, and it is a very good incidentality, too, for this country. Honourable members on this side feel just as keenly for those who are individually suffering hardships through the tax, but it is not a tax which Will destroy wealth. It will rather promote the wealth of the country, unless it is excessively burdensome. That has been its tendency in every country where it has been applied.",55

But it is proposed to tax leaseholds on the assumption that they all have a freehold value of 4 i per cent. In order to assess a leasehold, we must find the unimproved value of the land in fee simple, and we are establishing an artificial fee-simple value which may not exist. That raises the question whether the tax is valid; whether we can declare by Act of Parliament that all land for leased by the Crown has a capital value he represented by an annual value of 4^ per cent. That is a matter upon which based I am not now going to express an But it seems inexpedient to arbitrarily assign a capital value to in this way, irrespective of the considerations which determined the rental.

Is it fair that people who have gone out to develop Australia should assessed at the 9d. rate? Is it not sible to come to some arrangement, so that there may be the land' tax on freehold as at present, but to have two assessments, under which the owners freehold will continue to pay the 9d., while the leaseholders start at I d . , and rise to that amount? Surely that is reasonable proposition ? The leaseholders are not, and cannot become, monopolists, seeing that the land, in the case of Queensland, cannot become freehold, but reverts to the Crown automatically in a in. certain number of years. At a certain date so many hundred square miles are excised, and the rents re-appraised, and the balance given to the leaseholders for per a certain term. There are some very large places in Queensland, and many there had not been, because a great is. amount of Victorian money has been dropped there without any hope of recovery. Some of the estates which were 1,600 square miles in good country are down to 600 square miles, and in on the course of a few years there will be a cerfurther reduction. Those on the land, Auswhether people or companies, ought to be treated fairly.

The States are supposed to be managing their estates in the best way possible. They resort to every artifi.ee in order to do so. employ the best men obtainable to value the Crown lands. If honourable bers believe in the principle of leaseholds, as they claim to do, why do they seek to double-bank the taxation on those holdings? In this Parliament, agency of ours can we take account of all the circumstances that leases. I fancy that we shall get our money from one form of leaseholds. States have given rewards to men in order to get them to go out and reclaim some of their lands, or in order to tempt them to occupy land, to clear it of vermin, and to keep it clear, yet now we propose, by means of our rental provision, to take away these rewards from these men. We have no right to do any such thing. contract between the States individuals, stipulating that the latter shall have these rewards if they take the obligations and perform duties attaching to the occupation of these leases, and what right have we to step in upon those contracts, and take from the men who are doing this work for the States the value which the States give to them for doing it? seems to me to be one of the chief points against this proposal. not our land, we are not for keeping it clean, but after some one else has laid the eggs in the nest, we are coming in like the cuckoo to hunt them out and occupy the nest selves. Tremendous confusion must arise from this dual system of these Crown lands, because to fix rentals practically means to take over the management of leases, so far as sovereign power is concerned. Everything pressed in the rent. Improvements are to be made, the work to be undertaken, the liabilities to be incurred, are all expressed in the rent supposed to be already imposed by the States; and I do not know where we are to get the economic rent, unless we propose break in on a system already on by a State and a lessee as a fair one, and say that it is not fair. Mr Joseph Cook. making we must begin by doing that. We canWe are not get a penny by the taxation except management by impugning the management of the State lands and indicating to the world that the States are not doing their duty in ascertaining the economic rent for They these lands. We are to get the tax on the difference between the actual rent mem- paid and the economic rent. But surely the rents now paid are based on the economic value of the land. What more is needed? Yet, without knowing all the by no details of the leases and all the circumstances, we are to impose another valuasurround tion on land which has just been valued for a specific purpose; we are to come in The and say, "" A fig for your valuations in the States!

I have already pointed out that there is a great portion of Australia-r-of course, not the Darling Downs, or other rich portions with an assured rainfall-bu t large areas with a very limited rainfall, where the land-hoider has to take an immense amount of risk, and our experience has shown that these areas can be worked only in large holdings by men or companies with a fair amount of capital. Why do the Government wish to bring in taxation that will put land of that character out of occupation and make it unproductive again ? It has been difficult enough in the past to get men with sufficient capital, energy and enterprise to opeu up this laud, but the Eederal Government now propose to break up the estates and prevent the land from being profitably worked. Of course, everybody understands the formula that has been put before the House; it is a matter of simple calculation, but the formula is based upon some arbitrarily found value. The difficulty is to understand how that arbitrarily determined value is to be arrived at. Is it to be computed as in the principal Act? Honourable members know that in arriving at the present taxation they have first to ascertain what the fee-simple of the land would sell for ; but to ask people to termine the fee-simple of leasehold lands is to give them the task of finding out what is an absolutely artificial value.

Although the Prime Minister stated that he thought the difference between the rent paid today and the economic rent should be capitalized, and made the subject of taxation, I would point out that the valuation provisions of the principal Act arrive at the valuations by an entirely different method. It will be found in operation that the valuation by this method will be very difficult to arrive at ; it will be exceedingly costly, and if it is operated in a fair way I do not believe it will be productive of much revenue.",62

446,Sir JOHN FORREST,RATE OP TAX WHEN AN OWNER IS NOT AN,"Swan) [9.20]. - The Prime Minister seems to be sure of his majority when he tells us that he is going to sit on u n t i l this measure is passed, because it is in the in terests of the public. That, I suppose, is a matter of opinion, and I am sure that he is reasonable enough to admit that. In my opinion the Bill is not in the interests of the public, nor in the interests of the leaseholders or the pioneers. The right honourable gentleman ought to know that most of the existing leaseholds cover country which, in its natural condition, would carry no stock, or scarcely any. If the unim- a leasehold valuation. proved value were assessed we know very well that in most parts of the back country the unimproved land could not carry any stock, because very often there is no water,",63
447,Mr SPENCE,RATE OP TAX WHEN AN OWNER IS NOT AN,There would be no tax put on that country.,63
448,Sir JOHN FORREST,RATE OP TAX WHEN AN OWNER IS NOT AN,"The honourable member knows, or ought to know, that that is not the way in which estates are valued under the Act . The value of the country as it is now is the basis of valuation, and then the question is how much has its value been in creased by the improvements thereon. The assessors do not take into consideration the value of the improvements which a man has placed on his leasehold. When a man has improved a piece of land, and made it wealth-producing, and there is a piece of land adjoining which has not been improved, it is a question of how much greater is the value of the improved piece than the value of the piece not i m proved. We know from experience that a lot of money which is spent on a property is not deducted from the value of it at the present time, and if that was done in many cases there would not be any taxable value. We all know how leaseholds are sold. The value of the country is not divided from the stock, but the whole country and the stock are sold at so much a head. The lands, the buildings, the improvements, and the stock are. included in the price. In the case of leaseholds fenced with rabbit and dog proof wire fences, and provided with artesian bores, tanks, dams, wells, homesteads, and shearing sheds, you could hardly get at the unimproved value without separating the cost of those things. Of course it could be done if you deducted the whole cost to the lessee, but that is not the practice which is adopted. It is not so easy a process as honourable members opposite seem to think. This additional taxation upon property must be very exasperating and annoying, and most inconvenient, apart from every other consideration. In Western Australia all the pastoral leases will fall in , I think, in twelve or fourteen years. At the present time there are already three valuations. First, there is the shire council or municipal valuation; next there is the State land tax valuation; then there is the Federal land tax valuation, and in future there is also to be I think that the existing valuations are made separately, and I do not wonder that persons become annoyed. I should nave liked to hear the views of honourable members opposite who have had experience of pastoral leases, and know something about the country in the back blocks. I should have liked to hear my honourable friend who has recently been appointed a Minister, but who is not present now. He represented for many years a pastoral, agricultural, and mining electorate, but I have not heard hi m say a single word for his late constituents. He has now got into a better constituency, where he has only one class to represent; the pastoralists are not in his electorate any longer, but I should have expected him to express some sympathy with the struggling selectors whom he represented so long. The honourable member for Maranoa has had some experience, but he is as silent as if he were wrapped in the cold embraces of the tomb. Nor have we heard anything from the honourable member for Grey. Can it be that they are not in accord with this legislation? It is a very good reason for their not saying anything if they have to vote in a way which is not in accord with their wishes. In this country the pastoral industry is an important one, perhaps the most important one. I see that in 1912-and these are the latest figures available-the produce from the industry was valued at £52,000,000. In other Words, a fourth of the total production of Australia is due to the industry - I think that the pastoralists deserve the utmost consideration. Before I say a few words on that phase of the subject, there is another point to which I wish to refer, and that is the validity of what is being done. It seems-to me very questionable whether we can tax Crown lands. Occupation leases give the occuprises piers no right to the soil, but merely the right to the grass for grazing purposes and security of tenure. The lands are leased to the pastoralists by the Crown in the States. My honourable friends on the other side are not satisfied with taxing all the freeholds in Australia, but are determined to tax the lands which are leased by the States to individuals. I can only express the hope that it may be found that this legislation is beyond our powers. I express that hope because I do not approve of the Commonwealth invading the rights of the States where it is unnecessary. As regards the amount of money which the tax will bring in , I am quite sure that it will produce a great deal more annoyance than revenue. I disapprove of this desire to unduly tax all the interests connected with the land. The Leader of the Opposition has referred to this measure as being an interference with the powers »>f the States in regard to the management of their own property. It is very reasonable, I think, to use the argument that the desire is to interfere with the management of lands which belong entirely to the States, and with which we have no power to interfere except under our general power of taxation which we are "" run n in g to death."" It is not creditable to the Prime Minister, notwithstanding his. heroics, that he should try to invade the arena of taxation and legislation reserved by the States for themselves, when they very generously and without any coercion gave us all the powers which, as a Federation, we possess. It is not only ungenerous, but downright ungrateful on the part of the Labour party to propose, as they have done since Federation was accomplished, and not merely today, to invade the arena which the States retained for themselves, and which it was never intended should come under the control of this Federal Parliament. If there is one class of people which more than another in this country is deserving of the support and encouragement of every member of this Parliament, it is the pioneers who have reclaimed' the wilderness and made it [ 6 7 ] -2 wealth-producing. That is what the pioneers of Australia have done. If , in some instances, they have been rewarded for their exertions by wealth, it is still true that the majority of them have lost their money. Western Queensland comvery fine pastoral country, but more fortunes have been lost there by Victorian ' people than have been gained by those who have succeeded them. The TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN.

It initial step in connection with the assessCollins-street, ment of leaseholds that will give rise the first difficulty. It is necessary to in assessing these lands upon the unthree improved freehold basis. The proved v a l u e "" in relation to land defined in the principal Act to meanThe capital sum which the fee-simple land might be expected to realise if offered for sale on such reasonable terms and condiif tions as a bond fide seller would require, assuming that the improvements (if any) or appertaining thereto and made or acquired by the owner or his predecessor in title had not been made. The Prime Minister is aware that twenty throughout the whole of the western parts of Queensland the lands are held under a leasehold tenure, and alienation has taken place there. The Land Tax Commissioner will be asked to go to the western part of Queensi land, extending from the southern bordown der of the State to Cape York, and estito mate what he considers is the capital down sum which those western lands might be lowed. expected to realise if offered for sale on a fee - simple basis. What basis will he have to determine what that should be? Y e t that is the starting point of the whole valuation. The next objection is that, in order to estimate what is called economic value, it is worked out according to a formula which might apply admirably to Collins-street ""property, bu t which is entirely inapowners. plicable to lands in Western Queensland. It is an artificial formula, based upon a certain percentage. ' If we take the cases. case to which I have previously referred, of a leasehold of the estimated unimthe proved value of £20,000, the leasehold value is estimated by taking an arbithat trary 4£ per cent, of the unimproved value, which works out at £900. Then that is capitalized in accordance with the Act, and we get the taxable value of leasehold at £9,308. It is estimated a twenty years' lease of this leasehold land of an unimproved value of £20,000 bas a capitalized unimproved value of We are told that this is the economic value. The ordinary man, talking of the economic value of a leasehold, has same immediately in mind the unimproved value which it would bring in the marB u t the market value is not the of taxation under this Bill . There n is an arbitrary assessment based upon a is the rule of thumb, which might apply in but is not applicable to to the western country of Queensland. Supstart pose that in Western Queensland we had or four bad seasons, such as the "" unimseasons between 1901 and 1903; what is would be the economic value of leasehold land in Western Queensland' in those of the years? What would a man pay for the unimproved value of a leasehold which, it were a freehold estate, might be thereon estimated to be worth £20,000?",65
455,Mr FISHER,RATE OP TAX WHEN AN OWNER IS NOT AN,He would pay nothing.,65
456,Mr GROOM,RATE OP TAX WHEN AN OWNER IS NOT AN,"Exactly. But under this Bill lie would be assessed upon a years' artificial basis on £9,308. and his tax would amount to £ 2 3 2s. 2d.",65

459,Mr GROOM,RATE OP TAX WHEN AN OWNER IS NOT AN,That is another point.,65
460,Mr WATT,RATE OP TAX WHEN AN OWNER IS NOT AN,But it illustrates the point that in that case the Commissioner did not accept the valuation of the,65
461,Mr GROOM,RATE OP TAX WHEN AN OWNER IS NOT AN,"That is so. The honourable member was referring to fee-simple We are now dealing with the valuation of leaseholds in respect of which Bill says that a certain method shall be followed. The Prime Minister tells us this taxation is not intended for the bursting up of large estates. He is well advised in making that statement, because if the Bill were declared to be for the any other purpose than that of levying that taxation within the meaning of the Conof stitution, it would be ultra vires. The right honourable gentleman therefore says that it is for revenue purposes. In the same way, if the' Minister of Trade and Customs introduced a Bill , the real purpose of which was, not to impose high duties, not to raise revenue, but to establish industries, such a declaration in the Tariff itself might lead to its being questioned as being unconstitutional. Leading authorities in the United States of America hold that the incidental effect of a high Tariff may enable industries to be established; but the result, being incidental only, the taxation is v a l i d ; but it would be idle to say that the real object of .protective duties is not to bring about the establishment of industries. The same process of reasoning is in the minds of honourable members opposite in respect of this Bill . While it is true that it is desired to raise revenue, the Prime Minister will admit that the policy of his party with respect to this particular matter was framed by the Labour conference which sat in Brisbane in 1908, and laid down the general principle, which is now embodied as a plank in the platform to which they are pledged. Those who framed that policy should have a fairly clear idea of what their aims and purposes are. On referring to the official report of the Brisbane Labour Conference of 1908, I find that Mr J . Grant stated that Mr Watson bad said that the progressive land tax was not for revenue, but for the bursting up of the large estates.",65
462,Mr WATSON,RATE OP TAX WHEN AN OWNER IS NOT AN,"1 said it was not primarily for revenue, but for breaking up the big estates. Then Mr Hutchison, who was at one time a member of this Parliament, said that he felt thatThe progressive tax had two objects-first , enabling the big estates to be cut up for closer settlement, and secondly, asking those best able to do so to bear their fair share of tion. Senator Findley, who is a fairly good exponent of the views of his party, also saidFanners were.being driven out of Viotoria through not being able to obtain land, and that condition of things should be remedied by the imposition of the progressive land tax to burst up the big land monopolies. By endorsing the exemption of £5,000, Labour could prove incontestable that they desired to help the farmers and were on the side of the poor man. The bursting up of big estates is undoubtedly the hope and aspiration of honourable members opposite. The Prime Minister says that primarily the object of this taxation is the raising of revenue.",66
463,Mr FISHER,RATE OP TAX WHEN AN OWNER IS NOT AN,I have always * v i so.,66
464,Mr GROOM,RATE OP TAX WHEN AN OWNER IS NOT AN,"Quite so; but those who framed this policy for the Labour party did not hesitate to declare that the real object of it is the bursting up of big estates. The right honourable gentleman said, during this debate today, that, incidentally, t'.iis taxation would have that effect, and that it was, too, a very good incidental effect. That brings me to the point that this principle is being applied to the big leaseholds of Western Queensland, which under present conditions, and for many a day to come, could not be devoted to closer settlement for agriculture or dairying. I hope that with the extension of railway communication, and when the capabilities of the lands out there are better understood, a change will come over the scene. We know that in Queensland, as settlement progresses and a better know ledge of farming is acquired, pastoral lands are more and more devoted to agriculture. But that change is a long way off, so far as the lands of the western districts are concerned. Queensland has - allowed these leasehold tenures to exist there so that, as conditions improve, the land may be devoted to' closer settlement. But in applying this principle to the western lands of Queensland, the Government are trying to expedite a policy which' is utterly impracticable there. I fear that the only result of their effort may be to make pastoral pursuits so unprofitable there that the lands will become unoccupied. That, I am sure, is not the wish of the Prime Minister. I put this consideration to him in the hope that he will give it his sympathetic attention. If he is determined to apply this taxation to taxa- leaseholds, then, at least, he should refrain from making it cumulative. In the case of absentees, the tax will ru n up to lOd. in the £ 1 , and the results must be injurious. We are not raising these objections in any partisan spirit. The desire of honourable members on both sides should be to avoid any serious injustice. We must recognise that anything which tends to throw land out of cultivation and tc reduce the production of wealth in Australia, must be of serious injury to 'the Commonwealth. Let there be no mistake. If the rural districts are impaired in their productivity, the effect must be felt at once in all our cities. Town and country are closely related, and the high a wages prevailing in our city industries are possible only because of the increased production and the high prices being secured for our primary products. Any thing that interferes with those high prices, or with increased production, must have a serious effect on the cities, and must produce results which no one, I am sure, desires to bring about. I ask the Prime Minister to calmly think over this matter, and to take such action as will avoid the serious results which are likely to follow the passing of such a provision as this.  understand from the Prime Minister that lessees will have the right to make their own assessments?",66
465,Mr FISHER,RATE OP TAX WHEN AN OWNER IS NOT AN,"Yes .  one or two cases, and to ask the Prime Minister if lessees would be doing right if they assessed the value of the the basis that I intend to put before him . We have pastoral leases beginning with ten years without rent. Then commencing with a rental of 2s. 6d. per square mile per annum they go upwards. Assuming that 5 per cent, is the rental basis, what would be the capital value Bill . per acre, on which this taxation is to be based ? If it was based fairly , it would be one-six hundred and fortieth of 2s. or, if the rental was 10s. a square mile, it would be one six hundred of 10s. per acre. If the tax is to be fixed on the basis of the sale value of the as I gather from some honourable members posed. that it might be, it would be very unhandled fair, because there is no such thing sale value of these lands.",67
466,Mr GROOM,RATE OP TAX WHEN AN OWNER IS NOT AN,"The Act lays that down. good.  difficulty is going to arise. The lations are framed for dealing with freethe hold, or lands which may be converted hardships. to freehold, which is a very different proposition. Surely no honourable member on either side thinks that this is put on for the purpose of bursting leasehold estates, because I can instance few hundred, and probably a few thouget sand, in South Australia upon which would be absolutely criminal to put taxation that would throw the lessees with the idea of putting other occupants in, as the small men could not occupy them on account of the very nature of the country. They cannot be occupied except in very large areas. The State, under law, is now offering the first ten years without rental at all, and that fact will give honourable members an idea of some of the country out back. An enormous amount of money has to be spent on it , because it is waterless and infested with vermin of the worse type. I understood from the Atorney-General the other day that money spent on improving such country is not to be taken into consideration. Surely it ought to be considered. Under the existing Act , account is taken of it in the adjustment of the rent or the taxation, in the case of a lease of city property carrying building conditions. A man with a twenty-eight year lease may be paying only a nominal rental for the land, but may have to leave certain buildings on it at the end of his tenancy, and under the present law the tenant is entitled to consider that the value of those buildings represents a certain portion df the rent land on for the period of the lease.",67

I think that would be better if we did not tax perdoes sons .who have never been in Australia, but have sent their money here for investment. When persons who have made their money here go abroad to live, I have no objection to taxing them at a higher rate than is imposed upon residents in Australia; but when the money of persons who have never visited Australia is practically lent to us on reasonable terms, it is a short-sighted policy to tax the as investors. This investment has done the country an incalculable amount of good, 28 and I believe that millions of capital have 22 left the country of late years because of our land taxation. The point to which I wish to draw attention affects another matter. I feel that it is useless to ask the AYES. Government > to alter the proposals contained in this Bill , but I wish to suggest the insertion of a new clause which would in no way injure the Bill . There are persons living abroad who have bought land in the Commonwealth with the intention of coming to Australia to reside when they have finished their term of service in other parts of the world. Land in my constituency is held by many such persons, who have spent a good deal of money in having it cleared, orchard clearing being expensive. The Land Tax Commissioner considers that he has no power NOBS. to treat these persons other than as absentees, and that an amendment of the law is needed to meet their case. I hope that the Prime Minister will see the reasonableness of exempting these persons from the operation of the Bill . The taxation which they pay is small, but they do not like being taxed in this way. and others, hearing that they are taxed, think that we are not treating intending immigrants too kindly.

I cannot see why my honourable friends opposite refuse fco take a .lead from the Holman Government. There is not an honourable member - in this Chamber' in whose district unemployment does-not exist.

How often has he gone round the western districts of New South Wales administering the solace of moral persuasion and preaching the gospel of work, and a fair amount of it , and good opportunity for it , and good wages for it ? ' The Postmaster General knows the value of having com- petition for men's labour, and that it is the only real means by which men's wages are increased. We have an opportunity of encouraging the entry of as much money into this country as we can by throwing open the doors to that seed of Australian industry-^foreign capital. If Ministers will not explain why they differ from the State Labour Ministers in New South Wales, they can at least act as honestly as they did in the case of seed wheat, and remove this impost on foreign capital.

Clause 4The amendments of the principal Act made by this Act shall apply to land tax levied in and for the financial year beginning on the first day of July, One thousand nine hundred and fourteen and all subsequent years.  Every attempt at getting some explanation from the Government of their in tentions and of the operations of the Bill has been futile. I believe, however, that the Government have not yet grasped sufficiently the importance of this measure, and it would be in the interests of the country if a period of time were allowed to elapse before the measure came into operation so as to allow the in telligence of Ministers to ponder a little deeply on the provisions of the Bill . If the Government had an opportunity of calmly considering the effect of the Bill 27 for the next twelve months they might 19 be able to appreciate some of the arguments put forward fro m this side, the present drought might be considerably lessened, and the men against whom the AYES. Bill is aimed might be in a much better position than they are today to stand this impost. In the early stages of the measure it was clearly demonstrated that this is not a Bill for imposing taxation for war purposes, that the moment it became law it would remain law until it was repealed. If the operation of the Bill could be limited to the duration of the war, or if the operation of the tax Tellers: could be associated with the war in any Page, j . way, it might be viewed by this sidefrom an entirely different point of view. But as the measure, is to create an additional impost of over £590,000, an in crease of 36 or 37 per cent, on the taxation which land-holders are now paying, I consider that the Government ought to have a little longer time in which to consider the probable effects of the Bill . I therefore move an amendment That in line 5, the word "" fourteen "" he left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the word "" fifteen.""",71
493,Mr FISHER,RATE OP TAX WHEN AN OWNER IS NOT AN,The Government cannot accept that amendment. Amendment negatived.,72
494,Mr MASSYGREENE,RATE OP TAX WHEN AN OWNER IS NOT AN,"Richmond) [10.47] I move a further amendment That the words ""and nil subsequent years"" at the end of the clause lie left out. The object of the amendment is to make this additional impost simply a war tax. Whilst there may be some justification for placing this enormous burden on a comparatively few taxpayers-onl y about 15,000-ther e can be no justification for confiscatory taxation. In the higher gradations of the tax the additional impost amounts to one-fifth, and in some cases almost one-fourth of the taxable value of the land. That is added to the enormous taxation already levied-taxatio n for shire purposes, State land tax, and in come tax on revenue derived from landso that the imposts are becoming of such a nature that the whole value of land is tbeine taxed away. r - a very bad effect upon the country. Reeause once you take the whole value - of ithe land itself, you destroy one of the ..greatest assets in this country, for - a vast amount of wealth is invested in iland ;and is being constantly turned over :in production. I cannot see that taxa.tion of this confiscatory kind can possibly - be for the benefit of a country which - indulges in it . In any case, I submit - that the taxation should only be heavy during :the war.",72

496,Mr MASSYGREENE,RATE OP TAX WHEN AN OWNER IS NOT AN,"During this year we have some justification for imposing this taxation, and if it is found necessary next year, in consequence of the war, the Government of the day can come down and impose it for another year, but I do submit that in no circumstances should it be put as a permanent .impost on - the statute-book. nothing whatever in the suggestion of the Assistant Minister.",72

499,Mr MASSYGREENE,RATE OP TAX WHEN AN OWNER IS NOT AN,"I have not the slightest doubt, from the way in which the Labour party are transacting the business of the Commonwealth, that the Liberal Party will be in power after the next elections are held, but apart from that I say that "" sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof,"" and that this taxation should not be imposed for an indefinite time. The Government have no moral right to take that course.",72
500,Mr KELLY,RATE OP TAX WHEN AN OWNER IS NOT AN,"Wentworth) [10.52] I suggest for the consideration of the Prime Minister, that he might accept the amendment. The principle is a very old established one in the home of Parliament that taxation Bills of a certain nature should be introduced from year to year. This is essentially a Bill which the public outside regard as only excusable if it is introduced to. meet a great national emergency. If it is regarded, as I understand it is regarded by a number of honourable members opposite, as a mere measure to meet an abnormal expansion of Commonwealth civil activities, they are taking a very serious and foolish step, because undoubtedly, That can only have as the Assistant Minister of Defence put it , the war expenses will not terminate with the war, but we shall have to find funds to meet the dislocation. Why should our honourable friends opposite exploit the taxable possibilities of Australia to meet things with which this war is not concerned? They would have us believe that the measure has nothing whatever to do with the war. They repudiate the idea that it is connected with the war. That matter is to be dealt with by loan. But how are my honourable friends going to liquidate the loan afterwards? How do they propose later to put things on a solid and sound financial basis? They will have to face the issue sooner or later, but now they deliberately propose to take away a large share of the taxable assets. I believe that they are going to minimize the very basis of all taxation in a community of this kind, the riches' that come fro m the land, by putting on this extortionate There is tax. I think that the people of Australia will be ready to bear any sacrifice to shorten the trouble through which we are passing, but I hold that the best way to undermine the loyalty of the taxpayers to this or any other Government is for my honourable friends to show that - they regard this as a specially fine opportunity for profusion and wastefulness in directions outside the immediate crisis in which the country is engaged.",72

If was merely a question of a few men paypurposes, ing the tax for a year, well but it is not only a few men who pay the tax. Every manwho goes into a universal provider's establishment pays an increased cost for the goods over the counter because of the tax which the proprietor has to bear.

However, I rose merely to remove the i m pression which the right honourable member for Swan sought to convey that I was wanting in sympathy for the men who are pioneering in the wilderness in Australia. I have done as much for them in my limited sphere as .he has done: I do not say that I have bad the opportunities that have presented themselves to him ; but such opportunities as have offered have been availed of by me to assist those who are doing the pioneering work of this country. I have always given credit to the right honourable gentleman for what he has done in this respect, and it is most ungenerous for him to charge the Labour party or the Labour' Administration with having any desire to place undue burdens on the .pioneers of Australia.
