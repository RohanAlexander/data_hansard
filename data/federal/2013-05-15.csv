13,Mr HUNT,BILLS," It gives Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment Let me proceed in three brief steps. The principles and gas are very clear. The first is about seek to support energy security for Australia and, potentially-certainly in the case of gas-exporter. and for the world. It is about human development. and all of the benefits which come with modern flourishing offshore oil and gas industry, with is good for human development and is one hundreds of millions of people out of poverty profound historic contribution. The second of the principles is in relation sustainability. Whilst we want to see genuine flow from it, we do not want to make the trade-off we need strong, clear standards. This bill fairly consequence of the Montara incident and categorically, clearly and implacably opposed exploration in the Barrier Reef. In my judgement that, in generations. I think that that is something entire foreseeable future across the full political The third of the principles is to make sure To the extent that gas replaces other forms must be ecologically tested to ensure there are Disposal of the chemical and heavy metal to government regulations, particularly in clearance of vegetation for tracks and drilling any disturbance is kept to a minimum. Oil spill minister will ever have to worry about, but our environment. The Offshore Petroleum and Measures No. 2) Bill is focused on for clean-up and reduced environmental impact. to our Clean Energy Future. Obviously the to a low-emissions economy while upholding our Despite the doom and gloom and the relentless is that since 1 July and the introduction of the market have fallen by about 10 million NEM has increased by almost 30 per cent over has continued to grow close to trend and we have commend the government for the Carbon abatement projects to generate credits. attack, which is what a price does. disaster. Heaven forbid if they do get a chance me great pleasure to support the Offshore (Compliance Measures No. 2) Bill 2013. which we uphold in relation to offshore oil the economy and energy security. We unashamedly and the capacity to be an oil and gas producer These are good things for Australia It is about the access to heating and cooling society. Encouraging and supporting a viable a particular focus on gas, is good for Australia, of the drivers of bringing not just tens but in India, Indonesia and China. That is a to environmental safety, security and energy security and all the human benefits that where our environment is lost. That means and squarely addresses those standards as a the Montara commission. We, for example, are to mining and offshore petroleum and gas it will not change in my lifetime or, beyond which will be an Australian standard for the spectrum. So our duties are clear on that side. that we try to minimise our emissions footprint. of energy generation around the world, that is a way of doing this, but we also need to make broad bill addresses greenhouse gas storage-the overall national footprint. Let me then move from the principles to incident. I disagree with the member for public overreaction. It was a very serious consequences. I think it was well responded understate the environmental incident nor overstate that, we support the amendments which are in particular, the alternative enforcement mechanisms, for continuing offences; it is a tough regime. most part, outstanding. This was a case of consequences when there is significant damage principle. We support the inspection regime. titleholders. We support the regulator having recover costs from the titleholder, and we requirements. Against that background, we also think that, for federal and state environmental approvals ought to look-and here I move from policy to stop shop within the federal environment between a firm and the federal government coordinating agency for approvals, assessments a multiple agency regime. That is a personal concept in terms of federal-state relations to would make the difference on projects, I think, had to run the clock for five or six years to circumstances changed, the cost profile That brings me, lastly, to the contrast between budget. The contrast is this. This bill is minister and his predecessor; they have both chamber. By contrast, the entire carbon tax of $5 billion of revenues because they had there are still phantom revenue projections. 2016-17 forward carbon price of $18 in the market is saying the price will be. In other words, budget, and that means a $2 billion black hole toes up; it no longer exists. And, in 2016-17-using, opposed to the government's inflated phantom hole. What we have there is the same thing but ultimately unlikely to eventuate. It is exactly Compare these two examples of phantom revenue cooperative basis with industry and across as the offshore petroleum and greenhouse gas sure that we have adequate measures. Where this act itself-is one way of reducing our the bill. The bill is a response to the Montara Moreton, who made the point that it was a wild incident with very serious environmental to by the authorities in general, but let us not it. It was a serious incident. Having said proposed as a consequence of the commissioninfringement notices, daily penalties But our Australian companies have been, for the negligence, and it is appropriate that there are to the environment. Let me restate that We support the statutory duties on petroleum the ability to take the necessary action and support improving the effectiveness of insurance in the future, there should be a one-stop shop and assessments. In particular, I think we also a personal view-at a single, horizontal, oneso that there is only one point of negotiation rather than multiple agencies. I think a single and other activities would be far preferable to view as to how we can take the one-stop-shop a true, national, one-stop-shop assessment. That such as Olympic Dam and Browse, where they get approvals and, in the meantime, the economic went up and the projects were lost. this bill and what we saw last night in the an example of good cooperation, and I thank the been very good partners in working across the process has been a debacle. We saw a write-down phantom revenue projections last night. However, The 2015-16 price of $12.10 in the budget and the budget are more than double and triple what the there is still phantom revenue built into the in 2015-16. The surplus is gone-evaporated; again, the forward price of the market, as revenue projections-there is a $4 billion black as last year: phantom revenue, predicted, spent, what we said last year. Nothing has changed. with the way this bill was done on a the chamber. There should be more examples such storage amendment bill and fewer examples of phantom revenue for political purposes which evaporates.",210
