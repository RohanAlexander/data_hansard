2,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I do not know whether to treat the honourable member's question as one relating to a strike or a lock-out.. , Viewed from either stand-point, it places me in an equally embarrassing position.",14
3,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"J think that it is a""knock-out.""",14
4,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The question, however, is one that under no circumstances can be treated in a light fashion - The situation is too profoundly serious. It is because we have every desire to remain quite apart from the affray in the hope that a means of settlement will be speedily found tnat I must ask the honourable member not to press his question, the and other honourable member's not to press of similar questions. Judging.by the reports which appear in this morning's newspapers, there is every, prospect that action will, be taken by the State of New South Wales, the dispute has arisen, .which will, relieve us all at an early period of the this, grave and impending danger.

5,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"I desire to present a special report of the Printing Committeein reference to a petition which was preof sented to the House, on 18th September from certain electors in the electoral dis-"" trict of Hume, New South Wales. As the report concludes with a recommendation, I would suggest that it be read. Report read by the CLERK as followsThe Printing Committee, to which was rea Petition from certain electors of Hume; presented to the House on the 18th September for immediate investigation as to itsaccuracy and the alleged forgery of certain attached signatures, have the honour to report '; Youi 'Committee have examined the Petition And signatures, or what purports to be the signatures, attached thereto. Of these there are iixty-six. Letters have been written to Messrs. Heath - and Mitchelmore, the solicitors who prepared the Petition on the instructions of Mr James Beveridge, of Gundagai, to Mr Beveridge, and vto Messrs. Edmondson and Co., of Wagga Wagga, to whose premises, according to Mr. Beveridge, the Petition had been sent for signatures to be obtained, and replies have been received giving the information requested so far as available. Your Committee are of opinion that the following names attached to the Petition purporting *o be signatures are not genuine signatures, but are, in fact, forgeries, viz. :"" Alfred Deakin, Melbourne."" "" Harry Foran, Dom., Sydney."" "" May Francis, Crown-street, Sydney."" "" Beattie Booth, Reservoir-street, Sydney."" "" H . C. Walker, Customs House, Sydney."" Your Committee find that at the bottom of .page 2 of the Petition there has been written in ink what purports to be "" W. J. Lyne, Sydney."" An attempt has been made to cover this writing with ink, notwithstanding which ihe name, and address are still visible in outline. Your Committee are of opinion that this also is a forgery. The information received in reply to the let"" ieis above referred to in the opinion of your Committee points to a certain individual as the .perpetrator of the forgeries. It is recommended that theCrown Law authorities should be requested to take action with a view to a criminal prosecution of the offender, and that the correspondence in the possession of the Committee 5>e placed at their disposal for that purpose. House of Representatives, Committee-room, 14th November, 1907. . Report adopted. NA QUALIFICATIONS BILL. - Mr DUGALD THOMSON - I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether he intends to proceed with the.Disputed Elections and Qualifications Bill at once. understand that the adjournment of another place depends upon the passing of this measure.",14
6,Mr DEAKIN,DISPUTED ELECTIONS AND,"I recognise the urgency of the Bill, and hope to ask the House to give it some attention next week.",15
7,Mr REID,DISPUTED ELECTIONS AND,"In reference to the answer which the Prime Minister has just given, I wish to ask him whether we cannot arrive at a more immediate determination - of the question involved in the measure than his reply would seem to indicate?",15
8,Mr DEAKIN,DISPUTED ELECTIONS AND,The measure was only laid upon the table of the House today.,15
9,Mr REID,DISPUTED ELECTIONS AND,"I am quite aware of that. I believe that it is possible that the Senate - will adjourn at a very early date for a prolonged - period, and if we' make any amendments in this Bill, unless they are dealt with by the other Chamber before that adjournment takes place, the settlement of the whole matter will be deferred. Seeing that the-Senate has agreed to refer the matter involved in the measure to the High Court for decision the sooner it is determined the better, in justice to both parties.",15
10,Mr DEAKIN,DISPUTED ELECTIONS AND,I entirely agree with what the honourable member has said. The Senate is to be asked to continue sitting for a sufficient time to enable this House to dispose of the Bill.,15
11,Mr REID,DISPUTED ELECTIONS AND,It s consideration would not take long.,15
12,Mr DEAKIN,DISPUTED ELECTIONS AND,I know that. But honourable members have only just been placed in possession of copies of it'. NEW PROTECTION.,15
13,Mr HALL,DISPUTED ELECTIONS AND,"I wish to ask the Prime Minister whether the Bill embodying the new protection proposals of the Govern: ment has yet been drafted, and, if so, when will copies of it be made available to honourable members ? Mr DEAKIN.;- I may inform the honourable member that the difficulties in connection with the Bill' proper have been JOHN QUICK, almost, surmounted. The _ important quesChairman. tions, now awaiting 'determination lie in the schedule to. the measure, and"", that i's .receiving very careful consideration. 1 Mr Wilks"" - About a fortnight ago the Prime Minister was good enough 'to say in reply to a question by me that he would place on the table a memorandum setting out the salient features of the proposed legislation on the new protection. I I ask now when that memorandum will be produced, and whether it will be accompanied by a schedule of the industries to which it is proposed to apply the legislation?",15
14,Mr DEAKIN,DISPUTED ELECTIONS AND,"I have had the memorandum prepared so far as it can be from the legal side, and"" it has been sent on to the Department of Trade and Customs in order that it may be checked.",15
15,Mr HUTCHISON,DISPUTED ELECTIONS AND,"I should like to know, from the. Prime Minister, whether there is any doubt in. the mind of the Government as to the constitutionality of the legislation relating to the new protection, and, if so, whether steps 'will be taken to have the question tested before we dispose of the Tariff?",15
16,Mr DEAKIN,DISPUTED ELECTIONS AND,"The Government - is quite satisfied, on the advice of its law officers, of the validity of the measures which have been introduced, times referred to as the new protection legislation. An invitation has recently been publicly given-thoug h not by any member of the Government, or by Parliament-to those, who feel themselves in any way aggrieved, to test the constitutionality of the existing legislation. ' No doubt that invitation will be responded to j indeed, to use a Hibernianism, it would doubtless have been responded to if it had never been issued. MAIL SERVICE TO EUROPE.",16
17,Mr BOWDEN,DISPUTED ELECTIONS AND,I wish to ask the Prime Minister whether he is yet in a position to take the House into his confidence with reference to the new mail contract ?,16
18,Mr DEAKIN,DISPUTED ELECTIONS AND,"As soon as a cable has been received from London, and the signatures have been affixed to the. contract-whic h may take place today-it s terms will be communicated to the House. EXCISETARIFF ACTS : STANDA RD honestlv '' Mr DUGALD THOMSON - I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether he has observed the complexities which are arising in connection with the fixing of wages under the Excise Tariff Acts. number of tribunals are now determining the wages conditions of various industries. In the first place, I understand that two different rates have been fixed by the Justices of the High Court. Then the Minister of Trade and Customs is discharging a similar function. Further, Parliament may fix wages in certain industries if it wishes, and, in addition, a similar duty is being performed by the Wages Boards of the States. I am sure that the Prime Minister will recognise the complexities which this condition of affairs is creating. - I should like to know whether he has observed it , and, if so, whether in any contemplated legislation, means will be taken to avoid it . .",16
19,Mr DEAKIN,DISPUTED ELECTIONS AND,"In the absence of my honourable colleague, Mr Lockyer, the Assistant Comptroller-General of Customs consulted with me yesterday and again this morning in connection with some of the Complexities to whioh the honourable member has called attention. So far as I can form a judgment at the present time, it will be necessary, when the House meets after the Christmas adjournment, or as soon after as the information in our possession somewill admit, to submit a short measure dealing with these different standards of wages, and also with the retrospective operation of the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act prior to the declaration by the President of the Arbitration Court of the scale of wages which he has approved in the agricultural implement industry.",16
20,Mr WH IRVINE,DISPUTED ELECTIONS AND,In the meantime what will be done?,16
21,Mr DEAKIN,DISPUTED ELECTIONS AND,"In the meantime that branch of the Department will be busily occupied in communicating with the d if ferent persons concerned with a view to obtaining from them a full, statement of each case. All concerned have already been invited to send in these communications. This morning I saw a small country manufacturer for the purpose of explaining the position to him:, and he has, in the frankest fashion, put his position before me. It will be necessary for others to do the same. The Government will then be prepared to submit a proposal, which will inflict no hardship upon those who have done their best to comply with the law. OF WAGES.",16
22,Mr MCDONALD,DISPUTED ELECTIONS AND,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether, in view of the complicated position arising out of the industrial laws-as shown by the honourable member for North Sydney in Quite a the question which he addressed to' the honourable gentleman just now-the Government will take the earliest possible opportunity of bringing forward a Bill for the amendment of the Constitution, so that we may obtain uniform industrial laws throughout the CommonAvealth ? Mr D ' EAKIN - I think the honourable member wilT find that there is already a motion to that effect upon the business paper.",16
23,Mr MCDONALD,DISPUTED ELECTIONS AND,No .,16
24,Mr DEAKIN,DISPUTED ELECTIONS AND,In any case a motion dealing with the question was submitted by a private member on a previous occasion.,16
25,Mr MCDONAL D,DISPUTED ELECTIONS AND,"That motion was carried. .The motion now on the paper seeks to. refer the matter to the States, asking them to pass legislation.",16
26,Mr DEAKIN,DISPUTED ELECTIONS AND,"I notice that the motion on the business-paper is as followsThat, in order to give the industrial classes the full benefit of the protective policy adopted by the people of the Commonwealth, this House is of opinion that industrial legislation throughout Australia' should be of a uniform character, and that, in order to secure such uniformity} the State Governments should be asked by the Federal Government to introduce legislation - which would give the Commonwealth Parliament the necessary power, as provided for by the 1 Constitution, to enact such industrial legislation. What the honourable member desires to indicate is that there is another course open, namely, to appeal direct to the people for an amendment of the .Constitution. Without expressing any opinion on the motion, which I have just read, and without, of course, on the spur of the moment, committing the Government to any course, I am free to say that, personally, the suggested transfer is becoming obviously necessary.",16
27,Mr WH IRVINE,DISPUTED ELECTIONS AND,"I ask Minister, whether, as he has stated his purpose to introduce legislation that will deprive the present Excise Tariff Acts of their retrospective tendency, he will give an assurance that the excise will not be collected until the House has had an opportunity to deal with the question. ' Mr DEAKIN - I did not intend to outline any repeal of anv retrospective provisions; but a means for the consideration of individual cases of hardship under the retrospective provisions. said that there is a general hardship; and, if so, that will require to be dealt with by general provisions. But there may be specific cases of hardshirj in the application of the Act in, country districts, or where there are two sets of wages, as across the borders of States, to which the honourable member for North Sydney has called attention.",17
28,Mr WH IRVINE,DISPUTED ELECTIONS AND,"If the Government goes on with the Excise Procedure Bill , it will necessarily raise, by some of the provisions, the whole question of how far the original Acts ought to be retrospective.",17
29,Mr DEAKIN,DISPUTED ELECTIONS AND,It can raise that question. Mr W. H. IRVINE - It must.,17
30,Mr DEAKIN,DISPUTED ELECTIONS AND,"I hope that it will not be thought necessary to raise the question, in view of the fact that we are well advanced into November, and that it will be impossible to deal with the subject without the information which we ,are now acquiring with the utmost' rapidity possible, from all over Australia. Having obtained that information, we shall be able to propose to the House means of meeting cases of hardship which exist, whether they be close at hand or in remote districts.",17
31,Mr REID,DISPUTED ELECTIONS AND,"In view of the situation which has been indicated by the Prime Minister-that he and his colleagues may mercy is to be exercised. ' have to submit some measure dealing with possible hardships, it would, I think, be only fair that those manufacturers of harvesters should in some way or other be made to know that it will be a substantial element, in any possible consideration of their cases, that they should at once conform to the rates which have been decided by the Justice in the case of the Sunshine harvesters. Whatever we may do as to the past, the manufacturers have now a clear indication from the Court of what are considered fair and rear sonable rates, and I think it would be only fair",17
32,Mr SPEAKER,DISPUTED ELECTIONS AND,"^Is the honourable member asking a question ? the Prime Mr Reid - I intend to finish my - remarks in an interrogative form. I-think .it is a matter worthy of the consideration of the Government, or, perhaps, _ I should say, it is a matter worthy of consideration by the Prime Minister, that there should'be some indication that, if the manufacturers do not at once conform to the new standard their position mav, perhaps, be prejudiced.",17
33,Mr DEAKIN,DISPUTED ELECTIONS AND,"The right honourable gentleman has, perhaps, not observed that It may be my colleague, the Minister of Trade and Customs, in whose Department this matter lies-wh o is, unfortunately, absentthis morning owing to domestic bereavement- a few days ago, when receiving.a deputation said, in so many words, that the attitude which would be adopted towards the manufacturers would greatly depend on -' their immediate and frank acceptance of the rates of wages fixed by the Court. I may add that yesterday, and again to; day, I saw the head of the Department; and authorized him to convey to manufacturers, who were not present at the deputation, an exactly similar intimation-that from the date of the publication of the award, the scale of wages therein must be observed.",17
34,Mr WH IRVINE,DISPUTED ELECTIONS AND,"Why not, at the same time, state that the award will not be retrospective in any case.",17
35,Mr DEAKIN,DISPUTED ELECTIONS AND,"At the same time, we intimate that if any manufacturer considers himself aggrieved by the retrospective operation of the scale, he is invited to lav before the Government any reasons which appear to him to justify his request for consideration.",17
36,Mr WH IRVINE,DISPUTED ELECTIONS AND,"The manufacturer is convicted first, and afterwards it is considered whether the prerogative of ;",17
37,Mr REID,DISPUTED ELECTIONS AND,Peopl e who pay duties .do 'not - get their money returned if Parliament abolishes the duties.,18

41,Mr SAMPSON,DISPUTED ELECTIONS AND,"The Excise Tariff Printing Act imposes certain Excise duties on manuwealth, facturers who have not complied with the conditions now laid down by the Concilialater date) ? tion and Arbitration Court. As none of the manufacturers had any standard on the which to base the wages of their men, and as none of them could tell expenditure what was in the mind of Mr Justice ing Higgins, I should like to know whether the Government - would be justified in disSydney criminating as between manufacturers throughout the States.",18
42,Mr DEAKIN,DISPUTED ELECTIONS AND,"I do not think that the Government would be justified in discriminating until it has laid before the House ex- - any proposals it may have to make in - this regard.

46,Mr WEBSTER,DISPUTED ELECTIONS AND,"the Treasurer, 1. Is it a fact that the Government intends to appoint Mr J. B. Cooke as Superintendent of Printing in Melbourne? 2.

To my mind, it vvas foolish for the free-trade section of the .Commission to attempt to frame a Tariff. However, they did so, and the duty WHEAT. recommended in this case being part of a general scheme was to go for nought if that scheme were not adopted. The honourable member therefore, was hayhardly fair in alluding to this as the reports commendation of the. free-trade section of the Commission, without qualifying that far as statement in the way I have - indicated. Most of the goods in this item are either minor articles used in manufactures, or for duty ordinary household purposes* or are used steps by women reduced to the unfortunate posiin tion of having to battle for. their existence.

51,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,And the honoiable member wishes them to still come from countries. Anything to foster foreign industries.,20
52,Mr JOHNSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"I certainly wish to continue to come from those countries, seeing that we get practically none from any other country. The Treasurer will, makes them. perhaps, be surprised to learn that his pet newspaper, the Age, has very strongly nounced' this tax upon sewing machines.",20
53,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"I do not care what the A'ge says, l t does not affect me. . Mr JOHNSON - The honourable member and his followers generally tune their are. political fiddles to the note struck by that newspaper. It was in recognition fact that sewing machines are used chiefly by the poorer classes of the community, are necessary to enable many poor women earn a living, that, in response to a tremendous protest, the New Zealand Government removed the duty of i o per cent.",20
54,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"1I have a record that most of these items under the New .Zealand Tariff are dutiable at 20 per cent, or are free.",20
55,Mr JOHNSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"I have the following statement on the subject: On 23rd August, 1907, the Commissioner of Customs in Wellington (New Zealand), The Hon. J. Millar, struck out of the Pieferentiil Tariff the following :Sewing, Knitting, and Kilting Machines. Parchment Paper for Butter. Typewriters, &c. The preferential duty of 10 per cent, on sewing machines was abolished because sewing machines are almost entirely imported from America and elsewhere, and the imposition of a preferential duty would simply raise the prices to the public without diverting trade in any substantial measure to the British manufacturers. If this duty is intended to encourage the local production of sewing machines, it is just as well to point out that none of the best class are made here. Sewing machines are the subject of patent rights.",20
56,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,They are here.,20
57,Mr JOHNSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,The parts are assembled.,20
58,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,And most of parts are made here.,20
59,Mr JOHNSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"I am afraid the Treasurer knows as little about this subject as . about most others connected with the Tariff. Most of the sewing machines are still protected by patents, and are not made locally.",20
60,Mr WATSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,The patents now in force relate to very few of the parts; they apply those only to some special adjuncts.,20
61,Mr JOHNSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,Will any honourable member say that sewing machines are made them in any quantity in Australia?,20
62,Mr WATSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,No .,20
63,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,i think Mr Beale,20
64,Mr JOHNSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"If the Minister went dethrough Beale's factory he would find that all the parts are not manufactured there, and I believe even. Mr Beale has given up the sewing machine business entirely.",20
65,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,The bulk of them,20
66,Mr JOHNSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,Some of the minor of the parts may have been made here.,20
67,Mr STORRER,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"Does not the honourable and member think it possible for sewing, to machines to be made in Australia?",20
68,Mr JOHNSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"Probably we shall manufacture them when we have a larger population, but not yet. I would call the attention of the Treasurer to the following quotation from evidence given before the Industrial Appeal Court in Victoria in connection with the starch trade dispute. A starch worker gave evidenceI am 36 years of age, employed at Harper's, at 36s. per week. Replying to the question "" How do you live ? "" he said I have a sewing machine on time payment. My wife earns from 8s. to i is . per week with it. ' The children are aged 6 years, 3 years, and 8 months. Another employ^ statesI receive 30s. per week. Am a married man, with one child. My wife makes all the clothes for all of us. She has a sewing machine on time payment, at 2s. 6d. per week. The Age, the great protectionist oracle of the home of protection, in an article published some time ago, denounced this duty. It wrote. How. often in these modern days have we not heard the phrase as applied to some poor woman left suddenly to her own resources: "" Help her with a trifle of money over her immade mediate necessities, furnish her with a sewing machine, and she will be able to get along""; or, "" Help her to get a sewing machine, and she will be well content."" Careful inquiry made in connection with the preparation the of this article goes to prove, by actual extracts from 'the city ledgers of a leading firm of sewing machine importers, that it is the "" working "" and poorer classes who are the principal purchasers of sewing machines, especially on the extended payment system. An analysis of the last thousand town customers in this direc""tion (farmers and country folk generally not appearing in the list) give the following results :Single women, laundresses, dressmakers, tailoresses, nurses, &c. ...

The foregoing clearly proves that f u l ly 90 per cent, of purchasers of sewing machines on the extended payment system are in positions likely, to say the least, to be seriously affected by the ""seven lean years"" through which the colony is now passing . . . ancl yet, in the face of all this, the Government proposes a tax of 10 per cent, on sewing machines, a tax which; with interest and profit superadded, must eventually f all upon the purchaser- a tax never yet levied in any European country; a tax not even now proposed to be placed' on knitting and stitching machines; a tax in the very nature of things unfair, unjust, and which must be forthwith abandoned if the Ministry desires to pose longer as the ""poor man's friend."" This quotation covers all that I need to put before the Committee in regard to the matter, and if it does not convince the Minister that the duty ought to be removed nothing will. I move That the words "" typewriters (including covers),"" "" sewing machines (including cabinets and covers), button-hole punching and sewing machines, darning machines,"" be left out.",20
69,Mr WATSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"South Sydney) [11.15]-Personally , I do not think that it matters much whether we do or do not impose a duty of 10 per cent, on foreign importations of sewing machines, to give a preference to Great Britain; but I am surprised that the honourable member for Lang and the members of the party to which he belongs have not shown more concern about the robbery of sempstresses and other poor persons who need sewing machines, and have to pay extortionate prices for them. When Parliament was considering how best to protect certain local manufacturers - from unfair competition from abroad, tons of documents and protests were produced, and the members of the Opposition were perfervid in their declarations' against the iniquity of the proceeding, because, they alleged, prices were being charged for the locally-made articles quite disproportionate to their cost. But, in this instance, apparently because it is the importers who are making exorbitant charges, not a word is said on the subject.",21
70,Mr JOHNSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"Hav e I ever advocated the charging of exorbitant prices? Per cent. Mr WATSON - The honourable membei has spoken about the hardships which poor ... 37 people will suffer if a duty of 10 per cent is charged on imported foreign sewing machines; but he has not said a word ... 6 about the deliberate robbery of these poor ... 5 people by the combination of importers. ... ' 4 Mr JOHNSON - I do not uphold such ... 4 - practices. ... 3 Mr WATSON - The honourable member ... 2 is not individually responsible for them; ... 1 but, as he expressed so much concern f o i poor people, because they will have to pay a duty of 10 per cent, on foreign sewing machines, he might have said a word or two about the much more important matter to which I am drawing attention.",21
71,Mr JOHNSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"Honourable , members wished me to curtail my remarks.",21
72,Mr WATSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"I did not suggest'that the honourable member should refrain from saying what it was necessary to say in this regard. Sewing machines which are sold for £ 1 2 and £ 1 5 each are invoiced at about £ 2 and £ 2 ios. each, the average invoice cost of sewing machines with theii appurtenances and fixings being less than £ 2 each, so that the purchasers are robbed to the extent of about 500 per cent. The honourable member for Lang is wildly excited by the proposal to charge a duty of io per cent, on the invoice cost of foreign machines, which would come to about 4s. each, but he and other members of the Opposition seem to regard it as of no importance that the importers' make a profit of from jQio to £ 1 2 on each machine.",21
73,Mr JOHNSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,It is not fair for the honourable member to suggest that we. advocate the charging of extortionate prices.,21
74,Mr WATSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,What I said was that the matter appears to be of no importance to the members of the Opposition.,21
75,Mr JOHNSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,We are as anxious as is any other honourable member to prevent extortion.,21
76,Mr WATSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,The honourable member did not protest against it.,21
77,Mr JOHNSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"That was through an oversight, because I desired to curtail my. remarks.",21
78,Mr THOMAS,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"In any case,- what can we do in the matter? I do not see that the charging of 10 per cent, on imported foreign sewing machines will make either them or the imported English machines any cheaper.",21
79,Mr WATSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"To my mind, it does not matter whether the proposed duty is or is not carried. Even if the whole ofit had to be paid by the purchasers of the machines, it would not increase their cost by 4S., which is as nothing compared with the exorbitant profits of the importers.",22
80,Mr JOHNSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"If we impose a duty, the importers will add it to their prices, and charge profit on it as well.",22
81,Mr WATSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"They have already fixed the prices for their machines, especially for those bought on the timepayment system.",22
82,Mr LIDDELL,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,They have fixed the prices at which they can make a fair profit.,22
83,Mr WATSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,I hope that the honourable member will refrain from displaving his ignorance on the subject. The margin uf profit is enormous.,22
84,Mr LIDDELL,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,So is the cost of distribution. This gives work to the people whom the honourable member is supposed to represent.,22
85,Mr WATSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,Does the - honourable member suggest that it is to the advantage of the poor that they should have to pay £10 or .£12 profit on sewing machines!* - Sir WILLIAM LYNE - These machines' should be sold for £5 or £6.,22
86,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,They bought for £6.,22
87,Mr JOHNSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,Yes ; I have bought a machine at that price.,22
88,Mr WATSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,Onl y certain brands are sold at that price.,22
89,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,Goo d brands are sold at that price.,22
90,Mr WATSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,The Singer and Wertheim machines are sold at much higher prices.,22
91,Mr JOHNSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,Beale' s machines are just as dear.,22
92,Mr WATSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,Beal e does not make machines.,22
93,Mr JOHNSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,The Minister has told us that he does.,22
94,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,I have seen them.,22
95,Mr WATSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"Mr Beale found that the manufacture of sewing machines did not pay him, and therefore gave it up. I do not wish to put in a word for. Mr Beale or for any one else; but it seems to me that the prices of sewing machines are out of all proportion to their cost, and I am surprised that honourable members who have made such a noise about the proposed duty have nothing to say about the action of importers in charging so much for their machines.",22
96,Mr JOHNSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,Where machines are sold' on time payment there' must be a margin to provide for losses.,22
97,Mr WATSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,I admit that.,22
98,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"North Sydney) [11.26] - I was rather astonished at thefierceattack of the honourable member for South Sydney on the honourable member for Lang. We are dealing with a proposal' to impose a duty on foreign sewing machines, and the question of selling price did not arise. But may I point out to the honourable member for. South Sydney that, when it had been pointed out by the Opposition that Australian manufacturers had by combination been taking advantage of duties, and would do so still further if rates were increased, he,- and those with him, merely said "" We can. deal with combines.""",22
99,Mr WATSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,We fixed the selling prices of harvesters.,22
100,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"I am referring, not to harvesters, but fo other manufactures protected by high duties. Similarly, I would point out that there is on. the statute-book an Act to prevent what the honourable member for South Sydney has complained of, and therefore it seems to me that the honourable member for Lang can be is not to be blamed for not having referred to the matter. I am not here to support the importers, but, in reply to what the honourable member has said, I would mention that I have myself bought good family sewing machines for £ 6 each. Of course, there may be much more highly-priced machines.",22
101,Mr WATSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,I spoke after having seen copies of invoices.,22
102,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"I . know that the honourable member would not wil-; fully misrepresent the matter. But if prices are as high as he says, why do not Australian manufacturers take advantage of them, and, by importing and assembling here the parts, which they can bring in free of duty, share in the enormous profits. It is not necessary to erect an extensive plant for the manufacture of sewing machines; all that has to be done is to assemble imported parts.",22
103,Mr WATSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"Coul d an Australian manufacturer obtain parts? ' Mr DUGALD THOMSON - Yes ; anyone can get them. The proposed duty is not protective in its incidence, because there is no duty on British importations, and it is admitted that we cannot compete with' them. The-' honourable member - who has-* moved the amendment wishes to prevent the price of imported foreign machines from being increased, and I think that he is right in the action which he has taken.  is an old subject with me. I remember that, when the last Tariff was under discussion, the honourable member for Adelaide gave way on the duty on sewing machines without calling for a division, while the proposal to make stands dutiable was negatived on division. I have been informed that machines which cost £ 1 3 ios. are invoiced f.o.b. at £ 4 17s. 6d. It must be remembered that machines. vary a good deal-some , are very plain, while others have a lot of fancy work about them.",22
104,Mr WATSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"Some are invoiced at as little as 30s. each.  to be reliable. In any case, the public would not get machines more cheaply if we imposed a duty of 10 per cent..on importations from foreign countries'. The effect of the duty would be to increase the prices.",23
105,Mr WATSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"It would not increase them by more than from 2s. to 2s. 6d. each.  come to much more than that on a machine invoiced at £ 4 . It must be remembered that the parts of machines can be imported free of duty. I ask the Treasurer whether sewing machines are a fair subject for taxation? Hundreds of other tools of trade have already been placed upon the free list and I do not know why the women workers of the Commonwealth should be subjected to a special disability in the shape of a duty of 10 per cent. As a matter of - fact sewing machines comprised one of the items in respect of which the Premier of New Zealand on the representations of the Labour Party .of the Dominion refused to accord preferential treatment to the Mother Country. In almost every village throughout the Commonwealth women are operating these machines as their tools of trade. I trust that the Treasurer will see his way clear to place them upon the free list. When we were discussing the duty upon cream separators yesterday .the honourable gentleman requested the postponement of the item because he practically admitted that there was a consensus of opinion amongst honourable members that these articles should be admitted free. I venture to say that sewing machines are used to a much greater extent in the Commonwealth than are cream separators, and if it is fair to place the latter upon the free list surely the former should be included in the same category - I ask the Treasurer whether he seriously desires to levy this duty of 10 per cent, upon sewing machines ? ' Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume-Trea surer) [11.37] - I do not care very mucli whether sewing machines are made dutiable or not, but I am opposed to their importation from foreign countries when we can obtain them from Great Britain. I find that the importations under this heading - are valued at £ 1 7 9 , 0 0 0 , of which only £ 1 4 , 0 0 0 worth are of British origin. The balance comes chiefly from Germany and the United States.",23
106,Mr THOMAS,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,What quantity do we get from Canada.,23
107,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"Ver y little. There is one article in this item that I wish to eliminate- I refer to "" roll shells "" which I understand are made very largely in the Commonwealth. I shall afterwards propose to add to the free list a long list of machines which were inadvertently omitted by the Department.",23
108,Mr REID,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,It is a very serious matter for the Department to overlook articles of. that character.,23
109,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,Thes e - articles were inadvertently overlooked by the departmental officers.,23
110,Mr REID,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,I do not think that the names of officers ought to be introduced into this debate at all. Ministers should accept the responsibilitv which belongs to them.,23
111,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"I intend to move That the'words "" r o l l shells"" be left out.",23
112,Mr REID,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"East Sydney) [11.41] - I find it most difficult to accept the statement of the Treasurer that an important lot of machines, .which were admitted free under the old Tariff, were inadvertently made dutiable under this Tariff. I cannot accept his statement that, as the result of inadvertence, important machinery like printing machinery,' which, under the old Tariff was admitted free, was taken out of the free list and placed under a dutiable item. I cannot believe that the Department is in such a state. 'Blackfellows would not make a mistake of that kind. It is a monstrous thing. Was it the result of a mistake that a schedule was inserted in this Tariff under which hat and woollen mills were granted a. refund of the duty which they are called upon to pay on their machinery?",23
113,Mr STORRER,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,That provision was contained in the old Tariff.,24
114,Mr REID,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"The old Tariff did not provide that they should first pay the duty and then get it back. I have too high an opinion of the officers of the Customs Department to imagine that they could make an omission of this kind by accident. They must have done what they did by design. We do not expect mistakes of this sort to be made in a Tariff. In reference to sewing machines, I hold in my hand a publication which was issued upon the day that the Tariff was introduced, and which sets out hundreds of the tools of trade of protected industries upon the free list. But amongst these I can find only one connected With the .farming industry- I refer to scythes. That is the only implement of the agricultural industry which has been exempted from duty. I ask honourable members to get a copy of this by-law, and to compare all the tools of trade of industries enjoying a protection of 30 and 40 per cent, which have been put upon the free list with the tools of trade of the agricultural industry which - are being made free. Sewing machines are undoubtedly a tool of trade of the weakest portion of the community. I observe that about fifty different machines used in the bookbinding trade, and about 100 tools and machines used in the paper-finishing, saddlery trades, and so forth, are free; I suppose that, altogether, about 1,000 tools and machines of trade are made free by departmental regulation. I am glad that the Minister intends to accept the amendment which has been proposed.. The high prices which are charged for sewing machines represent a most odious sort of extortion ; but imposing a duty would not mend matters.",24
115,Mr WATSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,The duty would make no difference.,24
116,Mr REID,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"There was a most enterprising manufacturer of sewing machines in Sydney, in the person of Mr Beale^ but he has given up that branch of business. One would have thought, that, if there had been profits such as have been mentioned, he would have continued the industry.",24
117,Mr WATSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"We must remember, however, when considering the high prices of sewing. machines, that much of the profit is absorbed in canvassing and advertising.",24
118,Mr REID,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"That is so; just as in the harvester industry, the two articles being sold under similar conditions. But even after all allowances the difference between the cost of manufacture and the price to the consumer is too great.",24
119,Mr WATSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"Then private enterprise is not always efficient? . Mr Reid - Like everything else human, private enterprise has its imperfections. The honourable member's argument might be used' against the existence of mankind, seeing that none of us are perfect ; but we have to. make' the best of human nature as it is. I do not know much about time-payment systems, except what I have learned in my professional capacity; but my impression is that the people of Australia are about the safest "" marks "" in the world to honour obligations of the kind.",24
120,Mr FAIRBAIRN,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,Fawkner) [11.48]. - Has . the Treasurer really made up his mind to make this item perfectly free?,24
121,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"Yes , with one exception. Mr FAIRBAIRN., - Then we are united in our desire to make sewing machines as cheap as possible.",24
122,Mr WATSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,-Abolish the middle man.,24
123,Mr FAIRBAIRN,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"That is an heroic action which I am afraid is too much for me. The Treasurer, I understand, intends to see that the people of Australia get their sewing machines as cheaply as possible.",24
124,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"I would rather there was a duty, but I do not wish to waste time.",24
125,Mr TUDOR,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"Yarra) [11.50] - The Treasurer has consented to omit roll shells, and I suggest that steel rollers for flour mills should also be omitted. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports has gone into this question; and it was his intention to move an amendment to omit steel rollers in order that they might be made dutiable under manufactures of metals generally. In the absence of the honourable member I wish to move That the words "" steel rollers for flour m ill s "" be left out.",24
126,Mr WILKS,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"Dalley) [11.51] - I am glad that the Treasurer has consented to accept the amendment of the honourable member for Lang, and thus place sewing machines on the. free list. The Treasurer has told us that he desires to put a numi ber of other items on the free list; and, in 'view of that fact, seeing that item 155 has been postponed, I suggest that the item now under consideration should also be postponed. I desire to say a few words on behalf of the engineering industry, considering that so much consideration and protection has been extended to the woollen, hat and other in dustries. Speaking from memory, I should say that the engineering establishments of Australia could produce some, if not the whole, of the items which the Treasurer has intimated his desire to place on the free list - The question of the duty on sewing - Sir WILLIAM LYNE - I cannot find that many of the items are produced in Australia.",24
127,Mr WILKS,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"High protection is given to the wooilen industry and to the hat industry, and yet tliose who benefit from the high duties grudge protection to the local makers of tools and machinery. should say that any one who posed as a protectionist would give the utmost consideration to the iron and engineering industries, which are the basis of all other industries. Yet we find the Treasurer proposing to place on the free list many articles which are made by moulders, brassworkers, blacksmiths, and others. These men arid their families have to pay heavy duties on apparel and other necessaries of life, and yet they are denied any assistance under the Tariff.",25
128,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,This is a good tectionist speech.,25
129,Mr WILKS,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"I have already said that probably I could make a better protection' ist speech than could the Treasurer, and honourable members know that my stated intention was, if the policy of the Commonwealth had to be protection, to see that the industries in my electorate have a share. Under the Tariff the jewellery trade is highly protected, and yet jewellers' lathes are to be admitted free, although such lathes are a finished product of an industry within monwealth. Surely it cannot be pretended that Australia cannot produce rolled shells or steel rollers for flour mills. Sir WILLIAM LYNE . ; - I am proposing to make those articles dutiable.",25
130,Mr WILKS,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"I thought the Treasurer tions ? would not say that steel rollers could not be made in Australia, seeing that only very little time ago he performed the tismal ceremony .on one manufactured New South Wales. I am very strongly tempted to move that this item be postponed. Surely the Treasurer will admit that there is good reason to believe that some of the machines that he proposes to exempt could be made in Australia. The matter is worthy of consideration, and the artisains and mechanics concerned who have to pay a duty of 100 per cent, on hats will certainly be anxious to know what he has done to assist them. The Treasurer ought to be prepared to do for the secondary industries that which he is ready to do for the primary industries.",25
131,Mr WATSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"South Sydney) [12.2]. machines is not now of any importance since the Minister has agreed to place them on the free list; but it seems to me that the general policy of exempting machines known as tools of trade from any duty is being carried by the present Government to what from a protectionist stand-point is I an extraordinary extreme. It will be found that quite a number of machines included in the list referred to by the honourable member for East Sydney are not diffi-. cult to manufacture. They have not been made locally, because no encouragement has been offered to local engineers to produce them. They have been free, and have been so easily obtainable from abroad that no manufacturer in Australia has cared to embark upon the enterprise of making them. Some tools of trade, however, have been made in Australia. If the Treasurer pays.a visit to the Newport Railway Workpro- shops, he will find that a large proportion of the machine tools in use there were made on the premises. In the same way, quite a number of engineering firms in Sydney make their own tools. Whilst I do not think it would be justifiable to impose a high duty upon machines that are not generally made here, I think it is equally unwise to exempt them. In doing so, we give no encouragement to Australian engineering firms ",25
132,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,The list before us the Comdoes not relate to machine tools.,25
133,Mr WATSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,I refer to machine tools as affecting the general policy of exempting these mechanical appliances.,25
134,Mr REID,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,The honourable member has seen the list of exemptions in the regula,25
135,Mr WATSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"I saw it some time ago. a A large proportion of the machines that are baplooked upon as patented are not entitled .into protection under the patent laws. The word "" patented "" still appears upon many of them, but in a number of cases the patent rights have expired. Protection should not be granted to manufacturers abroad unless within a certain time they set up manufactories in Australia.",25
136,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,We have ih operation a patent law of which j . disapprove.,26
137,Mr WATSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"Quite so ; but, holding these views, I do not sympathize with the idea that we should necessarily exempt from duty anything patented abroad. It is all very well for those who believe-hi certain machines, such as those usedMn hat making, being free from duty to refer - specially to them, but we must not overlook 'the fact that these exemptions in the aggregate affect to an enormous extent the possibilities of development in the engineering trade. Machines of the value of hundreds of thousands of pounds are exempt as "" top Is of trade,"" or as not being made in Australia. If we are to have any adequate development of the secondary industries in iron we must impose some duty.",26
138,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,=Does the honourable member suggest a high duty ?,26
139,Mr WATSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,No . I admit that at present many of these tools are not made in Australia; but protectionists cannot overlook the fact that we are unlikely to have any development of the engineering industry if we persist in putting all tools of trade on the free list.,26
140,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,The honourable member suggests an experimental duty?,26
141,Mr WATSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"Practicall y that. A duty of io per cent, or 15 per cent, would probably be sufficient to give a start to the local manufacture of many machines at present on the free list.",26
142,Mr LIDDELL,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,That would be only a revenue duty.,26
143,Mr WATSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"In some cases it would not be sufficient; but in any event it would not be a serious tax upon those who use such machinery. I do not think that protected manufacturers should complain of a desire on our part to give a little assistance to engineers who can manufacture the machinery which they use. For that reason I would urge the Government in regard, not to this item alone, but to the exemption, of machinery generally, to consider; the desirabilitv of imposing a moderate duty. T.o view the matter from another stand-point, I would remind the Committee that we have - imposed a - number of - revenue duties articles which are in daily demand by the general masses of the community. If we» need revenue duties, it is much better to impose them on articles which may be produced in Australia, although they are not being made here at present, than oh actual necessities of the poorest section of the population. From that stand-point alone the Government might fairly well re-consider the position in regard to these exemptions.",26
144,Mr FOWLER,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"Perth) [12.9] - The honourable member for South Sydney has raised a point which undoubtedly ought to be of considerable interest to protectionists., but of which protectionists, as a rule, have fought shy. I was very glad to hear the honourable member endorse what was practically the opinion expressed by the free trade section of the Commission in regard to the exemption of tools of trade. We were struck by the anomalies in relation to these exemptions. We found that whilst tools of trade used in certain industries were on the free list, others were taxed. The anomaly appeared the more extraordinary when we found that almost invariably those industries which derived no advantage from protective duties were taxed in respect of their tools of trade, whilst protected industries obtained - them free. The honourable member for South Sydney has said very forcibly that if the engineering industries of Australia could only secure the making of a proportion of the toolsof trade, which, for the benefit of protected industries, are allowed to come in free, there would be very little complaint of depression amongst them. The quantity of machinery so introduced is enormous. Undoubtedly there is force in the observation that 'whilst, perhaps, a prohibitive duty would entail hardship on those who must neces : sarily obtain their tools of trade from abroad, still a moderate duty could be imposed which would produce revenue, and at the .same time lead to an expansion of production in the engineering trade of Australia, in those directions where any chance of success is probable. Although the free trade section of the Commission, according to the comparative table circulated amongst honourable members, recommended a duty of 10 per cent, on this item, its intention undoubtedly was that it should remain, as under the old Tariff, free.",26
145,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,Then why did it upon recommend a duty of 10 per cent. ?,26
146,Mr FOWLER,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"We did not. did not interfere with the exemptions under the old Tariff. Possibly we may have been at fault in failing to distinctly indicate that f a c t ; but such was the intention of the free-trade section, and I intend to show that it was by voting if necessary for this item being placed on the free list.",27
147,Mr BATCHELOR,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"Boothby) [12.15]. - The honourable member for South Sydney has anticipated a great deal of what I had intended to say, and ' I shall not repeat his arguments. The iron industry and its associated manufactures come next in importance to the primary industries, and are probably the most helpful that any country could possess. There is a good deal in the suggestion of the honourable member for South Sydney that practically all these tools of trade should bear some duty. There are some machines, such as printing and sewing machines and a few others, so complex that it would be idle to tax them, because their output in Australia would necessarily be very limited. ' Sir WILLIAM LYNE - What a time. I should have if I imposed a general duty 'on the tools of trade-!",27
148,Mr BATCHELOR,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"Ver y many tools of trade which are now on the free list could be made in Australia, and their manufacture here would give far more employment than many of the industries for the encouragement of which the Treasurer has been fighting so hard. Every additional tool of trade made in the Commonwealth means the introduction of special machinery,' and the possibility of still more machinery being produced in the Commonwealth. The introduction of one machine perhaps enables a number of others to be produced here. For what reason have fire engines been placed on the free list? They could be made here as well as most mining engines, and we make locomotives, which are the most complex of all engines.",27
149,Mr MAUGER,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"On three occasions we have tried' to get a sample engine made, calling for tenders and offering a piemium, But without result. - Mr BATCHELOR - No manufacturer would put up machinery for turning out one engine, and under free-trade conditions.",27
150,Mr MAUGER,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,There aretoo f e w fire engines required in Australia to make it profitable to manufacture them here.,27
151,Mr THOMAS,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,I am surprisedthat the Postmaster-General would allow a fire to be put out with any but an Australian-made engine. We Mr FOWLER - We will remind him of his argument when considering the duties on mining machinery.,27
152,Mr BATCHELOR,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"Most mining engines are as difficult to make as are'fire engines, and the sale for them is not much greater. I should like to see a moderate duty imposed on fire engines, to encourage their manufacture here. There may be parts which we cannot profitably make but I think that most of the parts could be made here. I urge the Government to take fire engines out of the free list. ' Mr Frazer (Kalgoorlie) [12.18] - I am in the main in agreement with the general policy in regard to tools of trade adopted by previous Governments and f o llowed by this one. No doubt the Australian people wish to endeavour to produce as much as possible of their. own requirements, and I think it a good thing to give reasonable protection to local manufacture. But if we penalize the importation of machine tools necessary for manufacture of fine old one kind or another, we shall be hampering instead of encouraging local production"". Many machine tools are turned out by firms which, have specialized their production, and have the world for their market.",27
153,Mr MCDOUGALL,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"Le t them come here and manufacture. - Mr Frazer - For certain lines the Australian market is so small that it would not pay them to do so. We could manufacture battleships or any other propositions if we were prepared to pay sufficiently for them; but' it is wiser to centre our efforts on the production of what we can make economically, and to give our manufacturers an opportunity to take advantage of the skill and specialization of manufacturers abroad. As our plants extend we shall extend our manufacture, even of special tools; and patent rights will expire. But it would be bad policy to penalize now the importation of tools of trade whose manufacture is protected by patent rights and carried out by specialized processes. There are many articles in the list of the Treasurer which could not be made without a special plant, and for which the demand is too small to make their manufacture in Australia profitable. I intend not to vote for revenue duties, and I shall Oppose duties which, while giving a little protection, are really, revenue-producing in their incidence. But - I am willing to give reasonable protection to the encouragement and assistance of manufacture, though without hampering our manufacturers or primary producers by imposing duties on tools of trade and other necessaries of the mining and agricultural industries which cannot profitably be made here. The Minister has consented to place sewing machines, typewriters, and other similar machines on the free list, because there is no reasonable expectation that they will be made here in the near future.",27
154,Mr MATHEWS,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,They would be made here now had a duty been imposed thirty years ago.,28
155,Mr FRAZER,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"It is easy to make an assertion of. that kind, but, as men of affairs, we must be guided by experience in determining what is possible. In my juvenile days I started out to make a steam engine, but I am satisfied that, had I completed it, it would not have been suitable for driving some of the plants which are used by our great primary industries. I am in thorough agreement with the proposals of the Government generally; but I believe in exempting tools of trade and other machinery which cannot be made here, set out in this and in subsequent items.  sire to point out that although importations from Great Britain are free, the effect of a duty of 10 per cent, on foreign importations of patent porcelain'and steel rolls for flour mills will be to tax one of the large manufacturing industries of Australia, because the tempering and other processes necessary for the manufacture of these rollers have been perfected and patented by continental manufacturers,- and they are not made in the United Kingdom. letter which I have received from the Otto C. Schumacher M ill Furnishing Worksthe only manufacturers of flour-milling machinery. machinery in Victoria-it is pointed out thatThese steel rolls are the principal parts of roller mills, and' are at present not manufactured in Australia, and but very few indeed in England, and these, by the way, are inferior to other makes. When the Bounties Bill was before us we were supplied with a report in which attention was drawn to the great value of the flour-milling industry, an industry of such value to the country that it was stated that there was a desire to recommend a bounty for the production of flour for human consumption and offals for the use of agriculturists and dairymen. We recognise the advantage of manufacturing all that we can, and I am prepared to give reasonable protection for the assistance of manufacturers. But we shall depart from the.true principles of protection if we levy taxation on articles which cannot be manufactured here. The Schumacher Company advocate a duty of 25 per.cent, on steel rolls; but it seems to me that they do so on purely selfish grounds. They urge that if the duty upon this article be retained at 10 per cent., and if the frames of the machines are subject to a 25 per cent. rate, the machines will be imported in parts, and the parts will be assembled here. That will provide a certain amount of employment, no doubt.",28
156,Mr MATHEWS,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,It . is only playing with the question.  Schumacher and Company turn out excellent machinery for flour mills.,28
157,Mr MATHEWS,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"Wit h the exception of the steel rollers.  manufactured locally. Even Messrs. Schumacher and Company do not manufacture them. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports poses as an advocate for a. gentleman who, in his own letter, saysSo far from these rollers being manufactured in Victoria they are only manufactued in England in a very small way, and they are inferior to other makes. Until some evidence is forthcoming of a desire to enter upon their manufacture, we should not penalize other manufacturers.",28
158,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"We want to make the flour mills pay something.  In a question from, a selfish stand-point, because I have a flour mill which is equipped with everything that is necessary in the wav of But if the manufacture of flour ought to be encouraged, it should be. encouraged by admitting free those articles which cannot be manufactured locally. I should like to add that my sympathies are. entirely with the .sempstresses and others who - are required to use sewing machines. As we do not manufacture these articles, it seems to be a very harsh proceeding to levy a duty of 10 per cent, upon them.",28
159,Mr MATHEWS,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"Melbourne Ports>[12.34] - So far, we have not attempted to manufacture porcelain rollers for flour mills, but there is a plant at Port Melbourne for the manufacture of the steel rollers. I admit that the firm in'question? is not making them now. The reason is that its members resemble certairt otlier tectionists wrio, whilst desiring their own industry to be protected, wish to obtain their raw material-whic h Is the finished article of another industry-as cheaply as possible. Surely the mechanical skill required, to produce a steel roller is not beyond Australians. These rollers are not being manufactured to any extent in Great Britain, and the whole of those used in the Commonwealth are imported from Germany.",28
160,Mr WYNNE,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,Do they not come from Buda-Pesth?,29
161,Mr MATHEWS,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"Yes . But, in this connection, I regard Austria and Germany as one country. Of course, we have been told that it is impossible to properly temper the steel in Australia. That is all moonshine. A good deal has been said in reference to subjecting the users of sewing machines to a disability by levying a 10 per cent, rate upon them. Are honourable members aware that if a duty had been placed upon these machines thirty years ago, they would have been selling in Australia today for half their present price? I know perfectly well that in Sydney and Melbourne 'there is a firm which alleges that it manufactures sewing machines. But, as a matter of fact, it merely imports the parts and puts them together here. I admit that it also ""does a certain amount of moulding work. The reason that the price of sewing machines in Australia has not been reduced is that they are not manufactured here.",29
162,Mr STORRER,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,They are.,29
163,Mr MATHEWS,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"They are not. Of each machine alleged to be made within the Commonwealth, not one-fourth of the parts are so .made. A machine which is sold for £ 1 2 ios. upon the time-payment system cannot be purchased for jQio cash. Yet that machine landed hi Australia costs only about £ 3 5s. The position regard to'the price of rollers for flour mills and printing machines is an exactly similar one. If these articles were protected the imported article would be much cheaper - than it is now. I hold that there is nothing remarkable in the process of manufacturing these rollers. Some of them are turned out plain, and others are corrugated, but as a matter of fact the corrugation upon them does not last. What do the Victorian millers do? They send their rollers to be re-corrugated and re-set by a firm in my electorate. Instead of imposing a duty of 10 per cent, upon these articles, the proTreasurer should have subjected them to a 25 per cent, rate under the General Tariff, and to a 15 per cent, duty under the Tariff for the United Kingdom. Experience has shown that wherever a duty has been levied upon an article which has encouraged its local production, the result has always been to reduce the price for the imported article.",29
164,Mr MAHON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"As in the case of sugar, for instance:",29
165,Mr MATHEWS,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"I do not hold a brief for sugar, but I am willing to encourage the employment of white labour, even if by so doing we are required to pay a little more for our sugar.",29
166,Mr MAHON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"The honourable member is prepared to protect black, labour?",29
167,Mr MATHEWS,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"If we wish to. exclude black labour, it is essential that we should impose high duties upon articles in the production of which it would be engaged. What is the use of protecting a whole machine if we allow its parts to be admitted free? Unless we can manufacture the articles specified in this item, it is useless for us to talk about becoming a nation, especially in view of the fact that the iron industry is the most 'stable industry that we can establish. We should be very careful about admitting free of duty parts of machines which can be manufactured locally. Seeing that the manufacture of steel rollers for. flour mills and for printing machinery would absorb such an enormous quantity of iron, I hope that the Treasurer will see his way to transfer this line to another item, under which it will be dutiable at a higher rate than that proposed.",29
168,Sir JOHN QUICK,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"Bendigo) [12.45] I think I can claim to be a fairly strong protectionist, but, at the .same time, in imposing protective duties on tools of trade or parts thereof, a certain amount of discrimination should, in my opinion, be exerin cised. If we accept the advice of the honourable member' for South Sydney, and impose a duty, with a view to some possible speculative effect, we may thereby place a heavy burden on industries already established. The time may come when we can expand the area of tools of trade, on which protective duties are imposed, but, in the meantime, it is a fair proposition to place duties on such tools or parts thereof as can be fairly and reasonably produced or manufactured in Australia.",29
169,Mr WILKS,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,Can steel rollers not fairly and reasonably be produced here?,29

Mr. Schumacher desires a duty merely to suit his own purposes.",30
172,Mr MATHEWS,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"That is not correct. : Sir JOHN QUICK - Mr Schumacher very is the only man who asked for a duty, and I know, as the honourable member for Melto bourne Ports does not know, the case which Mr Schumacher presented to the Tariff Commission.

Seeing, however, that, after a long discussion, we have disposed of' about one-third of the items, it is too late in the day to make any such . change'. The - Tariff has |?een arranged on .general - lines which are well understood; and it comes before us as the result of a Commission appointed inquire into the operation of the previous Tariff on existing industries.. '. But some protectionists seem to have an idea! that we have only to impose a duty to have, like the a stroke from a fairy wand, industries springing up all round us. While I look upon private enterprise as one of the failures .of our social system, I may noint that-no one-engages in. commercial business as a mere matter of philanthropy, especially when it is sought to introduce a new line, which has to come into competition, with the existing supply. Tools of trade are' supplied in . a certain . way already; and it would be a big undertaking to now endeavour to secure the market by. means of a new venture, apalrt altogether guineas. from the question of being able to produce the commodities at a competing price. Firms have their connexions and financial arrangements with wholesale' houses, and sometimes these arrangements are such to place them in the grip of the big manuof facturer or importing firm, as the case be. Under such circumstances, a firm takes Government proposal of preference, be the line that is most profitable. Any with capital to invest does not go round looking for some direction in which he do a good turn to the community, but barks on the enterprise which is likely prove the most remunerative. I support the views expressed by the honourable ber for, Bendigo. Tools of trade have to be replaced, and this cost has been calculated in the imposition the duties. To impose a duty on tools of trade would have much the same result as 'imposing duties on raw materials j and I hope the Treasurer will adhere to the principle of confining his tention to industries .already in existence. If it be desired to impose a protective duty, with a view to encouraging' the starting of an industry, that duty ought not to become proposedoperative until, the industry is started. I have a strong,objection to duties on articles which .'are'not made or are not likely made' profitably in Australia. Until our population is much greater we cannot hope to make Australia self-contained or selfthe supporting.

184,Mr SPENCE,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"Of course, we know that firms and establishments, like the Newport workshops, for example, make their own tools of trade; but that is very different from making .tools for sale by merchants and retailers. I support what has - been said in favour of making sewing machines free. We know that sewing machines .invoiced .here at 50's. are sold at fourteen There is no doubt that the organization of vendors is very complete; and I think it is a cruel system which insists on the breaking up of a second-hand machine, however good it may be, so that as prices may be kept up.

218,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"Hume-Trea surer) [2.48] - I am glad that the honourable member has directed my attention to this matter. It is true that we ought to manufacture any quantity of staples. I move That the word ""staples"" be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" transom catches.""",34
219,Mr MATHEWS,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"Melbourne Ports) [2.49] - Surely our brassworkers ought to receive some encouragement, and as these transom catches can be made in the Commonwealth, I do not see why they should not be subjected to a heavier duty.'",34
220,Mr HUGHES,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"West Sydney) [2.50] I fail to recognise the utility of levying a words duty of 5 per cent, under the General Tariff upon locks. Either they should be admitted free, or a sufficient duty should be imposed upon them to induce persons tp manufacture them, locally. ' Under item 186 barbed wire is dutiable at 36 per cent.' under the General Tariff, and at 20 per cent, under the Tariff of the United Does anybody seriously suggest that there is as much skill required in or' the making of barbed wire as there is in "" - the manufacture of locks? Why, a Chinaman could make barbed wire, whereas the val. manufacture of locks necessitates the emThere is nothing whatever to prevent persons in LYNE ) the Commonwealth from making keys, locks; and escutcheons, and yet it is proposed to levy a duty of only 5 per cent, Surely ihere should be some system ' followed in dealing with this Tariff.. The Treasurer wishes to stimulate native industries, but because nobody has waited upon him,' and told him all about ad the manufacture of locks, he has not Kingbothered to ascertain whether or not they can be made locally.. As a matter of fact, they can be manufactured in the Common",34
221,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,But they aie not with produced here in any quantity.,34
222,Mr HUGHES,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"Their manufacture does not necessitate the erection of exin pensive machinery. Either they should be i l admitted free, or a sufficient duty should be levied upon them to induce their manufacture to be undertaken locally.",34
223,Mr STORRER,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"Bass) [2.52] - I know that loGks are being made in the Commonwealth. Even in Launceston there is a lock manufacturer who supplies locks to the Tasmanian Government. To me it seems strange that the Treasurer should desire to subject locks to a duty of only 5 per cent., seeing that under item 173 brasswork and gun-metal work for general engineering and plumbing has been made dutiable at 25 per cent, under the General Tariff, and at 20 per cent, under the Tariff for the United Kingdom.",34
224,Mr WILKS,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"Dalley) [2.53] - I remember the time when the honourable member for West Sydney could make a very good lock. He could do more than that he could pick one, though he did not do it for burglarious purposes. There are many people in this community who have Sufficient'skill to manufacture locks. Upon this occasion I do not intend to put up a fight for the dear old Mother Country. Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin) [2.54] - Surely the Treasurer will not consent to locks being placed on the free list. Year after year in the United States I heard the same kind of talk indulged in by 'the opponents of progress as we are accustomed to hear in the Commonwealth. It was urged by certain persons in the United States that this article and that article could not be made locally. I recollect the experience of the tin-plate industry in this connection. It was said that tin plates could not be made in America, but today that industry is one of the greatest in the 'country, simply (belcause Mr MCKijiley gave it the benefit of a heavy protective duty. I wish to move that a duty of 25 per cent, be imposed upon this item.",35
225,The CHAIRMAN,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"The honourable member will - not be in order in doing that. Mr KING O'MALLEY - It is about time that we departed from the ridiculous practice' which permits only of a Minister moving for an increase of duty. Every honourable member ought to possess the same right in that respect as do Ministers. But, seeing that I cannot move for an increase of duty, I ask the Treasurer to consent to the postponement of the item, in order that honourable members may be afforded time to consider it Amendment agreed to.

227,Mr ARCHER,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,What is the object of the amendment ?,35
228,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"I expect that if the amendment be agreed to slugs wili then fall under another item, and be subjected to a higher duty. My proposal will have the effect of bringing the item into harmony with what we have done in regard to type.",35
229,Mr MAHON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"Coolgardie) [2.58] - I do not see any reason whatever for the amendment. A slug is simply a piece of lead which is thicker than the ordinary lead which is placed between the metal types. It must be a much more difficult matter to make' leads of varying thicknesses than it is to make slugs, and it is easy enough to make the former. It is quite absurd to omit slugs from this item ",35
230,Mr HUME COOK,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,But slugs will then be dealt with in connection with printers' type.,35
231,Mr MAHON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,This is the item in which slugs should be included.,35

It seems to me that the Treasurer ought to do something to encourage the making of tin plates in Australia.",36
247,Mr BATCHELOR,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"The word in the item should be ""plate,"" and not ""plates.""",36
248,Mr KING OMALLEY,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"I am taking LYNE ) the item as it appears; and I suggest a postponement, there being too much at stake for us to deal with it hurriedly. I remember how the great tin industry in the United States was established under the MCKinley Tariff.",36
249,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"Hume-Trea surer) [3.11] - In reply to the honourable member for Boothby, I may say that the words in the item are those used by the Department to describe ti n plate. TMs means' the plate from which the plates are made after it is imported, so that there is no interference with the industry.",36
250,Mr KING OMALLEY,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,But these are is articles which ought to be made in Australia.,36
251,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,North Sydney) [3.T2] - Do I understand that this means ordinary tin - plate?,36
252,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,I am informed by the departmental officers that this is the plate out of which the plates are made.,36
253,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"That be, or, if so, it should not be deas "" t in plates,"" because tin plates of are a well-known article of commerce. These plates are brought in as plates tinned, and if a duty be imposed the packing industry in Australia will be heavilytaxed. I am sure that tinned plates are so meant, because no iron plates are brought in here for tinning. If it does not mean a tin plates, then tin plates must be under a heavy duty in another part of the Tariff.",36
254,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"I can only say that I am assured by the departmental officers that this is the iron tinned over out of which the plates are made, and that the item shows the true trade description.",36
255,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"It .is tinnediron which is imported in sheets, packed in boxes of 1 cwt. each. I understood the Minister to say that these were iron plates brought into be tinned.",36
256,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,- I said that this was tinned plate out of which the tin. plates are made.,37
257,Mr MALONEY,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"Melbourne) [3.14]-The honourable member for Darwin desires to see the tin-plate industry encouraged here, in view of the fact that enormous - quantities of tin are produced in Australia. These are really iron plates covered with strong surface of t in ; and it is with to encourage the industry that the honourable member for Darwin suggests a ipostponewas ment of the item, so that fuller information may be obtained. I remember very how the MCKinley Tariff so built up this industry in America that the imports from England were absolutely destroyed.",37
258,Mr WILKS,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"Dalley) [3.15] - The honourable member for Melbourne is a little wrong in his facts. Under the MCKinley Tariff an effort was made to establish tin-plate industry in the United States, Titus Salt, the world-famed manufacturer of Wales, got into the American market spite of the Tariff, and today Wales plies the bulk of the tin plate there When we find that the manufacturers in highly protected country like the United States cannot compete with the Welsh makers, how can we expect the Australian manufacturers to compete? Any duty posed will simply be a tax on those who use the plate.",37
259,Mr FOSTER,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"New England) [3.16] This item is so important that I agree with the honourable member for Darwin in his - suggestion for a postponement. In the tin industry here the primary workers suffer a severe injustice, getting"" little more half the value of the product. The dipping, at least, ought to be done tralia, and some effort made to regulate .prices in a proper way. At the present time the workers are absolutely at the mercy of agents. We have been told that the American manufacturers failed; but, i that must have been on account of a trade secret, or some other special reason",37
260,Mr KING OMALLEY,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,The r e has no failure in America.,37
261,Mr MALONEY,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,The honourable member for Darwin is quite right; I was in Engsurer land at the time the trouble occurred.,37
262,Mr FOSTER,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"I fail to see why,.havindustry, ing regard to our abundant deposits of tin, we should not make a success of the manuB facture of tin plates.",37
263,Mr HARPER,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"Mernda.) [3.17] - Hon orable members should realise that the plate, to which this item relates, 5 (7fem221). 6117 absolute necessity to many of our local industries. Preserves, butter, and various other commodities, are packed in vessels made of tin, the plate which is imported for this purpose being known on the market as the "" LC . Coke"" arid ""Charcoal"" tin. I certainly should like to see the industry established in Australia, but we cannot lose a sight of the fact that the cost of the necesa viewsary plant would be very great. The value of our imports of plain tin plate last vear £ 2 5 8 , 0 0 0, and probably a properly equipped tin-plate mill would involve aii well expenditure of about £250,000.",37
264,Mr MALONEY,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,The plant for galvanizing iron did not cost anything like that amount.,37
265,Mr HARPER,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"But that is a very different industry. The proposal to impose a duty of even 5 per cent, on foreign imthe ports is to my mind a mistake, since it is but practically impossible at the present time to establish the industry here,, the scope for in it not being wide enough. My honourable supfriend was mistaken when he said that the used. United States of America had failed to a establish the industry. They unquestionably established it, and did so by means of a duty. The difference between their position and ours, however, is that they had a immarket of 60,000,000 of people to work upon, whilst we have a population of only 4,000,000. We might well agree fo the item as it stands, and possibly, when our population has increased by a few millions, we shall have tin-plate mills in Australia.",37
266,Mr KING OMALLEY,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"Darwin) [3.19]. - The honourable member for Dalley was than labouring under a multiplicity of delusions tin when he said that the tin-plate industry in Ausin the United States of America was a failure. What happened was that the Welsh tin manufacturers for the time being lost their market as the result of the establishment of the industry in the States, and f so, many of them proceeded to America and set up business thei'e. The United States of - America is now able to supply itself with been all the tin plate that it requires.",37
267,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"Not all. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The Treaought to agree to the postponement of this item, which has a bearing on the iron until we have dealt with the Manufactures Encouragement Bill . If that i ll is designed to give special privileges to a section of the neople at the expense - of the rest of the community, then I am tin opposed to it. I am a protectionist because is an the policy of protection enables the community to build up industries for the benefit of the whole of the people. I do not favour protection for any special industry or special class or corporation, but I believe that a general policy of protection cannot fail to be beneficial. I hope that the item will be postnoned.",37
268,Mr SPENCE,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"Darling) [3.21] - This item has some relation to the iron industry. since sheet iron is the basis of tin plate. If honourable members believe that iron will be imported and tinned out here, I think they are mistaken; there would be a risk of deterioration on the voyage. On the other hand, I have not heard of any proposal on the part of Mr Sandford or any one else interested in the iron industry to enter upon the manufacture of tin plates. I do not think we shall be able to utilize for some years our production of tin, and we must not forget that this material is used in nearly all our industries. Even the farmer requires tin for his stencil plates for branding purposes. I do not think that we should increase the duty. I should not object to the item appearing in division VI.A, so that the duty would come into operation when the industry of making tin plates had been established locally; but I do not think that we can hope for its establishment in the Commonwealth for some time.",38
269,Mr CROUCH,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"Corio) [3.23] - I rise to support the statement made by the honourable member for Darwin. When it was first, proposed under the MCKinley Tariff to establish the tin-plate industry in the United States of America, arguments similar to those just advanced by the honourable member for Mernda were heard all over England and America. It was said that it was a farce to impose a duty on tin plate, and thousands of dollars were offered to the first man who could produce a comparatively small quantity. One of the arguments used by Mr Chamberlain during his Tariff campaign of 1903 was that the tin-plate industry in the United States of America, which was so despised six or seven years before, was actually exporting plate to Wales.",38

272,Mr DEAKI N,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) [3.29] - I lay upon the tableMail Service to EuropeAgreement dated 15th November, 1907, between the Commonwealth of Australia, the Orient Steam Navigation Company Limited, and the Law Guarantee and Trust Society - Limited for the _ conveyance of Australian mails, commencing February, 1910. Agreement dated 15th November, 1907, - between the Commonwealth of Australia, the Orient Steam Navigation Company Limited, and the Law Guarantee and Trust Society Limited, for the interim carriage of Australia'n mails until 31st January, 1910. With the permission of the House, I wish to ta""ke this opportunity to make a short statement with reference to the proposed mail contract between the Commonwealth and the Orient . Steam-ship Company, which has been signed during the last five minutes. Honourable members are aware that the present contract is at the rate of £120,000 a year for the conveyance of mails to Adelaide within a time not exceeding 696 hours, and to that a further £26,000 a year is paid for the extension of the service from Sydneyits terminal point-to Brisbane. We thus have a total payment of ,£146,000 a year for a slow speed service to Brisbane, minus a number of important conditions that have been embodied in the new contract.",38
273,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"Who pays the £ 2 6 , 0 0 0 ?. .. Mr DEAKIN - The State of Queensland, with a deduction of ,£4,800 paid by the Commonwealth for mileage. Having regard to our recent experience with an - extremely promising contract, which was not carried out, under circumstances into which it is not now necessary to enter, the Government has reviewed all the old terms in order to obtain a contract more applicable to the conditions of the Commonwealth, and more in consonance with the desires of the representatives of the States. Instead of agreeing to pay £ 1 4 6 , 0 0 0 for a mere service to Adelaide of 696 hours, with several old boats, and a general Undertaking to provide cool storage space, we have made a more elaborate contract for an entirely new service, a copy of which I shall lay on the table, briefly summarizing its principal terms. The.proposed contract is for a term of ten years, commencing in February, J910. A subsidy of £ 1 7 0 , 0 0 0 is to be paid for a complete Australian service, making Brisbane the final port of call. The route to be followed by the mail steamers is to be from an approved port in the United Kingdom, connecting at Brindisi - probably, passing through the Suez Canal, and calling at Colombo, Fremantle, Adelaide, Melbourne, and Sydney, to Brisbane, returning on the same track, subject to a condi' tion in regard to Hobart, to which I shall, presently allude. The time of journey from Brindisi to Adelaide is to be reduced to 638 hours, orfifty-eight hours less than is required by the present contract, and from Adelaide to Brindisi to 650 hours, both periods being the same as are provided for in the latest contract between the British Government and the Peninsular and Oriental Company. Consequently, under the proposed contract we shall obtain what Australia has never enjoyed hitherto-^a much quicker service and uniform weekly arrivals of the mail boats, so as to permit of letters being answered, even from Brisbane, by return post. The proposed subsidy will be a little less than is now paid, taking £ 2 5 , 0 0 0 for an increase of speed, and £ 2 6 , 0 0 0 for the service to Brisbane; besides which we obtain all the further advantages which I am about to enumerate.",38
274,Mr WATSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"The proposed new sidy is nearly double what the company getting a short while ago, not allowing calling at Brisbane.",39
275,Mr DEAKIN,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"It must be remembered that, under the proposed contract,' the vice will be carried on by a much better class of boats, at a higher rate of speed, and under many other advantageous conditions. The new service is to be commenced with 1 five new steamers, each of not less than 11,000 tons register, possessing ,a> speed of at least 17 knots an hour, and built to plans and specifications approved by the Government. In each steamer not less than 2,000 tons of insulated space must be provided, allowing 40 cubic feet to the ton. At the present time, the insulated space on the Orient mail steamers is in"" some cases less than 1,000 tons, and-if my memory serves' me aright-in no instance exceeds 1,700 tons. An additional new steamer, equal in every respect to those just mentioned, is to be provided, and employed within .eighteen months of the commencement of the contract, and another within, six years.",39
276,Mr WATSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"Some ofi the old boats are to be run for six months after the commencement of the contract, I understand.",39
277,Mr DEAKIN,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"Yes ; the Orontes and, for a short' time, 'the Omrah, with the Ophir as a standby.",39
278,Mr WATSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"Will the company be paid the full subsidy while the old boats, are running?",39
279,Mr DEAKIN,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,Yes .,39
280,Mr FISHER,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,The old boats will have to run to time.,39
281,Mr DEAKIN,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"Yes ; all the steamers, mentioned are able to do so. The refrigerating appliances are to be in accordance with the most modern patents, and six of the steamers must call at Hobart in the period between February and May of each year, subject to exemp-. tions which the. Postmaster-General may allow. White labour is to be employed exclusively, and no discrimination is ito be made between unionists and non-unionists. There is the usual provision for repurchase by the Government, and no steamship used for the service is to be chartered or sold without the consent of the Postmaster-General. In the event of any competing line of mail ships establishing an improved and accelerated service vid the Suez Canal, the contractors shall, if so required at any time after the fift h year of the contract, provide a service equal to subsuch improved service. Any additional was subsidv and extended period of service are for to be determined by mutual agreement, or settled by arbitration. Therefore, if unforeseen improvemepts, enabling, the rapidity of transit to be greatly increased, occur serwithin the next five or six years we shall1 not be tied down to a slower service. All the steam-ships used under the contract, except any that may be temporarily employed, are to be fitted with a wireless telegraph apparatus when a shore station has been established in Australia. The plans and specifications of the new ships are to be submitted for approval within three months of the - ratification of rthe contract by Parliament, and the building of them is to be commenced within .three months of the approval of the plans and specifications, and to proceed with all reasonable despatch. The contractors have, in accordance with the conditions of tender, made a deposit of £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 , and will, in substitution for that already given, enter into a bond for £ 5 0 , 0 0 0 , with approved securities, to be increased to ,£100,000 if sufficient progress is not made with the building of the steam-ships. It will be seen that the experience of the last contract has not been lost sight of.",39
282,Mr REID,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,That will be known only when we see how the contract is drawn.,40
283,Mr DEAKIN,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"F r o m the commencement of the contract these new conditions are to be observed-The maximum rate for butter is fixed at Jd. per box, and for f r u it 60s. per ton of 40 cubic feet; a temperature of 15 degrees' is to be maintained in butter chambers throughout the voyage, unless any higher temperature is approved by the Postmaster General ; separate chambers are to be provided when butter is carried, and no fruit , cheese, or other odorous articles are to be carried in the same chamber as the butter;_ self-recording thermometers of approved pattern are to be supplied, and, as far as possible, maintained in good working condition, throughout the voyage; under normal conditions no differentiation is to be made in the rates of freight from the United Kingdom to the ports of the Commonwealth, or as between the ports of the Commonwealth in respect to the rates of freight charged for butter or frui t to the United Kingdom. All the States are put on an equality so far as high charges are concerned.",40
284,Mr HEDGES,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,Will the company be bound to carry from each port?,40
285,Mr DEAKIN,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"How is such a condition possible of enforcement? The contractors must withdraw from any combine or commercial trust that may be determined by the Courts to be illegal under the present or future legislation of the Commonwealth, and, in default, the contract may be cancelled.",40
286,Mr WATSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"I do not know that that means much. Our Courts cannot interfere with combinations entered into abroad. I do not think that that condition would prevent the compainy from belonging to the existing English shipping ring. - Mr DEAKIN - It might do so if the arrangement could be shown to be detrimental to the public of Australia. Speaking without having referred to the Act, I think it possible to prevent many arrangements seriously detrimental to the interest of the Commonwealth.' Under a separate agreement the contractors undertake to continue the existing mail service on the present terms and conditions from February, 1908 - whe n the current contract expires-until the commencement of the proposed contract, in February, 1910, unless an earlier date be agreed upon. They also agree to the insertion in this interim contract of the provision with respect to combines or commer-. cial trusts. The mail ships emploved under the principal contract are to fly the flag of the Commonwealth, provided that the Imperial Government consent-w e hope that there will be no difficulty about that - and the contractor's position is not prejudiced thereby.",40
287,Mr WILKS,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,Will the vessels be docked in Australia? That is of more importance.,40
288,Mr FOWLER,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,We need a better flag than that which is now known as the Commonwealth flag.,40
289,Mr DEAKIN,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"The criticism of the honourable member for South Sydney with reference to the applicability of Commonwealth law, has been met, so far as present conditions aire concerned, in a manner which I shall detail. In this matter, the Commonwealth Government, though deeply interested, is not so directly concerned as the States Governments, which have made various arrangements in regard to *he export of butter. Nearly all our delay during the last week or two has been due to our desire to defer concluding the contract until the very active, vigilant, and capable Minister of Agriculture for Victoria could have an opportunity to place before the companies concerned the complaints which are being made throughout' Australia. A combination of shipping companies, has led to the imposition, by what' are known as "" the five lines,"" of penal charges on goods shipped by exporters who have not agreed to send all their butter by these lines. This has followed a reduction of the butter rate to is. iod. per box for butter shipped by a rival combination known as the "" three lines."" How. ever we may view these arrangements, they are regarded as honourably binding upon the parties to them, and it has been necessary to allow the representatives of the Orient Company time to communicate with the five lines, with a view to securing their freedom. When they had done this, the larger question was raised whether it would not be possible, not merely to provide for the Orient Company forsaking the agreement, biit to induce the companies associated with it to reconsider the action they had taken under some'pressure, and thus relieve the shippers of perishable produce of certain disabilities. That has been the cause of the delay, which I have been unable to explain to the House for obvious reasons. Negotiations had to lae conducted, not only with a great number of steam-ship companies upon this side of the world, but also with their principals upon the other side of the globe. Considering the difficulties by which the whole question was surrounded, I have to freely admit that it has been owing to the unremitting attention and energy which Mr Swinburne has devoted to it that we have been enabled to arrive at what I believe will be a satisfactory conclusion. At all events, so far as the Orient Steam Navigation Company is concerned, they now propose an agreement which the people of Australia will recognise as a fair one, and they have been able to induce their companions in this agreement to take a similar course. The proposal made is to come into force at once, before the principal contract to which I have referred has any effect whatever, except, of course, so far as regards the building of ships and the carrying out of necessary preliminaries. At present, or up till lately, the freight charged for the carriage bf butter by the mail steamers was 2S. 6d., and by the great carriers, which were not mail steamers, 2s. 3d., per box.",40
290,Mr REID,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,That is under Jd. per lb.,41
291,Mr DEAKIN,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,On the mail steamers it is slightly over. One half-penny per lb. would amount to 2s. 46. per box.,41
292,Mr WATSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,Are there not 56 lbs. in a box?,41
293,Mr DEATCIN,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"While I am not sure of the details . in this connection, I am sure of the fact that 2s. 6d. per box represents slightlv more than i d . per lb. [217] One halfpenny per lb. would amount to 2s. 4d - a box as near as possible. The charge which has always been made by the mail steamers for the carriage of butter is 2s. 6d. per box. Had the rate been £d. per lb., the charge would have been 2s. 4d. per box. The proposed new arrangement is that, instead of the rate by mail steamers being 2s. 6d. per box, it will be a rate not exceeding 2s. 6d. per box, which, in the anticipation of several experts, is likely to mean 2s. 4d. per 'box, or Jd. per lb. As to the other lines, instead of the charge being 2s. 3d. per box as it was, it is proposed that it shall be 2s. per box by all the five lines; that is, by way of the regular lines of steamers.",41
294,Mr REID,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,Then they have come into the arrangement?,41
295,Mr DEAKIN,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"The five lines are willing to come into it. These rates are to operate at any port of the Commonwealth. It is worth noting-to prevent any misconception-that the conditions for which we have been fighting, while we have been assisted so materially by Mr Swinburne, are not for the benefit of one State, but apply to all the States, witliout any distinction whatever. The condition upon which these concessions are proposed, so far as the five lines are concerned, is that the shippers shall not use any line charging less than 2s. per box. Now, the present cutting rate charged by the three lines to which I have referred is is. iod. per box, and it is intended to propose to them that they shall come into this agreement, and thus be placed absolutely on the same footing as the five lines. Then, instead of there being three lines and five lines charging different rates, there will be eight regular lines of steamers charging the same price from all ports of the Commonwealth. The producer will thus be able to send forward his butter without regard to the ship that is in port, knowing precisely the rate that he will be charged for its carriage and the facilities that he will enjoy. If this arrangement can be carried out-and I am assured by experts that it is most reasonable, that the price charged is low, and that the conditions offered to trade by this means are better than have ever been enjoyed in Australia - it promises to give a very great impetus indeed to the whole of the Industries dependent upon cool storage. If the three lines should persist in standing by themselves, and should rely upon the difference of 2d. per box to tout for custom, of course a different state of things may prevail. But to us the imporfinal tant point is .that, so far as the Orient Steam Navigation Company is concerned, this fair and reasonable offer-whic h been approved by all the experts to whom it has been submitted-is made by them. They are anxious-and they have proved their bona fides-to withdraw from chargit ing a penal rate, and to substitute instead a far superior arrangement from every tralian point of view.",41
296,Mr WATSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,Is the abolition of the penal rate contingent upon the acceptance of 2s. per box by the Federal-Houldermanner Shire line?,42
297,Mr DEAKIN,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"At presait it is. also informed that not only is it anticipated that the three lines will agree to what proposed, but that even if they do not, modification of this agreement may be brought into play by the five lines.",42
298,Mr MCWILLIAMS,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"Does the arrangeI ment apply to fruit , too?",42
299,Mr DEAKIN,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"The prices which I have named apply to butter. So far as am aware, no difficulty has arisen in regard to the export of f r u it .",42
300,Colonel FOXTON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"What will sidy up to 1910? "" Mr DEAKIN - It will remain at its present figure.",42
301,Colonel FOXTON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"And a subsidy of £ 2 6 , 0 0 0 annually will continue to be paid by Queensland?",42
302,Mr DEAKIN,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"The £ > i , o o o balance will continue to be paid by Queensland. T understand that a preliminary agreement in that connection has already been settled as between the Orient Steam Navigation Company and the Queensland Government. In the interim we pay no increased' subsidy. Indeed, we shall not pay it until we get improved refrigerating space, and a number of other improvements upon which I need not dwell, in place of the mere postal service of the past and present.",42
303,Mr MCWILLIAMS,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,Will the for the carriage of frui t be the same as that charged for the carriage of butter?,42
304,Mr DEAKIN,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"The question of the freight upon frui t has not arisen, because, as I understand, the present contest between the five lines ancl the three lines relates to butter. Moreover, our arrangement with regard to f r u it will begin only with the commencement of the new contract. If the statement which I have made has not been quite as clear and comprehensive as I desired it to be, honourable members will realise that it is because' the papers relating to this matter have only been placed in my hands within the last few moments. I do not think, howhas ever, that anything material has been omitted. When honourable members look at the new contract, which I now lay upon the table of the House, they will find that has been thoroughly revised in every part, and that it has been brought up to date in Austhe light of our past experience. We are under a great obligation to the Secretary of. the Postmaster-General, Mr Scott, and  in which they have devoted themselves to the entire reconsideration of every I am line of this agreement, which I can therefore lay upon the table with the utis most confidence. It has been subjected to a the strictest scrutiny from the point of view of the Post Office, from the freight point of view, and also by the Crown Solicitor. desire to give notice that on Wednesday next Afr. SPEAKER - I presume that the I motion with which the Prime Minister desires to conclude is to the effect that the paper which he has laid upon the table of be the subthe House be printed?",42
305,Mr DEAKIN,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"I will embody the motion of which I desire to give notice in my statement. It readsThat the House of Representatives approves the agreement made and entered into the 15th day of November, 1907, between His Majesty's Postmaster-General in and for the Commonwealth of Australia of the first part, Orient Steam Navigation Co. L t d . of the second part, and the Law Guarantee and Trust Society Ltd. of the third part for the carriage of mails and services to be performed as therein provided, a copy of which agreement has been laid upon the table of the House of Representatives. Afterwards, perhaps, with the permission of the House, I may be allowed to put this motion on the notice-paper. In the meantime, I propose to take the proper ccfurse, which is to move that the papers freight be printed, and in the same resolution- I see no objection, unless you do, Mr. Speaker-to move that the interim agree- ment in regard to the coming two years be also placed on the table and printed, so that honourable members may have the benefit of its circulation at once, and be qualified to enter into the discussion of the question on Wednesday next. I hope that it will be plain that the - time spent in drafting the contract has not been wasted, but that, considering the exceptional terms we have been able to obtain, even in regard to matters outside the mails, any delay has been well warranted. I - trust that honourable members will realise that this is not merely a contract of the old post-office pattern.",42
306,Mr WATSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,Were there any other tenderers? ,43
307,Mr DEAKIN,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"Yes ; we took into account the three lowest tenders. On examination one appeared to be of a speculative character, and, therefore, we concentrated our attention on the other two. The second tender, of an advantageous character, was from a company which preferred to take only one-half ot the service ; that is to say, they desired to take a monthly service to Australia, leaving some other company to share the work, so that we should have had three mail lines instead of two. That, at first sight, presented considerable attractions; but on * inquiry it seemed very doubtful, from what we could learn, whether we could obtain from two lines the special conditions which are given in the contract now before honourable members. One difficulty was that the principal office of the second company was on the other side of the world. Honourable members will recollect that under the contract we undertake not to mention names except in the case of the lowest tender, though we may give"" particulars of the other tenders.",43
308,Mr WATSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,The offices of the Orient Company are 011 the other side of the world ?,43
309,Mr DEAKIN,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,But the Orient Company have representatives here who can deal with us on the spot. On further examination the most satisfactory tender we could obtain appeared to be that of the Orient Company ; we sought to exhaust ;ill possibilities with them before elsewhere.,43
310,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"It would be . interesting to know the amounts of the other tenders, though I do not ask the Prime Minister to give the figures now.",43
311,Mr DEAKIN,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"Speakin g from memory, the amount of the first tender was £180,000 a year, without any of the special conditions contained in the Orient Company's tender. That offer was afterwards lowered, if I recollect, to .£170,000, still without any special conditions; and only within the last few days there has been an intimation that a less amount might be con[217]- 2 sidered. But under the circumstances, the fullest examination seemed to show that the contract with an old and tried service was the one that promised most advantages; the terms we have obtained are at least as favourable-indeed , so far as we could judge, more favourable-tha n those to be secured from any other tenderer. .",43
312,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,We should like to know the terms of the other contracts.,43
313,Mr WATSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,We ought to know the terms in the other tenders.,43
314,Mr DEAKIN,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"Exactly . The terms of the second tender were those embodied under- in the advertised conditions, and nothing more. ",43
315,Mr REID,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,I understand that the second company desired to undertake only one-half of the service.,43
316,Mr DEAKIN,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"The v put in a strong plea for halving the service. Their tender for the servioe as a whole was subject to the statement that they did not regard that as a satisfactory arrangement, either in our interest or in theirs. They held that the service ought to be by two lines, each undertaking a monthly sendee.",43
317,Mr MCWILLIAMS,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,The result of the joint service to Tasmania ought to be a warning.,43
318,Mr DEAKIN,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"There were many warnings besides that. As honourable members will see, this is much more than a mail contract. It goes far beyond the carriage of mails, and carries its benefits to every capital in the Commonwealth.",43
319,Mr THOMAS,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"Is the Postal Department ""to be expected to pay the whole of the subsidy?",43
320,Mr DEAKIN,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"That is a matter for subsequent allocation. I should say that we looked we are paying at least £20,000 or ,£25,000 a year for the extra non-postal advantages we have gained. ' Mr THOMAS - It would be very unfair to make the Postal Department pay the whole of the subsidy.",43
321,Mr WATSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"It is quite certain that the service to Brisbane has nothing to dr with the Postal Department, however justifiable that service may be from another point of view.",43
322,Mr DEAKIN,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"Unde r this contract we have a great gain by getting a truly Federal service, which touches every principal port during the year-that is, the vessels will call six times at Tasmania, ancl every fortnight at each of the other ports. These new conditions will give, shippers, and the public of Australia generally, a deeper interest in the mail service than they have ever had before. We have been met in the frankest possible manner by the Messrs. Anderson, who were charged with the negotiations. Naturally those gentlemen have studied their own interests, and there were many weeks of keen bargaining before we were able to obtain the conditions now laid before honourable members. Those conditions speak for themselves; but I may say those concessions have been made byMessrs. Anderson, on behalf of their company, in the hope that they will lead to the recognition of the fact that they are en deavouring, as far as possible, to provide a truly Australian service in order to meet Australian conditions, and that they are relying upon the Australian public for support by way of recognising that aim.",43
323,Mr SPEAKER,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"I think the best course would be for the Prime Minister to move that the papers be printed, so as lo afford an opportunity to honourable members to offer any remarks they please. Tf, later on, the Prime Minister desires to give notice of motion out of due time, he may. by permission, do so, but the notice of motion could, of course, be given on Tuesday.",44
324,Mr DEAKIN,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,I move' That the documents be printed.,44
325,Mr REID,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"East Sydney) [4.0] - I have listened with deep interest to the statement the Prime Minister has made; and the contract submitted is evidently the result of very arduous negotiations. There was, however, in the midst of the honourable gentleman's eloquent exposition a melancholy sort of echo. The honourable member laid a much more dazzling prospect before us two years ago.",44
326,Mr STORRER,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,Le t us forget that.,44
327,Mr REID,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"Can we forget it? Only the densest party spirit could lead any one to forget it. The Government have not even got the £ 2 5 , 0 0 0 . Are they going to forget that? One of the most extraordinary announcements was made by the Prime Minister today in reference to the miserable fiasco of the late tender. It is disgraceful to the Federal Government that two vears after this f r i g h t f ul piece of impositionafter this gambling with the people of Australia, as it really was-w e should be told, as we were this morning, that no process has been begun in the Courts of England to recover on the bond, which was sup-* posed to be so drawn up as to be recoverable in the most summary way.",44
328,Mr CROUCH,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,It is nothing like two years ago-it is not twelve months.,44
329,Mr REID,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"I was not quite sure myself, but I was supported by an honourable member in my belief as to that being the period.",44
330,Mr DEAKIN,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,It is nothing like that.,44
331,Mr GROOM,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,It may be ten months ago.,44
332,Mr REID,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"At any rate, it is many months ago, and it is most disgraceful that in the case of a bond which was supposed to be so drawn up that it had only to be put in suit to be enforced, there should have been some mysterious difficulties in the way of action being taken long ago.",44
333,Mr DEAKIN,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,It is just four months since the contract was cancelled.,44
334,Mr REID,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,I am referring to the miserable fiasco months before the cancellation. Was the tender not accepted months before that?,44
335,Mr DEAKIN,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"Yes , but we could not sue when we accepted the tender.",44
336,Mr REID,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"In that I agree, but the tender was accepted, I think, more than ten months ago. One of the advantages of a properly drawn-up bond is that the moment default occurs, it has simplv to be put in suit to be enforced without delay.",44
337,Mr WATSON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,Where was the bond drawn up?,44
338,Mr REID,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,I do not know.,44
339,Mr BAMFORD,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,It would appear that the English lawyer knew a little more than did the Australian lawyer.,44
340,Mr REID,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"I do not know whether honprable members are satisfied to have this £ 2 5 , 0 0 0 suspended between heaven and earth for an indefinite period. I do not think that it is the disposition of honourable members. I admit that a seat on the other side of the House might lead honourable member.? to forget the whole affair; but our duty to the public ought to prevent that. Occasionally, when actions are begun, there are de'as beyond the power of the parties; but what I complain of is that no proceeding has been taken for the re- covery of the £ 2 5 , 0 0 0 . under the bond. Having regard to our very unfortunate experience in connection with the old contract, which very nearly, involved the States in a most miserable ever-to-be-regretted dispute, I am pleased that the Government have been able to conclude a contract with a company of a very different character. Over twenty years ago, I had the pleasure of playing a somewhat influential part in securing for the Orient Steam Navigation Company the prestige of a Royal mail service. In 1883, they entered into the Australian trade in competition with that mammoth concern, the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, and I think that the people of Australia should have a very kindly feeling towards them, having regard to the great battle which they fought against so formidable a rival.",44
341,Mr MALONEY,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,And they fought it with white crews.,45
342,Mr REID,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"They , so cheerfully observed the Australian view of that matter that I look with far more pleasure upon a contract entered into with them than I should have looked upon a contract made with any other company. I feel sure that in all our transactions with them we shall not have any of the miserable troubles that we experienced in connection with the old abortive contract. In view of the fact that the Prime Minister has, in many eloquent speeches, expressed an ardent desire tb encourage the flow of immigration to Australia, I notice with some regret that the honourable member made no mention of any arrangement in relation to that very important subject.",45
343,Mr DEAKIN,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"It is not included in any fixed agreement, but the accommodation provided for what were formerly known as third-class passengers is to be superior to anything that has been previously provided, and the Commonwealth or the States, whichever has the undertaking, are to be granted special rates in respect of the carriage of immigrants from the Mother Country.",45
344,Mr MALONEY,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,There is to be accommodation for third-class passengers?,45
345,Mr DEAKIN,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,Yes ; and it is to be fully equal to the old second-class accommodation.,45
346,Mr REID,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"The term "" special rates "" is a delightfully vague one.",45
347,Mr DEAKIN,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,The rates will depend upon the number coming out.,45
348,Mr THOMAS,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"If we are going to pose one or two more conditions, we might as well run mail steamers of our own.",45
349,Mr REID,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"That will be a matter for the consideration of the House when we are asked to deal with this contract. I listened with the greatest pleasure to the details given by the Prime Minister as to one or two features of the contract. In the first place, I think that the least we could do for Queensland is that which the Government have done in connection with this contract. And so with Tasmania. We might fairly relieve Queensland at once of the extra payment which she has been making. I fail to see why we should wait f o i another two years before, doing so, because, by the terms of this contract, we practically acknowledge that we should have relieved her of this obligation. I shall be very glad to support any movement to relieve the people of Queensland, from the present time until the new contract begins, of the special payment which they are now making to the company. I do not wish at this stage to deal with the questions of rates and freights. There are matters in connection with the contract which require serious attention, but, subject to a fuller consideration of all its details, I wish to say that it affords me the greatest possible pleasure to know that this contract-if it prove a wise and good one-ha s been made with a company on whose promises and undertakings we can fully rely.",45
350,Mr WILKS,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"Dalley) [4.10] - The statement that Queensland is satisfied, Tasmania is satisfied, and the primary producers are"" satisfied with the terms of this contract, sounds very well. The contract provides for something more than a postal service, consideration having been given to certain vested interests. About a fortnight ago I asked the Prime Minister to consider the advisableness of providing in the contract that the vessels of the service should be docked in Australia. . Mr DEAKIN - Hear , hear.",45
351,Mr WILKS,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"It is all very well for the Prime Minister to say ""Hear, hear,"" but whilst I believe that there is an understanding that the vessels of the fleet as far as possible shall be docked in Australia, a provision to that effect has not been inserted in the contract. The mere fact that these vessels will fly the Australian flag is not in itself sufficient to satisfy the people of Australia. Had the postal service alone been considered I should not have been justified in urging that provision should be im- made for the docking of the steamers of the fleet in Australia; but since the contract provides for something more than a postal service-sinc e it covers various vested interests- I have a perfect right to put in a plea for the consideration of other vested interests. The subsidy of £ 1 7 0 , 0 0 0 per annum means that the people of Australia will have to pay nearly £500 per day for this service. About four years, ago, when the Reid-MCLean Administration concluded a contract with the Orient Steam' Navigation Company for a service at rate of £120,000 per annum, it was subhad jected to considerable criticism by many honourable members, as well as by a section of the press. We now have before us a contract under which the annual payments are increased by £50,000, and the fact that the Australian flag is to be flown over lished. the stern of these vessels will not prevent the people from making the arithmetical calculation that an annual payment £170,000 represents 5 percent, on a capithe tal of £3,400,000. I can understand the honourable member for Barrier saying circumstances that if we are to impose or two more conditions we might as well have a fleet of our own. The arrangement is not such an excellent one. as it would first sight appear. Seven or eight vessels of the type for which provision is made could readily be purchased for £3,400,000. Hundreds of thousands of people in Ausevents tralia will derive no benefit from a mail service, and I think that I was quite justified in asking the Prime Minister ranging the contract to do something for the dockers, who are amongst the most ill paid of our workers. I hope that, although there is no such provision in the contract itself, there will be a distinct understandis ing between the Government and the comwhich' pany that, whenever practicable, these steamers will be docked in Australia. From a sentimental point of view I am pleased that the Orient Steam Navigation Company, which is a well-tried one, is the successful tenderer, and in conclusion' would emphaand size the point made by the leader of the Opposition as to the bond. I hope that it will not be so full of loopholes as was prepared by Mr Croker in connection with the recent abortive contract.",45
352,Mr THOMAS,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"Barrier) [4.15] - I the Prime Minister to postpone the furthe ther consideration of this matter until Thursday next, so that honourable members, many of whom leave for Adelaide and Sydney today, and will be unable to the Hansard report of his speech until Tuesday next, may fully inform themselves on the subject. The proposal to hand mail service over to a private company a term of ten years is an exceedingly portant one, and requires very careful sideration. The Prime Minister gave a great deal of information, but he' adr mitted that the papers from which he spoke came into his hands only five minutes before his speech was delivered, and therefore his remarks may not have been as the comprehensive as they would have been he had more time for preparation. ' A good deal of additional information was elicited by questions, and I think that honourable members should have an opportunity of making themselves fully acquainted with all the facts, so far as they are now pubI f we debate the matter on Thursday next, we shall probably be able to come to a decision before the end of of the week, and the Senate can deal with matter at the beginning of the followin the ing week. I hope that the House will one not ratify the agreement, but will take the better and bolder course of deciding to inaugurate a Commonwealth service. I hold at that two years ago the House failed to do its duty in this matter. Those who then advocated the running of a Commonwealth mail service were undoubtedly right, as have clearly shown. The right honspeedy orable member for East Sydney has pointed out what a miserable fiasco the in aradoption of the alternative course was.",46
353,Mr MALONEY,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"Melbourne) [4.18] - I endorse many of the remarks of the leader of the Opposition. I am pleased that it the Orient Steam Navigation Company has made this contract with the Gomail vernment. If the Prime Minister can see his way to postpone the consideration of the matter for a day or two, that course may conduce to a quicker settlement of it ; but, in any case, he can be sure of my vote support. I have watched the operations of the Orient Steam Navigation Company for the last fifteen years; but I did' that not know that it was the leader of the Opposition who helped it to start here. We owe to the Orient Steam Navigation Company, rather than to the Peninsular ask and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, acceleration of transit and other advantages which we now enjoy. The company has employed British men on British ships, and has made a brave fight against read a competitor which has been so unscrupulous that the President of the Board of Trade has said that the time may come our when it will have to - be prosecuted for criminally for its wicked and cruel treatimment of the lascars in its employ. The conOrient Steam Navigation Company, by us employing white seamen, has hurled back the insulting charge made against Britishers by the Peninsular and Oriental Steam gation Company, that they are too drunken to be employed.",46
354,Mr HENRY WILLIS,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,The Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company has not said so.,47
355,Mr MALONEY,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"It has said so peatedly, and acts speak more loudly than words. The Orient Steam Navigation Company has never had the finger of scorn pointed at it for carrying German goods imported to England, and transhipped at subsidy ? London for Australia, for 100 per cent, less than the rates at which it carried tish goods from London to Australia. Therefore I am glad that the Orient Steam Navigation Company is to have the conto go to Brisbane until 191°tract, even if it be for ten years. honourable member for Barrierknows he can always command my vote for the establishment of a Commonwealth mail service. If the Orient Steam Navigation Company flies the Australian flag, that may be the thin end of the wedge, and we may ultimately be able to start a fortbeing nightly service with boats of our own, to used as cruisers in time of war, and in of peace carrying mails as far as Ceylon. I think that a fortnightly service would sufficient for quick despatch, in addition communication with Europe by way of the Cape; but if more vessels are needed, I will cease in the year named. am sure that the shipping companies will supply them. I am very pleased with the contract, as I have gathered its terms from the eloquent lips of the Prime Minister. of £26,000 a year. It is the fairest and best ever entered by Australia. By requiring a bond of £100,000 we shall prevent trickery such as we have experienced in the past. Mr. Gladstone, on one occasion, when asked Lord Tollemache if he thought that the shipping companies would assist Germany to land troops in England, said that he believed that they would carry troops Hell - if they could get filthy lucre for doing so. The Orient Steam Navigation Company, however, .is free from reproach.

359,Colonel FOXTON,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"No; under this Briagreement, if the Queensland Government refused to pay, the boats would cease } A The present a subsidy of £120,000 is that beine paid by the Commonwealth Government, and £26,000 by the Queensland Government, a portion of which - between £4.000 and £ s > 9 0 0 1 S refunded by the Commonwealth to Queensland. A total"" subsidy of £146,000 is paid at present for a combined mail be and mercantile service. That sum is very time much less than the proposed subsidy ot £170,000 provided for under the new conbe tract to be paid from and after 1910; but to it is, perhaps, quite as much as should be paid for the less advantageous service which In the meantime, it does seem to me the Commonwealth should forthwith relieve Queensland of the payment of this immense burden That is the only into comment I have to offer upon the proposal now made save in terms of praise. However, that is, after all, a matter which is entirely outside the mail contract, and by which could be arranged between the Commonwealth Government and the Government of Oueensland. Save as to that, I think the Government are. to be heartily congratuto lated upon the contract that has been "" Mr KNOX (Kooyong) [4.27]-- ™? > 1 h at this stage, to say only a word, as 1 tninK a more fitting opportunity to discuss the I - question will be afforded when we come to deal with the motion for the ratiits fication of the agreement. I should for not like the occasion to pass without offering my congratulations to the Governwhat ment upon the accomplishment of a very desirable contract. The people of the Commonwealth, and particularly the trading communitv, who have been very much disbv'the uncertainty which has existed as for some time in connection with this matter, and particularly during the long period occupied by the proceedings connected with the recentfiasco,will be very much gratified at what has taken place. I hope that this agreement with a company to which the people of the Commonwealth already owe so much will be satisfactorily completed. I trust that the amount at present due by the late mail contractors will be obtained without delay, and that that nightmare will be done with and forgotten. I am glad that the Victorian Minister of Agriculture has received the commendation he deserves from the Prime Minister for the work he has done in bringing the various States Governments into line in this matter. On behalf of the commercial institutions, I express the most complete satisfaction at the accomplishment of a contract which, I trust, will be for the permanent good'of the Commonwealth.",47
360,Mr MCDONALD,RELANDI NG OF AUSTRALIAN,"Kennedy) [4.29] I do not intend to go into the merits of the proposed contract at this stage, but I wish to emphasize the protest made by the honourable member for Brisbane against the contract on the ground that it would compel Queensland, for the next two years at all events, to continue the payment of a subsidy of £>6,ooo-less about -£5,000 refunded by the Commonwealth. It appears to me that, as all the other States will benefit under the contract in being able at once to arrange for the export of perishamended ab e produce it is hardly fair that Queensland should be left out, even for the two years referred to. I do not intend to sav any more on the subject now. It is well known that I favour the Commonwealth being running its own line of steamers. When we take into consideration the elaborate unimportant amendments. statement made by the Prime Minister tomay, ""ay and the varied conditions he has sought to bring about, it is not unreasonable o say that he had only to go a little ther to decide upon running a line of monwealth steamers, which, I am satisfied, would be found more satisfactory in the long run.
