2,Mr MAKIST,FLOUR EXPORTED TO SOUTH,"It is etated in the carried South African newspapers, that the sendGermans, ing of unwholesome flbiir to that country from Australia-, recently was due, not and merely , to slipshod methods, hut to [368] downright dishonesty of the exporters. I ask the Acting Prime Minister if inquiry has been made into the facts, and, if not, I ask that it may be made, so that the prestige of Australian, exports may be maintained.",19
3,Sir JOSEPH OOOK,FLOUR EXPORTED TO SOUTH,"The matter is under very serious oonsideration. Inferior flour waB certainly sent to South Africa, but so far this iB one of those oases .in which nobody seems to be to - blame. We are trying to get to the bottom, of it , with a view to doing what the honourable member thinks should be done. I hope he will leave it at that for the moment. COCKATOO ISLAN D DOCKYAKDS.",19
4,Mr WEST,FLOUR EXPORTED TO SOUTH,"Yesterday a deputation of unemployed waited upon the Government of New South Wales to ask it for relief, and stated that the unemployment at Balmain is extreme, but that this .unemployment eould be lessened by . the ' starting of work at the Cockatoo Docks by the Commonwealth Government. Does the Government intend to do anything in that direction?",19
5,Sir JOSEPH COOK,FLOUR EXPORTED TO SOUTH,"I understand that orders have been issued for the. resumption of work at Cockatoo Island as soon as possible. The recommendation contained in the interim. Teport of the Royal Commission was that the Adelaide and another vessel should be completed by the new Board of Control within the terms of their appointment. The. members of the Board are now at the Island, or are due there, and the sooner they can arrange to get men back to work the better I shall be pleased. NA IMMIGRANTS .",19
6,Mr STEWART,DEPARTURE OF BRITISH,"The . following paragraph appears in t h is . morning's Probably never before has such a. large number of third-class passengers, representing BO many nationalities, left Australia as the batch which sailed . by the Orient liner Ormonde from the new pier, Port Melbourne, yesterday afternoon ior London. The steamer 900 steeragepassengers, andot this number 80 were Indians, 41 Jugo Slavs, 10 19 Russians,' 1 Dalmatian, 2Danes, 8 Italians, 1 Spaniard, 10 Greeks, 2 Belgians. the. remainder: British .. . A considerable number of the. British passengers the were' youngmen, who had served in th» British Army during the war, and had come to Australia in search of employment, but were returning. I direct special attention to the concludbut ing sentence, which speaks of the number of young Britishers who are returning. The state of affairs disclosed is extrato ordinary, in view of our recent immigramildly. tion legislation, and the campaign that bas been launched to attract immigrants. sponsible? W i ll the Acting Prime Minister cause inquiry to be instituted by the Immigraare tion authorities, with a view to ascersponsible taining the reason for the exodus of young Australia. men of whose services the country is much in need?",19
7,Sir JOSEPH OOOK,DEPARTURE OF BRITISH,"I am glad that the honourable member has asked the questions tion, though i should have been better pleased had he given, me notice of The facts that he has mentioned are seriouB, and are due, I think, to lack organization. A number of young men . came here from Great Britain, paying their own passages, but no arrangement was made for dealing with them on arrival. It was reported to me by Mr Gullett, that a number of these immigrants were in very straitened circumstances in Sydney, and it was suggested that the Commonwealth Government should grant money for their relief. I-agreed to the expenditure £5,000, on the condition that the Governto ment of New South Wales should make available the sameamount, and wrote a minute for the information of Hughes-this was before his departure for Great Britain-to the effect that men should be looked after, and should not be allowed to starve in onr cities.",20
8,Mr STBWABT,DEPARTURE OF BRITISH,The return of men like these will kill the immigration in the Old Country.,20
9,Sir JOSEPH OOOK,DEPARTURE OF BRITISH,"I agree with labourers. the honourable member that it may have a bad effect upon it, and I said so in my minute. The State Government would not make the grant asked for.",20

11,Sir JOSEPH OOOK,DEPARTURE OF BRITISH,"-Yes ; on their - unemployed generally. They said their own unemployed problem was acute, as no doubt it was. And they oould ,see their way to. close with our offer. Mr GBEOOBY,-And all the time the country is clamouring for development.",20
12,Sir JOSEPH OOOK,DEPARTURE OF BRITISH,"That is true, men may perish where there is plenty if there is a lack of organization, and the trouble now under consideration is due the failure of organization, to put it",20
13,Mr RIOHASD POSTBB,DEPARTURE OF BRITISH,Who is re,20
14,Sir JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTURE OF BRITISH,"Certainl y we not, except in so far as we are refor the general condition of Nothing was done hy the so State Government of New South Wales, and last week I heard from the chaplain of one of the big church social organizai n Sydney that he was relieying a number of these immigrants, some of it . whom had wives and families, and had nothing to eat and no home to which of . they could go. I have made available to him £1,000 for the relief of those people. The whole scheme needs organization, and the great point is that we should take care that when immigrants come here there is an organization ready to receive them. There again we are up against onr own limitations. The arrangement we made at the recent Conference in regard-to immigration was that the Commonwealth would take full responsibility for the imof migrants at the London end and attend their passage to Australia, the States, on their part, undertaking to receive, and deal with them on .arrival, as is already Mr being done by Western Australia and some of the other States. That was the the division of work that was agreed upon, and I hope that, the arrangement may soon be got into working order. There is, however, some little difficulty with campaign the State Governments.",20
15,Mr STBWABT,DEPARTURE OF BRITISH,There is room for thousands of domestic servants and farm,20
16,Mr ANSTEY,DEPARTURE OF BRITISH,"We cannot find work for onr own men. There are 100,000 men out of work in the Commonwealth",20
17,Mr STBWABT,DEPARTURE OF BRITISH,There is work for if they will work the same hours as the primary producer does.,20
18,Sir JOSEPH OOOK,DEPARTURE OF BRITISH,"Badl y off as that we are in regard' to unemployment, we are still better off than .any other country not in the world. We have unemployed in Australia, but there is no country in. the world that has not got them at present, and in very much larger numbers than they are here. This is a temporary difficulty, I hope, and we must try to get over it in the best way we can.",20
19,Mr WIENHOLT,DEPARTURE OF BRITISH,The unemployed trouble is much deeper than mere lack of organization.,21
20,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DEPARTURE OF BRITISH, Order ! This question is developing into an irregular debate.,21
21,Sir JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTURE OF BRITISH,"It is a very important matter, Mr Deputy Speaker, and affects our reputation abroad and our immigration scheme most profoundly. I hope honourable members will believe that with our limitations and all the defects we have at present in regard to this organization, we are doing the best we can. We have the whole matter under review. I have already made £1,000 available for the relief of these cases, and Mr Gullett is now at work upon this very problem, and I hope we may soon find, some solution for it . Meanwhile, he is developing his organization. It has been already launched in Victoria with very good prospects, and I see that a similar organization was launched in Sydney last Monday. I had promised to be present, but was unable to leave Melbourne. We are doing all we can to get the organization under way, but the obligation is on the States to undertake responsibility at this end, while we undertake the responsibility in London. If the States will not take the responsibility here we must, and will. In the meantime, I agree that, in our present circumstances, we shall do well to encourage the immigration of domestic servants and nominated immigrants. The latter is the best of all forms of immigration, because when the people arrive here after having been nominated by their friends, there is a place to which they can go and get something to eat until they can shift for themselves. class of immigration is being developed already, and we expect 30,000 or 40,000 new arrivals next year through this medium alone. But that is only a trickle, and we must look to the larger tide of immigration in the immediate future.",21
22,Mr CHARLTON,DEPARTURE OF BRITISH,"In view of his statement that the immigration organization is not complete, and having regard to the fact that thousands of men are [36S]- 2 unemployed in the different States, necessitating heavy calls on all the Governments, will the Acting Prime Minister take into consideration the advisability of at once informing the immigration officials abroad that because of the position here immigration activity should be deferred for the time being?",21
23,Sir JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTURE OF BRITISH,No ; I will not. ELECTORAL REDISTRIBUTION.,21
24,Mr FENTON,DEPARTURE OF BRITISH,"-Whils t I realise that the electoral provisions of the Constitution can be amended only by the people themselves, I ask the Acting Prime Minister whether, prior to the redistribution of seats in accordance with the new proportions of population in the different States, he will afford the House an opportunity of discussing what is known as the formula for ascertaining the quota, which is pronounced by experts to be altogether ineffective and inequitable. If that is done, I am certain the House will do no injustice to any State. All I am asking for is a fair deal for all the States, so that we may arrive at a formula that will be just to all concerned.",21
25,Sir JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTURE OF BRITISH,"In my simplicity, I was not aware that there was anything occult, complex, or extremely difficult in ascertaining the quota for the electorates throughout the Commonwealth. I should think there would be no trouble about that,.and I ask the honourable member to indicate where the difficulty lies.",21
26,Mr FENTON,DEPARTURE OF BRITISH,"If the Acting Prime Minister will inquire of the experts in connection with the Department or the Minister presiding over it, I think he will be told that there are some inequalities in the present system.",21
27,Sir JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTURE OF BRITISH,I shall certainly ask my colleague to make inquiries That at the earliest possible moment.,21
28,Mr GREGORY,DEPARTURE OF BRITISH,Do the Government intend to appoint immediately under section 13 of the Electoral Act a Commission for altering .and defining the boundaries of constituencies?,21
29,Sir JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTURE OF BRITISH,"So far only an interim report upon the census has been made. The figures have still to be checked, so that it may be some little time before the final report is made, but immediately that comes to hand the matter to which the honourable member has re-, ferred must command the serious attenof tion of the Government.

I would like' to know whether there is any means by which honourable members who leave their party at critical moments and fail to support their leader may be called to account?,22
31,Sir JOSEPH COOK,NEWSPAPER REFLECTIONS ON,"Wit h the honourable member's long experience of caucus methods, which, of course, are up to date, no doubt, he could enlighten the House upon many ways in which this could be done, and I suggest that some day when there is not much business of importance to be transacted he might do so.",22
32,Mr GREGORY,NEWSPAPER REFLECTIONS ON,"B y way of personal explanation, I would like to say in reference to certain criticisms directed towards the Leader of the Country party (Dr Earle Page) that his absence from the House is due to illness. NA SOLDIERS. POSITION OF MERCHANT SERVICE MEN .",22

If so, cannot this be amended? 2. Will he bring this matter before the Cabinet?",22
34,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PREFERENCE TO RETURNED,'The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. Members of the Merchant Service Marine are not eligible for the preference in employment provided under the Commonwealth Public Service Act for returned sailors and soldiers. 2. I see no objection to doing this. BURNETT LANDS.,22
35,Mr CAMERON,PREFERENCE TO RETURNED,"the Acting Prime Minister, upon notice I. Did the Government of Queensland formally apply for a loan of £2,000,000 from the Commonwealth Government for the .purpose developing the Burnett Land' Settlement Scheme? 2. If so, upon what date? 3. Has the Commonwealth Government considered the matter and arrived at a definite decision with regard thereto? 4. If. so, has that decision been officially conveyed to the Government of Queensland? I Sir JOSEPH OOOK - In all the correspondence and records of conferences I have seen, not only was there no promise made by the Prime Minister of monetary assistance for the development of this Burnett land scheme, but, on the contrary, there was a very definite statement by him that only in connection with the further development of the Murray waters scheme, and the alteration of railway gauges to a uniform gauge, did the Commonwealth propose to give aid to the States in connection with immigration - schemes. Everything else was specifically excluded from the range of that aid. The honourable member will see all this in the following lengthy summary of what - has taken place in connection with the matter:IMMIGRATION AND LAND SETTLEMENT. Premiers' Conference, May, 1920. At the Premiers' Conference, held at Melbourne during the month of May, 1920, the following resolutions were carried:Resolved: "" That the proposals of the Prime Minister as follow:Commonwealth to have full control overseas; Agents-General of the several States to form consultative committees in London; Commonwealth to be responsible for, and have control of, all overseas organizations and transport arrangements for bringing immigrants to Australia; Primary object of scheme to be the settlement of immigrants on the lands of Australia; Type of immigrant-preferenc e to be given to British ex-service men, Commonwealth io seek co-operation and assistance of British Government in obtaining right type of immigrant and of passages for same; Commonwealth to assume nnancial responsibility for organization for immigrants from overseas and transport to Australia; The States to be responsible for immigrants from arrival in Australia, and for their settlement on suitable lands and/or employment on public works; States to enter into an agreement with the Commonwealth, setting out in definite terms what they bind themselves to do in regard to providing(a) land; (6) other forms of assistance, such as depots, sustenance, general care of immigrants, employment on public works, particularly on unification of railway gauge and Murray Waters scheme, &c be approved by the Conference, with the following additions:Commonwealth and States to co-operate and consult from time to time as to the number of immigrants who can be absorbed, in the respective States, and the class of immigrants required.' The Commonwealth undertakes to assist the States by way of loans for approved land settlement and public works."" Resolved; ""That the Premiers undertake to submit the scheme for consideration by the respective State Cabinets."" The Prime Minister, together with other Commonwealth Ministers, attended the Conference on the 24th May, when the proposals of the Commonwealth Government with regard to immigration were placed before the Conference 5>y Mr Hughes. During the course of the debate, Mr Hughes said"" I must not be held to commit the Commonwealth to that proposal, if it is to be considered as part of the scheme, 'so that the scheme is itself contingent upon it. All that I say is this: That the scheme itself is limited clearly in the most definite way, and is under your control, because you are to say how many men you can Absorb, and what kind of men. Having agreed to that proposal, with that first addendum, if you ask, ' Are you prepared to consider the question of advancing loans for the purpose of this scheme on public works approved by you?' I say, 'We are prepared to consider it ; - but we do not say with regard to public works other than the Murray River and the unification of railway gauge that we will provide the money.' -., In regard to the unification of gauge, we do say that we will provide the money. As far as developmental railways are concerned, I may remark that I shall look very favourably on them, because I do not think we can spend - our money in any better way."" Li ' Premiers' Conference, July, 1920. At a further Conference, held at Melbourne - during the period 16th to 20th July, 1920, between the Commonwealth and State Ministers, the proposals outlined in the first resolution with regard to immigration passed at the former Conference were re-affirmed, and the - Conference decided that a scheme should be drawn up by the Commonwealth and submitted to the State Governments for approval. With regard to the second addendum to the first, resolution, however, the Prime Minister - stated that the Commonwealth Government - would not undertake to give any assistance except in respect of the Murray River waters scheme and the construction of a uniform'railway gauge throughout Australia. During the debate in connection with this matter, Mr Fihelly asked the Prime Minister what money would be made available for public for (1) ex-service men; works ? (2) other classes of immi- Mr Hughes replied that the Commonwealth grants ; Government was prepared to co-operate in all these public works undertakings to the extent of the mutual resources of the Commonwealth and State, but it could not go beyond that. He stated that the Murray Waters Scheme could be expedited, the Unification of the railway gauges undertaken, also any other public works that might be suggested, and upon which agreement might be arrived at. He also stated that the Commonwealth was .prepared to cooperate to the fullest extent, because immigration was essential to the welfare and safety of Australia. Mr Fihelly then pointed out that Queensland offered exceptional facilities for the settlement of the largest number of immigrants, and added that the Murray Water Scheme did not interest Queensland as a State. He intimated also that the same applied to the Unification of the railway gauges, because that would merely connect Brisbane with the border. Mr Hughes agreed that Queensland and Western Australia offered greater facilities than the other States for the settlement of the largest number of immigrants, but added - "" In regard to public works we must cut our coat according to our financial cloth."" Premiers' Conference, November, 1920. At a Premiers' Conference held at the Prime Minister's Office on the 1st November, 1920, Mr Theodore said"" We could absorb straight way a few thousands of immigrants if we had the money tb carry out our proposals. We want assistance financially."" ' Mr Hughes replied"" I do not know to what extent we can do that. You know the state of the moneymarket. I do not know what we can do. You (Mr Theodore) said the Burnett district wants £2,000,000 spent on it. . . . We have got to do something. I have done the best I can. We must carry out that scheme. We cannot settle it now, but this general conversation helps."" Mr Fihelly's Inaccuracy. Mr Fihelly, in May, 1921, stated that a promise was given at the July Conference between Federal and State Ministers that money would be advanced by the Commonwealth Government in connection with the Burnett lands. The answer to this assertion is summed up in the explicit statement by the Prime Minister "" that the Commonwealth Government would not undertake to give-any assistance except in respect of the Murray River Water Scheme and the construction of a uniform gauge."" This had reference solely to immigration proposals. Regarding soldier settlement, Mr Fihelly (at the July Conference) asked""What about Queensland's Upper Burnett Tailway proposition?"" To which Senator Millen replied"" That will come out of the £1,000 if the line is agreed to."" - This £1,000 was the amount to be paid in respect of each settler, £625 being secured to the settler himself and the £375 being available to the States for the purpose of providing land. Nothing was said that could be construed into a promise "" that money would be advanced by the Commonwealth Government in connection with the Burnett lands."" On the 15th November, 1920, Mr Theodore wrote to the Prime Minister, stating that the ability of Queensland to absorb any number of immigrants depended upon the opening of further areas of land therein for settlement. He stated that there was a large tract in the Northern Burnett and Callide Valley districts suitable for close occupation, on agricultural areas, of many thousands of selectors, but that about £2,000,000 would be required for railway and road construction to adapt it for such purposes. This work would extend over three or four years, but, in the meantime, 1,500 men would be employed on the construction as soon as money was available. He added that if the Commonwealth Government would grant the State a loan of £2,000,000, to be used for the above purpose only, and to be drawn on as required, the Queensland Government could make a concrete proposal with regard to immigration. The Premier further suggested that Mr. Gullett, Director of Immigration, proceed to Queensland and go fully into the matter with the State authorities. In reply to that letter, the Premier of Queensland was informed that Mr Gullett would inspect the areas in question early in the"" year 1921, and, further, that as soon as the report in the matter had been received the request for financial assistance would receive full consideration. Queensland's not Unnatural Desire. Queensland representatives have expressed a not unnatural anxiety to receive some indication tending to justify the hope that undeveloped parts of their richly-endowed State might be made more accessible to new settlers. The Commonwealth Government sincerely desired to formulate some plan ' that could be initiated on practical and financially sound lines. This much was indicated by the Prime Minister at the commencement of the negotiations with the Government of the Northern State. The Superintendent of Immigration was sent to Queensland to report on the value of the Burnett country as a district for settlement. He carried out this duty, and the report was printed for the information of honourable members - introduced This action appears to be accepted ;by some critics as an admission on the part of the Sir Joseph Cook. Commonwealth Government that it was committed to a scheme involving a loan of £2,000,000 to the Queensland Government. The facts of the case surely demand no elaborate explanation. Queensland asked for £2,000,000 to be used in opening up undeveloped country. Admittedly, this was an admirable objective. But the Commonwealth Government desired to learn full details regarding the advantages to be gained in alloting £2,000,000. This would have been a natural procedure, even had the Commonwealth Government held ample funds for general purposes. But with a Treasury meeting heavy demands pf an abnormal character, finance duly dominated the position. The importance of the opportunity for development in the Burnett district has never been questioned-li t cannot be questioned. But the fact cannot be ignored that Queensland is a State in which established railways cover wide areas of rich country, in which there is ample space open to prospective settlers. The Commonwealth Government regrets that it is not able to comply with the request submitted by the Queensland Government at the present time, as money is not available for the purpose. . REPATRIATION EFFORTS'. EXPENDITURE ON RE-AFFOKESTATION.",22

39,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PREFERENCE TO RETURNED,"The question asked by the honourable member is of sogeneral a character as to make a definite reply difficult. Civil administration wasin the mandated territory as from the 12th May, 1921, and the many important phases of administration which liave arisen are at present under consideration by the Government.

Will he inform the House if there are any other export duties in Australia and its dependencies ? 3. If so, will he ask the Cabinet to consider the removal of such burdens upon primary production f",25
42,Mr MASSYGREENE,PREFERENCE TO RETURNED,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o llow:1. There is no export duty on peanuts exported from Papua, but there is an export duty of 25s. per ton on copra. 2. There are no export duties on goods exported from Australia. The export duty on copra is the only export duty imposed so far as the dependencies are concerned. 3. The Commonwealth Government have no intention of imposing export duties on any primary products exported from Australia. So far as Papua is concerned, the question is one with which the local Government is concerned. IMPERIAL CONFERENCE.",25
43,Mr GIBSON,PREFERENCE TO RETURNED,"for Dr EARLE PAGE) asked the Acting Prime Minister, upon noticeIn view of the information in the cablegram published in Melbourne newspapers, that Dr Butler, of the Columbia University, has been asked to lecture at the Imperial Conference on constitutional problems, have the Government any information that the question of an Imperial Constitution will be discussed at the Conference; and, if so, has that information been received since the Prime Minister's departure?",25
44,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PREFERENCE TO RETURNED,"Accordin g to the public press, this statement has proved to be incorrect concerning Dr Butler, whom I met when passing through America; but I would like to say very emphatically-and it is necessary in view of what is being said in the papers, and in view of the demand in some quarters that something ought to. be done-that the Government have no information on these matters other than that which has already been communicated to the House.

Has the Melbourne Argus also recently increased its charge to twopence per copy? 4. Willi he consider the advisableness of diverting these excessive charges to a useful public purpose by imposing a tax of one halfpenny per copy upon twopenny daily papers, and thus provide ample funds to enable the Seat of Government to be transferred to Canberra within three years?",25
46,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PREFERENCE TO RETURNED,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. There has been a considerable reduction in the price of newsprint, which closely approximates that set out. 2 and 3. I understand the price of both the Melbourne Age and Melbourne Argus has recently been increased as stated. I am not in a position to say whether, having due regard to the publishers' costs, the increase is excessive. 4. See answer to questions 2 and 3. PUBLIC SERVICE. NA OFFICERS.",25

52,Dr MALONEY,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,What is the name of rthe firm?,27
53,Mr FRANCIS,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"Sturtevant , Bedford; '.Proprietary Limited, of Lonsdaletstreet. The firm is now occupying small premises, but hopes shortly to be occupying the new building which I have mentioned. If this and other industries are. given -.sufficient protection there will be no sity for sending away from this country hundreds of passengers who have arrived from the Old Country, as we have heard makers. - of today. I am continually being interviewed by men seeking employment, and the others made? if our Australian industries are ade»quately protected these men will easily be absorbed. Since the present duties were dalous. imposed an award of the Arbitration Court has increased the wages bill by per cent., and has also reduced the ber of working hours. I do not desire this juncture to discuss Arbitration Court, awards, but I am convinced that until cost of living is reduced wages must main as they are today. When the mawould chinery is installed, approximately £100,000 will have been invested in this particular industry, and it is only fair that the Government should come to its aid. Australian metals are used in the production of builders' brassof ware. The copper comes from Mount Lyell, the spelter from Broken H i l sheet brass from the Colonial Ammunition Company, and the ti n from Mount Bischoff. All the machinery is manufactured in Australia. Quite recently the Repatriation Department called for tenders for 12,000 locks for War Service Homes, and, so far as one can gather, orders for only 600 were placed with Melbe bourne manufacturers. The bulk of the requirements in this direction were chased from importing houses, which is conclusive proof that the present are inadequate. c",27
54,Mr WATKINS,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,Was there any great difference in the price?,27
55,Mr FRANCIS,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"Thos e who are conall right. ducting this industry are quite prepared to invest more capital if the present is increased by 10 percent. Quite recently £20,000 importing firms'placed orders with Japan. I have no interest whatever in this industry, and there are no factories in my conto stituency. I produce for the information of honourable members an article made in Japan, and one of similar type manufactured in Australia.",27
56,Mr WATKINS,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,Is that the stuff they are putting into the War Service homes?,27
57,Mr FRANCIS,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"I do not know whether the Department is equipping the soldiers' homes with Japanese furnishings; but I do know that, out of 12,000 neceslock sets for which tenders were invited by the War Service Homes Branch, only 600 were purchased from the Melbourne ",27
58,Mr FRANCIS,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,Overseas . ,27
59,Mr FRANCIS,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"I have these two 20 locks before me. In comparing them, the numman in the street, without practical at knowledge, would say that the Japanese lock appeared to be all right, and was the good enough. But the man who knows rewould compare the finish of the two. He note the superiority of the Australian article, and perceive its greater durability. Price, however, would be the appealing factor with the uninformed individual. Naturally, the Japanese article is the cheaper, considering that the item wage cost is almost negligible as coml , the pared with the same in Australia.",27
60,Mr RILEY,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,-What is the difference between the prices?,27
61,Mr FRANCIS,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"I have not that specific information; but the Japanese lock costs very much less. Having had twenty-five years' experience in the building trade, I can say, although I do not set up to an expert, that there is vastly greater value in the Australian product. Tha.^ purhowever, would not appeal to the average' individual. Price, I repeat, would be the duties main consideration.  these Japanese lines into the War Service homes, they will fly the good old flag over them, and that will make everything",27
62,Mr FRANCIS,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"If that is to be the duty purpose for which our flag is to be employed, I shall have no time for it. But I stand up for my country all the time, and every time, with Japan and every other country nowhere. I consider the desire of the Australian makers for a 10 per cent, increase in the duties extremely moderate and altogether reasonable. A Melbourne importing house recently sent a sample of the Australian product to Japan, and asked the foreign makers to imitate it as closely as possible, and forward a "" quote."" I emphasize that the wage cost in Japan is almost nothing, and that thus the foreign makers have an enormous advantage. But we must keep out these cheap Japanese goods if we are to foster the best interests of our own country. I move That the following words he added:-""And on and after 17th June, 1921, ad val., British, 45 per cent.; intermediate, 50 per cent.; general, 55 per cent.""",27
63,Dr MALONEY,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"Melbourne) [3.15] I hope the Minister will accept the amendment. I thank the honourable member for Henty for having moved it , and for having so ably stated the case for the Australian makers. Having inspected the samples, I noticed an undoubted similarity, but I point out that the play of the Australian lock is more facile than that of the Japanese; also, that the spring which holds the bolt of the localproduct in place is of brass, in keeping with the material of which the lock is made, whereas, in the Japanese bolt, the spring is of a cheaper metal. I can appreciate that there is bound to be a considerable difference in the selling price. I wish to say, by the way, that in my criticisms, I do not desire to disparage Japan. Its people are the most 'artistic r<ace the world has ever known. At the same time, our duty, as representatives of a white race, is first to Australia; and, even if the price of the imported line were less than half of that of the local production, we should support the Australian industry. One tremendous factor calling for our support is that all the material in the Australian lock is from Australian sources, that the machinery employed is Australian made, and that the workmen are Australians. With respect to the furnishing of War Service homes, Mr MCKenzie, the prethe sident of the Melbourne branch of the Returned Soldiers Association, made known to the public some time ago that the incandescent lamps which had been used in connection with the* electrical installations in soldiers* homes had been made in China. That assertion was contradicted by the head of the War Service Homes, branch;. Mr MCKenzie was told plainly that he was a perverter of the truth. Unfortunately for the veracity of the highlyplaced Government official concerned, Mr MCKenzie had some of these lamps, in his own possession. An order was issued by the War Service Homes branch. /for the return of all the Chinese lamps,, but some of them were not given up. They were missed, and their return was demanded. The lamps were only given, up, however, upon the Department issuing a receipt bearing the words to the specific effect that the lamps were "" Made in China."" In the light of that incident one can understand that the War Service Homes Department would readily equip the soldiers' homes with Japanese goods. If honourable members care to examine .the display board in the Queen's Hall,, which contains numbers of bolts, among: other things, they will be convinced that, since Australian factories can turn out such products, the makers deserve to be encouraged, not merely by 10 per cent, increases in the duties, but-by even more.",28
64,Mr MASSYGREENE,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [3.20] - In the first place, this item deals with manufactures of metals n.e.i., and certainly covers the particular articles to which the honourable member for Henty (Mr Francis) has referred. But I should be extremely sorry to be put through a catechism as to the additional articles which it covers. It embraces an immense range of articles, which vary both in the degree of manufacture that is involved in them and also in their values. The particular subject of the honourable member's remarks was brassware of one kind or another. I hope that he does not forget that very nearly as much labour is involved in the making of a steel bolt as is involved in the making of a brass bolt. It is true that there is a greater amount of labour requisite in manufacture of a brass bolt than there is in the manufacture of an iron bolt, but the ad valorem duty in both cases is the Bame, The duty upon the brass .'bolt, however, represents a far greatermeasure, of protection than it does upon.the iron bolt, because we have to considerthe - value of the metal used' in each instance, and we all know that the value of the metal used in the manufacture, of a brass bolt is very much higher than is the value of the metal used in the manufacture of an iron bolt. The same remark is applicable to the still higher processes of manufacture. In the case of goods from foreign countries, the duty proposed, namely, 45 per cent., would be very high if we added 10 per cent, to it. I cannot see my way to increase the existing impost. If honourable members will look at the item, they will see that the' duty upon .it has been increased from 30 per cent - under the 1908 Tariff, to 45 per cent, under this Tariff. In all the circumstances the - duties proposed appear to be sufficient to afford our local manufacturers a reasonable chance of competing successfully with the manufacturers overseas. I know that the industry is almost an entirely new one. Prior to the war its operations were almost of a negligible character, but since then it has made wonderful strides in. many directions, not merely in - the manufacture of the articles of which the honourable member for Henty has spoken, but also in the manufacture of locks. Then there is the brass metal, and other metal industries which are being established all over the country. It seems to me that the duties set out in the schedule are quite sufficient to enable our manufacturers to successfully carry on their operations. I ask the honourable member for Henty to accept those duties, because they cover a vast number of articles other than those which he has - enumerated.",28
65,Mr FENTON,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"Maribyrnong) [3.24]. - I regret that the Minister cannot accede to the request of the honourable member for Henty (Mr Francis), although I recognise the difficulty in which he finds himself owing to the general character of this item. ""Manufactures of metal n.e.i."" covers a very numerous class of articles, but I have always been under the impression that importations from other countries bear the name, of their .country of origin.",29
66,Mr RICHARD FOSTEE,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,That is insisted - upon by the State.,29
67,Mr FENTON,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"- I do hot know whether that is"" so, or whether the matter is. subject to our Customs regulations; but a quantity of bolts ""may be imported from Japan, and the box containing them may have printed across it the words, ""Made inJapan."" When those b'olts have been taken out of the box, the public is absolutely ignorant of their country of origin.",29
68,Mr STEWART,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,The honourable member is quite right. They ought to bear the name of their country of origin.,29
69,Mr FENTON,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"During the summer I had occasion to look put for a bathing costume, and accordingly visited .a draper's establishment for the purpose of buying one. I selected one which was rather to my liking from a colour-point of view, but upon closely examining it I discovered that it had been made in Japan. That was sufficient warrant for its rejection.",29
70,Sir ROBERT BEST,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,The .branding of all goods with the name of their country of origin does not come within theprovisions of the Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Act.,29
71,Mr FENTON,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"I think that Australian purchasers should be protected, because bolts, for example, may be sold by the gross, by the hundred, or by the thousand, and they may be palmed off as having been manufactured in Australia when, as a matter of fact, they have been'made in Japan.",29
72,Mr FRANCIS,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,The Australian bolt is branded ,29
73,Mr FENTON,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"It only bears its name. The Minister has confessed that he was almost ashamed to say that our Australian manufacturers are frequently asked to keep the brand, "" Made in Australia,"" off the articles which they produce, because of the public prejudice against goods of local, manufacture. Unfortunately that is true. If we have no regulations under which imported articles must bear the name of their country of origin, it is time that our Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Act was amended in that direction.",29
74,Mr MASSYGREENE,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [3.28] - Sectio n 7 of the Oommerce (Trade Descriptions) Act provides1. The regulations may prohibit the importation or introduction into Australia of any specified ""goods unless there is applied to ""them a trade description of such, character relating to such matters, nnd applied in such manner as is prescribed. That provision enables , us to prescribe, amongst other things, that such goods shall bear the name of their country of origin, and, as a matter of fact, we do so prescribe in so far as the Act enables us to do so. But section 15 of the same Statute saysSections 7 and 11 of this Act shall uot apply to any goods other than(a) articles used for food or drink by man, or used in the manufacture or preparation of articles used for drink by man; or (b) medicines or medicinal preparations for internal or external use; or (c) manures; or (ef.) apparel (including toots and shoes) and the materials from which such apparel is manufactured; or. (e) jewellery; or (/) seeds and plants. These are the limitations imposed by the Act. If anything be .placed upon these goods descriptive of what they are, under our regulations they must also 'bear the brand of the country of their origin. But we cannot insist upon all goods being so marked. However, the Government, have under consideration at the present time a proposal to amend the Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Act, with a view to making it applicable to all imported goods, and specifying that such goods shall be marked with the name of the country of their origin.",29
75,Sir ROBERT BEST,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"Kooyong) [3.80],- I am very glad that the Minister for Trade and Customs has intimated the intention of the Government to amend the Act in question. As I interjected when the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) was speaking, I do not think that that Statute applies to the case to which he has referred, and, as. a result, the Australian article has suffered severely. The intention of the Commerce Act was to enlighten the public as to what they were buying, and there is ample room for a substantial extension of it, so as to cover cases .of this kind. I regret, with some of my honourable friends who have addressed the Committee, that the Minister (. Mr Greene)' cannot see his way to give some further assistanco to this industry. He has rightly said that this particular itom, "" Manufactures of 'inetal n.e.i.,"" has a vast range. I admit that' it has, and from that - stand-point h i * argument is. difficult to answer - If , however, the honourable gentleman is satisfied-that any department of industry, such asthat of brasswaro, covered by the item is entitled to special encouragement, there is nothing to prevent him from breaking up the item and giving to'that department of the industry such, further encouragement as he thinks proper. It is unnecessary torepeat 'the argumonts which have already been advanced, but I would point out to the Minister that when he introduced the food or Tariff, some twelve months ago, he was-satisfied that the brassware industry and' bther like enterprises were entitled to the percentages of protection set out in the schedule. The very object that he had in> fixing these schedule rates was to give1 thom the - encouragement they required. If the value of those duties has since been substantially reduced, then We - who .areenaoting this Tariff legislation at the - present time must toko cognisance of that depreciation. If , when the schedule wasintroduced last year, 35 per cent, wasBTiffioient, a greater percentage must now be necessary;",30
76,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"The same depreciation, or. an even greater one, liasbeen going on in other countries.",30
77,Sir ROBERT BEST,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"So much theworse for us. A depreciation ih valuesin countries exporting here decreases, very largely, our opportunities, because it makes them better able to pay the duties imposed.",30
78,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,Then let the manufacturers here drop their prices. It is time that they did so.,30
79,Sir ROBERT BEST,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"But, - instead of wages in the brassware industry goingdown, they have actually increased 20 per oent. since this schedule was presented. That being so, the industry today is not getting 25 per cent, by way of protection Whilst I admit the force of the Minister's argument as to the omnium gatherum character of this particularitem, yet there is a means of compassing the difficulty; and if he canaot see his way now to give additional encouragement to the brassware industry, he may, after further investigation, entertain a proposal for an increasod'diify when the Tariff is before another place.",30
80,Mr RICHARD FOSTEE,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,An that wants more than the protection provided for in this case is not worth fostering.,31
81,Sir ROBERT BEST,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"The brassware industry in Australia is only in its infancy, but it is of very great value to the Commonwealth. Exhibits of its products have been made within the precincts of the House. Many thousands of pounds have been sunk in starting the industry, and we should not overlook the fact, since it bas been demonstrated that it cannot carry on in face of the competition from Japan and elsewhere.

For that reason we included them in this item, thus making them dutiable. Tihey now tell us that they cannot manufacture those articles here unless we grant them an increased duty, and this we do not propose to do.",31
82,Mr FENTON,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,I am surprised to hear that. They are the most easily manufac1 tured things in printers' materials.,31

89,Mr WATKINS,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"Newcastle) [3.45] The honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Blundell), who is at present engaged on a deputation, asked me to refer to this item. According to my information, "" The manufacture of clumps and leads is a different and distinct industry from type founding or casting of type, and in the TJnited Kingdom no typefounder makes his own clumps or leads."" I hear also that the whole of the typemaking industry is in the hands of a tremendous American Trust, which is not only dealing with the type-makers of England by getting them into their fold, but is also beginning to deal with the Australian industry. If that is so, the request of the Australian manufacturers for an increase in the general rate, it does not strike at anything British, very modest. During the debates on this schedule those who desire to create Australian industries have said that they would rather have trusts here than out-* side, because they could deal with them here; but in this case, if the facts subalso mitted are correct, an Australian industry is in imminent danger of being crushed by a Trust over which we have no control.",31
90,Mr JOWETT,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,The whole point is that you trust no Trust?,32
91,Mr WATKINS,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"That is so. After the Minister's amendment is dealt with, it would be a fair concession for him to agree to an increase of 10 per cent, in, the general rate on articles manufactured in Australia.",32
92,Mr GREENE,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,I am not moving for an increase. It must be remembered that these are the raw material of the printer.,32
93,Mr WATKINS,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,Do I understand that clumps are the raw material for the linotype and other machines?,32
94,Mr GREENE,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,They are printers' raw material. I do not think clumps and leads are used in the linotype. Mr WATK'INS - Perhaps we can go into the question more fully after the amendment is dealt with.,32
95,Mr FENTON,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"Maribyrnong) [3.49]. - The statement ma'de iby the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Watkins) places the whole question in quite a new light. The Americans are doing their best to make their trade in many lines as world-wide as possible. It would be remarkable to me if we could not manufacture these articles in a big lead-producing country like this. We produce the lead and antimony .in Australia, and it seems strange that we cannot supply the demand for the commoner articles used in the printing trade. A clump is merely a piece of lead made to various sizes, while a lead may be described as a thin strap of lead not quite type high, which is usually placed between the lines of type, although the linotype machine puts what is known as a ""beard"" upon each line, thus dispensing with the need for this separate piece of lead between the lines. Honorably members (may have where noticed that the leading article of a is newspaper is usually printed in larger type, with more space between the lines, due to the insertion of the lead referred to. All circular printing, book printing, and work of that nature is treated in much the same way. Metal furniture should be easy to manufacture, because all that is required is a mould into which the lead is poured, and afterwards cut off into the lengths required. The operation is so simple that it is evident the manufacturers here have not entered into the business more extensively because of the danger to be apprehended from American competition. This, I think, must be the reason for the request for a further protection. I can understand the Minister's disappointment at this request, because I presume that eighteen months ago - jus t prior to the introduction of the Tariff-the manufacturers suggested what they thought would be a fair duty, and evidently they came to the conclusion that 22£ per cent., 30 per cent., and 35 per ' cent, would be sufficient protection against the American Combine. But conditions have so altered since then that this protection has in some measure been wiped out. I am anxious that the raw material for these articles should be turned into the finished product in Australia, because our printing houses use thousands of tons of lead material in the shape of clumps, furniture, leads, and quads every year. We obtain a good deal of our requirements from Great Britain; but it seems strange that we should have to send the raw material 12,000 miles by sea to England, and bring the finished product back to Australia. Mr ""WIENHOLT - I thought that the naturalprotection we had been talking about. Mr Fenton"" - The bottom has been knocked out of that argument long ago, as the honourable member for Moreton must know. I am very disappointed to think that the items referred to are on' the free list so far as Great tain is concerned, and 10 per cent. in. the general Tariff, because 10 per cent, against the American Combine is worthless.",32
96,Mr GREENE,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"My amendment puts clumps and leads, not printers' type, in item 212.",33
97,Mr FENTON,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,Why make any difference between the clumps and quads? A quad is more difficult to make than a clump. If our manufacturers can turn out quads under the present Tariff I cannot understand why they cannot make clumps.,33
98,Mr GREENE,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"That they can is shown by the importations, which have fallen off by one-third.",33
99,Mr FENTON,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,And they tell you they cannot make clumps and leads?,33
100,Mr GREENE,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,That is what they say.,33
101,Mr FENTON,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,What about spaces?,33
102,Mr GREENE,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,They are all right.,33
103,Mr FENTON,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"But a space is a very thin piece of lead not type high, used in composition between the words. If spaces can be manufactured here, it is strange that clumps cannot also be made. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.",33
104,Mr BLUNDELL,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"Adelaide) [3.58] - It is my intention to move to amend the item by increasing the British duty to 35 per cent. Those engaged in this industry in Australia have had a big struggle against a great deal of opposition, particularly from the American manufacturers, who are employing their well-known methods to destroy the local industry in order that they may have a clear run of the market. The Australian manufacturers are selling their type at prices considerably less than those at which we have been able to purchase outside. I can speak from experience, because I have been associated with the co-operative movement in my own State, and I know that we have been able to get almost everything we required at reasonable wrices. There is a'gentleman in Australia acting as foreign and In ter-State correspondent for one concern was that has not the welfare of the Australian industry at heart. This organization has issued a circular in which it invites the trade to endeavour to secure a considerable reduction in the existing duties on this item. This shows that even in Australia itself there are those who are endeavouring, in connection with this parBri- ticular industry, to bring about a reduction of the duties by which it is protected. After setting out the need for a reduction of duties, and dealing with the question of the serious injury to the import trade which the local industry represents, the circular to which I refer readsShould the foregoing meet with your views, it is suggested that you might see fit to place the matter before the member for your Division in the House of Representatives and the senators representing your State, asking that the old duty be re-established without preference, which, after all, only serves to hamper the importation of the best and not the worse classes of new type designs. Apart from any communication you may make to your political representatives, I should esteem it a favour if you would give me your views on this matter at your early convenience, for the confidential information of my principals. That circular is signed by T. D. Chataway, who, I understand, at one time occupied the position of a member of the Senate. That is the kind of opposition which the local industry has to meet. I have said that prices in Australia are less than the prices of English and American imports at the present moment; but a circular has been issued by a representative of one of the American firms in Australia in which the statement is made that they are prepared to sell type at a 50 ner cent, reduction cn present prices. The firm carrying on the industry in Australia pays all the wages they are called upon to pay; and I may inform the Committee that 55 per cent, of the selling cost of type is paid in wages which are spent in Australia. In spite of this, the local industry is called upon to enter into competition with American firms that are prepared to agree to a reduction of 50 per cent. on tt present selling prices in this country. I mention, further, that everything used in the production of type locally is of Australian manufacture. Here, again, the local industry is placed at a very great disadvantage in connection with the cost of the material it must use. In the Argus of the 10th instant, I find that lead is quoted in Melbourne at £30 per ton, and tin at £224 per ton. In Eng-land, the price of lead is given at £22 17s. 6d. per ton, and the price of tin at £167 12s. 6d. Honourable members will see the great advantage which these lower prices for material give to the makers of type overseas. I ask the Minister to agree to an increase in these duties, and to retain in the item the two articles which he proposes to take out of it. It is true that representatives of the local firm approached the honourable gentleman some time ago, with a vi&w to extending their operations, and becoming in a position practically to supply the whole of the requirements of the trade in Australia. On their representations, the Minister agreed to include in the item one or two articles which he now proposes to strike out of it, on the ground that the firm has not already started to. manufacture these particular articles._ The Teason for this is obvious. It is of no use for the firm to undertake to put in the machinery essential for the manufacture of these particular articles when the industry they have already established is confronted with the disabilities to which I have referred. It is not reasonable to expect this firm to spend thousands of pounds upon the installation of the machinery essential to make these articles when they realise that their present industry is seriously attacked by outside competition. I have the authority of a representative of the firm for saying that, if these duties are made such as to protect the local industry against outside competition, they will be quite prepared to manufacture these , particular articles that have been referred to, and to place themselves in a position to supply the whole of the requirements of the trade in Australia. I move That the following words he added:-""An on and after 17th June, 1921, ad. val., British, 30 per cent.; intermediate, 35 per cent.; ral, 45 per cent."" I Ijppe that the Minister will agree thisamendment. He should recognise that this industry deserves adequate tection, and that those engaged in it should be placed in a position to continue the business they have established, and lions of [pounds. which has proved so beneficial to. the' trade generally in Australia.

In this Tariff I have raised the general rate already by 10 per cent. I m portations under this, item 'have in 1919-20 fallen off from £12,024 in 1913 to £4,499. Ever since this Tariff was tabled the figures of importation have included in this item clumps and leads, which were not included in it under the 1913 importation figures in the old Tariff.

I should like the Minister to explain what has actuated him in imposing such a high duty - Is the cost of production more than twice whatit was before the war?

The trouble is that the farmers will not be fair in return for the fairness they received from other sections of the community during the war. The manufacture of rabbit traps will mean the employment of some people, and the more we employ the moTe there will be to consume the wheat and wear the wool produced by the man' on the land.",36

The Government established aY Department of Health, and are carrying out special investigations in the north for the purpose of abating some of the plagues to which the country is heir, and all this is being done at the public expense. Again, the State Governments are spending enormous sums of money to combat the rabbit pest. Western Australia built a rabbitproof fence over 1,000 miles in length to stay the invasion of rabbits from the east, and when that failed built other fences for the same purpose. Every honourable member is aware of the. grave injury done by these rodents, and the placing of a heavy duty on an article that helps to keep them in subjection is absurd.

It passes my comprehension that members representing country interests, forgetting the bitter experience of the past, should be prepared to throw to the wolves those who came to rescue in a period of stress and difficulty.

146,Mr JOWETT,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"There is no reason prewhy they should not have got all the traps they required. The making of a rabbit trap is not a difficult matter, and is no justification for the imposition in of this heavy duty. The Minister (Mr. Greene) has treated the Committee with greatest possible courtesy, and has extended the utmost consideration to the views of others and appreciation of their arguments. Therefore I appeal to him be merciful, and to consider the sufferof the very large numbers of people in farming and grazing pursuits in Australia-^number s which, I regret to these say, are steadily diminishing because of war, the heavy burdens being placed on this section of the community, and because of the lack of adequate consideration shown to their needs. During the last few minutes I have heard views expressed by honourable members opposite which indicate that they are not fully seized with the serious nature of the devastation caused by rabbits. The inference has been made that the existence of large numbers of rabbits is beneficial because they supply food and skins. I admit that when rabbits are trapped or shot their carcasses may be used for food and their skin for fur, or for the raw material used in 'hat making. This to some extent is a mitigation of what is otherwise a terrible affliction upon the Commonwealth. But this fact provides the strongest possible argument in favour of the removal of a duty which may result in making it unpayable to trap rabbits. ""We cannot exterminate the rabbits, but there is an enormous advantage in trapping them, and thus securing the carcasses and the skins, as against adopting the purely destructive policy of poisoning them.",37
147,Mr WATKINS,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,Is not closer settlement the best means of .preventing the spread of said. rabbits?,38
148,Mr JOWETT,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"Close r settlement, of which members of the Country party are the strongest advocates, is a. most excellent preventive' against the spread of rabbits, or any other pest; but the rabbit question has a most important bearing upon closer settlement, especially upon the settlement of soldiers on country lands. On one large estate I visited a few years ago in search of grass for sheep during a drought period I saw enormous numbers of rabbits. There was a sufficient amount of grass, but I remarked to my manager, when I decided to put my sheep there, that I felt confident we could not keep them there for more than three or four months. The rabbits on the property were very numerous, because at that time it did not pay to trap them exhaustively. This estate was subsequently bought for. the settlement of soldiers. It was exceedingly valuable land, with a good rainfall, and the prospects were favourable, save in one respect, the prevalence of rabbits. Last week I inquired as to the progress made by the soldiers who had bought the land, paying a price which would not have been unreasonable if therehad been no rabbits. I was informed that they were not doing too well, and when I asked if they had got rid of the rabbits, the reply was, "" No; they are the trouble.'* In regard to the duty upon rabbit traps^ I ask the Minister to make some concession upon the British rate of duty. I know that he is prepared to make someconcession in regard to the general rate,, but the proposed duty of 20 per cent. on. British-made traps is too high. The discussion on this item has made it apparent that the imposition of heavy duties on rabbit traps is a very serious matter toall engaged in the farming a>id grazingindustry. Will the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene) reconsider his decision, and amend the rates to 10/ per cent. British, 20 per cent, intermediate, and 30 per cent, general?",38

But I am also anxious to assist those people on the land whose properties have been devastated by the ravages of rabbits. In my own electorate, and in those represented by the other members of this party, there are thousands of settlers, who are fighting day and night to protect ""their properties against rabbits and other pests. In some instances the burden has been so great that settlers have been driv.en off the land, and they"" are already increasing the numbers of people in our .over-populated cities. Will the Minister agree to my suggestion ?",38

159,Mr JOWETT,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"There has .been no concession, or reduction in the British rate. The bulk of the rabbits trapped can be used commercially, and we should encourage the trapping industry rather than allow the rabbits to be poisoned, because the carcasses arc then of no use to any one. Even if it means remaining here late, I shall not neglect my duty by allowing this item to pass without raising' a strong protest against such high duties. I again appeal to the Minister to reconsider his decision in view of the cogent arguments which have been adduced.",39
160,Mr GABB,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,I call attention to the state of the Committee. [Quorum formed.],39
161,Mr JOWETT,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,Is the Minister prepared to agree to a British rate of 15 per cent.?,39
162,Mr GREENE,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,No.,39
163,Mr JOWETT,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"A large number of people in the country producing foodstuffs are not even paying expenses, and it is the duty of the Government to protect their interests. The cost of erecting wire netting fences on small areas of from, say, 200 to 800 acres, is more per acre than on larger areas. I would now point out that any extra cost of rabbit traps, or of rabbit trapping, must fall much more heavily upon small landowners than upon the owners of large estates, The owner of, say, 10,000 acres in one solid block will have comparatively little difficulty in protecting his property from rabbits by erecting a wire-netting fence all round it. But the smaller the area the greater the cost per acre incurred in wire netting. Consequently, a large number of settlers on small holdings cannot afford to protect their properties by completely enclosing them with rabbit-proof netting, because it adds to the cost per acre of the land. Therefore, they have almost entirely to rely upon trapping. I have already detained the. Committee longer than I intended, and. I now make a final appeal to the Minister to amend the rates in the direction I have suggested.",39
164,Mr ANSTEY,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"Bourke) [5.5] - It isdifficult to know, in following the arguments of the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett), whether he is speak: ing as representative of the disappearing constituency of Grampians or as a prospective candidate for"" some metropolitan seat. I do not care, personally, whether the matter at issue is rabbit traps, or not. With me, the question is, "" Is this article,, necessary as it is for use in Australia, to be made.in this country, or not? "" Does the honourable member for Grampians desire the importation ofrabbit traps from overseas ? Mr BELX;-We want them cheap. We dp not care where they come from.",39
165,Mr JOWETT,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,I do not take that view.,39
166,Mr ANSTEY,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"Then there is a disagreement on the part of honourable members opposite. One wants rabbit traps, cheap, and does not care who makes them.",39
167,Mr JOWETT,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"I consider they could be. made easily in Australia, and that they would be of a quality which would defy competition; and, moreover, that Australian makers could cater for the demand with the help of a 10 per cent. duty.",39
168,Mr ANSTEY,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"Of course, these simple things ought to be turned out in Australia as easily as anywhere else, and there is no reason why they should not be made here to cater completely for Australian requirements. But, if honourable members desire rabbit traps to be made in Australia, let them agree to a duty which will permit these things to be turned out here, and overthrow foreign competition. If an honourable member were to say that there should be no duty at all, I could appreciate his view-point; but, when he advocates a duty as low as 10 per cent., it is obvious that he does not favour a Protective Tariff, but wants a revenue Tariff. He wants to impose so low a duty that it will not protect the Australian manufacturer, but will encourage the importation of foreign products-which , however, will be required tp pay a heavy revenue tax. Why should any one take up such an absurd position?",39
169,Mr JOWETT,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,I would rather have them come in free.,40
170,Mr ANSTEY,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"There is no article capable of being made in this country which can be adequately protected with a 10 per cent. duty. If honourable members desire Protection, the rates"" of duty must be high enough to really and adequately protect, at the same time having regard, however, to the price which the people must pay for the goods. ' I consider that the Minister has gone far enough, and I hope he will not, either now or upon any occasion, agree to less than a rate of 20 per cent. For a duty less than that is not protective, but is merely revenue productive.",40
171,Mr FLEMING,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"Robertson) [5.8] The honourable member for Bourke (Mr. Anstey) has apparently missed a most important point. It is involved in the consideration of what is the least expensive method of destroying rabbits. Poisoning and the trap are the means most commonly employed. But poisoning is the most wasteful. It not only destroys the rabbit as an asset after its destruction, but it is destructive to the natural life of the bush generally. The use of the poison cart has cost Australia hundreds of thousands of pounds, if not millions.",40
172,Mr RICHARD FOSTEE,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,It has saved Australia that much.,40
173,Mr FLEMING,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,I know that quite a lot of people consider the poison cart the best and most effective means of coping with the pest.,40
174,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,It is certainly the easiest.,40
175,Mr FLEMING,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,There lies the whole trouble.,40
176,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"In fact, it is the only really effective way.",40
177,Mr FLEMING,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"Sometimes poisoning is the most effective way; but if tiveness is the sole objective, the best method of all is to poison the water. That settles the rabbit, but everything else also, at the same time. The poison cart 'has been the means of almost exterminating bird life in parts of Australia. It has had the effect of tremendously increasing the blowfly pest, and dt has added to our troubles with grasshoppers. There are many factors which operate in upsetting the balance of nature; but nothing has been so ruthless in that direction as the poison cart. By its use not only is the carcass of the rabbit itself wasted, but the balance of nature becomes seriously disturbed, if not locally overthrown ;- and that balance is the only certain safeguard of the man on the land. The trap may not be as destructive as poison; but it does not destroy the'natural enemies of the rabbit and the various other pests which burden the producer. The rabbit trap is the small man's weapon. Netting, which is becoming ever more expensive, is the means adopted by the large holder for ridding his land of rabbits. Not only is the trap the main asset of the small holder in keeping down the pest, but it is the means adopted by thousands of children throughout Australia of bringing in a little pocket-money while assisting to rid their neighbourhood of rabbits; and it is similarly the means of providing employment for large numbers of men in the off seasons. The poison cart takes away the opportunity for young people to make a little money, and for the working man in the country to make a living during the dull periods. If .the Minister insists upon the rates set forth in the schedule he will be conferring undue advantage upon the poison cart. It is highly necessary that we should, as far as possible, restore the balance of nature. An old resident of New .South Wales, who has been writing to the papers for many years upon this subject, has established a sanctuary on his own extensive property in an effort to restore the depleted bird life and native fauna. He will not permita poison cart anywhere near his run, yet, I am told, he is the least troubled by rabbits among all the landowners in his district. If all holders were to follow the advice and example of Mr Abbott, they would not be troubled with the vermin and other pests which so handicap the man on the land today. effecThere is a prominent resident of Melbourne who has also long given consideration to the subject of the restoration of the balance of nature. He has practically spent his life in working out problems having to do with the extermination of rabbits and the like, and he is bitterly opposed to the poison cart. In the matter under discussion there is not only involved the question of the rates of duty to be fixed upon rabbit traps, but there is this additional consideration: That any difference made in the cost of applying the two methods of destruction will go a long way towards further increasing the disabilities from which Australia is now suffering. If the Minister intends to accept or move an amendment, I hope it will be in the direction of according greater preference to Britain. In the course of the Tariff de'bate I have already urged more generous measures of preference towards the TJnited Kingdom, and I have suggested that, if necessary, the duties in respect of foreign products should be increased. With its wide variety of climatic conditions, the Empire is capable of becoming self-supporting. Australia is not, and never can be, self-supporting. No single country, indeed, which sets out in that direction can become anything but a failure.",40
178,Mr BELL,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"Darwin) [5.17] - Las t week, when debating the duties upon wire netting, I spoke of the devastation caused by rabbits in the north-west of Tasmania .and parts of Victoria. I do not propose to repeat those remarks, but I earnestly ask the Minister to accede to a reduction in the rates of duty upon rabbit traps. Of what importance is an industry-if it can be so called-engage d in the manufacture of rabbit traps compared with the welfare of agriculture and grazing throughout Australia? I fear that the Minister and many honourable members do not realise the menace of the rabbit pest. Had their experience been such as mine, they would perceive how Teally trivial is the question whether or not rabbit traps can be or should be profitably made in Australia. The cry of honourable members is, "" Give Australian industry a chance."" I say, "" Give Australian pioneers a chance, and do not talk about the manufacturer every time you speak of Australia."" I said, by interjection just now; that I did not care where rabbit traps came from so long as we got them cheap. I repeat that with all seriousness. What does it matter who makes the weapon with which we fight and try to overcome the menacing rabbit pest? I do not care whether the rabbit trap which I use to save my holding is made in Japan, or in Germany, or in some other world, in fact. It is our chief weapon of offence against Australia's worse scourge. In many parts, the man on the land is faced with ruin. We must use the trap, and the poison cart, and wire netting, too. We have already put on wire netting a very high duty, which was not justified in any sense. I am now offering my little plea against a further increase on the other weapon which we must use for the destruction of rabbits. I ask the Minister to give favourable consideration to our request. I have supported him on every occasion when those on the Opposition benches have asked him for an increase, and I do expect him to give some consideration to the people for whom I am speaking.",41
179,Mr MASSYGREENE,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [5.21] - I am sorry that I cannot see my way clear to agree to my honourable friend's request. I have heard a number of debates which had some amusing and some annoying features, but today I have heard statements about which I can say that I really do not know whether they annoy or amuse me most. Any honourable member who has had experience of what happens under practical trapping conditions knows full well the net result on the number of rabbits in this country.",41
180,Mr BELL,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"I can prove to the Minister that last year. 16,000 rabbits were trapped on one sheep run, of less acreage than that number, at any rate.",41
181,Mr MASSYGREENE,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"It cannot be said that 16,000 acres off which 16,000 rabbits are trapped in a year is infested country.",41
182,Mr RIOHAKD EOSTER,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,We have trapped more than that in a week in a place half that size.,41
183,Mr MASSYGREENE,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"Yes, in heavily infested country far more would be trapped. Everybody knows that in most instances the rabbit trapper's idea is not to get rid of the rabbits entirely, but to keep them going. *",41
184,Mr RICHARD EOSTER,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,Do you want to make it a permanent industry?,41
185,Mr MASSYGREENE,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"No ; but trapping by itself is not much good as a means of getting rid of the pest. We have had experience in Australia regarding the industry of manufacturing rabbit traps. The effect of making this duty 10 per cent, would simply be to turn it into a revenue duty, and the industry would go out of existence.",41
186,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,Wir y sliould it be simply a revenue duty ? The trap is the simplest thing in the world to make.,42
187,Mr MASSYGREENE,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"I will give the Committee an instance of what happened under the old 10 per cent. Tariff. I have received a letter from a man who is now manufacturing rabbit traps, in which he .saysWithout a duty local manufacture is impossible except for just a month or two as at present, while there is a dearth of imported traps. My reason for making this assertion is based on the experience of a few years ago. At that time a local factory was established, but the venture was disastoous, because makers abroad dumped traps into Australia at a price which made it quite impossible for the Australian firm to compete, and when it had been defeated* prices were, of course, raised.",42
188,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,They were not raised much before the war.,42
189,Mr MASSYGREENE,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"I feel that, with the - experience we have had, we cannot agree to reduce this duty if we have any real desire to see Australia put in a position to protect itself in all circumstances. I cannot believe that a duty of 20 per cent, can result in any increase in the price of rabbit traps, with several makers manufacturing in this country. The duty is moderate. I am prepared to take out dog traps, and to make the foreign duty 30 per cent.",42
190,Mr JOWETT,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,No ; we do not ask for that.,42
191,Mr MASSYGREENE,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"Some have asked for it. In making that offer I am meeting the Committee in a reasonable way, and at the same time keeping faith with the manufacturers who came to our rescue at a time when we were practically helpless.",42
192,Mr JOWETT,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"The duty of cent., which operated some years ago, did not apply to British traps?",42
193,Mr MASSYGREENE,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,No .,42
194,Mr JOWETT,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,And there has never been a duty on British traps?,42
195,Mr MASSYGREENE,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,No . _,42
196,Mr JOWETT,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"Then , in the circumstances, a duty of 10 per cent, would be reasonable.",42
197,Mr ROBERT COOK,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"Indi) '[5.27] The Minister's reply to the common-sense arguments that have been used has been simply a repetition of the answers he has given all through the piece to reasonable demands made by reasonable members. We have given him a very fair go so far as the Tariff is concerned. Everywhere outside one can hear it said that the people are going protection mad. I am a Protectionist, but many of the items to which the Committee have agreed represent, not protection at all, but extreme prohibition. An instance of that is the duty of 45 per cent, on a reaper and.' binder, which is one of the most useful necessities that a man can have on a' farm; and another instance is the duty of 68s. British, S4s. intermediate, and 105s. general, per ton on wire-netting. The TEMPORARY CHAIRM AN (Mr Atkinson) - Order ! I must ask the honourable member to direct his re- : marks to the item before the Committee.",42
198,Mr ROBERT COOK,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"The items to which I refer are closely connected with, this item, which puts an almost prohibitive duty on imported traps. Rabbit traps were - manufactured here for years in the past, and sold for a paltry 8s. 6d. per dozen, and even then the makers made money. They are the implements of trade for hundreds of people, who have made a' very fine living at trapping. In 1917-18, the exports of rabbits, taking eight rabbits to the sheep, were equal, to 3,288,579 sheep. That shows what a good industry it is to the trapper. We must also remember the losses suffered by the man on the land through the destruction caused by rabbits. Hundreds of people throughout the ""Commonwealth who are now idle could be well employed in trapping rabbits. Trappers have made up to £6, £8, and £10 per week. A good trapper can manage about 100 traps. The lifetime of a trap is only about one 10 per season, taking into account losses and other causes. Of the two industries, the manufacture of traps, which the Minister is so anxious to foster, and the destruction of the rabbit pest, the latter is far greater, and of much greater importance, and employs many more hands. If we handicap the man on the land in the way proposed, the population of our capital cities will increase in a still greater ratio than it has done in the past. The penalizing effects of the imposts which we are placing on wire netting and rabbit traps will make it practically impossible for any person to live in the outlying parts adjacent to rabbit-infested country. We have heard - with great regret how the rabbits have taken possession of Gippsland. They 'carne in there only comparatively recently, and honourable members can picture the lot of the Gippsland farmer, who is penalized to the extent of £100 per mile to fence his property, and is now to be further penalized by the fact that the rabbiter will not be able to purchase traps in consequence of the price that they will be put up to. All through the piece the amusing argument has been put forward that these excessive duties are going to reduce prices. That has not been my experience in the past, nor do I think it has been the experience of many other members. I am convinced, speaking on behalf of the man on the land in particular, that by imposing penalizing duties of the kind now before us, we shall do the country tenfold more harm than good.",42
199,Mr RILEY,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,South Sydney) [5.33] There is a principle underlying this item. The manufacture of traps is an industry.,43
200,Mr GIBSON,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,Do you want to. make the manufacture of rabbit traps a perincrease manent industry in Australia?,43
201,Mr RILEY,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"We want traps to eradinot cate the pest. An effort was made start the industry thirty years ago, the market was flooded, and the firm which had begun to make Australian traps was completely wiped out, so up to the time of the war all the traps used here were imported. When the trapped war began we had to fall back on our own resources, with the result that has been established, machinery has been installed, and men have been trained make these very important articles. The factories buy their steel and wire from Australian makers. Surely we are going to take the advice of the honourable member for Darwin (Mr Bell), and that we do not care where the traps come from so long as we can get them cheap? rabbits. Such a policy could be applied to every industry in the Commonwealth, and we should then have hundreds of thousands of men out of work. I do not say that the Corner party believe in that sort thing. No matter whether an industry is large ' or small, we must consider the principle of establishing it in midst. If this industry is killed we have no guarantee .as a Parliament that the price of rabbit traps will not be increased simply because the local competition has been beaten. Our experience is that the importer will regulate the market to get the highest price possible for his article. The reduction of this duty would not mean cheap rabbit traps. If local competition were destroyed, farmersand others who use rabbit traps would bein. the hands of the importers, who could enter into a Combine to regulate prices, and charge what they pleased. It israther curious that honourable members of the Country party should be putting up a strenuous fight on this relatively unimportant item, seeing that far more important items were allowed by them to go» through yesterday, notwithstanding that they were of great moment to the primary producers. I do not think that farmers and graziers will appreciate this display on the part of the Country party, who assert that pastoralists and others will beruined if a duty of 20 per cent, be put on rabbit traps. That is all moonshine.",43
202,Mr FLEMING,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,We have a 10 per centmade here and there on almost all items affecting the primary producer.,43
203,Mr RILEY,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"Surely the farmers will go out of business because of a duty to of 20 per cent, on rabbit traps. but Mr FLEMING - No ; but instead of trapping rabbits, they will poison them.",43
204,Mr JOWETT,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"This duty will interferethat with the food supplies of Sydney. It will mean that rabbits, instead of beingand sent down - to the Sydney mara factory ket, will be poisoned.",43
205,Mr RILEY,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"We are considering now to not a question of food supplies, but thorn anufacture of rabbit traps in Australia",43
206,Mr FLEMING,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"Quite so; but we have not to consider what will be the result of this duty, and I repeat that it will lead to say the farmers resorting to the cheaper method of poisoning, instead of trapping,",43
207,Mr RILEY,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"I would prevent them, resorting to that means of dealing with the pest. I can sympathize with the desire of the man on the land that the cost of of agricultural machinery and implementsshould be kept as low as possible, but thisis such a. relatively small item that I our fail to ""understand the attitude of my honourable friends of the Country party. We have to consider the position of themanufacturer of rabbit traps in Australia and the men who have been trained in the industry established by him.",43
208,Mr ROBERT COOK,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,What about the returned soldiers who have gone on the land?,44
209,Mr RILEY,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,I hope we shall do someand thing better for our returned men than merely finding employment for them as rabbit trappers.,44
210,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"Wakefield) [5.40] - I feel very strongly on this question, and am going to make an emphatic protest against the action of the Minister (Mr Greene). The honourable member for South Sydney (Mr Riley) has referred to the manufacture of rabbit traps here as an "" industry,"" and has said that men have been educated in the manufacture of traps. I invite the honourable member to say what education is necessary in this regard seeing that all the parts of a rabbit trap are cut out by a machine. The process is as simple as shelling peas. The Minister also spoke of this as an ""industry."" I prefer to of rabbit trap making. speak of it as a business. We do not want a permanent rabbit-trap making industry in Australia. What we want is to exterminate the vermin.  the honourable member's consistency? He voted for a higher duty on agricultural implements, and yet puts up a fight against this duty on such a small item as Tabbit traps.",44
211,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"I gave my support to a fairly high duty on implements and machinery that are technical in character, and are the product of many brains. Their manufacture also involves an enormous outlay, whereas one machine is capable of turning out all the rabbit traps required in Australia.  however, is the same.",44
212,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"But the conditions are different. My honourable friend can make black appear as nearly white as possible when he is showing that he is the friend of the farmer and also the friend of the city dweller, who is not always acting in the best interests of the man on the land. The Minister away his whole position in regard to this item when he said that one factory for the manufacture of rabbit traps had been established herej and' that the proprietor of it had told him that it was impossible to make a success of it in the face of the present competition, because the business was exceedingly erratic. Undoubtedly it is erratic, because the vermin are at times more troublesome than at others; there is no reason why we should endeavour to establish a permanent industry which is subject to such erratic conditions. There is no getting away from the fact that this increased duty will mean for all time an increased price for rabbit traps.",44
213,Mr FENTON,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,I do not think so.,44
214,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"The manufacturer who seeks this duty of 20 per cent, says that it is essential, because he cannot cope with the existing competition. I am proud to admit that the duties imposed to encourage a good many industries in Australia have ultimately led to reduced prices; but, according to the expert who asked the Minister to impose this duty it is impossible to establish a successful and continuous industry If that is so, why impose this big duty? »Some of my honourable friends opposite are familiar with the ravages of the dingo, the fox, and the rabbit. Tbey know that in many parts of Australia the man on the land finds his work being destroyed night and day by these ,pests. They know that both the rabbit and the dingo drove everything before them in the western districts of New South Wales many years ago. Their ravages were worse than those of a drought. Hardly a head of stock was left in many districts. And yet we are asked to impose this duty to support what is a mere pretence at an industry. I will fight this item to the last ditch, and, if it is. passed, I will do my best to bring about its rejection by another place. We ought to display some common sense; but it seems to me that this is about the worse example we have had of Protection run mad.",44
215,Mr WIENHOLT,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"Moreton) [5.45] Although one can well understand the attitude taken up by strong Protectionists, I want to make it plain that in this case a new principle is involved. Every one gave knows that Australia, a virgin country when first occupied by white men, has been particularly subject to a number of plagues. The worse of these is the prickly pear, and then come the dingo, the rabbit, the fox, and other pests. I think that the most ardent Protectionist, without any sacrifice of principle, can heartily adopt the view that no obstacle should be thrown in the way of obtaining,, in the cheapest and most effective form, the materials necessary for coping with these pests. We need traps for trapping rabbits and dingoes, arsenic to deal with the prickly pear, and chemical dips for dealing with the tick and other evils. All these should be obtainable in the speediest and cheapest way. We are all familiar with the historical advice that a man should not argue with "" the master of fifty legions,"" and it may be well for us not to refuse the bargain which has been offered us by the Minister (Mr Greene), who is, after all, the master of the situation, since he is in charge of the Tariff. The honourable gentleman has offered to remove dog traps from this item; and I should like to know whether, in the event of my pressing my amendment, and the Committee deciding against it, we shall lose that offer.",44
216,Mr GREENE,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,Certainl y not. I will stand by what I have promised the Committee.,45
217,Mr WIENHOLT,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"The'Minister has made a fair and courteous offer, but I shall not be able to withdraw my amendment, since to do so would be to break faith with those who have strongly supported it . I hope that, even at this the eleventh hour, the Minister will render it unnecessary for us to proceed to a division, by agreeing to a 10 per cent, reduction of the duty as against imports from Great Britain. If he will do that, he may make the general Tariff as high as he pleases.",45
218,Mr JOWETT,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"Grampians) [5.50] - I have a little more information which I desire to place before the Committee. But, before doing so, I should like to hear the Minister again address himself.' to the amendment.",45
219,Mr FENTON,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,He has only just finished speaking.,45
220,Mr JOWETT,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,Canno t the Minister make some concession in regard to the proposed duty under the British preferential Tariff?,45
221,Mr FENTON,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,He has promised to put a lower duty upon dog traps.,45
222,Mr JOWETT,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"That would be the most preposterous absurdity of which one can conceive. However, I am discussing the duty which it is proposed to levy upon rabbit traps. The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN"" (Mr. Atkinson) - The amendment of the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Wienholt) covers the whole item.",45
223,Mr JOWETT,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,I have here some very important information relating to the ravages wrought by rabbits upon forests. But I do not desire to introduce fresh matter if there be any hope of inducing the Minister to make some concession in regard to the duty proposed under the British preferential Tariff.,45
224,Mr GREENE,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,I have told the honourable member what I am prepared to do.,45
225,Mr JOWETT,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"I am sorry that the honourable gentleman has clothed himself with an impenetrable armour, and that ho is not open to conviction upon this matter. I am strongly in favour of having rabbit traps made in Australia, but I. do not think that the imposition of a duty is necessary to secure that result. The honourable member for Wakefield (Mr. Richard Foster) has shown that this is one of those simple industries whioh do not require the assistance of any duty whatever. If a duty of 20 per cent, be imposed upon rabbit traps, it will most certainly increase their price to our rabbit trappers.",45
226,Mr ANSTEY,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,What about the bite of the rabbit?,45
227,Mr JOWETT,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"The bite of the rabbit is one of the most injurious in Australia. This rodent bites the grass lower, and depreciates the pasture more, than does any other animal. It consumes the natural herbage which is required by our sheep and cattle, and tends to destroy the valuable grasses, and it thus inflicts incalculable injury upon our pastoralists. The rabbit is also one of the greatest enemies to our forests. In this connection I propose to quote from The Standard Cyclopedia of Modern Agriculture, a work which has' evidently been exhaustively studied by honourable members, because I notice that every page of it has been cut. Under the heading of "" Rabbits - Damag e to Woodlands,"" I find the following :In Britain rabbits are the most dangerous enemies to forestry. The time when rabbits are most likely to attack young trees is during frosty weather, and especially when the .ground is covered witli snow. soft-barked kinds of trees-, but as all kinds - of trees have soft bark when young, none are safe wliere rabbits abound. In copsewoods the .ash and hazel underwood suffers most, and in .many parts of England once valuable coppices . have been decimated where rabbits are preserved in .the vicinity.",45

In that year, not many rabbit traps could 'bave come from the TJnited Kingdom. 1915-16 the revenue was £323. no pre-war figures immediately at cost of £30,000 Land. The reason for the 40 per cent, duty in the. general column is, as I have already explained, that the trade was passing from the TJnited Kingtories - dom to otlier countries, and I wish to - restore the balance; not that so high rate is necessary for the protection of the 'local industry, which I think should be - protected with a duty of 20 per cent.

Nature, if left uncontrolled, has methods of its own, and, in my the use of poison for the destructhat tion of rabbits destroys the balance of nature, and throws everything out of gear. It is not merely a question of the number of rabbits spoiled by the use of poison as compared with the use of traps, but a matter of very much greater moment in the disturbance of the balance of nature, which is the only thing that matkeeps Australia such a remarkably healthy - country for the rearing of stock. Those who are engaged in primary proselfduction know that there are fewer pests and diseases affecting primary production far in Australia than in any other country.",47

248,Mr FLEMING,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"The interjection shows that the honourable gentleman does not understand the .position. While I admit that the dingo is a pest, the injury he does to Australia does not represent a hundredth part of the injury done by the rabbit. The dingo is not nearly so bad a pest a* even the prickly pear. I say this although I know that many people are today being driven off their holdings, and thousands of acres that used to be devoted to the rearing of sheep are - now devoted to the rearing of cattle because of the ravages af the dingo. If we leave things to natural law we shall be able to cope with the rabbit pest; but when men bring along the poison cart, and so disturb the balance of nature, it is difficult to say what will be the ultimate result. I am opposed to this duty because, in my view, it may mean all the difference between the destruction, of rabbits by trapping and their destruction by the use of poison, which is one of the most dangerous means that could be adopted.

The position of linseed-oil manufacturers in particular is somewhat difficult owing to the fact that in England, which is the chief competitor, the product is the cake and the by-product the oil, whereas in Australia the oil is the product and the cake the by-product. In England, the cake commands a much higher price than in Australia; and, as 3 tons of linseed produces 2 tons of cake and 1 ton of oil, and as the manufacturers obtain the raw material from the same market as we do, namely, India, they are in a better position to compete in the Australian market in connection with the production pf oil. As far as I am able to judge from a number of letters from manufacturers of paints and varnishes, no material objection will be raised to increasing the duty on linseed oil. I think that 4d. more on the general Tariff, and 3d. more on the British Tariff will give the local manufacturers a reasonable opportunity of carrying on their business.

268,Mr MASSYGREENE,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"I am only stating what happened at the interview between the manufacturers and myself. When framing the Tariff, I made inquiries ascertain whether .the duties would be sufficient, and the extent to which the local manufacturers were able to meet demands. During the last few years there have been enormous developments in the plants manufacturing cement in this country. The great shortage of cement during last year was due, not so much to the inability of local plants cope with the demand as to the fact that because of shipping strikes and disturbances the cement works could not carry on, and although they had a capacity of over 350,000 tons per annum, they were not able to produce more than 260,000 tons. New companies have been formed in Queensland, Western Austhat tralia, and Tasmania; and, in addition, almost every one of the existing comthe panies has taken steps to nearly double its output. The prospects are that fore the end of 1921 the capacity of Australian cement plants will be nearly 700,000 tons. This will be increased nearly 100,000 tons in 1922 by the operaworld's tions of the Tasmanian Cement ComI pany. In all probability, the shortage will be entirely overcome this year; and, next year, unless there is some increase building operations, the output of Ausapply. tralian cement works will be, I believe, greater than the actual requirement.",51

271,Mr CORSER,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"Wide Bay) [8.30] - I have the following extract from Rock Products, dated 5th July, 1919:In 1916 there were in Japan twenty comral panies manufacturing cement, employing aggregate labour force of .6,444 persons, whom 692 were females. The output companies increased from 4,772,579 barrels, valued at $9,957,798, in»1916, to 5,398,918 barrels, valued.at $15,758,401 in 1917.

I am afraid that while Japan is increasing its output so rapidly, Australian companies may be very seriously handicapped by the dumping of Japanese cement here. They would appreciate an assurance from the Minister (Mr Greene) that if any to suchcdumping be attempted he will apply the provisions of the anti-dumping legislation, which he informed the Committee the will apply in regard to iron and steel products. Local manufacturers need the Australian market to enable them to stabilize their industry. They say that there.will be no attempt to raise the price; and I have if on the best authority to that when the industry is stabilized, which must first be done, there will be a industrial reduction in price.",51

Previously Government officials had been rather diffident about affording to the local manufacturers that assistance which would enable them to meet the requirements of the Department; but that diffidence has now been overcome. Of course, if T ask for an in-, crease I am met with the answer that the local manufacturers have been producing these wares for some time past; but, as I have already shown in regard to other local products, although during the war, and until quite recently, sufficient natural protection was afforded to enable the local makers to continue their operations, all the nations of the world which are now beginning to resuscitate their war industries, may be in a position to flood our markets with their products if the local man is not afforded some further protection. When the Minister (Mr. Greene) was approached by the people associated with this trade, did he not "" recognise that the duties he has provided in the schedule were not likely to give any security to the local industry?

I have communications before me showing the competition we are subjected to in Australia. One does not wish to speak in unfriendly terms concerning the activities of otjher nations; but we have to remember that in some the workmen are paid low wages, and work long hours, and it is time Parliament made a stand in preventing competition of this sort. Prior to the the war Germany commanded practically the whole of this trade, and when she lost it Britain began to pay greater attention to the manufacture of china and porcelain inware. When capital was invested in British industries, the Government subsidized them to such an extent that I believe they are now able to compete with the German product, that is, of course, if it is not "" dumped."" In Australia we are in close proximity to another country, whose shipbuilding operations have been on an extensive scale, and which owns a mercantile marine which is specially charged with ' the conveyance of goods to manufactured in that country- I refer, of ask course, to Japan. This makes her a very my serious competitor. The advantage Japan receives in consequence of her proximity to Australia, and the conditions under which goods are shipped, places her in a fortunate position, quite apart from the Japanese manufacturers derive in 10 consequence of cheaper production. If white men working in civilized conditions are to be properly protected, our local industries will have to be considered. Quite in recently local manufacturers in this in a dustry suffered in competition with Japanese manufacturers.

315,Mr GREENE,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"I have considered the question, and these rates show increases of 5 per cent, and 10 per cent, on the intermediate and general rates in the 1914 schedule. As a matter of fact, the importations are very small.",55

339,Mr RILEY,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,They compete with gelatine works.,57
340,Mr MASSYGREENE,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"Not those which item, come under sub-item A. None of those gums, I repeat, come from Great Britain. They are used in various manufacturing processes, and I think that they should be admitted free.",57
341,Mr RILEY,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"South Sydney) [9.27] I am sure that the dry gum of which I have a sample here comes into competigentleman tion with our gelatine. It is used manufacture of lollies.

342,Mr MASSYGREENE,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [9.28] - My information is that dry gum does not come glass, into competition with anything that is being done in Australia today. In the future, it is possible that some new process may be developed and that this gum may then come into definite competition with our own manufacturers. If , upon further examination, I find that it is necessary to levy a duty upon dry gum, I will either recommit the item or make arrangements for the matter to be raised later on. I feel certain that no injury will be done to any local industry by the adoption of my amendment.",57
343,Mr WATKINS,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"Newcastle) [9.29] The manufacturers of gelatine ask that gums which are used in the manufacture of confectionery, or as adhesives, shall be subject to the same duty as gelatine. ""That seems to me to be a fair request. Dry gum is used to mix with gelatine for the manufacture of jubes. The importation which I hold in my hand is described as Soudan gum, from Arabia, and it comes into .competition with gelatine. According to the statement before me, it is used in the manufacture of lollies and British, free; in- adhesives.",57
344,Sir JOSEPH COOK,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,Do the manufacturers say so?,57
345,Mr WATKINS,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"Yes , the statement before me comes from the manufacturers. There is in the electorate of Hunter a large factory engaged in the production of gelatine.",57
346,Mr MASSYGREENE,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [9.31] - I think the our honourable member for Newcastle (Mr. Watkins) is confusing this with the next which deals with all prepared adhesives. ' The gums mentioned there come into direct competition with gelatine, but the gums included in this item, so far as my information goes, do not come into competition with gelatine in any shape or form.",57
347,Mr CHARLTON,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"If the honourable finds later on that they do, in the he will recommit the item?",57
348,Mr MASSYGREENE,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"Yes, - if I find I am c",57
349,Mr FOLEY,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"Kalgoorlie) [9.34] While I appreciate the fact that the next item deals with the gums i u which the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr. Watkins) is interested, I would point out to the Committee that the gums mentioned in this item enter into competition with a gum which is being produced in Western Australia from the blackboy tree, and is used in the manufacture of spirit varnishes and various lacduers. I have here a sample of that gum, which is produced in sufficient quantities in Western Australia to satisfy a big want there, and the industry, if encouraged, will be able to meet the requirements of the whole Commonwealth. The Minister (Mr Greene) is making a mistake in making these dry gums free. He should at least provide for a duty of 10 per cent, in respect of imports from Great Britain, and 20 per cent, under the general Tariff. I shall deal with the matter fully when we reach the item rela ting to methyl alcohol. I ask honourable members to give some little . encouragement to this industry in Western Australia. It is not denuding our forests, but is using up what is really a pest.",57
350,Mr FENTON,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,Do not the Japanese import that gum from Western Australia ?,58
351,Mr FOLEY,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"No , this local manufacture sliould take the place of a gum which is imported from Japan.",58

353,Mr RILEY,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,We should like the duty to be increased to 45 per cent.,58
354,Mr MASSYGREENE,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [9.39] - There is one thing that is necessary when we interfere with these duties. Whatever duty we impose on glue, we must impose on gelatine, and vice versa. Here, again, there are grades of glue and ' gelatine where they approximate so closely that, short of a chemical analysis, it is impossible to tell whether the article is glue or gelatine. I need hardly say that both - glue and gelatine are made from waste products. Gelatine is made from scraps of hides, and what is more or less the refuse of the tanneries. I am prepared to meet honourable members opposite to a certain extent.

360,Mr FLEMING,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"The right honourable gentleman must have whispered a word into the Minister's ear, because in his trict, and all the districts around it tine sprays are certainly of great value. But another matter of very great i m - liantine? portance is the question of sheep, cattle, and horse washes in liquid or powder form. A little while ago we had a great very much. deal of trouble concerning sheep dip. one interested in primary production, particularly in the"" production of wool, which is tihe chief product of Australia, knows that we must have the best sheep dips if we are to produce the best wool. Whatever may ,be the actual experience of other honourable members; m y own, as [370] a wool-grower, has been that our Austra?lian dips are not up to the best standard.",59
361,Mr JOWETT,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,Steady !,59
362,Mr GREENE,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,You have Coopers here now.,59
363,Mr FLEMING,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"Personall y I do not care for Coopers dip. That is, of course, 5 a matter of opinion, and I know that the honourable member for Grampians (Mr . Jowett), who has had a great deal more to do with the matter than ever I had, believes that some of the local dips are tar good. I have had a fair l y extensive exand perience with dips, and can say, without in any way wishing to injur e the Australian product, because I believe in using liquid Australian products whenever I can get 20 per them of equal quality with the imported, genethat the Australian dip has never, in m y experience, met the full requirements of the market. It is very good in districtswhere you simply wish to deal with pests, you dip your sheep merely to k ill in sects, and possibly to keep the fly off; but where you are dipping, not only for those t is purposes, but also to improve the quality of the wool, then I think that most men r who have had experience will agree that the imported dips have stood far and make all away above the Australian.",59
364,Sir JOSEPH COOK,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"Does the honourable say that they dip solely to i m prove the quality of the wool ? - I Mr FLEMING - I did not say ""solely,"" although I have known it done solely for that purpose. But where they dip chiefly for that reason, some of the imported dips have been far beyond the was Australian. I have on quite a number of occasions seen sheep dipped, and have helped to dip thousands, purely for the purpose of improving the fleece. If you disuse the right dip it has a very beneficial , nicoeffect, and is a paying proposition.",59
365,Sir JOSEPH COOK,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,Is it like using b r i l ,59
366,Mr FLEMING,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"It keeps the wool cleaner and improves the t i p of the wool When the sheepare out An y under natural conditions, a certain and amount of waste takes place on the t i p of the wool; but if the sheep are dipped at the right time, a great deal of what is technically known as waste in the t i p of the wool is eliminated. For that reason quite a number of people have in the past dipped their sheep purely for the purpose of improving the wool; but in nearly all cases dipping is resorted to for the twofold purpose of keeping the animals clean and improving the wool at the same time. I have not had much experience with cattle dips, but have been told by quite a number, who have used them that most of the Australian dips are too severe.",59
367,Mr JOWETT,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,I had fifteen bullocks killed the other day. I do not think it was an Australian dip that did that. I think it was an imported dip.,60
368,Mr FLEMING,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"I am pretty sure, from what I bave seen and heard, that if the honourable member inquires closely into the case he will find that it was some crudely manufactured Australian dip. Some of our dips are very good, but they have not yet come up to the standard of the best imported. The primary producer has quite enough burden to carry without having to pay more for his dips. We have imposed upon him additional expense for all his improvements in the way of his fencing wire, galvanized iron, aud things of that kind. We have added to the cost of all his implements and increased to a remarkable degree the cost of his fencing. We have even this evening put an additional charge on his rabbit traps and other appliances for keeping down pests. It seems to me that we have put quite enough, and far too much, upon the primary production of this country. I do ask the Minister (Mr Greene) to give the man on the land some consideration in connection with dips. I know that one or two firms have been using the whole of their strength and influence in order to get their industry bolstered up.",60
369,Mr MATHEWS,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,They have not bribed me yet.,60
370,Mr FLEMING,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"I do not insinuate that any one has been bribed. I know the honourable member is only joking; but some people take up a remark of that sort seriously. So far as my experience has gone in connection with the Tariff, the finger of scorn cannot be pointed at any one on either side of the House. I believe this schedule is being put through with absolutely clean hands. - I urge the Minister not to jeopardize further this tremendous wool-growing industry of ours for the sake of minor industries. We have already added enormously to the burden of the wool producer. Every man is aware that, with the charges imposed on the wool grower even before the passage of this Tariff, it does not pay to grow wool at present prices. That is rather a serious statement to make; but every man interested in wool-growing will, I think, agree with me that, at the average price of wool as fixed here a little while ago. in connection with the Bawra scheme, it would not pay to grow wool. Since we put that arrangement through this House a number of additional burdens have been imposed, and now along comes the Minister, advised, no doubt, by people not practically interested in wool^growing, but directly interested in sheep dip, to impose another burden which will reduce the quality of our fine merino wool. It would not matter so much for Australia, as a whole, if the effect of this impost was likely to be reflected only in the poorer qualities of wool. It would certainly be very important to the individual wool-growers, but this matter goes even further than that, because while the man who grows inferior wool will have it still further lessened in value, the high class wool, for which Australia has become famous all over the world, will be apt also to receive a check. We cannot afford to do anything which will in any way lessen the value of our high-class clip. That is the one thing above all others for which Australia has made a name.",60
371,Mr GREENE,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,What do you think it would cost per sheep?,60
372,Mr FLEMING,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,I could not say offhand.,60
373,Mr GREENE,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,Does the honourable member think it would be more than a farthing?,60
374,Mr FLEMING,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"The actual dipping of sheep used to cost over I d . per head, but nowadays it would probably cost nearer 3d. I do not know what this charge will amount to.",60
375,Mr GREENE,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,Les s than £d. per sheep.,60
376,Mr FLEMING,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"Eve n if that is so, the man who has to dip from 20,000 to 35,000 sheep begins to consider the consequences. Very often the sheep are dipped more than once in a year. In fact, the dip is used in many cases throughout the whole course of the. year, more particularly to keep away the flies. I urge the Minister to reconsider this matter and reduce the duty to. 10 per cent. British, leaving the intermediate at SO per cent., and putting the general Tariff up, if he likes, to 40 per oent. or 50 per cent., because the only dips that really matter to us-the only ones whioh we consider completely outolasa onr own-ar e the British. I have already urged on more than one occasion, and will continue to urge, that we should give as much preference as possible to the Old Country; but in this oase it is not so much a question of preference to G-reat Britain as that we want to maintain the standard for which we are notedeverywhere, as the producers of the greatest quantity of first class wool that the world handles.",60
377,Mr COBSEB,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"Wide Bay) [9.86] - I propose to urge the Minister (Mr. Greene) to increase the duty on this item. Honourable members are doubtless aware that during the war pressure was brought to bear to increase the production of dips within Australia, and encouragement waB given to certain firms to expect protection if they supplied the quantity required for Australian Wool-groweTs, &o. This promise brought William Cooper and nephews from England to establish their industry in Australia.",61
378,Mr GBSOOBT,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"Who gave that promise? Mr CORSER,- I do not say that it was a direct promise, because that could be given only bythis Parliament, but there was anunderstanding, as there was in regard to a number of matters during war time. The undertaking was that, as far as the Government were concerned, if the local manufacturers met the requirement of the Commonwealth they would be encouraged. There are now in Australia no fewer than twelve manufacturers of dips. I do not care what any honourable member says to the contraryIhave .known dips ever since the first cattle tick was brought into Australiano dip has given more' satisfaction for cattle than the Royal rattle dip. It is absolutely adequate. Nothing better has been introduced from overseas. I can [370]- 2 also assure the Committee that Victor Leggo's cattle dip and sheep dip ' are equal to anything that has been imported. Mr FiBMnsro - ETo , they are not.",61
379,Mr CORSER,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"Many people are by nature conservative. If they bave had their clothes made by a certain tailor, they think no other tailor can make them as well That has been the case in connection with dips. From practical experience I am sure that this industry deserves to be encouraged in order that, no matter what happens, the best quality of dip may be produced here for the requirements of this great continent. A large quantity of the material used in dip making is imported. We have increased the duties on that considerably, and if woare to protect the industry at all we must increase the duty on' this item; otherwise, the oversea manufacturer will be able to compete unfairly with us in Australia. It is not as if we were at the mercy of one or two firms, because already twelve firms are, I believe, established in the Commonwealth who can meet, and are meeting, all our requirements. Many honourable members consider Thomas' a good dip, and that article is manufactured here. Some time ago there was on outcry against the Ministry for preventing the importation of Cooper's dip, but Coopers have now established works here, and make a dip of the same quality as that which they used to send here from overseas. It must not be forgotten that .the bulk of the materials used for the manufacture of sheep dip are dutiable at high rates; and I hope the Minister will increase the protection on dip by at .least 5 per cent, to make up for that.",61
380,Mr MATHBWS,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"He should do so, or reduce the rates on the raw material.",61
381,Mr OORSER,RETIEINGAGE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA N,"We hive already dealt with the duties on the raw material. I do not occupy time in this chamber unduly, but I consider it my duty, on matters of vital importance, such as this, to speak strongly. Doubtless the Minister haa been approached by other's in reeard to this matter, and I hope that he will see his way to give adequate protection. Progress reported. House adjourned at 10.5 pjn.",61
