WOMEN'S EXHIBITION RIFLE MATCHES.",14
1,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Minister of Defence, without - notice, whether he is aware of the series of rifle matches at present being conducted at the Women's Exhibition, in which women are their letters. showing such remarkable proficiency With the Francotte and Winchester rifles, that not a single shot had been fired off the during two days, whilst in many cases the possible has been made; and whether, view of these facts, he will give the women of Australia an opportunity of perfecting themselves in rifle-shooting?",14
2,Mr EWING,Unknown,"I shall be glad to do anything that will further the laudable end which the honourable member has in view. The questions of method will require very special considerations. TASMANIAN"" MAILS.",14
3,Mr STORRER,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Postmaster-General, without notice"", a question relating to the delivery of Tasmanian mails to the members of this House. I may explain that members of Parliament have at various times encountered great difficulty in getting their letters. Last Saturday week I telephoned down to the General Post Office to inquire why our mails had not been delivered. I telephoned twice, but I did not get my letters until Monday, although they arrived in Melbourne at 9 o'clock on the Saturday morning. To-day, I suppose, the steamer arrived at her usual time- 9 o'clock thismorning. I tried to get a telephone message through to the General Post Office, ' but could not succeed. The mail has not yet been delivered. I ask now, as I cannot get any satisfaction . elsewhere% although I telephoned to the Deputy Postmaster-General-whethe r the Postmaster General will take this matter in hand himself, and see that we, who are members of Parliament, are not placed at a.great disadvantage because we happen' to meet in this place?",14
4,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"I have taken every pos- ' sible step to facilitate the delivery of mails to honourable members. As you are aware, Mr Speaker, I have arranged for a box to kept at the office, and for a messenger to go down to get mails every hour and for bring them up to Parliament House.",14
5,Mr STORRER,Unknown,Apparentl y he does not do it.,14
6,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"That is not. my fault. I can only put the machinery in motion, and do my best to see that arrangements are carried out. I will confer with Mr. Speaker, and ascertain why the arrangement has not been observed. I will certainly do all that I can to afford every, possible facility to honourable members to get",14
7,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I desire to say, in justice to the officer concerned, that I have target just now asked the Serjeant-at-Arms whether the letters were sent for as usual in today, and he tells me that they were. NA DUTIES.",14
8,Mr GLYNN,DUPLICATION OF CUSTOMS,"I wish to ask the Minister of Tradeand Customs a question, without notice, whether he is aware of a duplication of Customs duties under which sardines are taxed at id. per lb., when imported in oil, whilst if they happen to be imported smoke.d, they are also taxed ^d. per lb. as smoked fish? I wish to inquire whether the principle of duplication, which is certainly an anomaly in the case of sardines, runs throughout the Tariff?",15
9,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DUPLICATION OF CUSTOMS,"There are liound to be certain anomalies in connection with a Tariff covering so many items, and I am glad to have such instances pointed out, so that I may take steps to remove them. RABBIT EXTERMINATION .",15
10,Mr THOMAS BROWN,DUPLICATION OF CUSTOMS,"I desire to ask the Treasurer a question, without notice. I gather that he has received a report from' Dr Tidswell respecting the rabbit extermination experiments in New South Wales. I desire to know whether any representations have been made to him with a view of giving those interested in the result of the experiments, information as to the nature of them ? Has the Government come to any decision as to its future attitude regarding the matter?.",15
11,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DUPLICATION OF CUSTOMS,"In reply to the honourable member's question, I desire to state that those interested have not approached me- I do not know whether they have approached the Prime Minister-re f arding the matter to which he has reerred. I think the honourable member must mean experiments on the mainland - CADET RIFLES. I saw something about the matter in the press, but I have not been approached. As regards future action regarding these experiments of Dr Danysz, I . intended to see the Prime Minister this morning in order to learn what course it was proposed by the Government to take, but was not able to do so. My own feeling is that the experiments ought 'not to be repeated on the mainland.",15
12,Mr CHANTER,DUPLICATION OF CUSTOMS,"Arisin g out of the question asked by the honourable member for Calare, I desire to refer to a previous question asked by myself. It may be remembered that I asked whether inquiries had been made respecting the attempted introduction of a rabbit disease into Australia, and whether the Government would ascertain the name of the New South Wales sheep breeder who had attempted to introduce the disease ? I . may say that I have very grave doubts whether the gentleman-whos e name many of us knowhas not surreptitiously introduced into Australia a rabbit disease which, if it spread amongst our sheep, might be calamitous. I press the Prime Minister to obtain further particulars if he can. In the meantime, I wish to ask the honourable gentleman whether he will obtain the name of the pastoralist who was on the steamer Moana, having with him .the germs of a rabbit disease that he was bringing into Australia, which germs were seized and thrown overboard by a.steward? It is a serious matter to Australia, and I hope that the Minister will cause the most careful inquiries to be made.",15
13,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DUPLICATION OF CUSTOMS,"The inquiries that I have instituted so far have not been successful. I recognise, however, that the matter is a very serious one, and lhat if anything of the kind has occurred we should endeavour to sheet it home to the offender.",15
14,Mr HUTCHISON,DUPLICATION OF CUSTOMS,"I wish to ask the Treasurer whether, seeing thar Dr Tidswell's report on Dr Danysz experiments has been orderedfo be printed, he will direct that the last report supplied by the South Australian Commissioners, Dr Johnson and Mr Giddings, is also published ?",15
15,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DUPLICATION OF CUSTOMS,"I shall consult the Prime Minister, in whose Department, I think, the papers to which the honourable member has. referred are at the present time.",15
16,Mr HENRY WILLIS,DUPLICATION OF CUSTOMS,"I desire to ask the Minister of Defence, without notice, whether he will state what kind of rifle is being supplied to theCadets at the present time, and whether it is his intention to supply them in future with a heavier rifle than they are now using?",15
17,Mr EWING,DUPLICATION OF CUSTOMS,"The Senior Cadets are using the .303 rifle, which is the same as is used by our troops so far as ""weight is concerned. The Francotte rifle is used by Cadets in Victoria. The rifle that is used by Cadets in New South Wales is the Westley-Richards. I may also inform the honourable member that the English military authorities have been considering a suitable rifle for Cadets. .We have a sample here, and it may be'possible for us to adopt it , and so provide a uniform rifle throughout Australia. However, I am not quite sure at present. DUTIESON PAPER.",15
18,Mr MAHON,DUPLICATION OF CUSTOMS,"I wish to ask the Treaand, surer, without notice, whether, before the the sale? duties on paper are discussed by the Committee of Ways and Means, he will favour the House with a return showing the duties collected on paper .since the imposition the new Tariff ? I desire to know tity of, value of, and revenue collected .upon paper taken out of bond since the new Tariff came into operation.",16
19,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DUPLICATION OF CUSTOMS,"In reply to the honourable member's question, I have to state that I shall confer with the Comptroller of Customs, with a view to obtain the information which the honorrats? able member desires. I will give House as soon as I receive it . INTER - STA TE TELEPHONE SERVICE : DECREAS E OE",16
20,Mr HENRY WILLIS,DUPLICATION OF CUSTOMS,I wish to ask the Postmaster-General whether the reported falling-off in the revenue from the lntej State telephone service is due to its being impossible to carry on a conversation between Melbourne and Sydney through any of the suburban telephone bureaux?,16
21,Mr DEAKIN,DUPLICATION OF CUSTOMS,It is quite possible.,16
22,Mr HENRY WILLIS,DUPLICATION OF CUSTOMS,"H a v in g tried recently, without success, to establish communication between Melbourne and Sydney through a local telephone bureau, I thought that the falling-off in the revenue might be due to a similar want of success on the part of others. Will the Postmaster General cause inquiries to be made, and make a statement on the subject?",16
23,Mr MAUGER,DUPLICATION OF CUSTOMS,"Arrangement s can be made to be connected - with the local bureaux. All that is necessary is to leave a deposit either at the central or the local office with which ""it is desired to be connected.",16
24,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DUPLICATION OF CUSTOMS,That point.,16
25,Mr HENRY WILLIS,DUPLICATION OF CUSTOMS,Will master-General look into the matter?,16

OFFICALS. - Mr CHANTER - I wish to ask the Postmaster-General whether it is true, as reported in the press, that postal officials in Adelaide have been supplied with helmets made in China.",16
31,Mr MAUGER,SEIZU RE OF TREACLE AS,"I find that the Deputy Postmaster-General of South Australia, in the exercise of powers recently delegated to him, has accepted a tender, through the State Tender Board, for the supply of a certain number of helmets manufactured in China. I ' have issued instructions that the order shall be cancelled, and that the Deputy Postmaster-General shall be asked on what authority a tender was accepted under such conditions.",16
32,Mr BATCHELOR,SEIZU RE OF TREACLE AS,"I wish to know under whose instructions the Deputy Postmaster-General of South Australia accepted the tender through the State Tender Board, and whether there is not a Government policy with regard to the use of locally-made articles ?.",16
33,Mr MAUGER,SEIZU RE OF TREACLE AS,"There is a very clear Government policy in the direction menis not the tioned by the honourable member. Our policy and also, I believe, the regulations the Posthave been distinctly violated.",16
34,Mr HUTCHISON,SEIZU RE OF TREACLE AS,Who issued the in to the Deputy Postmaster General ?,16
35,Mr MAUGER,SEIZU RE OF TREACLE AS,"Wit h a view to carrying out the policy of. decentralization, a number of duties have been delegated to the Deputy Postmasters-General. It has been urged that too much of the work of the Department is concentrated in the central office, and one of - the unfortunate results of our efforts to remove that cause of complaint is that the Deputy Postmaster-General at Adelaide has misunderstood the policy of the Commonwealth, as well as his instructions-, and himself and the State Tender Board intp trouble. TEMPORARY LETTER CARRIERS, WESTERN AUSTRALIA.",17
36,Mr FOWLER,SEIZU RE OF TREACLE AS,"Will the Postmaster General cause inquiries to be made as to the correctness of the statement made in the Western Australian press, that temporary letter carriers are being paid in that State at the rate of 3s. 46. per day, and, if he finds the report to be correct, put an end to the system?",17
37,Mr MAUGER,SEIZU RE OF TREACLE AS,"The employment of temporary letter carriers at the rate named is contrary, not only to the regulations, to the Public Service Act, and instructions that have been issued. If it be found on inquiry that the statement is correct, an order will be issued that the practice shall be at once stopped. COMMONWEALTH. OFFICES IN LONDON.",17
38,Mr HENRY WILLIS,SEIZU RE OF TREACLE AS,Will the Prime Minister inform the House whether final arrangements have yet been made with the London County Council for a site for the proposed Commonwealth Offices in London ?,17
39,Mr DEAKIN,SEIZU RE OF TREACLE AS,"Our offer is still before the London County Council, arid we expect early to receive an answer. SATURDAY SITTINGS.",17
40,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SEIZU RE OF TREACLE AS,Will the Prime Minister state whether it is his intention to ask the House to sit on Saturday? I seek the information at this stage so that we may make our arrangements accordingly.,17
41,Mr DEAKIN,SEIZU RE OF TREACLE AS,"My honourable colleague the Treasurer hopes that the progress made with the Tariff will be such as to render it unnecessary to ask the House to meet on Saturday; but if it is not, he trusts that honourable members will be prepared to meet on that day. TARIFF. NA AND BUTTER BOXES - EXEMPTIO N OF HAT - MI LL MACHINERY.",17
42,Mr WH IRVINE,REBATE OF DUTY ON TIMBER FOR FRUIT,"Revertin g to a question which I put to the Minister of Trade and Customs some time ago in regard to a rebate of the duty on timber used for the making of butter boxes and fruit cases, I wish to know whether the got Minister will explain how it is proposed to make ""the rebate practically available to those whom it is intended to reach?",17
43,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,REBATE OF DUTY ON TIMBER FOR FRUIT,"As I informed the honourable member for Cowper yesterday, the whole matter is now receiving attention, and we hope to be able to make arrangements that will be satisfactory to all concerned.",17
44,Mr BRUCE SMITH,REBATE OF DUTY ON TIMBER FOR FRUIT,"I wish to ask the Prime Minister, as a matter of Victorian fiscal history, when there first appeared in the Tariff of this State a provision that a refund of the duty paid on hat-mill machinery should be made as but soon as that machinery was established in a factory? As the honourable gentleman is aware, under the new Tariff, machinery for the hat-making industry, has been entirely differentiated from the machinery required for other industries, and I understand that the exemption which appeared in the Tariff of 1902, as introduced by the right honourable member for Adelaide, was simply a continuation of a Victorian practice.",17
45,Mr DEAKIN,REBATE OF DUTY ON TIMBER FOR FRUIT,I was not even aware that such a practice existed. The only case that I can recall of a refund of dutybeing granted by the Victorian Parliament related to machinery required for a papermill at Geelong.,17
46,Mr BRUCE SMITH,REBATE OF DUTY ON TIMBER FOR FRUIT,That was an exceptional case?,17
47,Mr DEAKIN,REBATE OF DUTY ON TIMBER FOR FRUIT,It was. I was not aware that there had been any other.,17
48,Mr BRUCE SMITH,REBATE OF DUTY ON TIMBER FOR FRUIT,"Does the Prime Minister know' of any reason why there should be a duty of 20 per cent, on mining machinery, while machinery for hat mills is exempt?",17
49,Mr SPEAKER,REBATE OF DUTY ON TIMBER FOR FRUIT,"Order . The matter to which the honourable member has now referred on two occasions is one for the consideration of the Committee of Ways and Means when dealing with the Tariff, and it would be quite improper for me to allow an explanation of it to be asked of the Prime Minister, or for the Prime Minister to comply with such a request.",17
50,Mr BRUCE SMITH,REBATE OF DUTY ON TIMBER FOR FRUIT,"The Prime Minister may, for reasons of health, be unable to be present when the Tariff is being discussed, and, therefore, I may not have the opportunity suggested to appeal to him as one familiar with the fiscal history of Victoria to tell us why this exemption, for which, so far as I know, nobody knows the reason, has been transferred from the State Parliament of Victoria to the Federal Parliament.",18
51,Mr SPEAKER,REBATE OF DUTY ON TIMBER FOR FRUIT,That circumstance would not alter the rule to which I have referred.,18
52,Mr CHANTER,REBATE OF DUTY ON TIMBER FOR FRUIT,"Arisin g out of the question asked by the honourable member for Parkes, I wish to ask the Prime Minister if he has noticed the statement which appeared in the Age of this morning claiming that the Federal Tariff has resulted in prosperity to New South Wales by leading to the investment of ^3,000.000 in various manufacturing industries in that State?",18
53,Mr SPEAKER,REBATE OF DUTY ON TIMBER FOR FRUIT,Order !,18
54,Mr CHANTER,REBATE OF DUTY ON TIMBER FOR FRUIT,I am leading up to a question.,18
55,Mr SPEAKER,REBATE OF DUTY ON TIMBER FOR FRUIT,It appears very clear to me that the honourable member for Riverina is anxious to get in some information which should certainly not be conveyed in the form of a question.,18
56,Mr CHANTER,REBATE OF DUTY ON TIMBER FOR FRUIT,I wished to ask whether the Prime Minister will send a telegram on the subject to New South Wales ?,18
57,Mr SPEAKER,REBATE OF DUTY ON TIMBER FOR FRUIT,The honourable member did not ask that question.,18
58,Mr CHANTER,REBATE OF DUTY ON TIMBER FOR FRUIT,I was going to ask it.,18
59,Mr SPEAKER,REBATE OF DUTY ON TIMBER FOR FRUIT,"The honourable member evidently was more anxious to get in a particular statement, which was not in order in the form of a question.",18
60,Mr CHANTER,REBATE OF DUTY ON TIMBER FOR FRUIT,"I ask whether the Prime Minister will send a telegram, through you, sir, on behalf of the House congratulating New South Wales on the increase of her industrial, prosperity since Federation was accomplished?",18
61,Mr DEAKIN,REBATE OF DUTY ON TIMBER FOR FRUIT,I shall probably have another opportunity to communicate - on this and other matters.,18
62,Mr FOWLER,REBATE OF DUTY ON TIMBER FOR FRUIT,"I ask the Prime Minister, without notice, if, when he is sending his telegram to the Premier of New South Wales congratulating the State",18
63,Mr DEAKIN,REBATE OF DUTY ON TIMBER FOR FRUIT,I did not propose to send a telegram.,18
64,Mr FOWLER,REBATE OF DUTY ON TIMBER FOR FRUIT,I understood that the honourable gentleman proposed to comply with the request of the honourable member for Riverina.,18
65,Mr DEAKIN,REBATE OF DUTY ON TIMBER FOR FRUIT,I pointed out that there might besome other opportunity.,18
66,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,REBATE OF DUTY ON TIMBER FOR FRUIT,Does the honourable member wish a similar telegram to be sent to Western Australia ?,18
67,Mr FOWLER,REBATE OF DUTY ON TIMBER FOR FRUIT,"I wish to ask the Prime Minister whether, should he comply with the request of the honourable member for Riverina, he will not also send a telegram to the Premier of Western Australia, regretting that the Tariff submitted by the present Government will inflict serious injury upon that State?",18
68,Mr SPEAKER,REBATE OF DUTY ON TIMBER FOR FRUIT,Order ! That question cannot be answered. NA STAMPS.,18
69,Mr HENRY WILLIS,UNIFORM COMMONWEALTH,"I ask the Fostmaster-General, without notice, . whether orders have been given for the printing of the proposed uniform Commonwealth stamps, and, if so, whether they are to be printed in Melbourne?",18
70,Mr MAUGER,UNIFORM COMMONWEALTH,We have not yet reached that stage. We have yet to call for designs. NA SYDNEY AND BRISBANE.,18

76,Sir JOHN FORREST,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,I very much question that. I do not think that is the legal position.,19

In this.connection I wish to the refer honourable members to a voluntary made to the Tariff Commission by Mr Harrington, of Walker's, Limited. He was one of the principal witnesses exthe amined in Queensland, and he appeared the Commission, asking for high duties. The only reference to portable engines is in the statement of this witness. Honourable members will find it at page 2188 of the Minutes of Evidence, wherein a duty of 33J per cent, is reMr Harrington, not on crossitem. examination, but voluntarily, said I would go even so far as to strike out my request in relation to traction and portable engines, because I do not wish to trench upon the agricultural industry. The witness came before the Commission asking for protective duties, but he felt, as every honourable member here must feel, that if the duties as proposed by the Treasurer were imposed they would press severely on the agricultural and mining industries so far as traction engines are concerned. He voluntarily suggested that those machines should come in free. In the interests of the agricultural and mining industries [ suggest, to the Committee that both traction and portable engines should be to put on the free list. Traction engines are used for the carriage of ore in many parts of the Commonwealth. They are not made here.",19

92,Sir JOHN QUICK,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,"In support of a - duty of 25 per cent, all round, I should like to read a quotation from evidence given in Queensland by Mr James - Ford Pearson, engineer of Walker's Limited. Maryborough, one of the biggest foundries in Australia. On page 2209 of the once, Minutes of Evi'dence appears the follow8 ingDo you think you could turn out traction gines on the same scale as John Fowler and of Leeds?- I have turned out several, though they have not been altogether as highly painted up as are Fowler's engines, they - done practically the same work. Have you turned out the engines at as low a - cost as Fowler's?-No . VVe get a bigger price, because our engines are made to perform - woik. How much more do you get relitively?About 15 to 16 per cent. more. Can you explain why the Clyde Engineering Company did not ask for duty upon traction engines?-Because Mr Noake their manager, is the agent for Messrs. Fowler and Co. I should also like to draw attention to a passage in our report as followsVVe have been informed that the firm of J. Renshaw and Co., of Queen's Bridge-street, South Melbourne, has lately built some six horsepower portable engines for the Victorian Mining Department equally as pood as, but at a cost of about 15 per cent, more than, imported engines of the same type. The Austral Otis Engineering Co. has built several portable engines in sizes up to 12 horse-power. At present, the same company is constructing two heavy earthscooping traction engines, each of 80 horsepower, and each to cost ^1,200. These machines can be made here, and would form an important addition to the iron trade of the country.",20
93,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,Did the Commission take any other evidence regarding the quality of traction engines alleged to be made in Queensland?,20
94,Sir JOHN QUICK,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,"I know nothing more than what the engineer says-that The they were substantially equal to the imported, but a little higher in price.",20
95,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,Would the honourable member regard that as conclusive evidence in a Court of law?,20
96,Sir JOHN QUICK,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,"I am now dealing with the practicability of manufacturing these engines in Australia, and showing that it is all moonshine to say that it is impracticable or impossible. There is the evidence, not of a Victorian, but of a Queensland industry, where it is even more advanced than in Victoria. I have here a letter from the representative of the Austral Otis Company, in which I am informed that at least 200 traction engines will be required in Australia next year, and that at an average price of ^800 each they would represent a value of _£i6o,ooo, of which it is estimated that ,£60,000 would be spent in wages in Australia. It is also statedWe are prepared to begin the manufacture at if the duty is retained. We would supply horse-power engines of similar type to the best imported, as under :- 8 horse-power single cylinender traction engine, ^720; 8 horse-power comCo., pound traction engine, ^825; 8 horse-powerand alsingle cylinder portable engine, ^325. If it be possible for Australian firms to have construct large horse-power locomotive engines, why should it not be possible for them to turn out small portable engines?",20
97,Mr WILSON,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,"Corangamite) [2.40] special I support the proposal of the honourable member for Illawarra, to omit traction and portable engines from this item. The Minister has told us that the Austral Otis Company made a traction engine for the Collingwood City Council; but, I suppose, he means that the company made a steari roller which may be i^ed as a traction engine. Traction engines, properly speaking, are largely used on farms, and are altogether different from such machinery as the famous Coon road roller. If the Collingwood road roller'were placed on a farm, it would be bogged for ever, on account of its weight.",20
98,Mr MATHEWS,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,Tractio n engines are made in Australia.,21
99,Mr WILSON,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,"That is not so. Under the old Tariff traction engines and' portable engines were free; and they are used on. every farm in the time of threshing, and also for ploughing, pulling down trees, and so forth. Portable engines are also largely used in initial mining work; and the fact remains that up to the present they have not been manufactured commercially in Australia.",21

However, the main point is that traction and portable engines are used by primary producers, both in agricultural and mining pursuits, to a very considerable extent.",21

The Minister seeks to include scarifier attachments, but, in my opinion, there is no necessity for that, cause, I suppose, the scarifier is meant tearing up metal.

I might also add that portable engines are largely used as part of pumping plant for irrigation purposes; and irrigation is a work we ought to encourage. The Treasurer, who is supposed to have the interests of the whole country at heart, is found siding with the men who live in the. cities-is found siding with the honourable member for SoutH Sydney and the honourable member for Hindmarsh-in an endeavour to impose heavy taxation on people who are developing the country'. It is time a protest was raised against such a policy. The honourable member for Hindmarsh is an absolute prohibitionist, and admits the fact.",21

118,Mr WILSON,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,"I feel this item to be one of considerable importance to primary the producers from one end of Australia to the other. We must avoid taking a narrow minded view. We ought not to confine our attention to the interests of Adelaide, Melbourne, and Sydney,- forgetting the men who are developing the resources of the country in the northern parts of Queensland, the back-blocks and the north-west of Western Australia, and in the Northern Territory. f h e primaryproducer is always ready to give the manufacturer fair encouragement. In the past manufacturers of some of the items under discussion have enjoyed duties to the extent of 1 2 per cent., and have progressed 1 very well under that protection. We are now preparing to give the manufacturer a little more assistance, although that little more is something which cannot be recouped to the producers of butter, grain, and gold. In order that Australia may, as far as possible, be self-contained, we, from patriotic motives, are prepared to extend the protection a little, but that little is as much as we can bear.

Upon this waggon were traction and [237] portable engines, and in front of the donkey which represented a certain party, was a bunch of carrots labelled "" New protection."" 1 do not know what was the condition of the carrots, but I fear that they were not very sound in some respects. As the result of the promise given by the Treasurer, members of the Labour Party are prepared to vote for duties which under other circumstances they would never have dreamed of supporting.

130,Mr MATHEWS,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,"In my opinion the honourable member is opposed to the manufacture of AustrSlian commodities, i nasmuch as he refuses to extend to our industries a sufficient measure of protection to enable them to successfully compete against the outside world.

131,Mr WILSON,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,I said that they were not commercially manufactured.,22
132,Mr MATHEWS,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,"I take it that the for the honourable member means that they have not been manufactured and sold here. As a matter of fact there are five establishments in my own electorate which are making portable engines and selling them in Australia. I hold in my hand a photograph of a portable engine Of which Johnson's Foundry has manufactured twenty, all of which have been sold in Victoria. - Sir JOHN FORREST - In what year did they manufacture them?",22
133,Mr MATHEWS,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,"Fourteen or fifteen years ago. I also have here two plates of a 12 horse-power portable engine of which Mr Renshaw, of South Melbourne, has made four, which are working in Victoria today. . His price for each of them was £ 2 2 1 . I have still another plate of a six horsepower engine and boiler, of which the same firm has manufactured six, two*in 1905, two in 1906, and two during the present year. If any honourable member doubts the accuracy of my statement he hasonly to visit the establishment in question, where he will see an 8 horse-power portable engine and 1 boiler which has ' been manufactured to the order of the Metropolitan Board of Works. Twelve engines of the same type have', been sold for £ 2 2 7 each. Is any other evidence necessary to prove that this class of machinery is being manufactured here commercially ? There is not a man in Australia who can doubt the efficacy of the steam road roller which was manufactured to the order of the Collingwood City Council.. It burns the minimum, quantity of coal, it is doing its work efficiently, and it was made in Australia. If engineering firms in. this State had to manufacture the whole of the road rpllers. required "" in Australia they would - be in ' a. position ' to produce them at a very much reduced price. We all know that a start has to he made at some' time. In the first instance a manufacturer has to incur considerable expense before he can produce an article, but in later - years he can manufacture, it at a much cheaper price. The*Collingwood Council, - who have received, a'nd rightly received, great credit for paying a little more for their road roller, have put the. other councils in a position to procure:road rollers at a"" very much' cheaper rate'than has prevailed hitherto. Traction engines have been made satisfactorily in Australia. We are told that in these matters the principal fronsideration is the economical workine of the article. I am informed that every user of machinery which has been made in Australia during later years has expressed hiswillingness to give a certificate as to economical consumption of coal, durability, ancl capacity to do the work required. Here is a photograph of a portable engine of a special Australian pattern which was made not with a square firebox but with a round firebox, so that the stumps would not interfere with or disarrange the engine.",23
134,Mr WILSON,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,"They could not get out the ashes. - Mr MATHEWS - No less than twenty of this patented portable engine have been put on the market. Men do not buy a new invention for fun's sake. They generally satisfy themselves that it is worth buying. This portable engine was satisfactory to the user. If the honourable member does not like that one, then like Gheapjack in the market he can take his choice from the other samples of locally-made - engines which are shown in these phonographs. T ought not, perhaps, to blame the honourable member for Corangamite for advocating the proposed reduction of duty. Many of his constituents, being human beings, are selfish to a certain extent, and they,' like all free-traders, wish to secure as free a market as they can in the purchasing of commodities. I can assure the honourable gentleman that within a .quarter of an hour's walk of this building portable' engines have been manufactured, and the manufacturer has informed me that in point of price they compare very favourably with imported engines. First of - all, we are told that it .is years since these articles were made. As a matter of. fact, the engineering trade in Australia, at any rate in Victoria, did far better thirty years ago - than it is doing now!. ' Why ? . Because theprotective Governments .of Victoria in 7 their wisdom, impqsed such a duty - that the articles'could be manufactured ihere. - What was good for Victoria cannot be Otherwise than beneficial to Australia as a whole. The agriculturist, thegrazier, and the miner are dependent upon the menin the towns,- and therefore they - should be prepared to give and take. I ask the representatives of mining districts, "" Is it wise to. have only one avenue of employment for men?"" Are they so much wedded to the mining industry, to working in the bowels of the earth, that they do not want to bring into existence other avenues of employment for their sons and their daughters' husbands? There is no man in the city, but will concede to the agriculturist the - right to . live in the same sense in which he wishes to-live. , But the agriculturist knows very well that in large cities there is a ready mairket in which he can always get satisfactory prices for his products. I realise that it is necessary to export certain commodities which we overproduce - That is essential, and also beneficial to us as a whole. At the same time, it behoves us to see that one and the other are protected in a certain sense. believe that certain honourable members represent the true feelings of primary producers when they urge the Committee to discourage the manufacture of an article in Australia.",23
135,Mr FAIRBAIRN,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,"Fawkner) [3.5] - I am one of those who hold that the great bulk of these engines ought to be made in Australia. I think that, unlike the hot-air engines, they are made to only a very limited extent. In Australia there is a very large market for portable engines. They are used in every State, and are in great demand. I believe that if there was a properly equipped factory they could be turned out as well as locomotive engines are turned out. It is an industry which we ought to try tq establish in our midst. At the same time, we ought, not to impose too high a duty. I ask the Treasurer to listen .to a letter which I received a day or two ago, and which pretty well speaks for itself. Writing on the 23rd of. November, my correspondent saysT beg to call your .attention to the injustice which the proposed duty of 25 per cent, on portable engines will entail on a mining company iri which T am interested. This is the Wilberforce Gold-dredging Company,' situated near Beech; worth.",24
136,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,We had that over and over again last night.,24
137,Mr FAIRBAIRN,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,I . wish to draw the attention of the honourable gentleman to the actual sum which is involved.,24
138,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,"I know all about that. ' Mr FAIRBAIRN - The company is operating in' the Ind i electorate. Prior to the introduction of the Tariff it ordered from England a 30-horse-power portable engine- a very large class of engine. Out of £ 8 , 0 0 0 expended' on the mine, over £ 3 , 0 0 0 has gone in the purchase of engines, boilers, & c , made in this country - a fact which I think the Treasurer has not grasped. The letter continuesOwing to the fact that the depth of the alluvial ground necessitates a type and size of portable engine never kept in stock by machinery merchants, ancl, indeed, never made except to ordeT, the directors were compelled to cable to England for the building of this special engine. The duty on this engine will amount to not less than £250. That is a very large sum for the company to be called upon to pay in Customs duty. [237]- 2",24
139,Mr TILLEY BROWN,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,"That was calcuI do not lated on a duty of 25 per cent., but the Treasurer now proposes to levy a duty of -30 per cent.",24
140,Mr FAIRBAIRN,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,"I believe that with duties of 20 and 15 per cent., respectively we could establish the industry of making portable engines.",24
141,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,Will the honourable member agree to a minimum of 20 per cent. ?,24
142,Mr FAIRBAIRN,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,"No ; I think it would be better to fix the duties at 20 and 15 per cent, respectively. If we did, we should not penalize the industries which have to use portable engines. I want to see the industry started, but I do not wish subsidiary industries to be handicapped too much. I hope that, on reconsideration, the Treasurer may see his way to agree to my suggestion.",24
143,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,I cannot.,24
144,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,"Robertson) [3-9]--There seems to be a. doubt in the minds of some honourable members as to the possibility of making portable engines in Australia. That comes to me as a very great surprise. So far back as I can remember, in the various States portable engines have been made, and made very well indeed. There is nothing extraordinary in the making of a portable engine. But I feel quite sure that very few traction engines have been made in Australia. Not long since I was looking round Australia for traction engines. In Sydney I found several of Fowler's traction engines, for which the owners had no use, and could find no sale, as so few of them are used in that State. I was told that more of them were in use in Victoria. It appears that there is very little demand for traction engines, because of the enormous expense caused by wear and tear when the engines are used on the roads to draw heavy loads. Besides, it is only on excellent roads that they can be used in that way. According to the evidence quoted by the honourable member for Bendigo, Mr. Pearson, a Queensland manufacturer, has stated that he can make engines which will work as effectively as Fowler's best, though they have not the same finish, which is not surprising, because in no country in the world can better engineering finish be given than in. Great Britain. I believe that Mr. Pearson's engines can do the work required of such' machinery. He says that while he charges from 15 to 16 per cent, more, ihe sells a better article than the Fowler engine. Therefore a protective duty of 15  that he asked for when giving evidence before the Tariff Commission. The honourable member for Bendigo, as Chairman of the Commission, recommended a duty of 12^ per cent, on some of these, engines, and J take it that he had in his mind traction engines.",24
145,Sir JOHN QUICK,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,No ; we expressly commended a duty of 25 per cent.,25
146,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,"The Quick section of. the Tariff Commission recommended 12J per cent, on steam road rollers, including scarifiers, while the Fuller section, adopting a different classification, recommended 15 iper cent. The Quick section recommended 25 per cent, for other machinery, which, I take it , included portable engines. In Australia manufacturers are in the habit of giving more power per nominal horse-power than is given with imported machinery. That is a failing on the right side which is always noticeable in young countries..",25
147,Mr MALONEY,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,Are not these engines made in New South Wales?,25
148,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,"Tractio n engines are a drug in the market there. 1 know of half-a-dozen which are housed in Sydney. There is no sale for them, because the roads are so bad.",25
149,Mr WILSON,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,"They should be sent to Victoria, .where the roads aTe good.",25
150,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,"M o r e of such engines are used in Victoria. In this State a good portable engine can be made, arid we have it on the evidence of a manufacturer that .16 per cent, is a sufficiently high duty to impose on traction engines.",25
151,Mr MALONEY,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,"A good traction engine, made in Melbourne, was shown at the '.Royal Agricultural Show, and afterwards sold in the open market. - Mr HENRY WILLIS - They can be made commercially here, all that is asked for being a protective duty of 15 or 16 per cent. The Minister's proposed rates are 30 and 25 per cent. I cannot understand that proposal, in view of his utterance in favour of 25 per cent., and in the face of the recommendation of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission that the rate should be i 2 | per cent., and from 15 down to 10 per cent, for other similar machinery. I think that we shall be adopting the happy mean if we agree to rates"" of 20 and r5 per cent. If the Minister wishes to make progress, he should adopt the line of least resistance. He can accept, with honour, rates of 20 and 15 per cent.; but if he sticks out for higher rates he will be ignominiously defeated, as he was yesterday.",25
152,Mr BATCHELOR,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,"Boothby) [3.16] I was rather surprised by the outburst of the honourable member for Corangamite. I do not understand why he , asks that portable engines shall be treated d if ferently from other similar engines. He re- says that they are used on farms, but so, too, are stationary engines. Why should a portable engine be admitted free and a stationary engine be made to pay duty? Does the honourable member see anv particular virtue in the fact that an engine is mounted on wheels instead of being bedded ?",25
153,Mr WILSON,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,Certainly .,25
154,Mr BATCHELOR,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,A portable engine has its advantages for a farmer; but I cannot see why in a Tariff a distinction should be drawn between portable and stationary engines.,25
155,Mr WILSON,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,"Portabl e engines are necessary for opening up and developing the country, while stationary engines are used merely for driving chaffcutters and other machinery.",25
156,Mr BATCHELOR,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,I cannot see the logic of the honourable member if he says that that .is a reason for differentiating in the Tariff between the two classes of engines.,25
157,Mr TILLEY BROWN,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,Thes e facts must have weighed with the Committee in 1.Q02.,25
158,Mr BATCHELOR,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,"No ; the Committee was influenced then, as many honourable members, I am sorry to say, are influenced today, by too great a desire to coddle and nurse the farmers. All kinds of social legislation is passed by the Commonwealth and State Parliaments, but the attempt is always marie to exempt 'the farmers from its restrictions, and honourable members are trying to exempt them largely from the payment of duties. Farmers should, of course, receive as much consideration as other classes of the community ; but the fact that one kind of engine is more useful on a farm than another is not a reason why it should be imported duty free. Instead of the question asked being "" Can we make these engines successfully?"" honourable members wish the Committee to consider only the fact that the farmers use them.",25
159,Mr FULLER,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,Aii d what the farmers will have to pay for them if a heavy duty is imposed.,25
160,Mr BATCHELOR,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,That question has not been raised.,26
161,Mr WILSON,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,Yes ; most distinctly.,26
162,Mr BATCHELOR,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,"As to the matter of price a great deal dep'ends upon whether or not there is a competing industry in Australia. If no portable engines are made in Australia the purchaser will undoubtedly pay more even if there be no import duty. If honourable members in the Opposition corner are. prepared to accept a duty of 20 per cent, on portable engines and traction engines, I shall say no more. Personally, I shall vote for duties of 25 per cent, and 20 per cent. Seeing that we have laid it down that we will impose duties of 20 per cent, on motive power engines, we cannot expect to have a higher duty on these engines simply because they are on wheels. All motive power engines should be treated in the same way.",26
163,Mr WILSON,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,"We shall vote for duties an addition to of 20 per cent, on foreign-made engines and 15 per cent, on engines from the TJnited Kingdom.",26
164,Mr BATCHELOR,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,That is absurd. Surely we ought to act on logical lines; at least honourable members should pretend to be logical. It would really be too ridiat culous to differentiate in. motive power engines. A locomotive is an infinitely reasonable more complicated machine than a tracAustralian tion engine. It is probably the most highly complex machine in existence. But it is not suggested that we cannot successof full y make locomotives in Australia. Even the honourable member for Illawarra would not propose to place them on the free list. But why should locomotives pay a higher duty than portable engines?,26
165,Mr WILSON,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,Because it has been monstrated that locomotives can be made here commercially.,26
166,Mr BATCHELOR,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,"Does the honourable member put that forward as a reason? He must be a curious kind of protectionist. If he votes for protection on goods which the farmer and miner do imposing not use, I am puzzled to know what duties who he will support. If the farmer used lococannot motives the honourable' member would say that they could not be made in Australia. 1 hope that honourable members will, agree to make the duties the same for all chines doing the same kind of work and having about the same degree of comof plexity.",26
167,Mr ATKINSON,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,"Wilmot) [3.28] Under the 1902 Tariff portable engines traction engines were admitted duty free. The honourable member for Illawarra proposing to revert to the position. I shall .support him, though I must admit, from what I know of the feeling of the Committee, that there is not much hope in that direction. At the same time, the good sense of the Committee ought to induce us to reduce the proposed duties materially. According to the opinion of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission, the duty should be 25 per cent. The Treasurer asks us to make it 30 per cent, with a preference of 5 per cent, in favour of Great Britain. Take an 8 horse-power single cylinder traction engine such as is commonly used. The price is about £ 6 5 0 . With a duty of 25 per cent, the price would be increased by £ 1 3 5 . The price of a compound engine is about £ 7 8 5 . The proposed duty would mean an increase of £ 1 5 0 , or thereabouts. Surely the local manufacturer does not require so great the price of imported engines before he can begin to compete. The question is not, as some honourable members and the protec. tionist section of the Tariff Commission or think, whether these engines can be made in Australia, but whether they can be made a reasonable price. I do not think that traction engines can be made here at a price, simply because the market is too limited. According to the report of the protectionist section of the Commission, Mr Thomas Irons, Sydney, stated-that there was not a sufficient demand f b r traction engines at the present time to justify their manufacture in Australia. There was no doubt in his opinion that a firm would start to make them if the duties were prohibitive. But dethe plant would be expensive, and a great deal of capital would be lying idle in stock on hand to meet occasional demands. If these engines cannot be made here at a reasonable price, the probability is that only more harm than good would be done by a high duty. If people are now using traction engines purchase them on account of their dearness, a great many men will be thrown out of employment. So that, looking at the question from a broad stand-point, we mashould lose more than we should gain by a heavy duty. To add £ 1 5 0 to the price an article worth £ 7 5 0 is to go beyond the bounds of reason. Witnesses before the Tariff Commission stated that they and could produce these engines in Australia only at an advance of 15 per cent, or 16 is per cent, on the English price.",26
168,Mr HUGHES,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,What is the honourable member in favour of?,27
169,Mr ATKINSON,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,"I think that trac-.' tion and portable engines should be allowed to come in free, as under the 1902 Tariff, but seeing that the Committee are not likely to agree to that, I am prepared to be reasonable and to vote for a duty of 12J per cent or 15 per cent. ing the heavy freight, those would be reasonable duties. The honourable member for Fawkner quoted a very pertinent instance in relation to portable engines. The Great Wilberforce Gold Mining Company did their best to get a suitable engine made in Australia, but they could not get a 30 horse-power engine turned out here according to their requirements.",27
170,Mr BATCHELOR,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,Canno t the honourable member get a fresh yarn? We have heard all that before.,27
171,Mr ATKINSON,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,"So long as the facts ' are true, due weight ought to be given to them- The price of the 30 horse-power engine they required was £r,i5o. After being landed in Melbourne, it cost £ 1 2 0 to get it to the mine. A duty of 25 per cent, on such an engine would increase the price by £ 2 5 0 . That means a 2d. call on 30,000 shares to pay the duty. Such a heavy tax is one which many mining companies could not afford to pay. Even if only one mine were closed down, it would mean a great loss of employment. We should look at this question as business men. If honourable members do that, I am quite sure that, even if we do not succeed in having these engines placed on the free list, the duty w i ll be lowered considerably.",27
172,Mr COON,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,"Batman) [3.35] - I wish, in the first place, to correct the misstatement made by the honourable member for Corangamite, that road rollers are not portable engines. As a matter of fact, the only difference between a road roller and an ordinary traction engine is that the wheels are in the centre instead of at the side of the machine. It has been said that the effect of this duty will be to increase prices. When the Collingwood City Council proposed to purchase a new road roller, it obtained prices from several importers, but as soon as it determined to call for tenders, and so to invite local competition, the importers reduced their prices °y £ ° I O The Council secured a road roller from a Melbourne firm for £ 2 5 less than it could obtain an imported one. It Svas made under the present Tariff, and we wish the duty .to remain.

We ought to be prepared to encourage this industry. At the present time, it is practically impossible, owing to slackness of trade, to apprentice a boy to the .engineering trade, and one of our largest foundries, which, prior to Federation, was employing' 600 men, has now only 250. hands: I hope that honourable members who were returned as protectionists ' willstand by their election pledges and vote for a protective duty.",27

I am surprised at the attitude of the honourable member for Barrier, who is opposed to preferential trade.

We have been asked what consideration we are extending in this matter to the miner. I have been associated with mining, both as a speculator and as a worker, and am satisfied that the establishment of this industry in Australia will enable those engaged in mining to obtain their machinery cheaper later on. The position will be the same iri regard' to pumping engines for irrigation purposes. Irrigation, together with the making of ensilage, and the storing of other fodders in times of plenty, will lead to the salvation <of the Commonwealth.

I ' am surprised that some honourable members should imagine that the miners and farmers have so restricted an outlook that they would have us legislate only for today. They are quite prepared to bear their share of any burden involved in the establishment of industries native to Australia, and to support such, legislation as will attract population to Australia, and enable her to offer an effective defence in the day of need",28

I quote from a letter received from Messrs. Welch,. Perrin and Company, English manufacturers, the statement that an 8-h.p. traction engine costs £650, and I wish to infonn the Committee that Messrs. Cliff and Bunting, of North Melbourne, manufactured an 8-h.p. traction engine this year, which they exhibited at the Victorian, Agricultural Show. It was subsequently sold to a farmer for £600, and is now working satisfactorily at Shepparton. I make the point that the price put upon the imported engine is £650, and that a local manufacturer has sold for ^600 a similar engine, which is giving complete satisfaction.",28
183,Mr THOMAS BROWN,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,"Calare) [3.5.2]. - The question is not whether these engines' can be made in the Commonwealth, but Whether they are being made here in sufficient numbers to enable those who require them to obtain them at a reasonable price. Apparently, in view of the volume of importation, this has not been done in the past. I do not wish to make an appeal on behalf of the poor squatters and farmers. I wish to see justice done, but, while we should have every regard for the secondary industries, we should not forget the interests of the primary industries on which they depend. In my opinion, those who are prepared to push theirc protectionist principles to the point of prohibition on behalf of the secondary industries are the worse enemies of those industries. If the miners, squatters, and farmers did not use machinery, the workshops of the secondary industries would speedily be closed up. I am afraid that very often honourable mem : bers are interviewed by the promoters of secondary industries, and, as a result of the representations made to them, are induced' to forget the interests of the primary industries. I am just as anxious as aTe my protectionist friends to see the manufacture of engines and machinery promoted, but I do not wish to see the primary industries heavily handicapped by prohibitive taxation upon the machinery and implements they require for their development. These portable and traction engines are very largely used in the pastoral, mining, and farming industries of the Commonwealth. If they are to progress, labour-saving appliances must be used even to a larger extent than at present in those industries. I can inform the Committee that the mineral recovered from the mining property at Nymagee, in the electorate of the honourable member for Darling, which abuts upon my own electorate, is conveyed a considerable distance to the nearest railway station by means of a traction engine. In my own electorate during the drought of 1902-3 the owners of one station spent £ 1 2 0 , 0 0 0 fodder imported to save their stock; and a large quantity of that fodder was conveyed from the' nearest railway station by a traction engine. Along the Lachlan there are numbers of settlers engaged in irrigating large and small areas, and traction engines are largely used in that kind of work.",28

185,Mr THOMAS BROWN,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,"That is so, but not inquire. the preference is given to the traction engine - because it can be so easily moved about.

187,Mr THOMAS BROWN,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,"The percentthe age is not a large one, but I wish to it increased, because every farmer who in a position to employ one of these engines on his farm will be able to great deal more work than he can do without it . If this class of machinery be obtained at a reasonable price farmers engines dutiable at 30 per cent. will be in a position to make use of it give another instance. who must do without' it if the price considerably increased as the result of imposition of a prohibitive duty. I in the interests of the farming, mining, bourne. and pastoral industries that I wish to have these engines placed upon the market at something like a reasonable price. I prefer that they should be manufactured in Australia, but imported engines of this description should not be shut out if they cannot be produced here at a reasonable price. The experience of the Wilberforce Gold Dredging Company is a striking illustration of the effect of these duties. They have presented a petition to this House, the facts stated in which have not been controverted. They have expended something like £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 in mining development. Their work is not carried on in the back blocks of Queensland or New South Wales, where they might have some difficulty in obtaining information as to the development of manufacturing industries in the Commonwealth. Their operations are carried on in the vicinity of Melbourne, and they have informed honourable members that they have purchased £ 3 , 0 0 0 worth of machinery from Victorian manufacon turers. It is clear, therefore, that if they could obtain the engine which they found indispensable for their work from the Victorian - firms from whom they purchased their other machinery, at a reasonable figure, they would have done so. They have said that they were obliged to import a 30 horse-power engine, because they could not get their order for such an en",29
188,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,Because they did,29
189,Mr THOMAS BROWN,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,"It is all very well for the Treasurer to tell the Committee that they did not inquire. They inquired for £ 3 , 0 0 0 worth of machinery, and it is therefore reasonable to assume if they could have secured the 30 a horse-power engine in the Commonwealth they would have done so rather than go to the expense of importing it. They made inquiries, and were unable to get it here. In the interests of hypothetical production, Treasurer submitted a duty of 25 per see cent, on these machines, which would reis present a tax of £ 2 5 0 upon this company in the purchase of the engine referred to. do a Not satisfied withthat, the honourable gentleman yesterday proposed to jump the can duty up another 5 per cent., making these I can I have here a letis ter which I suppose other honourable memthe bers also' have received, from the firm of t is Welch, Perrin, and Company, of MelThey state that under the old Tariff they were selling three lines of 8 horse-power single cylinder, compound cylinder, and portable engines at £ 6 5 0 , £ 7 5 0 , and £ 2 8 5 respectively; and the mere imposition of the increased duty has had the result of increasing the price of these engines to ^ 7 S » . £9°S> respectively. The Chairman of the Tariff Commission has said that the Austral Otis Company are prepared to produce smilar 8 horse-power - engines for -^""720, £ S > 8 2 This indicates, assuming that those engines are identical-and , so far as I can judge, they are-wit h the engines put on the market here by Messrs.

This means if these high duties are and the engines are made locally, on the basis indicated by the Otis Company, the farmers, graziers, and miners will have to pay that much more for them than they have been paying. the hard pounds-shillings-and-pence side of the question. It means'a considerable additional burden to the primary producer. Is it reasonable that he should not be considered in this matter at all ? Should not his interests have weight with the Committee? I have presented to the Committee concrete facts, first regarding the mining"" company 1I have indicated, and next as to the difference of price between those two reputable firms-the Otis Company and Welch, Perrin and Company.",29
190,Mr MCDOUGALL,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,Are the mining companies and those importing firms primary producers ?,30
191,Mr THOMAS BROWN,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,"I did not claim that they were. I am showing to what extent they are helping the primary producer by supplying him with his machinery. I should like to see these machines on the free list, but, if I cannot get that, I propose to vote only for that amount of taxation which .will not be severely felt by the primary producer. I do not pro* pose to move any amendments myself, but I shall support those that have been indicated. The Treasurer seems to overlook the fact that in the great protectionist countries of Canada and New Zealand a great many of these engines are on the free list', or were kept upon the free list until such times as they could be produced locally, other means-suc h bounties in Canada-bein g adopted to bring them to that stage. But here, Treasurer proposes a heavy 30 per cent. tax, practically saying to the primary pro8 and £341 ducer, "" You will have to buy these machines at that price, or do without them."" In that way he proposes to encourage the secondary producer. His policy is largely that of killing the goose £ $ 5 respectively. 2 that lays the golden eggs. If he penalizes the primary producer to that extent he will find that it will react upon the secondary producer, and that, instead of helping the latter, this prohibitive Tariff will be really a detriment to him.",30

193,Mr HUGHES,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,Is it on wheels? That is Sir WILLIAM LYNE - Yes .,30
194,Mr HUGHES,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,And do they go round?,30
195,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,"Severa l honourable members have made very wild statements. This is what the Australasian said about that traction engineOne of the exhibits at the Royal Show which is sure to attract and hold the attention of the majority of visitors next week will be a handsome, well-balanced, and serviceable traction engine, designed and manufactured by Messrs. Cliff and Bunting, of North Melbourne. This engine- a photograph of which appears in the pictorial pages-is the outcome of years of practical study of Australian conditions and ""needs. It has been designed and built in Australia, every part has been made in Australia, every feature has been carefully thought out, and ""the result is an engine which will give satisfactory service under all conditions-o n metal roads, on earth roads, and in paddocks hauling or ploughing. The excellent quality of the material used throughout not only .insures great strength, but materially reduces the weight of the engine,which is just seven and a-half tons, so that it is well within the weight limit allowed on bridges' and culverts. The strength and lightness, combined with wide road wheels, means that no injury is done to metal roads, whilst heavy loads can be hauled in swampy paddocks where weightier engines would stick fast. . . . Two-speed gear is fitted; quick speed for use on good roads and to make good time, and slow speed for use on rough or bad roads, or when there is a heavy load behind. The reverse is a single eccentric, very easy to handle and with little liability lo wear. One of the features of the engine is the wonderful ease'with which it is steered.",30
196,Mr HUGHES,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,How does it compare in as price with that of the imported engines ?,30
197,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,"The price is. the not given. The honourable member' for Batman knows more than I do about the combined road roller and traction engine made recently for the Collingwood City Council, and regarding which I was questioned this afternoon. That honourable member was to a large extent instrumental in having that work done here. The Collingwood. Council invited tenders for it. The tenders came in, but a movement was started to get the machine made here. The moment it was discovered that the Collingwood Council had decided to have it made here the outside tenderers reduced their price by £ 1 0 0 . I am told that the price of the accepted.engine .was 25 per cent, less than, the importers' tender price - The honourable Member for Calare made certain 'quotations - of importers'' prices. importers will do exactly as the other importers, did'.in-the case of the Collingwood engine. The moment, they, know there is going to be opposition here, and that good engines are being made here, their, price to the fa.rrrier ""will come down immensely, nnd the farmer will benefit very largely, from the fact 'that we are protecting an engine which is made here, and which they can > - use - - The honourable' member for Calare, when 'he"" looks at the ""picture in the Australasian of the traction engine 1I have mentioned, will admit that he never saw a j bettermachine. It is suitable to Australian' conditions. Just as the harvester people applied their inventive powers fo turning out a harvester fitted for; Australian conditions, and have also adapted other agricultural machinery to Australian conditions, so the local makers have adapted this machine, to Australian requirements. The practical position before us today is that, by putting a' good duty on these imported machines, we shall give employment to oun own people, and' get machines made, like the one I have just shown to honourable members, as good as any ever built. j"" Mr HUGHES (West Sydney) [4.18] This item raises the whole question of whether we are to resort to revenue or protective duties. I have been all my life a very ardent free-trader, but I have never yet conceded, nor am I now going to. concede, the expediency of revenue duties - I have to ask myself,, in view of what has been .said thii afternoon, which of the three :duties proposed--15- - per - cent., 20 per - cent., and 30per cent - is likely to prove most effective so far as production in this country is. concerned, and which will be productive of the most revenue. Although, what the honourable member for. Calare has said is no doubt true, that if a duty is i m posed somebody has to pay it, it is also perfectly obvious that if so low a dutyisimposed as not to encourage people in this country to make the article, those who import it will be able, in the absence of opposition, to form acomplete ring to fix prices, as all trusts do, by arrangement and not by competition. The one great fact that? the twentieth century and the last years ofr the nineteenth century have made abundantly clear is that the day for the fixing of prices by competition is either past or passing, and that all prices will in"" the future be fixed by arrangement.' Those We, in this Parliament, deliberately propose to pass a law to compel men, within certain limits, to' pav. certain wages and"" sell at certain prices. Honourable members should not merely say that, if we impose a certain duty, prices will rise to the extent.of that duty; because, I presume, it will not be denied that we can make eighthorse traction engines in Australia. If E had charge of all the industries in the country, and were all-wise- a supposition which, seeing that I am not on the Treasury benches, is obviously absurd- I should protect the iron and steel industry beyond alf. others, as the one that requires the most skill and affords the greatest opportunities. There are more ramifications every day in this modern world of ours springing from the engineering industry than: from any other. Although machinesevery day replace or displace skilled labour, yet, as a matter of fact, the great machines are becoming in themselves so marvellously - complex, as to demand the highest skill and intelligence in their management, and particularly in Iheir making.' It cannot be said that it is impossible to make a traction engine in Australia. Sucb an engine does not differ, excepting in its wheels, and in its potential speed, from a' locomotive. The honourable member for 1 Boothby, who is an engineer, has said that the locomotive engine is the most complex:' of all, and, no doubt, that is true enough. The question whether we canmake, traction engines is . not to be debated, because it is very obvious that we Can; and that we have not done so--if we have not-is entirely owingto the fact; that insufficient inducements have been held"", out.' - Now, we have come, through no ac- ; tiO'n'of mine, or-of persons thinking-withme, face to face w.ith. Government proposals^ to', .'raise a Large amount"", of. revenue. . The? .necessity for this step may partly be attributed to the constitutional blot, which 'compels us to raise four times more revenue than we require. We are not asked to say - whether engines shall be free or dutiable, Sbut whether the duty shall be 15 per cent., 20 per cent., or 25 per cent. The honourable member tor Calare is one who will cheerfully vote for a duty of 15 per cent. But that duty, added to insurance and freight, and taking into account the difference in the value of the articles here and in the place of origin, is equivalent to at least -22 per cent, or 23 per cent. The honourable member for Calare and others are, therefore, in favour of imposing a revenue duty to that extent. They tell us that such a duty is not sufficient to be felt by the - people, or, at any rate, not to be appreciably felt; but directly k is proposed to add another 5 per cent., we have presented to us - pictures of the most terrific and awesome character as to the consequences. The honourable member for Wilmot told us that a certain machine would, under such a duty, cost £100 more than formerly, and the honourable member for Calare told us of another machine which would cost £ 7 0 more. If an engine- I do not care what sortcan be made in this country, it will compete with imported engines, and prices willfall-that prices fall in competition is very obvious. I have, or had, in my possession a letter from a kerosene oil company, I do not know which, to the effect that if the duty of 3d. per gallon be taken off certain oils, then another company will have a monopoly, and prices will rise; that is to say, directly there is a monopoly prices rise. A man must be blind, or shut his eyes to facts, if he does not realise that there are importers' rings just as there are manufacturers' rings. Rings are not confined to any particular class; wherever there is profit there we find a ring, just as wherever there is carrion there we find the crows. That being the obvious fact, we have to ask ourselves whether, as a matter of hard and solid fact, the imposition of another 5 per cent, will not result in a lower price rather than in a higher one. I learn, to my greatsatisfaction, that farmers are in the habit of purchasing traction engines. quite frequently. I have worked for farmers myself many times; and I only knew one man who had a traction engine which travelled with a thresher round the country. Farmers must be more prosperous than they used to be, or than they say they are; and I should be glad to see many of them possessed' 'of - engines. It is of no use pointing to the poor farmers as victims. The farmers have had ample consideration, and the operative and skilled artisan ought now to receive some attention. Since we have to raise a large revenue, why not raise it in a way that will give employment to numerous people?- I will not vote for a revenue duty; - the mere fact that I am told that a revenue duty is proposed , is enough to cause me to vote against it. I know only one effective way of raising revenue, and that is by direct taxation-no t necessarily on land-and , if I am forced to choose, I shall not support very low duties, because I hate taxation that falls on the shoulders of very .poor people. But he is not a poor person who can buy a traction engine worth from ^200 to .£700. Personally, I am not a very poor person, but, at the same time. 1 cannot afford to buy a fraction engine. I have been hesitating a long while about getting a very flimsy sort of pumping' apparatus, and I find the price, to me at any rate, quite prohibitive. The Treasurer has proposed duties of 30 per cent, and 25 per cent.; but he is an enthusiast j and, when he says 30 per cent., he very often means 20 per cent., and is very glad that is understood to be his - meaning: Therefore, I shall vote for the same duty on this item, as I did on the last.  day we had an exhibition of what is generally termed in political circles "" getting in out of the wet,"" and today we have had the most shameless display of the kind known since the creation of this Parliament. The honourable member for West Sydney is the apostle' of free-trade; and has scores of times, on the floor of this House, contended that duties increase prices. Yet he tells us today that the imposition of the proposed duty will mean decreased prices. If the honourable member is right, his argument would apply to every item we have dealt with in this Tariff. Much as I value my positionmuch as I appreciate the honour conferred upon me by my constituents- I would sooner walk out of Parliament tomorrow, than give such an exhibition as we have - witnessed today - How far is the honourable member for West Sydney from the fact, when he says that duties decrease prices? The duty now proposed by - the Government means an increase from £65 0 f° ^785 on one class of portable engine; on another class of engine, from ,£750 to £905; and on another, from £^285 to £341. On the very engine under discussion, under the old Tariff, there was boots. protection, including freightage and charges, amounting to 33 per cent., whereas the proposed duty means a prothey tection to the extent of 40 per cent. honourable member for Bendigo told us day that the Austral Otis Company, is primarily interested in this duty, can manufacture eight-horse power cylinder engines at £720; eight-horse' power compound engines at £825; and eight-horse power portable engines at £325. But the Austral Otis Company have increased their selling prices by £l°, £l5> d J£40an What becomes then of the honourable memthe ber's argument that the imposition of duty will have the effect of reducing price of these engines? The high price of horses at the present time renders almost obligatory that a large number farmers shall use portable engines to vide them with motive power. The one purpose which they have in view is cheapen the cost of production. Yet the per cent. Committee are asked to sanction-in the interests practically of one firm-a proplanation, posal to increase the cost of these machines to the extent that I - have indicated. venture to 'say that if the Committee sent to that proposal, this firm will take tralia. full advantage of its position. have its pound of flesh, and, in doing I do not suggest for a moment that it any worse than is the average individual. Upon the first class of machine, it have a margin of £65 upon which to inleather. crease its price directly this duty posed. Upon, the second class of engine, it will have a margin of £80, and upon the smaller engines, it will have a margin of £6°- The Committee, I regret to deserves say, have already authorized the collection of duties upon the tools of trade of the producers, as well as upon the necessaries of life. But if honourable members were to visit the various factories in the citv Melbourne, they would find that in nine cases out of ten, the tools of trade the raw materials of these establishments have been placed upon the free list. they had not been out ini that category, the manufacturers of Victoria would have been in the lobbies of this House pestering honourable members.

Upon that occasion, the boot manufacturers engaged in with which they have to contend.  lobbying for the purpose bf getting a duty of 30 per cent, imposed upon What happened subsequently? other They invaded the room occupied by the free-trade members of the House, whom requested to abolish the duty of 15 The per cent, which was being collected upon toleather, on the ground that leather was which their raw material.",30

I say fhat it would pay our primary producers If to pension off the men employed in the manufacture of these engines,' if, by so doing, they were permitted to obtain their tools of trade and the necessaries of life the lowest possible rate. I have had some experience of the lives which our farmers lead, and I know the difficulties I am acquainted with men in the arid portions of South Australia, who have obtained from their holdings very little more than seed-wheat, and the necessary flour upon which to live. As a matter of fact, - I have seen them maintaining their families, not upon bread, but upon boiled wheat.

Yet, With honourable (members who live in a fine climate, and are surrounded by the manufacturing interests, the only consideration, I apparently, is to pile on duties, ostensibly to create labour. It does not matter to them what duties are imposed, so long as they create labour in the towns, if it be created for only ten, twenty, or thirty men. It concerns them very little whether they penalize hundreds of primary producers who cannot possibly derive any advantage from the Tariff. What did the Prime Minister say only a few years ago in regard to the imposition of duties levied on agricultural implements, which I declare are essential to enable agriculturists to contend with climatic conditions, vermin, and various other things, in the poorest country, whither they have been driven, by land monopoly? Yet, the Government propose to increase their burdens. I trust fhat the Committee will fix as low duties as possible on these tools of trade, which are essential to cheap production by primary producers, and which, as time goes on, ""will be used still more largely.",34

204,Mr WILKS,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,"I generally extend more than ordinary courtesy to my fellow members, and particularly to the honourable ' member for Grey. We are not here, however, for the purpose of cultivating personal friendships. I do not believe that there is a stronger friendship between two members of the House than exists between the honourable member and myself. I do not know how it may be aftected by my remarks this afternoon. I trust that the honourable member will not be fractious under my observations, because he can pepper us very strongly when he likes. He has rubbed it in strongly in his last speech. He, in common with others when it suits their purpose, imposes a self-denving ordinance, so far as Tariff matters are concerned. I do not think that the electorate of Grey is full of in- sir. dustrials to manufacture anything. I have not vet heard that it was a teeming mass' of factories. And when the honourable member says he is prepared to take a political cake-walk out of the chamber rather than do certain things, I take the liberty of saying that probably the policy which he is advocating is a just and usef u l policy to a constituency in which there are no strong vested interests, no thousands of men engaged in factories, no hundred varieties of industries which require or ask for assistance. It is just as well, sir, for me to throw that sidelight. The honourable member for Dalley, when he addresses you, does not pretend to defend this item on economic grounds any more than he would on any other grounds; but he says openly that as honourable members rise in their places they show that they are free traders or protectionists, in patches, just it suits them, and he generally finds that the patch which is put most strongly before the Chair is the patch in their own electorate where a particular industry, is concerned. So far as pestering is concerned-eithe r by personal approach or in any other way-let me tell the honourable member for Grey that not on any item have I been approached directly by either importer or manufacturer. . That is the stand which I took on the first Federal Tariff, and the stand which I take on this I was Tariff. Certainly I have received their circulars, but that has been all. If ever they have got near enough to speak to me, in my electorate or elsewhere, I have asked them to keep off the Tariff question, and to allow me to deal with it as a man who is responsible to his constituency for his votes. I do not ask any one else to share my responsibility. I wish the honourable member for Grey to understand that I have no recollection of the incident to which he referred just now. I do not question that it occurred as he said. Probably the way in which I then dealt' with any attempt at pestering has prevented any one from attempting to pester me in connection with this Tariff. Referring to the item before the Chair, I suppose that the largest engineering estab- . lishment in New South Wales is in my electorate. There' are also many similar establishments there. Out of all those firms not one of them by letter, to say nothing of a personal interview, has approached me in regard to this - item. There is a clear statement of my position, I would not pursue that course any longer, only that I wish to make my case clear. When I was before my electors during the last campaign, I said openly', "" So far as the doctrine of free-trade is concerned on the necessaries of life, such as food supplies, & c , I shall endeavour to get you the lowest possible duties. But as regards"" any other question when I find men, either free-traders or protectionists in patches, fighting to get a little assistance for their own electorates', I shall take care that, as your representative, I shall not be slow in demanding a little share of that protection for my electors."" That is a frank, open statement. Perhaps, sir, you may say that it was a foolish statement for me to make, but I made it, and am answerable to my constituents. I am now carrying out, as rightly or wrongly, my self imposed policy : at the last election. Yesterday, when a similar item was submitted, the plea put forward was that it would be all right if it did not affect mining machinery. You, sir, pleaded with honourable memwell bers not to put penalties on the great mining experiments of Australia. You put voting protection for the nail that plea pretty strongly before the Cominterrupt mittee. You said that you would not be like the honourable member for Dalley- . of Australia. such a practically low-minded individual as to fight for your electorate. You that you would not do such a thing, that you were such a noble-hearted, elevated patriot, that all you thought about ruination of your State.",35
205,Mr TUDOR,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,Who said that?,36
206,Mr WILKS,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,"I must not take too much liberty, because it was said by an honourable member who. at present is handthe cuffed. I would not like to be sitting the chair, sir, and to be referred to as I am referring to the honourable member for them some. Perth, who is generally very calm in his speech, and very careful as to his statethat ments. When he' put that position to the honourable member for Dalley, he put it very nicely. In fact, with a sort of sorhonorable rowful air, he said that he stuck up for his electorate, but that he, like the honorof able member for Grey, would rather walk oujt - of ' P/arliament than do such a thing., as .he' indicated. State,"" ' he said,' "" the engineers are more benefited by the successful runbecause ning of mining ventures than by anything else."" So, Mr Fowler, I find that even that honourable gentleman had a patch. do not wish to speak rudely, but my nature .is a bit rough. I think that there is just as much human nature to the square inch in yourself as there is in the carcase of honourable member who is addressing you. Yesterday, you were looking after your State. To-day, when this particular indusnet trv - is concerned, I am looking after, only my electorate, but also mv State. We have dealt with the item of mining masevere chinery, and now that we are dealing with another item, what is the plea put foron ward? The plea is made on behalf of somebodv else-poo r struggling men who buy traction engines at £ 4 0 0 o r ' / ^ o o ; poor individuals who walk into an engineering establishment and give an order piece of machinery costing from -£500 to times. £r,ooo. Poor devils!",36
207,Mr HEDGES,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,It will take a good tion engine to shift us off this item.,36
208,Mr WILKS,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,And it will take a good traction engine to shift me off my vote. A 60 horse-power locomotive engine such the honourable member may affect would not take me off my track.' It is all for the honourable member for Swan - wh o yesterday almost burst himself in industry-to me. I ask him now to do a little on behalf of the engineerng establishments,36
209,Sir JOHN FORREST,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,But the honourable declared member is a free-trader.,36
210,Mr WILKS,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,"The honourable member is a free-trader, is he? He voted for 40 per was the cent, on nails yesterday.",36
211,Sir JOHN FORREST,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,The honourable member is a tree-trader; I am not.,36
212,Mr WILKS,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,I would like to see the honourable member give a little protection to engineering trades. What have they in done that they should not receive it?,36
213,Sir JOHN FORREST,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,I am going to give,36
214,Mr WILKS,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,"I do not wish to pursue argument any further, but to refer to the item before the Chair-to locomotives, traction engines, and other things. Some members desire to have a revenue duty, but I ask them to abolish their idea getting revenue by this means, and put the articles on the free list. If they think that those who use these engines will have "" In may. a severe tax placed upon them, let them not vote for a duty of 15 or 12^ per cent.; that will be imposed upon the users, and will be of no benefit to the engineering fraternity. There is no compenI sating advantage in imposing such low duties. With them it is only a question of imposing heavy duties on articles which, according to their own statement, are the the tools of trade of the down-trodden masses, for that is the way in which they put it to you, sir. If they hold that view, do let them fool with the question at all . not Let the honourable member for Swan, and those who think with him that the duty is a imposition upon people, and cannot encourage local manufacture, put the articles the free list. I will show them what sort of an animal I am. If I . cannot get an effective duty, I will vote to place the articles on the free list.",36
215,Sir JOHN FORREST,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,The honourable for a member has told us that about twenty,36
216,Mr WILKS,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,"If I have, I do not tell tracit to slow music as the honourable member t tells his story, nor with one-half of the bumptiousness which he exhibits, approaching the table like an inflated balloon, as he as has done on very many occasions, and telling the Chairman that he will - not allow this very member or that ..member to doubt his veracity. Let me respectfully tell the honourable member for Swan that the honourable member for Dalley mav be allowed to say one or two words regarding the attitude which he is going to take UD.",36
217,Sir JOHN FORREST,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,Yes .,37
218,Mr WILKS,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,"I thank the honourable member very much for his condescension. With regard to locomotives, even the State of New South Wales has got out of its free-trade ideas. A few years ago its Government refused to purchase locomotive engines for running on their railways, and made arrangements for some to be manufactured at the Eveleigh workshops under Government control by their own workers. The free-trade press of New South Wales accepted that arrangement with the warmest praise, because it meant work tor the engineering fraternity. I was very pleased indeed to think that the railway workshops of the State were going in for the manufacture of locomotives. I am only showing you, sir, that .they all have little patches of protection upon them. That is a patch which I hope to see enlarged before the debate in regard to machinery is concluded. Honourable members have said that in the past the demand for traction engines has been so small that it did not pay engineering firms to attempt to manufacture them. An engineering"" establishment cannot be started except with a larger expenditure on plant. The man who thinks that he. can start with. a file, and 2S. 6d. in his pocket, will soon file his schedule. We have heard a good deal about the great amount of plant lying idle in the nail-making industry, which employs twenty men; but I - ask those who voted for a duty of 40 per 'Cent, to protect that industry, why they should be frightened to give 30 per cent, to protect the immensely larger engineering industry ? One engineering firm alone in my electorate pays from £ 1 5 0 , 0 0 0 to £ 1 7 0 , 0 0 0 a year in wages. If a man is going to make a splash at all, he should do it for the engineering and iron-working trades, which are national in their character. Engineering establishments are not confined to Victoria and New South Wales. If the Tariff encourages manufacturing, there will be engineering establishments, not only all along the eastern sea-board, but also in Western Australia as well. The trouble of the Western Australian people today is that, if they import from the eastern States, they have heavy freights to pay; but with engineering establishments of their own they will be able to get what they want locally. Although the new grouping of items which the Treasurer has brought forward is an improvement, it still leaves things in an unsatisfactory * position. Why should steam turbines be placed on the free list, and a duty of 25 per cent, be imposed on high-speed engines - bot h of which are used for practically the same purposes? Great Britain leads the world in the manufacture of this kind of machinery, and it will be some time before we can make equally good machinery of the kind here. But the dif ferentiation to which I refer is an anomaly. Both turbines and high-speed engines should be on the free list, or both should be dutiable at 25 per cent. Coming to the question of preference, I have throughout showed the hollowness of the preferential trade proposals. They have been used to secure a lower Tariff, and I have been glad to avail myself of them to bring about the reduction of duties on articles of ordinary consumption. But I am not willing to pretend to do something for the engineering industry, and then take away any advantage by imposing a low duty : upon British importations. I ask the Government to go for rates of 30 and 25 per cent., if they, can get them, or, if not, for an all round rate of 25 per cent.",37
219,Mr TILLEY BROWN,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,Twent y and 15 per cent.,37
220,Mr WILKS,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,I would sooner have this machinery placed on the free list than impose merely revenue duties on it .,37
221,Mr TILLEYBROWN,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,"If our manufacturers cannot make it under a protective duty of 20 per cent., they should not tryto do so.",37
222,Mr WILKS,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,"Why did the honourable member vote for the imposition of such heaw duties upon woollens and hats? - Mr TILLEYBROWN - I "" have not voted for the imposition of heaw duties. Mr Wilks . ^ - T he honourable member gave many votes for much higher rates than 20 per cent.",37
223,Mr TILLEY BROWN,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,No .,37
224,Mr WILKS,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,"If he did not, he is the rara avis of the Victorian protectionists, and the honourable member for Grey is a bird of like character' in the labour flock. Honourable members know the great dimensions of the engineering trade, in which the wages paid to artisans are from 80 to 50 per cent, higher than are paid in other trades. If any criticism is to be offered on the subject of change of attitude, I shall be very pleased to do my own attacking, instead of allowing others to attack me. I have stated my position here, and I stated it when before the electors. Those connected with the engineering industry have not appealed to me personally, but, as high duties have been voted for the protection of mere mushroom industries. I shall he very glad to support duties for the protection of a substantial industry. But there must be reason in roasting eggs, and I do not wish to go to extremes.",37
225,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,"A duty of 30 per cent, is very moderate.",38
226,Mr WILKS,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,"It is moderate compared with duties of 75 and 50 per cent., which have been imposed upon other items. A duty of 30 per cent, should be the high water mark so far as the engineering industry is concerned, and it is a very reasonable rate to ask for. I hope that the Treasurer will not allow the protection given to the engineering industry to be cut down by preferential trade proposals. - Sir WILLIAM LYNE - We must have preferential trade.",38
227,Mr WILKS,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,No preference was given last night. Sir WILLIAM' LYNE - That was because we could not get what we wanted.,38
228,Mr WILKS,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,"I hope that it will not-be given in this case. It is only a device to reduce rates. It is absurd to say that we cannot make steam rollers here. They are the simplest machines to make, and I was glad to know of the manufacture of the machine on which the Treasurer performed baptismal rites at Collingwood.",38
229,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,"That is a traction engine, too.",38
230,Mr WILKS,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,"Yes . Not many have been made here, because there is not a Targe demand for them; but that does not prove that they cannot be made. I shall be satisfied with reasonable duties for the protection of engineering; but, seeing that my constituents have to pay heavy duties on clothing, food supplies, and other requisites, I should"" be worse than a fool if I did not trv to get something for them.",38
231,Mr CHANTER,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,"Riverina) [5.17] - I should not take part in this debate had it not been for the strange speech of the honourable member for Grey. I take this opportunity to point out, I hope once and for all, that others as well as he represent farming constituencies, and have .the interests of the farmers at heart. It will not help his cause to put the farmers in a'false position by making them appear antagonistic to an Australian policy. The bulk of them are in favour of an Australian policy, because they know that they owe their existence as farmers to it. Does the honourable member think that the Committee will accept such an exaggerated statement as he' made ?",38
232,Mr HEDGES,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,It was quite true.,38
233,Mr CHANTER,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,"The honourable member for Grey , said that in a part of South Australia the farmers for ten consecutive years existed on boiled wheat, that that was their staple food. I have eaten boiled wheat, and know that it makes a good article of diet; in fact, I use it in preference to some of the oaten and maize meals.",38
234,Mr MAHON,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,But the honourable member would not like to live on it.,38
235,Mr CHANTER,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,"No one would like to be confined to one diet. I have been a farmer, and have undergone as many hardships and troubles as any farmer in the country; but 1 do not believe it possible that for ten consecutive years farmers in any district have had to live on boiled wheat, with a yield of half a bushel to the acre, which they sold at is. 4d. per bushel. The farmers in my electorate have suffered as much as those in the northern parts of South Australia. They are called upon to suffer greatly at times, by reason of droughts.",38
236,Mr WH IRVINE,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,How does the honourable member propose to connect these remarks with the subject of* portable engines ? He is making a second-reading speech.,38
237,Mr CHANTER,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,"I am dealing with the contention of the honourable member for Grey, that traction engines should not be made dutiable, because farmers who have been in the terrible position which he mentioned are forced to buy them for use instead of horses. I challenge the honourable member for Grey to find in any State 500 bona fide farmers- I am not alluding to large pastoralists- 5 per cent, of whom are employing traction engines and other powerful engines. The 5 per cent, might use them for threshing purposes, travelling round with them from farm to farm, making a levy upon the farmers who use them. A farmer who understands his business knows full well the advantage of breeding a high class of stock. There will always be a demand, both in Australia and outside, for ten times the number of horses we can breed in this country. The arguments used to induce the Committee not to agree to a substantial duty, in this instance, are the most extraordinary I ever heard comgeneral ing from a so-called farmers' representatection. tive.",38
238,Mr WH IRVINE,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,"The honourable member's argument"" seems to be should increase the duty on powerful engines to induce farmers to breed more horses.",39
239,Mr CHANTER,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,"I say nothing of the kind. Some honourable members who recussion, present mining or farming constituencies from beginning to end. look at a matter of this kind simply from the point of view of their own electorates, and appear to be incapable of regarding from any other aspect: Consider it from the miner's point of view. Will it be nied that the miner has been benefited by industrial legislation, by means of which importers' monopolies have been compelled to bring down their prices? The reducdealing tion in the cost, of machinery has enabled benefited. the employers to pay Letter wages than they could otherwise have done. In years gone by, before Victoria and other States, entered into the manufacture of from a serious, point .of - view, prices were ioo per cent, higher than they are today.",39
240,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,"That is the old argument-hig h prices for flour make bread cheaper! Mi. CHANTER - What I say as to machinery cannot be contradicted-; statis-' tics prove it. I know of no farmers who use - steam rollers, traction engines, and powerful engines of other classes. afforded I know of very large capitalists ""who may. sometimes want them for extenwant sive irrigation works; but when I speak of a farmer, I mean a working man whodrives his own .plough and tills with his. own implements.",39
241,Mr MAHON,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,The honourable member ought to have a much larger class of that kind around Deniliquin.,39
242,Mr CHANTER,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,I quite agree with the honourable member. Will he the farmer is benefited by a Tariff such as this?,39
243,Mr MAHON,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,I thought the honourable member was going to show how is benefited. ',39
244,Mr CHANTER,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,"I have dorte so. T have shown that a Tariff such as this tends to give the miner constant 'employment, and that he benefits ' from. the competition caused by the internal manufacture of ing machinery.",39
245,The CHAIRMAN,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,I must ask honourable 'member' not to enter into A discussion of free-trade and pror,39

248,Mr CHANTER,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,"I sat patiently listeningto other honourable members who en-i it tered into general considerations. The honourable member for Grey made statedements which I believe to be absolutely incorrect. I wish to prove that not only, has the miner benefited from industrial legislation such as we are now engaged in with, but that the farmer has also",39
249,The CHAIRMAN,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,"I do not wish to curtail the honourable member's remarks, but I cannot allow a general discussion to machinery, take place on this item ",39
250,Mr CHANTER,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,"I was not opening, up anything at all new, but was simply replying to statements made by the honourable member for Grey, which can, I think be easily refuted. I ask honourable .members whether the manufacture in Australia of such machinery as we are now considering has not had the effect of lowering prices ? The farmer and* the miner have also 'been benefited by opportunities being; for their sons to enter into-.other; fields of employment.' A miner does not; his sons to be always miners.",39
251,Mr MAHON,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,That is what - Graham Berrv told the Victorians thirty years ago.,39
252,Mr CHANTER,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,"And he was perfectly, right. It has been demonstrated that thou-, sands and thousands of miners' sons, and of miners - themselves, have drifted from the mining fields into our manufacturingindustries. The same is the case ' with, deny that farmers' sons - ' ' -.",39
253,Mr FOWLER,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,"And many of the men. in the industries of Melbourne had tr* drift ov'er to Western Australia to get work the miner in the ""mines there.",39
254,Mr CHANTER,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,"The greed for gold has - induce'd men to go,- sometimes to'theArctic Regions, aiid .at other times to the hottest of countries. The point is, however, that our farmers and miners have minnot beendriven out of Australia,' and we want' them to remain. here. The miner is; 'the' as much interested in our manufacturing industries 'as are other classes, not only? ,frcm the point of view of his own benefit, but for the sake of the community of which he is part. I know hundreds, of cases, especially on the Bendigo field, with which I am well acquainted, of - miners who have left the mines and entered into industrial - occupations. .would a farmer be benefited by the policy of those honourable members who, by placing such machines as we are considering upon the free list, would drive our manufacturing industries out of the Commonwealth? Will not the farmer be benefited by such an increase of industries as will increase the population of Australia? If .the factories aie emptied, whom are we going to depend upon to fight for Aus-' .iralia if a time of stress should come? We cannot depend upon those who want to keep our chimneys from smoking and our wheels from revolving. The farmer knows .that he is benefited from the prosperity of our manufacturing industries. They create for him a large home market. He has two . markets to depend upon, one of which he can to a certain extent control, whilst the other is beyond his control. His home market is increased by affording profitable employment to thousands of workmen. I challenge another statement made by the honourable member for Grey. .He said that the effect of every Tariff that has been passed had been to increase the price of everv article upon which a duty was imposed, and that the farmer had to pay more for everything he ate and everything he used. Well, a good farmer does not usually require to buy much to eat. He produces that for himself. As for prices, will any one deny that until the policy of protection was applied in Australia, every machine and every article was dearer by TOO per cent, than is the case today? That is a statement that cannot be contradicted.",39
255,Mr FOWLER,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,Because all over the world processes have been cheapened to a large extent in the meantime.,40
256,Mr CHANTER,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,"I can give the honourable member instances where prices have 'been at a certain figure in one State, and considerably higher or lower in other States, as the case may be, according to 'whether the price of imported articles was affected by local manufactures. Competition has brought the price down. ",40
257,Mr CHANTER,TELEGRAPH LIN E BETWEEN,"That , is quite another matter. I sincerely hope the Committee will pass_ this item with the duty, proposed. 't ask honourable members to break down once for all the feeling that we cannot make these goods to advantage. Australia has determined upon a protective policy. The details of the Tariff may require rearranging from time to time, but duties should be so fixed that every one may know How that for all time capital may safely be invested in Australian industries. We should let it go forth to the world that capital may be invested in our industries with some hope of return. We can make in Australia all that we require,- and if the majority of honourable members are true to their election pledges, they will vote for a truly protectionist policy, such as is embodied in this Tariff.

258,Mr FOWLER,AYES,"Perth) [5.51] - I wish the Committee. to supply a little information for the benefit of our protectionist friends. The Tariff Commission were told repeatedly by interested in this industry as workers, that a duty of 25 per cent, on machinery of kind was of no use whatever to them. honourable members desire that protection should be afforded to this industry, they must, therefore, vote for much higher to insert in duties than 25 per cent.",41
259,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,AYES,"What do honourable members in the corner say to this? ... 27 Mr FOWLER - The effect of a duty ... 30 of 25 per cent, would simply be to add to the cost of all the machinery included in this item. It would not lead to any appreciable-development of the industry ln AVES. Australia. That is the opinion of those who asked the Tariff Commission for higher duties. Those who wish to be conA. sidered consistent protectionists, should, in this case, vote for higher duties than are now proposed, or leave this machinery # dutiable at the rates levied under the old Tariff.",41
260,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AYES,"Hume-Trea surer) [5.53] - I wish just to say that I should like very much to have been able to secure a duty of 30 per cent., but, as I find that I cannot do that, I am preNOES pared to accept the amendment of the honourable member for Bendigo.",41
261,Mr HUTCHISON,AYES,"Hindmarsh) [5.54]. - I amvery sorry to hear the Treasurer make that admission. We have heard from the honourable member for Perth that if we intend to protect this industry, we should not impose lower duties than those proposed by the Government. I have been very much, surprised by the action of the honourable member for Bendigo in moving his amendment. It must not be forgotten that if the duty imposed under the general Tariff were fixed at 25 per cent, instead of 30 per cent, as proposed by the PAIRS. Government, it would mean a duty of 20 per cent, on imports from the United Kingdom, because the majority of honourable members are pledged to preference. The Treasurer should have stood by his Tariff, and I say that the honourable member for Bendigo was bound to support him, if only for the reasons stated by the honornegatived. able member for Perth. Mr KING O'MALLEY' (Darwin) L5-551-- I ask the Treasurer whether he proposes that the duty all round shall be to insert in lieu 25 per cent. ?",41
262,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AYES,"That depends upon Mr KING O'MALLEY - If not. the Treasurer, in accepting the amendment, is' those sacrificing the people's interests.",41
263,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AYES,"Hume-Trea this surer) [5.56] - I cannot allow such reI f marks to be made. I challenge honourable members, and especially protectionists, to say that I am sacrificing protection in any way. If they are not prepared, to a very large extent, to leave it to me to decide what I can get, some one else had better be given charge of the business. what I can get, and what I cannot get, and what I can best do in the interests of those who desire the highest protection we can secure for them.",41
264,Mr STORRER,AYES,"Bass) CS-57]-- In ply i o the honourable member for Perth, let me say that I am a protectionist, and can exercise my right to vote as such without any dictation from free-traders. made up my mind, when the Tariff was introduced, that I would vote for duties of 25 per cent, and 20 per cent, on this item, and that is how I intend to vote, whether the Government accept the amendment or not.",42
265,Mr HUTCHISON,AYES,"Hindmarsh) [5.58]. - I wish the honourable member for Bendigo to explain whether, in moving his amendment, he is prepared to accept a duty of 20 per cent, in the second column, or whether he does not think that 25 per cent, is the minimum of effective protection for this industry. I can understand the honourable member being against preference, but surely he must be aware that if 25 per cent, is considered a fair duty under the general Tariff, honourable members will look for a duty of 20 per cent, on imports from the United Kingdom",42
266,Sir JOHN QUICK,AYES,Certainly ; I said so.,42
267,Mr HUTCHISON,AYES,"Then the honourable member does not believe that 20 per cent, is a fair duty. He is going against his own recommendation, although he said that he was prepared to stand by the recommendation of the protectionist, section of the Tariff Commission. I say that if we are not to have effective protection for this industry, it is better that this machinery should be admitted free. I have no wish to penalize the users of these machines, unless we can benefit the manufacturers and workers of Australia. I have been prepared to agree with some of the recommendations of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission, but I have never been prepared to vote for duties below those they recommended. now appear to be a fact that the Chairman of the Tariff Commission is prepared to accept a lower duty than that which he believes will give effective protection.",42
268,Mr HEDGES,AYES,"Fremantle) [6.1] - A duty of 25 per cent, on this item is recogf nised as a fair duty by Silverthorne and Adair, who have the largest foundry - in Kalgoorlie.",42
269,Mr HUTCHISON,AYES,The honourable member proposes that they should be given a I know duty of only 20 per cent.,42
270,Mr HEDGES,AYES,"Wage s in this industry are 50 per cent, higher in Kalgoorlie than in Melbourne' or Sydney, and if a duty of 25 per cent, is sufficient for Kalgoorlie, re- manufacturers in Melbourne and, Sydney should be ashamed to ask for a higher rate of duty. In view of the increased cost of labour, a duty of 25 per cent., as applied I to the industry in Kalgoorlie, would be worth 50 per cent, to the industry in Melbourne. At page 2022 of the Tariff Commission's report it will be found that Mr . Silverthorne asked for a duty of 25 per cent.",42
271,Sir JOHN QUICK,AYES,Why did not the hon 7 orable member vote for that duty?,42
272,Mr HEDGES,AYES,"Because - I thought they were asking for too much. If the Western Australian manufacturers secured that rate of protection, the bigger factories with better facilities in Melbourne and Sydney would secure the same rate. If manufacturers at Kalgoorlie can hold their own with a duty of 25 per cent., those engaged in the industry in Melbourne and Sydney should be able to carry on with the duty imposed under the old Tariff.",42
273,Mr HUTCHISON,AYES,Hindmarsh) [6.4]. - We heard yesterday that the honourable . member for Fremantle did not care whether they could manufacture these machines in Western Australia or not.,42
274,Mr HEDGES,AYES,Who said that?,42
275,Mr HUTCHISON,AYES,"To-da y the honourable member states that if manufacturers in that State are given a protection of 25 per cent, they can carry on. I wish to show that he is prepared to destroy the Western Australian industries. He says that they can carry on with a 20 per cent, duty.",42
276,Mr HEDGES,AYES,I did not say so; they have said so themselves.,42
277,Mr HUTCHISON,AYES,"The honourable member must be aware that they cannot carry on with a lower duty. By voting for the amendment, he would decide in favour It would of a duty of only 20 per cent, on imports from the United Kingdom. That is the position. The honourable member has led the Committee to believe that he thinks a duty of 25 per cent! a fair duty.",42
278,Mr HEDGES,AYES,I did not say it was a i r ; I said that they asked too much.,42
279,Mr HUTCHISON,AYES,"We have to con'sider not merely the manufacturers of Victoria and New South Wales. I have more consideration for the smaller States, 'where manufactures cannot be carried on on the same scale as in the larger States. I do not wish to see any industry in - Western Australia or in South Australia destroyed in the way the honourable member for Fremantle proposes they should be. If the Committee does not. carry a duty of 30 per cent, in the General Tariff, I shall claim the vote of the honourable member for Fremantle in favour of a duty of 25 per cent, on imports from the United - Kingdom. - Question-That the figures -"" 30,"" pro.posed to be left out, stand part of the proposed amendment (Sir JOHN QUICK'S posed amendment-put . amendment of Sir WILLIAM amendment)""-put .

282,Mr HUTCHISON,AYES,"Hindmarsh) [6.25]. - Now we see the ridiculous position in which"" we are placed. The honourable member for Bendigo, as Chairman pf the Tariff Commission, recommended a duty of 25 per cent, as ""that which ought to be imposed; and we have ""agreed on that duty in' the general Tariff. I must say that the Treasurer has not shown his"" usual astuteness; because,' although"" he might not have the support necessary to carry a duty of 30 per cent., there were still sufficient to enable him to obtain a duty of 25 per cent, all round. Having agreed to allow 25 per cent, to be fixed for the general Tariff, the Government are now practically forced to accept a duty of 20 per cent, as against Great Britain; and' AVES. that is certainly not sufficient protection. In the case of the previous item there was no preferential duty; but now it is proposed to give a preference which will be injurious to the industry. I invite the honourable member for Bendigo to withdraw'' the amendment, because, in my opinion, the preferential duties are destroying the Tariff. For my part, I shall vote against the amendment. I am sorry to think that honourable members, who went before the country as protectionists, should be found, supporting the amendment of the honorNOES. able member for Bendigo. We find honor-, able members like the honourable member for Echuca voting for a duty of 15 per cent.; and yet, before his constituents, he called himself a protectionist. How can honourable members justify such votes?"" Why do such honourable members not come' out in their true colours and call themselves free-traders? I likejjonorable mem-' F.

285,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AYES,Can the Treasurer give us any information regarding the addition which he proposes of apparatus for the liquefaction of gases?,45
286,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AYES,"I understand that this apparatus is not being made in the Commonwealth. Some honourable members may not be. aware of the fact that pulley blocks and travelling blocks will include the tackle connected therewith. The point was raised by the honourable member for Indi as to whether the foot-noteSubject to rebate under the conditions specified in the schedule hereto, will be retained. I may inform him that it will have no application unless an asterisk is retained.",45
287,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AYES,"Parramatta) [7.47] - I should like the Treasurer to explain what this apparatus for the liquefaction of gases really is? It is of the utmost importance that we should know what we are voting, for.",45
288,Mr EDWARDS,AYES,Oxley) [7.48] - I desire to know under what item of the Tariff air compressors are included. Do they come under paragraph A of this item?,45
289,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AYES,"No , under paragraph B.",45
290,Mr ARCHER,AYES,"Capricornia) [7.49] I would point out that steam turbines are dutiable at 5 per cent, under the general Tariff, and are free under the Tariff for the United Kingdom. Now, the only engines which enter into competition with steam' turbines, and which, in many instances, do the same work, are high-speed engines. At the present time these bear a duty of 20 per cent.",45
291,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AYES,"High-speed engines are included in item 162, which has alreadv been passed. Mr.'ARCHER - I wish to make high speed engines having a piston speed of 500 feet or more per minute, dutiable at 5 per cent, under the general Tariff, and to admit them free under the Tariff for the United Kingdom ",45
292,The CHAIRMAN,AYES,I would point out that the item which the honourable member is desirous of amending has already been passed.,45
293,Mr ARCHER,AYES,"Seeing that steam turbines are the motive power for the turbofor the blowers, why cannot we include in this 5 item high-speed engines which do the same free, (B) Mawork? I therefore move That the amendment be amended by inserting after the word ""blowers,"" paragraph A, the words "" and high-speed engines having a piston speed of 500 feet per minute or over.""",45
294,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AYES,That matter has already been dealt with in item 162.,45
295,Mr ARCHER,AYES,"How about turboblowers? Unless my proposal is ruled out of order, I intend to persist in it. Steam turbines and high-speed, engines practically do the same work in certain places. I understand that the Department urges some objection to the adoption of the course which I propose, because it alleges that it is difficult to differentiate between slow-speed and high-speed engines. But I would point out that in only a few instances, would it be possible to introduce a slow-speed engine under the description of a high-speed engine. In other words, there would have to be a misdescription of the goods. The argument advanced by the Department is not a good one, inasmuch as it might be urged with equal force in regard to every item of the Tariff. Because, in a few instances, it may be possible, under a wrong description, to introduce slow-speed engines as high-speed engines, I do not see why the latter should be refused admittance at 5 per cent, under the general Tariff, or why they should not be included in the free list under the Tariff for the United Kingdom.",45
296,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AYES,"Hume-Trea surer) [8.0] - I wish to point out that high-speed engines are included in item 162, which has already been agreed to. A steam turbo-blower may be constructed on exactly the same principle as a. steam power, but it is not considered a motive power at all. All these items, and the one to which the honourable member has referred, are included in item 162. The only way in which that can be altered is by recommitting the item, and taking out the article, because I do not intend. to mix up motive power with secondary machinery. Item 162, I repeat, deals with motive power. I hope that the honourable member will not move the amendment. I do not know whether the Chairman thinks it can Le moved, but I think that we shall have to recommit item 162 before anything can be done in that regard.",45
297,The CHAIRMAN,AYES,"It is a most difficult tiling for me to decide in this technical matter. But if I am assured by the Treasurer that high-speed engines are included in item 162, the honourable member for Capricornia will be out of order in moving the proposed amendment; otherwise, 1 would have accepted it . Mr W. H. IRVINE - On order, sir, I understand that we have passed motive-power machinery n.e.i. at 25 per cent., or whatever the duty is, but that we may elsewhere include any particular part of that machinery in any item. The Tariff has been dealt with throughout on the understanding that the term - ""n.e.i."" means ""not elsewhere in the Tariff included,"" and does not mean ""not elsewhere in this item included."" If you, sir, look through the other items in the same way, you have to look through a number of different divisions to see what the term "" n.e.i."" means. I wish to have a ruling, because it will govern, not merely the amendment which the honourable member for Capricornia wishes to move, but many others.",46
298,Mr BATCHELOR,AYES,Then clude helmets in this item?,46
299,Mr WH IRVINE,AYES,"We might include any article in this item. I submit that we have to exhaust the Tariff in order to ascertain whether any article is not elsewhere included. If that be right, the honourable member, of course, will be in order in proposing the insertion of any relevant article.",46
300,Mr BATCHELOR,AYES,But this is not relevant.,46
301,Mr WH IRVINE,AYES,"It is. relevant, because it is machinery.",46
302,Mr BATCHELOR,AYES,"That does not make it relevant. Mr W. H. IRVINE - The member will not suggest for a moment, suppose, that a high-speed engine is not machinery ?",46
303,Mr BATCHELOR,AYES,Certainl y not.,46
304,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AYES,It is a motive power.,46
305,Mr WH IRVINE,AYES,"I understand that, but it certainly would be included in general term "" machinery"" if it did happen to have been already dealt with motive-power machinery. the proposed amendment is relevant to ' item with which we are dealing. that motive-power .machinery had not been dealt with, then the proposed amendment of the honourable member ought to be quite in order, because he says, "" We are deal- ing with machinery generally, and I want to include. under the head of machinery admitted at 5 per cent., one kind, namely, a high-speed engine."" As against that, it is said, "" Oh, but that particular kind of machinery comes under motive-power machinery, with which we have already a point of dealt."" I submit that we have dealt with only motive-power machinery n.e.i., and in order to find out whether that fact prevents us from dealing with the insertion of high-speed engines here we have to ascertain what the term "" n.e.i."" means. I hold that it means motive-power machinery not elsewhere included in the Tariff. If that is the meaning of the term, it is left open to the honourable member to include the article anywhere else in the Tariff.",46
306,The CHAIRMAN,AYES,"I point out to the honourable member for Flinders that the phrase ""n.e.i."" as used in item 162 refers to that particular item, and to any similar article not specifically mentioned in the item. If it applied throughout the Tariff, then under groceries, textiles, or any other head, honourable members could drag in. we could in- certain items already dealt with, and deal with them again, and there would be no finality to our dealing with the Tariff. As it stands now, item 162 refers to specific articles, and the term n.e.i. in the item includes similar articles not elsewhere included in the item. Mr. JOSEPH COOK. - May I respectfully point out to vou, sir, where a ruling like that will land you?",46
307,The CHAIRMAN,AYES,Does the honourable member intend to dissent from my ruling ?,46
308,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AYES,No .,46
309,The CHAIRMAN,AYES,Then I cannot allow any discussion on it.,46
310,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AYES,"I take it, sir, that honourable there is no rule to prevent me from pointI ing out to vou a resulting anomaly.",46
311,The CHAIRMAN,AYES,"Six or seven honourable members rose in their places.when the honourable member did, and if I were to allow him to question my ruling, every other member of the Committee, if he so desired, must be allowed to do so. If the the honourable member considers that mv ruling not is wrong, the better way will be for him as to move that it be dissented from. I contend that Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Are we to underthe stand, sir, that in future you are going Suppose to classify these items?",46
312,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AYES,No .,47
313,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AYES,"-That is the effect of (the ruling. Honorable MEMBERS - No .

314,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AYES,I have stated what item the article mentioned by the honourable (member for Capricornia cpmes under.,47
315,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AYES,"The Committee. I submit, is the final arbiter of that. If it comes under motive power machinery, n.e.i., then the question of where it is to be put arises. The classification of the Tariff must be left to the Committee entirely: ' You will take upon your shoulders a very complex burden, sir, if you undertake to classify the items.",47
316,The CHAIRMAN,AYES,"I am not desirous of taking upon mv shoulders more than I - have already done. I point out to the honourable member that if his contention is correct, then everv item with which we have dealt in the way of machinery could be repeated so that there would be no finality in our dealing with the Tariff. I am not here to decide what a turbo blower or high-speed engine - is. I can only be guided by the Minister and honprable members.. The Treasurer has stated that a high-speed engine is a motive power. Mv interpretation is that it comes under paragraph B-n.e.i - of item 162, and that its insertion in 164 cannot be moved ",47
317,Mr GLYNN,AYES,"May I refer to the fact, sir, that a clearer definition of the term "" n . e . i . , "" if wanted, ought to be put in the Customs Act? fines the term as meaning "" not elsewhere included."" If there is only one "" n.e.i."" item attached to machinery, it is clear that all machinery not specified falls under it.

319,Mr GLYNN,AYES,"The terminology cannot be altered now, but it may be cleared up afterwards in the Customs Act.",47
320,Mr KNOX,AYES,"The honourable member for sir, Capricornia may not be precisely in order in . urging that high-speed engines .should receive consideration I The CHAIRMAN - Order ! I have already ruled that the ' amendment is out of order.",47
321,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,AYES,"North Sydney) [8.13] - I have not risen, sir, to question your ruling, nor to deal with the matter with which the honourable member for Capricornia attempted to deal, though I agree .with him that there is great inconsistency. The Treasurer has .indicated his opinion that the term "" n . e . i . "" applies to. items not elsewhere included in the item which we are considering.",47

The honourable member for Parramatta has asked why the engineering of Victoria and New South by Wales do not make the pulley-blocks and The travelling blocks specified in paragraph A of item 164. As a matter of fact, these are wood-split pulleys, and are not made in engineering establishments. But as. they are largely used in such establishments, they should be-dutiable at as low a rate as possible. ' Mr TUDOR - There are iron chain pul",48

It seems an anomaly that the turbine which supplies the motive power should be separated in this Tariff from the turbo-blower, which is screwed on to the blower, and finishes the work. The honourable member was quite right in his desire to have high-speed engines placed on the same basis as turbo-blowers. Certainly it is anomalous that a turbine should pay 5 per cent., whilst in another part of the Tariff it is provided that an engine doing similar work should pay 20 per cent.",48

Personally, I should prefer that both paid 20 per cent. I do not know whether the Treasurer has provided for every exemption that it is desirable to provide for. There are other industries affected by this Tariff whose tools of trade are not exempted at all. I resisted efforts to get the tools and machinery of the hat-making industry placed on the exempt list; and why should I vote for a high duty for the benefit of the engineering trade, and not for a duty for the benefit of the tool maker? The engineering people' have no greater right to have their tools exempt than have those engaged in other industries. As to pulley blocks and travelling blocks, I was under the impression that those terms covered wood split pulleys. But is that so ?",49

To make them free so far as the United Kingdom is concerned It seems a is a very empty concession indeed. I hope that the Treasurer will give no undue preference to the engineering trade. If those engaged in it receive Tariff assistance, they The honourable should be prepared to give proper Tariff assistance to those who make their tools.

If it means not elsewhere included in item 164, it means that all machines, except those mentioned in paragraph A will pay 30 or 25 per cent. But there are other machines mentioned in other parts of the Tariff which are dutiable at different rates. For instance, in item 166, ""machinery and machines and machine tools,"" there are a number of machines which are dutiable at 25 and 20 per cent.

We have .already placed chains on the free list, and I am sure that the honourable member for Bendigo would not expect me to inquire personally into all the details 'of every item, and to be able to say, as the result of personal investigation, whether pulley blocks can or cannot be made here.

374,Sir JOHN QUICK,AYES,We are not bound by their suggestions.,51
375,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AYES,"No ; but as a rule I accept the suggestions of my officers, and throw the responsibility upon them. If I can say of my own knowledge that a proposal is wrong, I alter it. I do not know of any establishment where pulley blocks are made. When last in Sydney I visited a ship chandler's store, with a view to making a purchase for my son, and was there informed that pulley blocks were not made in Australia. These are my reasons for including pulley blocks in this item. Mr TILLEY . BRO.WN (Indi) [8.53I There is a footnote to this division setting forth that items 164 and 166, amongst others, are -"" subject to rebate under the. conditions specified in the schedule hereto;'', and on turning to the schedule, we find, that in respectof certain imported machinery the full duty paid is to be refunded. It seems to me that there will be great confusion .unless some further amendment be made. The term n.e.i. is always confusing t-> merchants, and is really a dragnet provision. In the schedule to the Tariff, we find that the full duty, paid under items 164 and 166 on- Machinery and parts thereof used in manufacture of fibrous materials and felt, felt hats, when installed for use mill, or n hat factory, for the manufacture of such materials, felt, and hatswill be refunded. Item 166 also machines used in the tanning of hides and skins, and it seems to me that the rebate seem to proposals of the Government might also be extended to them.

377,Mr TILLEY BROWN,AYES,"Indi) [8.56I T think that the proposal to grant a rebate in respect of the duty paid on certain machinery is most improper. The hat-making industry in some cases has been granted the protection of a duty amounting to 150 per. cent., and yet it is proposed to allow rebate in respect of the machinery used in that industry, while, at the same time, the claims of the mining community are ignored. I am afraid to speak of the "" primary producer,"" for I notice that whenever I . do refer to it some of the newspapers, whether if be true or not, report that my statement is received with laughter.

' Mr HUTCHISON (Hindmarsh) [9:40]. - The honourable member for Barrier wishes to know whether workers are better treated in protectionist America arid Germany than they are in free-trade England. That is not the question before the Com-' mittee. The question is whether it would not be better to have this work dOne in Australia, where we can exercise some supervision, over wages and conditions. ' Mr THOMAS - Then why riot have a duty of 25 per cent, all round?",55
413,Mr HUTCHISON,AYES,"It is my desire that there should be a duty of 25 per cent, all round; and 1 was endeavouring to show why we could not have such a duty, when the House adjourned for dinner. The reason is that we have honourable members like the representative for Echuca",55
414,The CHAIRMAN,AYES,Order! ',55
415,Mr HUTCHISON,AYES,"I desire to show the reason why we cannot have a duty of 25 per cent, all round. We have honourable members like the representative for Echuca, who says he is a protectionist, but who votes for a duty of 15 per cent. We have honourable members like the representative of Flinders, who goes to the country and says that he is a protectionist The'. CHAIRMAN - The honourable member must see that if I allow him to proceed on this personal line it may lead to a long and irrelevant discussion. I must ask the honourable member to discontinue that line of argument.",55
416,Mr HUTCHISON,AYES,"Then I shall take another line of argument. I am in favour of a duty of 25 per cent, all round; but there are honourable members who went before the country as protectionists, like the . honourable member for Flinders, the honourable member for Kooyong, self and",55
417,The CHAIRMAN,AYES,Order !,55
418,Mr HUTCHISON,AYES,"I desire to show, as I think I am entitled to do, why we not have a duty of 25 per cent, all round. After the interjection of orable member for Barrier, I think that he will vote for the imposition of a cent, duty all round. I should be very sorry-to see the rate reduced to 20 per cent. This is one of the most important items in the Tariff, and 25. per cent, ought to be the minimum duty levied upon it .",55
419,Mr THOMAS,AYES,Will the honourable member answer my question in reference to Germany and England?,55
420,Mr HUTCHISON,AYES,"I will, if the Chairman will permit me to do so. The honourable member would rather extend a preference to a foreign country than to his own country. I want to give my first preference to Australia, and mv second to the Empire. If the Empire cannot produce what we want, then I am prepared to get it from that part of the world where it can be obtained at the lowest price.  this evening the honourable member', f o i Hindmarsh has attacked me. If the hon- "" orable member would limit his attention to his relations with his own constituency, and allow me to look after mine, he would have quite enough»to do. He is accustomed to dub every man who will not vote for the precise duty which he desires a free-trader. Is that a logical position to take up ? Why this hysterical demand for these excessive duties? It is high time that the country awoke to the fact that the demand is being made simply to enable the Government to pass on the benefit of these duties to the employees in the form of the new protection.",55
421,Mr WISE,AYES,The honourable member does not object to the workers getting a fair share of that benefit?  to read a short extract from the report of a deputation which waited upon the Minis- . ter of Trade and Customs yesterday in regard to the Excise duty upon agricultural implements. The CHAIRMAN.'-The honourable member will not be in order in referring to that matter.,55
422,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,AYES,"The honourable but who, member must not trv to bully me.  are the very best' of friends. I would no more dream of attempting to bully him than he would of attempting to bully me or any one else. In replying to the deputation canwhich waited upon him yesterday, the Minister of Trade and Customs said that it was the honnecessary to exercise caution The "" CHAIRMAN - The honourable 25 per member must not read the extract.  the members of a certain party in this House are being induced to support higher protective duties than they would otherwise support, because of the promise of the Government to introduce certain legislation, which legislation, I venture to say, will prove to be absolutely unconstitutional. That is the price which the country is paying today for the promise which has been made by the Government- a promise which is never likely to be carried into effect.

425,Mr FRAZER,AYES,"Kalgoorlie) [10.0] - In view of a certain standard having been adopted in regard to articles n.e.i., I desire to mention that there is a particular description of machinery which is used in the NOES. Commonwealth, but which, beyond a certain capacity, has not yet been satisfactorily manufactured here. I want honourable members to give consideration to those mining companies which are dealing with low-grade ores, in many cases in an extensive way. In order that they may be able to realise sufficient gold with which to carry on their works, I move That the following new paragraph be added to the amendmentTellers: ""(c) A i r compressors beyond a capacity of 1,000 cubic feet of free air per minute, ad val. Thomson, John. (General Tariff), 5 per cent.; (United Kingdom), PAIRS. free."" I have had personal experience in regard to aii compressors and engines, and, therefore, I have a fair idea of what can be reasonably done by our manufacturers. The best advice I cw get is that the manufacturing plants in ""Australia can produce satisfactory machinery up to a certain capacity, but that the limited quantity of machinery beyond that capacity which is required is not sufficient. to justify the the enormous expenditure which has often to by be incurred in order to produce a single machine of such size. I am informed that it may cost as much for patterns and designs to produce' one machine as it would cost to produce six machines."" According to the best information I can get, air compressors with a capacity of 1,000 cubic feet of free air per minute can drive ten or twelve drills, - which, as lionorable members know, is beyond the requirements of the majority of ordinary mines. We ought to make it possible for such machines to be obtained from the markets of the world. - Mr WATSON - I am informed that air compressors up to a large capacity can be .made here. -. Mr Frazer - I am assured that, on a commercial basis, an air compressor with a capacity of 1,000 cubic feet of free air per minute is the extreme size which local manufacturers will undertake to make. The limited demand for air compressors beyond that capacity does not justify them incurring the expense of procuring patterns and designs. - Mr COON (Batman) [10.7] - I may inform the honourable member for'Kalgoorlie that air compressors with a capacity of not 1,000, but 4,000 cubic feet of free air per minute, have been made at Bendigo, Castlemaine. and Melbourne, in Victoria, and also in South Australia, and that such a machine may be seen working today at .the Long Tunnel mine.",56
426,Sir JOHN QUICK,AYES,"Bendigo) [10.8] In South Australia, Mr John Felix Martin, of the Gawier Foundry, was asked his opinion about the evidence given by a Kalgoorlie mining manager to the effect that the Ingersoll-Sargent air compressor was more efficient than an Australian-made one. According to the report. of the A section of the Tariff Commission, page 41, Mr. Martin explained that it was all a matter of price, which varied according to the required capacity of the machine. An Ingersoll-Sergeant compressor could be goi in Australia, asthat company was not the' only maker. He claimed that his compressor could he made as efficient as any imported one working in'Australia. Another South Australian engineer used these significant words-To say that mechanics who built, locomotive engines in South Australia, Victoria, ancl land cannot make an. air compressor is to talk nonsense - Mr Frazer - To whom did they supply Similar eviderce was given on behalf of - Walker's Limited, of Maryborough, QueenslandThe engineer for Walker's Limited, Maryborough, informed your Commissioners (in regard lo evidence given by Mr Moss in Western Australia, that locally-made air compressors were not as good as imported)- that this gentleman told him the air compressor which he had supplied had done 25 per cent, better than anticipated. The witness stated that he had made air compressors for the Broken Hill South, Broken Hill North, Block 14, and three other mines on the Barrier, and the indicator cards had shown them equal lo the highest class made in England or America, namely, 95 per cent, of efficiency.",57
427,Mr FRAZER,AYES,"Will the honourable member state the capacity of those compressors ? Sir . JOHN QUICK -^-There was no evidence given about the capacity, and that .point was not taken at Kalgoorlie. Only the question of price was raised there. I have no doubt whatever that air compressor's of the capacity referred to by the honourable member can be made in some of the big engineering establishments in . South Australia, Victoria, and Queensland. The Golden. Horseshoe Mine gave to an outside firm an order for an air compressor without - calling for tenders in Australia, and with reference to that order, Mr. Rigby, of the Austral Otis Company, has made this statement in a letter which he sent to meThere is no reason whatever why a compressor in every respect similar to the one they had imported could not be made in Australia, and I have no hesitation in saying that if they called for tenders for a duplicate it would be supplied locally for very much less than this one had cost the Golden Horseshoe. There is a challenge to the honourable member for Kalgoorlie.",57
428,Mr SALMON,AYES,"Laanecoorie)'[t0.1 2] I sincerely hope that the Committee will not agree to the amendment. At Castlemaine I have been in Thompson's up to-date foundry, where I suppose more air ""compressors are turned out than are made by any other foundry in Australia. I have seen as many as five being laid, clown at one time. They are made there up to almost any capacity which may be used, ancl they are of . the finest quality.",57
429,Mr FRAZER,AYES,'What is the highest capacity up to which they are made?,57
430,Mr SALMON,AYES,"They can be made up Queens- to a capacity of 4,000 cubic feet of free air per minute. such air compressors?""",57
431,Mr SALMON,AYES,At the foundry they can make air compressors up to that.size. '- ' Mr Frazer - To whom did they supply them?,57
432,Mr SALMON,AYES,"I have not seen their books, and do not know whom the air pressors were supplied to.",58
433,Mr FRAZER,AYES,The honourable member does not know anything about it.,58
434,Mr SALMON,AYES,"I have the authority of the men themselves for stating that are capable of making air compressors up Limited, saysto a capacity of 4,000 cubic feet of free air per minute.",58
435,Mr FRAZER,AYES,I am satisfied that some honourable members will make any sort of statement.,58
436,Mr SALMON,AYES,"I . am very sorry that, the honourable member is adopting that attitude. At Thompson's foundry, Castleillustrated maine, I - have seen these air comOctober pressors in course of construction, and I have been assured by those Blayney who use them that, they are equal, if not superior, to imported air compressors. On these grounds, I ask honourable bers not to agree to the amendment, but .to.assist us in maintaining the supremacy we have - gained, and also to increase the industry. A great deal has been said the past about the inability of local manufacturers to make these articles, but any honourable member who will visit Thompout of his Tariff. son's foundry at Castlemaine will, I feel sure, find one or more of these air pressors in the course of construction, and also see documents in which the users them speak in the highest terms of their efficiency and durability. ' That magnificompressor cent foundrv known as Walker's Limited, pany Maryborough, in Queensland, also manufactures these articles, and of the highest quality too. Unless they are made well to withstand the strain which is put upon them they will not give satisfaction. We have proof that they are made to the complete satisfaction of the users, and would be nothing short of a criminal act if we took away from the manufacturers the opportunity they have to prove that Australian workmen are equal to the workmen whom the world can produce. ",58
437,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AYES,Hume-Trea - ally surer) [10.15] - I think that there must a mistake in the minds of some honourable fitably made here. members in regard to the manufacture of air compressors in Australia. The honto make them. orable member for Kalgoorlie has said that they are not made here. A very large one has been made here. I have been trying to ascertain its capacity. - Mr Frazer - Did the honourable gentleis man state that I said that air compressors are not made here? .,58
438,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AYES,"I understood comthe honourable member to say that air compressors of the capacity mentioned in his amendment are not made here. But Mr Donald Clark, in his work on Australian Mining and Metallurgy, page 55, they speaking of the Kalgurli Gold Mines The mine is well equipped with a fine winding engine, and an'air compressor made by James Martin and Co., of Gawier, South Australia. The size of the compressor is not given; but I am assured'that it is larger than 1,000 cubic feet. I am informed, too, that an air compressor of 3,000 cubic feet is in the Brisbane Daily Mail of 5th, 1907, as supplied to the pany, Copper Mine's and Smelting ComBlayney, New South Wales, and manufactured . by the Bundaberg Foundry memCompany Limited, Queensland. Though I should like to meet any reasonable objections to my proposals, I cannot accept the amendment, seeing that compressors pf in large capacity are made in Australia ",58
439,Mr MATHEWS,AYES,I hope that the Treasurer will not allow the eyes - to be picked,58
440,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AYES,"I shall cercomtainly not allow it,' though I may be forced to if the numbers are against me. I of am also informed that the Austral Otis Company has made a 3,500 cubic feet for the Long Tunnel Com",58
441,Mr KNOX,AYES,"Kooyong) [10.19] - I wis* 1 to inform the Committee that in the Mount Lyell mine we had a compressor of a capacity of 3,500 cubic feet, and that it was made in Victoria. It is an excellent it piece of machinery. There is no reason why compressors should not be made here.",58
442,Mr SPENCE,AYES,"Darling) [10.20] - We are all glad to know that Australia can best make these machines. The question at issue is, not whether air-compressors can be made here, but whether the exceptionlarge ones which the honourable membe ber for Kalgoorlie has in .mind can be pro",58
443,Sir JOHN QUICK,AYES,I have read an offer,58
444,Mr SPENCE,AYES,"That offer did not contain any mention of capacity. Those who know anything about mining are aware that in dealing with low-grade lodes machineryneeded such as it is not reasonable to expect to get in Australia. Evidence given before the Tariff Commission shows that' one-fifth of the cost of a pieoe of machinery goes in preparing preliminary plans, and it would not be fair to expect an engineering firm to undertake the expense necessary to turn out a big piece of machinery, such as. it would not be called upon to make again for a number of years. I do not know enough about the air compressors which are in use to be able to say whether the honourable member for Kalgoorlie has fixed a proper limit; but consideration should be given where machines of an exceptional size are required. When high duties are imposed on machinery which cannot be made here, a heavy tax' is levied on the mining industry, without corresponding benefit to Australia. I am glad that the Minister has been able to give us some definite information.",58
445,Mr FRAZER,AYES,"(Kalgoorlie) [10.22] When I brought forward my proposal, my only desire was to do what is fair in the interests of mining. There are not, on my information, many more than twenty air compressors of over 1,000 cubic feet capacity in the mines of Australia at the present time. A compressor which will deal with 1,006 cubic feet of free air per minute can drive ten three-inch cylinder rock drills, and not many mines use so many drills at one time. When a mining proposition has to deal with a large quantity of low-grade ore, it must - reduce its costs to a mimimum. No doubt there are manufacturers in Victoria who would proclaim their ability to make any machinery that the most fertile imagination in the Committee could conceive of. But there is such a small demand for machines *of the size of which I am speaking, that it would not pay Australian manufacturers to go to the expense of making preparations, for constructing them. Of course, my statement is disputed. Any statement made' on behalf . of the mining industry, no matter how substantiated by facts, is almost sure to be disputed, either by a reference to something contained in the 6,050 pages of the Tariff Commission's reports, or by the statement of the representative of a constituency in which there_ is a foundry or engineering establishment of some description. . My proposal applies to big machinery only, and there are in Australia very few of the machines which it affects. They are being used on low-grade propositions, which are being worked as economically as possible, although the men employed on them are 'being paid a decent rate of wages. If the amendment be agreed to, the engineering trade of Australia will not be seriously affected, because the demand for these engines is so small that local manufacturerswould not find it worth their while to make them.",59
446,Mr MATHEWS,AYES,"Melbourne Ports> [10.27] - The honourable member for Kalgoorlie says that he believes.that representatives of the constituencies in which there are foundries-are ready to assert that anything can be made there, which is equivalent to saying that members will make misstatements in order to get their way. I do not know whether the honourable member would like us to doubt the truth of his statements. I have here a photograph bf a Cross Compound Air Compressor of 2,000 cubic feet capacity, capable of driving twenty drills, and designed and manufactured for the Long Tunnel mine, Walhalla, by the Austral Otis Engineering Company Limited, of South Melbourne; and another photograph of steam cylinders fitted with triple expansion valves and air cylinders, with improved Corliss air valves. The manager of the Long Tunnel Gold Mining Company, in a letter to the Austral Otis Engineering Company, dated Walhalla, 22nd July, 1807, saysI have great pleasure in stating that the double compound and condensing air compressing engine which was constructed by your firm, and latelyerected at the company's mine, has given every satisfaction. For tie past three months it has been at work night and day, without a hitch of any kind, and during that time has supplied all the compressed air, at n o lbs. pressure per square inch, required in the mine for motive power, pumping, winding, and rock drilling, at a depth of 1,822 teet below the adit level. I consider that the whole plant is of the finest class, and is constructed on the most modern and improved principles for aifT ""compression, namely, high and low pressure air cylinders with mechanically moved suction and delivery valves, and the steam engine, compound and surface condensing. The indicator diagrams, which have been taken from both the engine and compressor cylinders, show that the whole machine is working in a thoroughly satisfactory manner, giving a very high economy' and efficiency. But some honourable members will not believe the statements made to them, nomatter what proofs, are put before them. If they were shown these engines, they would find fault with them, unless there was the name of a foreign firm attached to them. I do not think that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie does credit to the State which he represents when he tries remake the Committee believe that Australians cannot do anything. It seems to cue that the time will come when Australians will say that they cannot have their wants made known, iri the Houses of Parliament. It is a wonder to me that the advocates of the importers, are not imported - as well as the mechanical - contrivances needed in Australia. I hope that this . Committee will not allow the vital points of - the Tariff to be picked, out so as to make the whole scheme useless. I have noticed - during the debate a tendency to pick out portions of it . for special attack. I trust that the Committee will strenuously resist the attempt to eliminate air compressing engines. Amendment of the amendment negatived. . Mr THOMAS BROWN (Calare) £10.31] - I desire to speak upon item 164 before it is finally dealt with, and to refer to the manner in which the Minister's scheme is formulated. Lines are mentioned which are.placed on the free list so far as concerns the United Kingdom, and which .are dutiable so far as the rest of the world is concerned. Other mining machinery of all descriptions comes under the general n.e.i. drag-net, which, by a recent vote of the Committee, has been reduced from 30 and 25 to 25 and 20 per cent. I wish to emphasize the point that a large percentage of the minerals that have to be dealt with in this country are low-grade ores. Every now and then some new method of treating such ores is discovered, which enables very large quantities to be treated successfully. AVithout such methods those ores could not be profitably treated. The improvements are very largely mechanical contrivances adapting electricity and chemical processes to the treatment of ores. Under the Minister's proposal no new method of that character devised outside Australia, and covered by patent rights, could be used here Avithout the oavment of royalties to the patentees in addition to taxation at the higher rate. In this way the mining industry would be seriously handicapped. I might mention as an instance the cyanide process. Prior to that process being discovered, a great quantity of low-grade stuff in the Commonwealth was unused. By the introduction of the cyanide process .and the appliances connected with it , large .areas of mineral country were rendered highly profitable. In my own electorate, - enormous quantities of tailings from the old mining fields have been successfully treated several times, yielding a profit each time; and'on each occasion the method applied represented an improvement upon the preced6719 ing one. But under the proposal of the Minister, new mechanical appliances would be penalized by having to pay the higher scale of duties.",59
447,Mr SALMON,AYES,"What appliances does the , honourable, member mean in regard to cyaniding ?",60
448,Mr THOMASBROWN,AYES,I am referring to any appliances which may be discovered in any part of the world for the more economical and profitable treatment of mineral ores.,60
449,Mr MATHEWS,AYES,It would be possible to buy the patent rights or pay royalties to the patentees.,60
450,Mr THOMAS BROWN,AYES,"The patentees would have a good deal to say as to what would have to be paid to them. The honourable member is probably aware that machines are being used in the boot factories of this city upon the rent system, by which the patentees, who refuse to sell their patent rights, secure considerable returns. If I may diverge for a moment, I take up this position in regard to patent rights: I think that we should under our law insist on the manufacture of patented machines in our midst, or that the patents should become invalid. But we have not reached that position - yet. We recognise patent rights taken out in all parts of the world. Underthis scheme, we are practically going to penalize our own people who are engaged in the mining industry in regard to the use of newer, more up-to-date, and more economical methods of treating ores. The Minister might overcome the difficulty 'by putting in a paragraph that would allow him to permit the introduction of new forms of machinery on the lower scale, until such time as they could be manufactured here. I quite agree that it is not wise to put too. much power in the hands of the Minister, but we have to nlace power somewhere, and so long as it is used ,in the best interests of the community, no objection can be taken to it. I point out that countries which are soaked in protection-that are not experimenting with it , , but have had practical applications of it , and are further advanced in the arts and sciences than we are-pa y greater regard' to their mineral development than we propose to do under this Tariff. In New Zealand, very nearly all the large machinery used in mining and mineral recovery is on the free list. The same is the case in Canada. Cyanidinsr plants are upon the free list there, as are a large enumeration of mechanical contrivances for the profitable treatment of mineral ores, in; eluding gold, silver, and iron ores. .Surely, - dependent as we. are to such a large extent upon our mineral resources for our wealth, i we ought to have a little, regard to these - interests. Whilst the total amount of wealth realized from mining is very large, it must be remembered 'that a great number of mining propositions are working very close . up to the paying margin, . and that even a slightly increased impost might make their operations unprofitable, . and cause them to shut down - In these . circumstances it should be our desire to encourage, as far as possible, instead of to penalize the industry. Under the Trea- surer's ""«roposal everv new invention that . cannot be' produced here, and must be . imported to facilitate mining operations, will come under the drag-net n.e.i. provision, and be liable to the higher duty. - The Minister would do well to insert in - the item a new paragraph enabling him to allow new inventions, calculated to assist us to make the best of our mineral resources, and which cannot be made here, to come in free.",60

T wish to be quite clear that that note is : no part of the item, and that in passing the item we are not pledging ourselves -' the rebate referred to.

It seems to me that, in any event, that procedure would have be followed. I do not think that honourable members would agree to allow the Government to say what should be free and what should be dutiable. .My experience .is that the' House is very jealous of its privileges in that ""regard. I am often told that as I am a protecSkins tionist I would, if left to myself, protective duties upon many articles. the same way it might be said that a freemany trade Minister would be. disposed - to articles on the free list.",62
466,Mr THOMAS BROWN,AYES,It could not be any worse than it is under the present vision.,62

Sir WILLIAM ' LYNE (Hume-Trea surer) [10.52] - l n accordance with a. promise given very early during the consideration of the Tariff, I intend to move that the words "" Machinery for Scouring and Washing Wool "" be left out. I was asked by tool, or the honourable member for Maranoa why this class of machinery should not he in- of eluded with other wool-scouring machinery to which he referred at the time. I admit be that, so far as I know, there is no reason it should not, and I therefore move - admitted duty free, the amendment.",62

471,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AYES,"Robertson) [10.54] - The Minister might very well agree also to leave out the item, "" Machines n.e.i. used in the' Tanning of Hides and and in the Preparation of Leather."" impose Very few machines used by tanners are In made in Australia. There are a great machines in use in America which, if put they could be obtained here, would enable our tanners to produce' leather j which is the raw material of the shoemaker,. at a lower profigure, and would in that way benefit the shoemaker.",62
472,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AYES,"I hope the honor: if able member will .not press me to, ""do what",62
473,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AYES,"The Treasurer to must see that there would be such a small demand for machinery of this kind that no' effect manufacturer would be warranted in importing the special appliances necessary to make these tanners' machines in the. Commonwealth - Manufacturers in America have the, a population of 80,000,000 or 90,000,000 the of people to provide for, and they have the' very best machinery for treating .. leather. A few days ago the Treasurer 1 was talking to me about a splitting maany chine. ' I know the machine - referred to.. the It is - an, American Bandmachine, and it. . is possible with if to cut a hide right"" through into two or three thicknesses. is a comparatively recent invention. There was a Union machine - in use prior to the discovery of the Band machine, by which only one layer could be taken off a hide. Cut in this way the leather would, of course, be inferior, but there is a demand for this kind of leather in the manufacture of boots and shoes, and Australian manufacturers are at a disadvantage so long as our tanners and curriers are unable to obtain the machine to which I refer. I may have something further to say when I have heard the Minister on the subject.",62

I enter my protest against that proposal. These machines are made in my electorate, and I was told some time ago that they were not to be admitted free - of duty.",63
475,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AYES,This matter under consideration two months ago.,63
476,Mr COON,AYES,Why should wool-scouring machines be allowed to come in free?,63
477,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AYES,Some of them have been free all along.,63

The Minister ought to make a statement, at this stage as to the exemption of special machinery for hat and wool factories.",63
481,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AYES,"If I say two words,, it gives rise to a long debate, and, therefore I had better say nothing..",63

484,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AYES,"-If the Trea- I under- surer will say that, I shall be satisfied. I should think the industries themselves do not desire a special favour. Strange to say, the Minister has taken certain articles out of the special line dealing with that machinery, and included them in this item. I refer to machinery for scouring and* washing wool, and for the manufacture of was paper and for felting.",63
485,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AYES,I .am proposing to take out machinery for scouring and washing wool.,63
486,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AYES,"I wish the Treasurer - to make them all pay alike. Whatever is done, let them all be classified together. We should not single out the hat manufacturer.",63

The question ot tanning machinery and tools was debated for nearly a. week during the consideration of the last Tariff, and the then Minister decided to put them on the free list. He - found that they were not being made in Melbourne. Some tanning machines are being made here, but some of them are obsolete - Now these things are sneaked in again under this general item. In the last Tariff nearly all the different machines were itemized, but now they are brought together in this innocent form. A number of these - tanning machines are patented and are not made here, and cannot be done without. They must be imported, no matter what duties are imposed.

Amendment (by Sir 'WILLIAM LYNE) proposed-That the words "" Machinery for Scouring and Washing W o o l "" be l e ft outl",64
498,Mr MAHON,AYES,"Coolgardie) [11.12] The action of the Treasurer in submitting this amendment is very remarkable. So far as I can judge, the wool industry is well^able to pay any impost of the kind.",64
499,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AYES,And so should mining be.,64
500,Mr MAHON,AYES,"We are not dealing with mining now; when we were the Treasurer was adamant against any such concession as he now proposes. In the 1902 Tariff this machinery was in the free list, but in a' totally The Comdifferent form from that now proposed, seeing that it was placed there along with a 26 number of other items. In the 1902 Tariff the exemption read as follows10 Machinery for Scouring, Washing, Carding, Spinning, Weaving, and Finishing the Manu16 facture of Fibrous Materials. That covers much more ground than the particular exemption sought to be introduced now.",64
501,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AYES,"Hume-Trea surer) [11.13] - Perhaps the honourable member will allow me to explain that this particular machinery will come under a new item which I propose to follow item 166, embracing machinery and parts, and accessories used in the treatment, manufacture, and finishing of fibrous materials, and felt, and felt hats. The new item will embiace those other items to which the honourable member referred.",65
502,Mr MAHON,AYES,"Coolgardie) [ n . 14] - I object to those articles being made free, cause the industries concerned are quite capable of paying their share of taxation. Furthermore, 1 understand that this machinery can ""be manufactured with commercial advantage within the Commonwealth. The honourable member for Batman informs me that wool scouring machinery is made in his electorate.",65
503,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AYES,"I make the proposal because the honourable, member for Batman informed me that machinery for wool scouring in the woollen mills came in free, while the machinery used for scouring in the ordinary way was dutiable.",65
504,Mr MAHON,AYES,"The Treasurer has the remedy iri 'his own hands, inasmuch as he can impose a duty on both. Protectionists who desire to be logical and consistent must resist the Treasurer's proposal and support me in mv determination.",65
505,Mr WATSON,AYES,"South Sydney) [11.20]. - I cannot reconcile the attitude taken up by the Government on this question with their attitude a few moments ago in reference to tanning machinery. I voted against the exemption of that machinery from duty, because I think .that all machine tools should be placed upon exactly the same footing.",65
506,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AYES,The Minister has promised to exempt machine tools enumerated in this item.,65
507,Mr WATSON,AYES,"But I understand that whilst hat-making machinery is to be takenout of the free list and subjected to a duty, wool-weaving machinery .is to remain in the list of special exemptions.  cord to the woollen industry?",65

' Mr WATSON - I intend to vote to impose a slightly heavier duty upon yarns,, so as to prevent their importation. All I claim is that we ought to impose a uniform duty upon every class of machine tool.",65
509,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AYES,Irrespective of whether or not they can be made here.,65
510,Mr WATSON,AYES,"Does anybody suggest that wool-washing machinery cannot be made in the Commonwealth?  Hall's patent wool. scourer is not made in Australia. Mr (WATSON./-That is true. ' But cloes the honourable member say that a woolbescouring machine, which is one of the simplest pieces of machinery imaginable, cannot be made in the Commonwealth ?",65
511,Mr COON,AYES,They are made here.,65
512,Mr WATSON,AYES,"I can understand that some machines which. I have seen working are made locally.  is made in Australia, but that machine cannot be compared with Hall's patent woolscourer.",65
513,Mr WATSON,AYES,"I say that all machine tools should be placed in the same category, no matter for what purpose they may be used. I am in receipt of a letter from' some tanners 'in New South Wales, in which they express themselves as being ready to pay a duty upon their machinery so long as other imachinery is treated in the same way. That is a reasonable attitude to take up. I shall vote against the Government's proposal.
