0,NA,Unknown,"Club. Twice in the last 18 months-regretfully, on the passing of former prime ministers Whitlam and Fraser, when the House suspended as a mark of respect to those fine men-as a keen golfer Don took the opportunity to reach out to members from all around this great country who like playing golf and said, 'Let's go down and mark our respect and have a game of golf.' He spent a lot of time on the golf course, but he was a hacker. He was not a great golfer by any stretch of the imagination, but he would give it his best. I would hope that one of the traditions that Don's passing leaves in this place is that, when time permits, members of this House-and I know the Western Australian members will join me in this-have some type of memorial day or recognition day for Don conducted at the Royal Perth Golf Club. We will take some members of the press with us who have played with Don and members who have previously played either directly or indirectly with Don. I think there are about 12 or 15. I would like to propose that that happen at a point in the future so we can acknowledge and remember Don's contribution to this place and, like all good golfers, sledge him as hard as we can, because that is what you do on a golf course. Don's commitment to this place was vast and varied. He sat on a number of committees, He sat on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment and Workplace Relations. I sit on the Standing Committee on Economics because small business is my background. But Don's background was as a schoolteacher, an educator. Wanting people to be better tomorrow than they are today, Don was also a natural fit for the Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Workforce Participation. He was also part of the Joint Statutory Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Account; the Standing Committee on Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government; and the Standing Committee of Privileges and Members' Interests. When he went onto the local government committee, Western Australia was a growing, emerging state and, as we heard in speeches today from members, he was always in the minister's office advocating for his electorate, shouldered by either a mayor or groups he was sincerely advocating for. It is ironic that he sat on the privileges and members' interests committee, because everyone will remember the issue that got Don got into hot water fortravelling from Western Australia to Cairns, spending time with a colleague up there. Entitlements will always haunt this place. Don was no stranger to it. During the Howard government, he held the position of Chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration. He has been most recently a member of the Standing Committee on Procedure. Under this procedure portfolio, he had just undertaken a comprehensive review of the Federation Chamber, which the Deputy Speaker, in the chair at the moment, presides over. He had just presided over a review of electronic use of equipment in the chamber, conducting roundtables with the members of this place. He religiously attended the Selection Committee-the committee that determines the private business that comes before the House-and always had comments to offer. Don was a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. I think it was the trade part of that that blew back Don's hair. His relationships internationally extended to the Parliamentary Friends of Japan and the Australia-Cuba parliamentary friends group, and it was lovely to see that the ambassador for Cuba, who Don had a very strong relationship with, attended Don's funeral. His Excellency will not mind me sharing with the parliament that he stood at Don's coffin, put his hand on the coffin and  blubbered and cried for the loss of a friend and the loss of a friend of Cuba, because that is what Don was. Don was also chair of the Sri Lanka friendship group. I had the opportunity today to catch up with one of Don's colleagues from Sri Lanka, Noel, and I have given him a personal commitment that I will do my best to fulfil the duties Don was doing. I will try and take up that role, because any work Don has done in this place was invaluable. In opposition, Don was the shadow parliamentary secretary for local government before he was the shadow parliamentary secretary for roads and transport. Prior to that, Don held the positions of shadow cabinet secretary and shadow parliamentary secretary assisting the Leader of the Opposition, as well as the shadow parliamentary secretary for energy and resources. So he was across a number of portfolios. I associate myself with all the comments of my colleagues today in acknowledging the passing of a good man. On his corflute was written 'You talk and I will listen'. When I saw that, I thought, 'I might use that; that's a good idea, 'you talk and I will listen'. He took Canning from being a marginal seat to a very safe seat. Speaking at the funeral, his children, Tess and Elliott, gave an account of a dad who was a great dad, a dad who will be sorely missed. It was an emotional day. It is my intention to take a copy from Hansard of each of the speeches that have been given here today by members on both sides of the House. It is my intention to have them bound. It is my intention to have each of the members who have made a contribution here today personally sign their speeches. Then, with the approval of the House, I will send that to the family as a gift from this place, as a reminder of every word that has been said in this place by every member, so that it will be kept and held as a memento for the family. I thank you for the opportunity to speak. Don Randall, my mate, rest in peace. I hope my handicap gets better and, if it does, it will be as a result of your tuition.",115
1,Mr ROBERT,Unknown," I thank the member for La Trobe for his patience. I just wish to make two remarks about our good friend Don Randall. Don Randall was the first MP I met when I walked into this place in 2007. We came down to the party room meeting and he was the first MP I bumped into, not knowing anyone. The first thing Don did was to welcome me into his office, break some bread, and he had been a great colleague ever since. We heard the member for Dickson, Minister Dutton, speak about a group every Tuesday morning that would go out for lunch, after party room and before the House began with question time. It is something we should consider bringing back again, having the House start a bit later on that Tuesday. Those less informed-on the Left he was referring to my good friend the member for Moncrieff-called us the 'book burners club'. It was sound and suitable members of the Right-I was one of them-who for a number of years always went out, mostly to Timmy's, and broke bread together. He was a tremendous man. He was a man of humanity, he never left people out-he was an inclusive sort of guy-and he was taken from us far too early. He was a man known for controversy and not a man known for political correctness, but he was an extraordinary colleague, he was a good friend and we will certainly miss him. ",116
2,Mr WOOD,Unknown," I also would like to pass on my condolences and lament with Julie, the wife of Don, and Tess and Elliott. It is quite bizarre that I was actually sitting down with Don and Tess last sitting at the Italian ambassador's residence; I was sitting beside Don. Don was always so very entertaining and, like many colleagues on this side-I would also like to thank those for their comments very much on the other side-I could not believe it when I actually looked on the online media to see the passing of Don Randall. In actual fact I was very upset, like all members would be. I got to know Don in particular when we sat beside each other in the opposition as shadow parliamentary secretaries. The role I took up was always to advise Don: 'Don't do that. I wouldn't do that; I wouldn't say that.' He used to always run in interjection, 'I'm thinking about saying this,' and I would say, 'Don, I don't think you should do that.' Even with the cardboard cut-out of Kevin Rudd, he said, 'I'm going to do this,' and I said, 'Don, I don't know about that.' He said, 'Oh, I'm just going to do it; would you just bear with us-I am going to do it.' And he would do it. Don would never be the person who would let anything go by without putting his hand up and putting himself first. One thing in this place-there are not many people like Don, and what he would try to do is engage everyone. Don would always invite you out for dinner and always crack it when you would not come out to dinner with him. To the member for Bonner, my friend Ross Vasta-congratulations, Ross, for putting your hand up for Speaker today-Don would be looking down in this place on you and thinking 'job well done'. I love that motto, 'You talk and I'll listen,' because, as Prime Minister said, in the party room it was 'everyone listen to Don'. Don would always say what he believed and what he felt. I always used to say he would be a great detective, and he used to say, 'Why is that?' I would say, 'Don, because you've got your heart in the right place, you never give up and you look after other people.' That is why he was a fantastic local member for Canning and did such an amazing job. He would always be talking about Sri Lanka and Cuba, and I remember recently-it was actually earlier this year-walking past a committee room and Don grabbed me and said, 'Come and meet the Cuban ambassador.' I said, 'Oh, I am in a bit of a hurry.' He goes, 'Haven't you got a heap of Cubans in your electorate?' I said, 'I don't think I've got any.' He said, 'Oh, okay. Well, we're giving out free alcohol.' I said, 'Don, I'm not drinking at the moment.' And Don goes, 'Woody, just come in here!' So we came in and met the Cuban ambassador. But that is the type of bloke he was-he would basically grab you when you were in a hurry and bring a bit of peace and stability, and have a chat and get you to meet people you normally would not meet. When I heard today he played the violin and tended the roses, I could not believe that. That, I suppose, is a sad thing about this place; quite often we do not hear about the talents and skills of our colleagues until it is in a situation like this. To his family, I cannot imagine what you are going through, but Don's legacy will live on and on and on, because he was that sort of bloke. You just cannot forget everything he has done, and nor should we. So, like many members here today, I truly feel the great loss of Don Randall. Don, if you are looking down now, you are a great mate. You looked after everyone, you will be sadly missed, you have left too early and we will look after your family. Thanks so much. ",117
3,Mr TAYLOR,Unknown," On Tuesday, 21 July I attended the funeral for Alby Schultz-as everyone knows, a great stalwart of the Liberal Party and a man of conviction and commitment. It was on my way home that afternoon that a friend rang me to tell me of Don's death. I did not know Don for as long as many in this House, being a member of the class of 2013, and I did not know him as well as many in the House. But I did know Don in two ways: first, as a member of the Timmys Tuesday lunch group, which others have spoken to and which Don invited me to join based, I guess, on his friendship with my predecessor, Alby Schultz; and second, but perhaps more importantly, sitting next to someone in the House inevitably creates a special relationship, particularly, I suspect, in your first term in the parliament. It has been an extraordinary pleasure to sit next to Don for the last two years. I thought it might be interesting to share some insights that I gleaned in my two wonderful years sitting next to Don here in the parliament. The first is one that we have heard much about. There is no doubt that Don was a man of extraordinary conviction. He never left anyone in doubt about his views. Like my predecessor, he was not shy and retiring in the chamber. I heard from him often-and often I had to put a hand over my left ear because of the noise created by Don when he felt that there was bad behaviour coming from the other side of the chamber. He was, of course, a strong and consistent conservative. I could often identify with Don's view of the world. When I look back at his first speech, there were some real gems. He wanted to see the end of the welfare state mentality, with a greater emphasis on hand-up instead of hand-out. He talked about Australia as a 'land of opportunity, where we can make our own luck'. Hear, hear to that! As a man of conviction, I identified with him very quickly and very positively. But perhaps what is lesser known about him and what I found him to be was an extraordinary mentor. His observations about people on both sides of the House were always worth listening to. He was a great student of politics and, as we have heard from others, a man of great curiosity. Every time. I wrote an opinion piece in one of our national papers, as I am wont to do, I could always be assured that Don would have read it, have questions about it and show great interest in it. That was the mark of the man, because he was primarily, as I said earlier, a man focused on his convictions and on his electorate, but he was always curious about other things. Perhaps most of all I found him to be a man of the people and of his electorate. When I first got into parliament, he said to me, 'How have you enjoyed your time as a candidate?' I said, 'You know, Don, I enjoy it, but I've really surprised myself, because the thing I enjoy most is not standing on a street corner waiting for people to come up and speak to me but going out and knocking on doors.' He said, 'That's a good start, Angus. If you want to know what people really think, don't stand on the street corner; go knock on doors.' Several months ago, Don heard that I had been to dinner with a member of the press gallery. Next day, here in the chamber during question time, he started quizzing me about it. He was a bit disappointed that I would see fit to go and have dinner with a member of the press gallery. He said: 'I've seen lots of people start well in this place, but fewer people finish well. Don't get caught up in that press gallery world. It's a million miles from your electorate.' I certainly hope I can live up to your advice, Don, because you were right. To Don: every time. I look at that seat next to me, I will be reminded of your sharp, dry sense of humour. I will be reminded of a man who made me laugh almost every day, no  matter how bad things were. I will be reminded of your extraordinary mix of conservatism and compassion. And I will be reminded most of all of why I am here-to represent the good people of my electorate. Don, in this place, you started well and finished well. I will miss you.",118
4,Mr ALEXANDER,Unknown," It is my sad pleasure to stand and speak of my friend and colleague Don Randall. I often reflected in my first years in this place that one of the great collateral benefits of this choice of career was that all of a sudden you were surrounded by a whole group of new friends from both sides. One of the first people who, as so many of my colleagues have said, extended that hand of friendship was Don. I remember being invited into his office, and on walking into his office I saw the most beautiful set of golf clubs, which were immaculately cleaned. We started talking, as golfers do, about theories on how to play. The one thing in common that he and I had with Tiger Woods was that we all have our very bad days on the golf course. He took great pleasure in telling me about this method that he had to get onto the course at Royal Canberra Golf Club. We went and played at Royal Canberra, and we played a very similar game of golf. As that game does to you: you have your good days, your bad days, your good holes and your bad holes. The one thing we had in common was that, unlike some golfers who get very upset when they play badly, it did not impact on our conversation, our enjoyment of the game or of each other's company. Nor did it impact on our ability to address our thirst, which had been created by this beautiful game of golf that we had enjoyed, and I believe we had a glass of red wine-maybe we had two. Don loved a yarn. He loved the camaraderie of his many friends here. But he had a serious side. He was a very genuine Australian, a man who befriended us with his ability to be irreverent, which is a great Australian characteristic, but there was a serious side. He had a great love affair for Sri Lanka, and we shared that through my family. My partner's father had been the high commissioner of Sri Lanka, and he had said late in life that the happiest days of his life had been lived in Sri Lanka. While I intended to go to Sri Lanka with Don, that was never the case; but when I eventually get there, I will be traveling with you, Don. It is a hard day for us all to acknowledge the passing of this great man, this great friend, and we have all lamented his passing, but with the presence today of his beautiful family, his lovely children Tess and Elliott and his lovely wife, Julie. Our loss is meagre compared to theirs. So our thoughts and our prayers go with you into the future. You will always have through extension, through that great man, Don, friends here.",119
5,Mr HUTCHINSON,Unknown," When I first got elected, I remember a colleague that I had worked with for many years, by the name of Gilbert Davidson, saying to me, 'Just remember: the constituents in your electorate will be less concerned about what you know; rather, they will want to know that you care.' I think that is something that Don Randall understood very well, because he cared for the people within his electorate. Of course, he cared for his family. I did not know Don terribly well. He had office RG84; I have RG81. Many was the time that, during a division, we would walk down the corridor together. My father, David, also died at the age of 62. It is too young, and life, unfortunately, has a habit of taking good people from us before their time-and that was the case with Don Randall. When I first came to this place-and I have heard the story from a number of people here-I was not quite sure what to make of Don Randall, but, as the wonderful contributions  that we have heard on both sides of this place today in recognition of Don's work and his friendship and his companionship and his frankness in this place show, they come in all different shapes and sizes, and that is how it should be. In Don, we had a special needs teacher-I did not know that-and we had a horse trainer. He certainly, like us all, was a reflection of the very diverse community that makes our country so great, of the aspirations of its people, of the causes that they feel strongly about. Don was one of those optimists among us-an extraordinary advocate for his state of Western Australia and the people of this electorate of Canning. When I first heard the news of Don's passing, like so many here, I was somewhat shocked, contemplating how it would be. When I think of Don Randall, I will think of a man who said his piece and was very clear about where he stood without fear or favour. He did make, as was mentioned by somebody today, interjections during question time-he sat just behind me here-in his deep voice with a genuine wit. He could often be heard making interjections that did not get, perhaps, the recognition they deserved. He was indeed a fighter for the little guy-those people that have suffered, whether it be at the hands of local government or state government or federal government-on the issues that are never reported in the newspapers. But those things, which perhaps brought the greatest satisfaction to him as a member of parliament, as they do to many of us, had an important impact on the lives of the people within his electorate. I commented to him one time, passing his office, that he always had a different staff member coming over to Canberra with him, and I asked him why that was. Again, as has been mentioned by many today, he took great pride in his staff-and, clearly, his staff took great pride in working for Don Randall. He saw the opportunity for them to come to Canberra as a way not only of giving them an opportunity to see that part of the work that he did but also to further their careers and give them opportunities, as was mentioned by Minister Hunt today in his contribution-to give good staff the opportunity to be the best that they could. I did not know him well-not well enough. But his frank and genuine honesty was indeed a most attractive characteristic-not by design but by coincidence. Life has an uncanny way of delivering strange things in terms of timing and other matters. As it happened, I had a meeting today with Gerard Neesham and the people from the Clontarf Foundation that I had arranged nearly two months ago. I met with them today in my office, and we spent some time contemplating, remembering the contribution and the work that Don Randall had done with that very excellent organisation. On behalf of myself, my family and the people of the electorate of Lyons in the state of Tasmania, I offer my sincere condolences to Julie, to Tess and to Elliott.",119
6,Mr VASTA,Unknown," We were in shock when we heard about the passing of Don Randall; it was with great disbelief. At first, I thought it must have been one of Don's stunts or some type of practical joke, because this man was larger than life and how could we allow someone like Don to leave us? We needed him, and we miss him terribly. He was a great mentor. He often would say to me, 'You belong to a special club.' My good friend the member for La Trobe is a member of that club. It is the club where you lose and then you come back, and Don would remind me of that constantly. He would say, 'We're pretty special, because not many people do come back, and we did come back.'  Yes, he was a great grassroots campaigner, and you could learn a lot from Don. But I learnt more from Don because Don used to talk to me while we were catching the flights. He was going to Perth and we were going to Brisbane, and often his beautiful daughter, Tess, would be there as well. Don loved all things Italian, and I think that is why he sort of had a particular fondness for me. He loved to practise his Italian, and he actually spoke it very, very well. Don, you were a great friend. We miss you terribly. May you rest in peace. Our thoughts and our prayers are with your beautiful wife, Julie, and with your children, Tess and Elliott. May you rest in peace.",120

This included savings from both the Prime Minister and Cabinet and Health portfolios, over five years. A significant proportion of the savings under this item in the Prime Minister's portfolio has been reinvested including through other budget items.

14,Mr Robb,QUESTIONS IN WRITING,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. World Trade Organization (WTO) and international trade agreements to which Australia is a party do not contain ""barriers"" to members, including Australia, monitoring food imports for safety reasons. (2) No. Food Labelling (Question No. 761) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for Trade and Investment, in writing on, 12 May 2015: (1) Will signing the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) create legal issues for the Government if it subsequently proceeds with strengthening food labelling and monitoring standards. (2) Can foreign corporations sue the Government under a potential investor-state-dispute settlement provision that may be contained in the TPP in respect of possible changes in food labelling and food standards laws.",126
15,Mr Robb,QUESTIONS IN WRITING,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. (2) No. Australia's ability to regulate food labelling and food standards will not be diminished by the TPP.

(2) Will he review Australia's food labelling standards in the context of providing consumers with easily visible and informative information on which products are (a) imported from overseas, and (b) wholly grown and produced in Australia. (3) Does he accept that Australia has some of the highest food safety and environmental standards in the world, and that the Government should be encouraging local farmers and food manufacturing processors to work together to supply the domestic market. NA  (4) Why does Australia import food, at the expense of local industry and jobs, from nations which have lower environmental and food health standards than Australia.",126
16,Mr Joyce,QUESTIONS IN WRITING,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) What measures and actions are he considering and investigating in respect of strengthening Australia's food labelling and food monitoring measures following the outbreak of Hepatitis A linked with the importation of frozen berries  The Department of Agriculture has implemented new testing for imported ready-to-eat berries from any country. The inspection rate remains at five per cent of consignments, as per the risk advice of the Food Standards Australia New Zealand(FSANZ) that it is low risk to human health when produced under good agricultural and hygiene conditions. Samples are now tested for the presence of E. coli as an indicator of processing hygiene  Additionally, importers must review their supply chains to ensure there are satisfactory through chain controls for hazards such as foodborne viruses.  The Department has also recently introduced a new agricultural chemical residues screen for imported fruit and vegetables which consists of 108 chemicals. This will also apply to imported ready-to-eat berries.  On 19 May 2015, Food Standards Australia New Zealand published the finalised risk advice relating to ready-to-eat berries. This advice noted that when berries are farmed and handled appropriately during packaging there is very little risk of Hepatitis A virus being introduced.  In response, the Department issued an Imported Food Notice (IFN) on the same day, alerting importers to the requirement for them to ensure that their supply chain(s) for berries have effective control strategies in place to manage the risk of microbiological contamination. The IFN also confirmed that imported ready-to-eat berries would continue to be tested for E. coli at the surveillance food rate.  Separately, the Department is considering whether reforms are required to improve how the Department administers the Imported Food Control Act to ensure appropriate and timely responses continue to occur for future incidents. (2) Will he review Australia's food labelling standards in the context of providing consumers with easily visible and informative information on which products are (a) imported from overseas, and (b) wholly grown and produced in Australia.  On 26 February 2015, the Prime Minister announced that the Commonwealth is committed to reforming country of origin labelling (CoOL).  Ministers have been tasked with bringing forward options to enhance Australia's CoOL framework to provide consumers with clearer information to make informed choices about the origin of the food they buy.  The Commonwealth is undertaking consultation with consumers, industry stakeholders and states and territories in metropolitan and regional centres to develop a framework that meets the needs of consumers, without imposing unnecessary costs on businesses.  The government will be considering this issue further in August 2015, and any proposed enhancements to Australia's framework would also consider the impact on Australia's international trade obligations. (a) Under the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code, all food sold in Australia must adhere to Australia's country of origin labelling requirements, which apply equally to domestically produced and imported food. Country of origin requirements apply to all packaged food and unpackaged fresh or processed fruit, vegetables, seafood, pork, beef, lamb and chicken meat. NA  (b) I have stated my preference for a country of origin label to show the Australian content of ingredients in a product and that this label should be mandatory, diagrammatic, proportionate and simple to understand. (3) Does he accept that Australia has some of the highest food safety and environmental standards in the world, and that the Government should be encouraging local farmers and food manufacturing processors to work together to supply the domestic market.  I am proud of the fact that Australia has some of the highest food safety and environmental standards in the world. This government is strongly committed to a vibrant, innovative and competitive food sector that allows farmers to link with food processors to supply the domestic and international markets as well as achieving better returns for farmers at the farm gate.  One of the initiatives to encourage greater collaboration between farmers and processors is the establishment of a Food and Agribusiness Industry Growth Centre. This is being established under the Australian Government's $188.5 million Industry Growth Centres initiative to boost Australian industry's competitiveness and productivity in five key growth sectors, including agriculture.  The Food and Agribusiness Growth Centre will make business easier in the food and agriculture sector by reducing regulatory burden, getting new ideas into the market, improving workforce skills and improving access to international markets and global supply chains.  Projects that the Food and Agribusiness Industry Growth Centre may be involved in include providing assistance with developing desired product characteristics, advice on intellectual property, marketing and country specific exporting intelligence and/or working with regulators to improve the efficiency of the regulatory framework while maintaining Australia's reputation for food safety. (4) Why does Australia import food, at the expense of local industry and jobs, from nations which have lower environmental and food health standards than Australia.  The Australian Government supports two-way trade and choices for Australian consumers. Australia must be prepared to accept imports from other countries in order for other countries to accept our exports. Imports provide Australian consumers with benefits including access to a range of competitively-priced products and counter-seasonal produce. Fresh fruit and vegetables are imported mainly to cover seasonal shortfalls in local production or decreased production volumes due to climatic events such as cyclones or drought.  Any move to stop imports, particularly as an exporting nation, would risk retaliation by trading partners, with negative impacts on our farmers and the broader economy. The government is committed to maintaining Australia's high biosecurity standards, including managing any biosecurity risks from imported foods.  All food sold in Australia, whether produced domestically or imported, must comply with the safety requirements of the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code. All imported food must first meet biosecurity requirements, to prevent the incursion of foreign pests and disease, prior meeting the requirements of the Imported Food Control Act 1992.

23,Mr Joyce,QUESTIONS IN WRITING,"The Minister for Agriculture has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: Given the high level of quarantine risk posed by bovine serum for diseases such as Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD), a precise evaluation of the provenance of the serum is required. Until February 2014, this was only possible through the performance of a traceability audit. In conducting such an audit, departmental auditors review documentary evidence maintained by serum producers. A traceability audit was offered to Serana at the execution of the warrant on 11 December 2013. The department also sought to develop an antibody detection test for determining the provenance of bovine serum; as such no such test existed at the time. a) On the 16 January 2014 the department was notified of a test that could be applied to the bottles of serum *seized during the December 2013 search warrant. The test was for Bovine Viral Diarrhoea Virus (BVDV) – Pestivirus Type 2.

27,Mr Billson,QUESTIONS IN WRITING,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The ACCC currently has two matters before the court relating to anti-competitive behaviour involving supermarkets as follows: - ACCC v Colgate Palmolive Pty Ltd & Ors – the proceedings relate to allegations of cartel conduct in respect of laundry detergent products. The ACCC alleges that Woolworths Limited was knowingly concerned in the alleged arrangements. The media release relating to the institution of proceedings is available on the ACCC website: http://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/accc-takesaction-against-alleged-laundry-detergent-cartel. - ACCC v Informed Sources Pty Ltd & Ors – the proceedings relate to allegations that Informed Sources and several petrol retailers engaged in anti-competitive conduct relating to petrol price sharing arrangements. The petrol retailers, Woolworths Ltd and Eureka Operations Pty Ltd (trading as Coles Express) are joined in these proceedings. The media release relating to the institution of proceedings is available on the ACCC website: http://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/accc-takesaction-against-informed-sources-and-petrol-retailers-for-price-information-sharing. (2) In addition to the two matters outlined in response to question one, the ACCC has taken action in the following matters over the past 18 months: - In December 2013, the ACCC accepted separate court enforceable undertakings from Woolworths Ltd, and Coles Group Limited, Coles Supermarkets Australia Pty Ltd and Eureka Operations Pty Ltd (together Coles) following an investigation into whether fuel savings offers from Coles and Woolworths were causing a substantial lessening of competition in retail fuel markets. The undertakings state that from 1 January 2014 Coles and Woolworths will not make or allow fuel discounts where those discounts are not funded wholly by the fuel subsidiary or division of Woolworths or Coles; or are greater in amount than four cents per litre and contingent on purchase of goods or services at a store or business separate from the retail fuel outlet. - In February 2014, the ACCC began separate actions in the Federal Court against Coles Group Ltd and Woolworths Ltd for allegedly breaching these court enforceable undertakings. The ACCC alleged that: o Coles had breached the undertaking as it offered a bundled discount of 14 cents per litre (10 + 4 cents), which was only available to a customer who had made a qualifying supermarket purchase NA  o Woolworths had breached the undertaking as it offered a bundled discount of eight cents per litre (4 + 4 cents) which was only available to a customer who had made a qualifying supermarket purchase. - In April 2014, the Federal Court found that Woolworth's initial 4 + 4 cent offer to 9 March 2014 had breached the undertaking as the discount depended on a supermarket purchase. However, the Federal Court dismissed the ACCC allegations in relation to the Coles offer and the post 9 March Woolworths offer on the basis that only 4 cents of the total discount was contingent upon a supermarket purchase; in both cases, the additional discount was dependent upon a minimum purchase from the store at the petrol station. Imported Aluminium Cladding (Question No. 828) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Employment, in writing, on 25 June 2015: In respect of the danger of using imported (from China) flammable substandard aluminium cladding on high rise buildings, as demonstrated by the (a) 2012 Symposium on Fire Science and Technology where it was revealed that 59 people in China had died as a result of fire fuelled by such cladding, and (b) substandard aluminium cladding-fuelled fire in Melbourne's Lacrosse Tower in November 2014, what action, if any, has the Government taken, or will it take, to reduce the risk of such existing cladding on Australian high rise buildings.  honourable member's question: State and territory building and planning legislation sets out the legal framework for the regulation of the construction of buildings, building standards (including compliance with the National Construction Code) and maintenance of specific building safety features. The Australian Government has no direct role in regulating building products. The Lacrosse Tower fire in Melbourne is being investigated by the Victorian Building Authority, as matters such as this are primarily the responsibility of state and territory building and planning regulators. Work health and safety regulators are monitoring developments to determine if any action is required in relation to work health and safety, particularly for construction workers.
