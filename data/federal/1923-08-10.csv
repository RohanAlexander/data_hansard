TJ' - I have heard a great deal in. this Chamber about the necessity for assisting the primary pre-d'ueers. In my opinion, a better method of assisting the cattle-raising industry ceroid be adopted than tfre grant of a bounty on the capo rt of motet. The bounty can bo owly collected after the producer baa found', a market for his product, and that being so> it is i m p w r t i w that the GovermnegCt should find markets few it . I am of opinion that; thjese markets can be fauoadi iS the matter is trealib with syafcenwtksjly, 1 I have, here a letter from the East, and I Will read raf&cient of what ib pontaiai* toshow that markets arc ayaiiable< i a Eastern caunfcriea for the products of' the pastoral industry. This: letter is the outcome of negotiations with. an. Eastern firm, with a view to opening up a market forAustralian, meat, and paiticularlv meat produced in the Northern Territory. At the time the negotiations were opened, the Government had a freezing' works in the Northern Territory, and. it was anticipated that itsuse would be ot considerable benefit to pastoralists. in . enabling tbem to puttheir meat on Eastern markets. Subsequently the, Government closed the freezing works, and centered into au agreement with a private concernwithout making any provision whatever for the cold storage necessary to encourage the export trade. The to Butteipato writer of the letter say*Can. yon contract 100 tons for the Government ; 75 tons for others, monthly 1 I bare been in conversation with one of the A i m ; PAPERS. Serviue officers, who is also a director ot the Supply Board, and ho laid mo they wore very dissatisfied with the quality of neat being, supplied at she present time. He wanted to know from me what possibilities there were to encourage the Soyply Board to make a contract with au Australian firm to supply their requirements is frozen meat direct as against their present system of letting a contract for supplies to a loeu) Arm. The Government should take this matter up seriously, because T believe it would mean a trade of from 500 to 600 head of stock per month, and that would only be the nucleus of a very considerable/ trade with Eastern ports. The writer of the letter f u r t h er saysThere is a big business in this. It will not only meaa an army contract, but others such 'as the police .force, which, is nearly as big .as the .army, the prisons, the hospitals, At the present time a contract is let to a local firm that imports live-stock, and slaughters here as required. That is not satisfactory, as the cattle arrive in very poor condition, and there is no feed to fatten them. Were it not that the Government has closed its freezing worts this trade could loe .undertaken at once with very beneficial results to' the primary producers of the Northern Territory. If the Government will not carry on its freezing works in the Northern 'Territory it should let some one else do so. I should like to refer., in connection with a proposed vote of £3,000 for the - maintenance of destitutes and lepers, to a. matter of considerable importance. Honourable members, are probably - not aware of the inhuman treatment meted out to lepers in the Northern Territory. On an island not far from Darwin a station for lepers has been established. There are from ten to fifteen persons of loth sexes at that station. It is located on a low-lying island in the harbour that is infested with mosquitoes and sand flies. These lepers are just tipped on to the island and left there. There are Chinese, half-castes, and others, and they are interbreeding. At low tide they can easily get ,to the mainland, and they frequently - do iso, and may thius convey the dread disease from which they - suffer throughout the Territory. I am told that .the offspring of lepers, no matter to what (extent the parents have teen affected by the disease, are io all intents and purposes free from it, but it reappears in ithe third generation. is so, the disease may fee spread throughout Australia. ' It is inhumane on the part of the Federal Government to establish a - station of this kind, and then leave it absolutely uncontrolled. I understand that a visit is paid about once a month by a medical man from the"" mainland, but beyond that there is no supervision. It is the duty of the Government to attend to this matter at - once. difficulty of proper supervision arises at present from the fact that apart from the quarantine doctor, whose work is , confined to duties connected with his Department, there is only one medical - man in the Northern Territory. On the Estimates are two amounts of £550 and £100 for the Government Medical Officer, &c - who has also a monopoly of the 'medical practice of the entire Territory. He must find it unprofitable to attend to the lepers on the island seeing that he has a more remunerative practice on the mainland. It is obviously the duty of the Government to insure proper supervision over the leper station. It is not sufficient to place a sum of £3,000 on the Estimates and then leave the unfortunate sufferers to 'attend to themselves. The treatment of Oialf-castes is another problem in the Northern Territory. Young girl's in employment are brought, in contact with the public through the employers, away from the influence of the matron of the compound, and invariably before they are sixteen years of age they are returned to the compound in a state of pregnancy, and often diseased. The matron ""has made numerous appeals to be allowed to segregate the half-castes and give them domestic training. Better handling of the half-caste boys is also necessary. 'The Public Works Depart. merit and other Government services in the.Territory could be effectively utilized for the training of these boys. The only solution of the half-caste problem that I can suggest is the training of both sexes until they are old enough to inter-marry. The present system practically condemns the half-caste girls-to a life of prostitution, and Government neglect condones it. The report of the 'matron of the compound should receive more consideration, and, as she has vast 'experience of the natives, and understands the requirements of the - half-castes particularly, her advice should If this 'be acted upon. Another desirable reform is the introduction of definite regulations governing the employment of natives. I assure honourable members that Mrs Harriet Beecher'Stowe, who, in Uncle Tom's Cabin, exposed the ihorxors of negro slavery in America, would shudder if she could know - of-the conditions imposed upon the natives in tihe Northern Territory. The system of The employment is to collect natives regardless of sex, and take them .to - various works. They are given clothes while they are at work, - and when the job is finished they are deprived of them and sent back to the bush. Should a cattle ! man decide to annex a black boy's lubra he does so by force. J 'have known of a boy whose lubra had been stolen by a white man, to track the abductor until he came upon his camp at night, and then to recover the woman. He was then chased by horsemen and captured, chains were hung round his neck, he was tied to the stirrups, dragged alongside the horse for miles, and finally flogged. Those a_re the abuses that are possible under the present administration of the Aborigines Act. admit that Mr T. J. Beckett administered the Act in a most humane spirit, but because he was fearless and had the courage to inform the Administrator of abuses and of reforms that would be to the benefit of the natives and prevent cruel treatment by their employers, his position was abolished. His was not an isolated case. Any official in the Northern Territory who has the courage of his convictions, and dares to condemn the prevailing order of things soon finds that he has lost his position. On the Estimates is an item of £350 for the printing of the Northern Territory Gazette. ""We hear a lot about the Treasurer's desire for economy, and I propose to show where a further saving could have been made if honesty prevailed in the administration of Departments. Some time ago tenders were called for the printing of the Northern Territory Gazette. Two were received, one from an office with an obsolete hand-setting plant, and the second from an establishment with a linotype and complete up to-date plant necessary for the economical and efficient production of a newspaper. The price tendered by the latter was £200, and by the obsolete printing establishment £350, and on the advice of the Administrator the higher tender was accepted. It was impossible for the successful tenderer to do as good work as his rival, but the latter had had the courage to expose many anomalies and shortcomings in the, Northern Territory Administration. For that reason only a contract Avas let for the pi'inting of the Gazette for £150 more than the price at w^iich it could have been more efficiently produced in another office. Personal considerations should not influence the Administration; efficiency tive than the should be the governing factor: The unsuccessful tenderer was prepared to offer a most substantial guarantee, but a viniWr. Nelson. dictive Administrator ,had decided that he should not get the contract, and it seems to be the invariable practice of Ministers in Melbourne to be guided by the Administrator. I use the word "" vindictive"" deliberately, and I refer honourable members to the report of a Queensland Royal Commission, comprising three Judges, which unanimously found some years ago that the gentleman, I who is now Administrator of the Northern Territory was tyrannical and vindictive. He is not the type of man who can best promote the development of the Territory, and I think the Government might seriously consider the abandonment of the present system of administration. I advocate the substitution of an Advisory Council. The Territory might be cut' into four divisions, each of which should elect a representative to the Council. In this way a ful l measure of representation would be given to all interests in the Territory. The expense of that system would be far less than the present cost of administration. The Government is paying the Administrator a salary of £1,500 per annum and expenses, and it proposes to create a Land Board at a cost of £2,000 or £3,000 pei' annum. I claim that it would be in the interests of the Northern Territory if the position of Administrator were abolished and an Advisory Council established, of which the Government Secretary should be chairman. At its inception the Council should comprise four members, and I do not suggest that the representation should be on a population basis. I am not wedded to the democratic principle of representation where the development of a big unpopulated area like the-Northern Territory is involved. Full representation should be given, to all interests, irrespective of the number of people in each division. Of course, as the Territory advanced, and population increased, the representation should be adjusted accordingly. I hope that in the interests of the development of the Northern Territory, Parliament will seriously consider the appointment .of such a Council, which would be cheaper and more effecpresent system of administration. Parliament should direct also that intending settlers in the Territory shall be exempt from taxation for a number years. That would not involve a great loss of revenue, because at the present time the receipts are small. I put forward this suggestion solely as a means of encouraging development. That concession was extended to the for settlers in New Guinea, and I think was depart. made retrospective for a number of years. The same principle should applied to the Northern Territory, but the exemption should be for a definite period only. The abolition of t r i al by jury"" in Northern Territory has fomented trouble and discontent, and will continue to so. The withdrawal of a right that was wrung for the English people from John, and has been enjoyed by Britishers ever since, is provoking dissatisfaction, and may possibly lead to something worse in the near future. I have seen witnesses taken into the Court house on several days ment. preceding at r i a l, and rehearsed in the evidence they were to ,give against a white man. I can prove beyond dispute that this has occurred. Without a jury in the name of Heaven, what white citizen is safe if the authorities can manipulate black witnesses in this way, and rehearse their evidence before the trial takes place? It should not necessary for me to appeal to Parliament back number. to restore to the Territory trial by jury which is a fundamental right in a B r tish community. For many years the Administration fields and coal deposits there. has grappled with the problem of profifths viding shipping to meet the requirements of settlers, and so far every attempt establish a satisfactory service has proved abortive, not because it is impossible do these things, but because of the uning fortunate state of the administration of the Northern Territory. The vessels are engaged in service for practically five months, and lying idle for the remainder of the year. Other boats of considerably years this position has obtained. less tonnage consistently ply their trade all the year round. The Rachael Cohen, which has been obtained by the adminiNorthern stration-and I hope it is not another coffin ship-is fifty or one hundred years bid. I doubt very much whether that craft is seaworthy. An adequate shipmediately ping service is essential for the .proper development of the Northern Territory, and this is certainly not the type of to give the best service. Owing to the of lack of facilities, and the perpetual very bungling of the Department, I have known settlers' teams to be on the banks of a river for three months awaiting the arrival of boats. No settler can afford to have a man and a team of horses idle that period. The settlers, in despair, The boat comes along and dumps the supplies on the river bank. be The wet season arrives, the river overflows its banks, and away go the whole of the stores. These occurrences are well-' known to the Administration, but no in telligent suggestion has been made by the them to remedy this state of affairs. The' system of administration has been tried do and found wanting. An Advisory Board would not have full executive powers, K in g but would be purely a medium of communication between the Northern Territory and the Commonwealfch Government. Tho advice of such a Board would be of considerable advantage to this ParliaThe mining industry in the Northern Territory can be successfully developed. , The experience of every civilized country in the world is that mining 'towns grow in a uigh't like mushrooms - No item appears on the Estimates for the encouragement of mining. To the Northern Terribe tory, Administrator that industry is a The largest low-grade , gold propositions in Australia are in the i - Northern Territory. The Minister, acting through this Parliament, will not allow persons to exploit the large mica Fourof the area of the Northern Territory has been taken up in 1,000 to square-mile blocks under oil and coal licences, and the licensees have not the to slightest intention of workingor exploittheir leases. They hope that some one else will sink a bore or exploit the possibilities of adjoining blocks. If oil is struck, they will amass wealth by virtue of the other man's operations. For two I recently asked the Minister,' in view of the great importance of coal to the Territory, and of the non-compliance with the conditions of the licences, if he would cause them to be forfeited so as to enable proved coal-fields to be imworked. He replied that the Government were obtaining the services of a famous geologist to report on the boat indication of oil and coal deposits in the Northern Territory, and that u n t i l such time ast he; had. reported, the licensees could ignore the terms' of licences. These conditions, which are at [11.46] - I movepresent operating in the Northern Territory, aire, condoned by the present vernment. A guarantee has been given tr> the Government that actual deposits of coal will be disclosed immediately the licences are declared void.

On several occasions, I have informed the right honourable gentleman,, on behalf of the Opposition, that he. can go abroad, and. that, we' will give, him. a. pairif he will allow the business, of the country to. be continued in, his. absence.

M . HUGHES - Hear , hear! Mr Charlton .r-Thos e honourable members who do not know this will soon find that it is so. Honourable, members deal with matters in a general way when discussing a Budget speech-. They voice their views so that other honourable members may consider' them, and determine how they will act when detailed proposals are before them. Many matters-in the Estimates require careful consideration by this Chamber. Several honourable members have indicated that they are not satisfied with proposals made in the Budget. I refer particularly to' the Government's immigration policy. Under the motion proposed by the Prime Minister we are asked to conclude our discussion on this important matter by 4 o'clock today. It is now noon. Can this Parliament by 4 o'clock,, consider fairly, and; come to a decision on, such an important matter as the re-organization of the Immigration Department.?",19
15,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,That is only one matter.,20
16,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"That is so. We have to complete our consideration of two Departments by that time. It is proposed that we shall deal with all the Departments in the same way. Will honor- able members be willing in this way to vote huge amounts of money, and to allow the waste that is going on to continue f The Government has made no provision for re-organizing the Immigration Department. Many honourable members admit that re-organization is badly . needed. Complaints are made in the public press nearly every day that we are obtaining the wrong class of settlers. It is generally admitted that we have no proper arrangements for the supervision of immigrants, and that the methods of selection are most unsatisfactory. spite of that, we are to be asked to agree to the expenditure of large amounts of money on immigration, without any undertaking that improved methods of handling the situation will be adopted. I do not wish to speak at length on this motion, because much better use could be made of the time in discussing the items of the Estimates. For that reason I shall ask my friends on this side of the House not to debate the matter at length. It is to be understood that,- on behalf of the Labour party, I am making an emphatic protest against this proposal. As it is, we shall not have sufficient time to deal with immigration matters.",20
17,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,H as not the subject been debated for days?,20

19,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,"We have debated subject, and now we shall have time to decide what to do.",20
20,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"The member knows that this matter merits length. our most careful consideration. In time allowed by the Prime Minister we cannot give that thorough attention we ought to give to the subjects which will come before us. If honourable members want certain items reduced or removed from the Estimates altogether they must give reasons. Very little opportunity for that is afforded by this motion. The acceptance of this motion will really prevent honourable members from properly carrying cut their duties. The only reason for asking us to spend £60,000,000 between now and tomorrow morning is that the Prime Minister may close Parliament before he leaves these shores to attend the Imperial Conference. When the ex-Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) wished to attend the Imperial Conference, he made arrangements for Parliament to continue sitting. Why does not the present Prime Minister do that? Is he afraid of his colleagues? Surely he does not suggest that they are incapable of carrying on the affairs of the country during his absence. If so, he thinks In very little of the Treasurer, who is supposed to be his right-hand supporter. Surely the Treasurer could control affairs if he had a pair for the Prime Minister. Are there no other honourable gentlemen in the Ministry who are capable of leading the Government during the absence, of the Prime Minister? What about the Attorney-General ? What about our old friend, the Minister for Trade and Customs? Are they not capable? Yet it, is not fco be. The Prime Minister has made his declaration, and apparently he intends to give effect to it , and close this Parliament. The Estimates are the most important business with which Parliament has to deal. During my membership of fhis House I have no recollection of the guillotine having been used in connection with the Estimates.",20

I realise that I am occupying valuable time in debating this question. honourable Possibly I should not speak at such I wish to obtain a vote on the many important matters which will come before us in the Estimates. It is necesthat sary, however^ that this party should register a most emphatic protest against the manner in which the Government propose wantonly to expend public moneys in certain directions. Though. I shall curtail my remarks, I wish it to be distinctly understood that the Labour party is thoroughly unanimous in entering this protest against the attempt of the Government to bludgeon these Estimates through the House without proper' consideration. The general discussion on the. Budget does not in any way assist us in dealing with particular votes, seeing that there is no opportunity then to move amendments. There is a heavy public debt, and it is generally admitted that there ought to be reductions of expenditure in certain directions. able members who support this motion are shirking their duty to the' country, and for this they are responsible to their constituents. We on this side have a clear conscience. The onus and responsibility for the action of the Prime Minister this morning rests on him and his supporters. In the last Parliament the discussions on the Estimates saved the country half-a-million of money, but today we are deprived of the opportunity to reduce them by Is. It is absolutely impossible to effectively deal with the Estimates with the guillotine hanging over our heads. If the whole two hours is taken up in the discussion of one item, then not only that item, but all the other items in the Division must be voted on at once. Is this responsible governmenb as we know it ? I venture to say that it is as we know it , but it is a new departure in ""responsible government."" people of Australia expect their representatives to give their time and attention to the work of the country, and that work includes the curtailing of expenditure as far as possible. We shall in the time at our disposal do our utmost to focus attention on certain questions, and we hope that the common sense of honourable members on all sides will lead them to support any proposal we make if they think it a just one. Sir. W . M . HUGHES (Worth Sydney) [12.1] - It is right and proper, in the face of the motion of the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) and its consequences, that those who are unable to accept this policy as desirable for the country should enter a protest against what is proposed. This I do. It has been my good fortune to be a member of the i Commonwealth Parliament since its inception. I have seen many Governments in power, and was a member of a Government which possessed an overwhelming and homogeneous majority, being supported by a party held together by the most perfect bonds of discipline. When my then Leader (Mr . Fisher) was in England, I was left in charge. But even that Government, riotwithstanding that it had a majority in both Houses of this Legislature,' never attempted, as this Government is attempting, to weaken the functions ""and interfere with the rights of the representatives of the people. Such a motion as that now before us is without parallel in the history Honor- of the Commonwealth, and I never heard of such procedure in the House of Commons, the Mother of Parliaments. The right of members to discuss and control the public expenditure is the foundation of the people's liberty. W it h o ut that right, what is responsible government? While we control expenditure, we control the Government; we hold in our hands the affairs of the country, and can direct the course of public policy. The Prime Minister insists, I understand, that this afternoon two Departments of the Estimates must be disposed of. He has told us how many hours and minutes were occupied in discussing the Budget. Although the right honourable gentleman is a newcomer in this assembly, he cannot be utterly ignorant of the fact that on previous occasions any attack made on the financial proposals of a Government has been on the Estimates. The The Budget is a sort of preliminary canter, and, as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr . Charlton) said, anything practical must be done on the Estimates. The Budget debate is mere criticism, availing much or little, but in .itself effecting nothing. One hour spent on the consideration of the Estimates is more profitable to the country than twenty hours spent on discussing the Budget. Ministers claim that they took office to restore responsible and representative government, to give the people's representatives the opportunity to control the public expenditure, which, according to the Treasurer and his supporters, had been taken away from them by previous A d ministrations. The present action stamps the Government and its supporters for what they are. For my part, I shall oppose this motion. Here I can do nothing; but where I . can do much I shall do it .",20

That is not our fault; in any case, the Prime Minister has a mutual responsibility, seeing that he adroitly allowed his followers to occupy time, and thus drag out the debate.

I can quite understand the Prime Minister taking up his present attitude. My Leader (Mr Charlton) has suggested that there are honourable gentlemen opposite who could take over the control of the - Government in the absence of the Prime Minister, .and that Parliament could well proceed with business while he is away. But my Leader is wrong. Parliament could not be carried on in the absence of the Prime Minister. Irrespective of himself, there is no ability on the front bench; in his absence the Government does not exist. His following has no capacity of thought, speech or action; it is only through the Prime Minister that it can speak, and in his absence it cannot live. Previous Governments have always had at least one or two - members capable of taking command. On the occasion to which the ex-Prime Minister (Mr W. M . Hughes) referred just now, he was left on the front bench - I was left on the back bench. In his absence the right honourable member, when Prime Minister, could rely on you, Mr. Speaker, on the present Prime Minister, and also on the then member for Richmond (Mr Massy Greene). The present Prime opportunity to Minister is not in that happy position, and we can only 'extend to him our hearty sympathy.

He practically said to honourable members, "" The whole of the money has been spent, and now you can talk as long as you like.""

Dr EARLE PA'GE - The present Prime Minister was iiOt Treasurer when the right honourable (member for North Sydney was leading 1 a Labour Government. However, on the present occasion there has been the most-prolonged debate on the Budget that ever took place in the Commonwealth Parliament. Practically thirty hours have been given to the discussion, and honourable members know that Ministers deliberately refrained from speaking in order that the opportunities of honourable members should not be curtailed. Then, again, it is proposed to devote twenty-four hours to the consideration of the Estimates, and to this the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) strenously objects.",22
34,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,I have a recollection of the honourable gentleman similarly objecting last year.,23
35,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"I then wished the Estimates to be postponed, and, failing that, I let them pass. I remind honourable members that last year we voted on the Estimates £2,000,000 more than is proposed on the present Estimates, and in five hours and seventeen minutes. The arrangement proposed by the Prime Minister will be approved by the general community as quite proper in the circumstances, and as insuring to every Department a definite allotted time to enable its items to be debated. It ' is suggested that this has never been done before. The right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr W. M . Hughes) says that such a thing is unheard of in the history of Parliament. I have noticed every time the honourable gentleman speaks that he has the most conveniently short memory of any man I have ever heard of. When the right honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt) was Treasurer in the right honourable gentleman's government an exactly similar motion was put in this Chamber, and was withdrawn only to enable the honourable member for Bass (Mr Jackson) to make a statement. I have explained the true position, and it is just as well that the House and the public should know it.",23
36,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,"Yarra) [12.16] - The Treasurer has charged honourable members on this side with hypocrisy, and he has given the best possible example of hypocrisy in his own speech.",23
37,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Rt. Hon. W. A. Watt). - The honourable member may not refer to a phrase which, on exception being taken to it, has been withdrawn. [95] Mr Scullin' - I will say that the honourable gentleman talked with his tongue in his cheek. When the Government, under the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr W. M . Hughes), put the Estimates through in the last Parliament in five and a half hours, no one protested more strongly than did the present Treasurer. He stood in the Country party's corner, and exuded wrath because the Government were rushing through votes for the expenditure of public money. He accused the ex-Prime Minister of lack of consideration and of nearly every political crime in the calendar. He charged his present leader with the same things. Many of his gibes were directed against the present Prime Minister. He is now backing up the right honourable gentleman in the course to which he previously objected, in order to let him get away to the Old Country, where he will do no more good than he did at the recent Conference with State Ministers. It is said that thirty hours have been spent on the Budget debate. I can say, perhaps with greater freedom than others, that that is not a long time to spend on the Budget, because I did not myself occupy a minute of that time. I admit that when a number of speeches have been delivered on a Budget there is a good deal of repetition, and some time may have been spent in that way: I have never attempted to waste the time of Parliament, and I frankly admit that at certain times a Government is justified in limiting a debate. I admit that the guillotine may sometimes be fairly applied to curtail a general debate. I make the admission, because if I were on the Government side I would so apply it , and what I would do on the Government side I will not protest against from this side. But we are here dealing with an entirely different proposition. I sat silent through the general debate on the Budget, because I felt that what I had to contribute to a discussion on the finances of the country might, perhaps, be better left until we were actually voting the money to be expended. Now the Government propose to give honourable members twenty four hours to discuss the Estimates. We are asked to rush through Estimates of expenditure at the rate of about £3,000,000 an hour. Any honourable member who knows anything Estimates will agree that it would not be possible to take even a division each of the items in twenty-four hours. How can the Government say what parthrough . ticular items honourable members wish discuss? The estimate for one Departtine ment might fairly be passed in ten minutes, whilst it would not be unreasonhalf able to occupy the whole twenty-four hours in discussing the Estimates another Department. If the Government proposal is agreed to honourable members will be denied the opportunity to carry out their obligations to the people. I said that the proposal I know of the Prime Minister is a dastardly proposal, and was called to order that, but I should like to use even stronger words. The fundamental tion of Parliament is to control the finances of the country. We are asked to vote £60,000,000 of money within twentyvotes four hours. It might be a reasonable thing for the Government, in dealing with an ordinary debate, to say that so many hours should be given to members of Opposition, and so many to members their own side, and let the members either side who desired to speak divide the time allotted. But that kind thing cannot be done in dealing with Estimates. If the twenty,four which the Government propose to.devote to the consideration of the Estimates were spread over three days, honourable members might discuss them and cast intelligent votes upon them. "" But the Government proposes that honrushed orable members shall sit for twenty-four hours on end to pass the Estimates, there is not a member of. this is physically capable of doing justice to the Estimates in such circumstances. We shall have the press commenting upon members asleep on the benches, then criticising Parliament for rushing the Estimates through. Whatever justialso fication the Government may have for the limiting a general debate, there is none Minister present Government. for applying the guillotine to the sideration of the Estimates. proposed is the passing of the Estimates by exhaustion. The Government had no policy worthwhile to put the Parliament, and all they want is Mr Scullin. have the Estimates passed in order that they may close Parliament for the next of the six months,' and let the Prime Minister get away to the Old Country. W hat have T on the Government to smother up to account for their desire to rush the Estimates in the way proposed? Never into the history of Parliament has the guillobeen applied to the Estimates. If the Estimates went .through' in five and a hours on a previous occasion it may have been because Parliament .was satisof fied that they were all right.",23

45,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"Batman) [12.25] My Leader, in speaking on this motion, suggested that the time taken up in discussing it would necessarily be deducted from that the Government propose to place at our disposal for the consideration of the various items of the Estimates. W it h that spirit of conciliation and moderation which makes the honourable gentleman the power he is in this House, he invited some of us to withhold further criticism of the motion now before us. I do not view the position quite i u the same light. I conceive it to be my duty to meet abuses when they arise. This motion represents an abuse and invasion of the rights, not to mention the privileges, of the members of this House that ought to be met and fought at every stage. If the public do not understand or appreciate our point of view, it should not be our fault. I do not agree that in the day to come, when we will have, opportunities to give effect to our purpose, we must indulge in reprisals on the lines pursued by the Government. If I were a member of a M in isterial party twice as strong and much less composite than the party opposite, I would not advocate the policy which is bringing the present Government into discredit. .We have had a general discussion on the Budget. 1 do not know that any honourable member on this side was given the special privilege of speaking twice upon it , but I do know that many honourable members on this side did not speak upon it at all. I am one of those who, by reason of the representations made to us, refrained from discussing the Budget. I did not say a single word in the general discussion, relying upon the promise that ample time would be given to debate the details of the Estimates. It is an offence against the intelligence of honourable members for the Prime Minister to say that the limitation of debate is proposed on the ground that the Estimates are an urgent measure, and that a reasonable time is to be. allotted for their discussion on that basis. Ho knows, as does every other member of the House, that it is not a question of the urgency or otherwise of the Estimates, though it would be absurd to say that they are urgent, the real purpose being that the right honourable gentleman may desert his place in this country and in this Chamber to go abroad upon a mission which, by comparison with the interests involved in the Estimates, is a very minor matter. The Prime Minister ironically interjects, "" Hear, hear,"" as if what I am saying were the acme of absurdity. I believe that the' right 'honourable gentleman sincerely believes that he can serve the interests of this country better by taking counsel with persons abroad than by remaining in Australia and attending to his duty as' a responsible Minister of the Crown; but I do not agree with him. While the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Anstey) was speaking the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Stewart), continued to say ironically, "" Hear, hear,"" when it was pointed out that apparently the honourable gentlemen seated behind the Government cannot-be trusted to carry on the business of the country in the absence of the Prime Minister. He might gracefully have remained silent, because if ever there was a party which showed its incapacity, lack of initiative, and determination not to accept one atom of responsibility, it is the party now sitting behind the Prime Minister. Not one ray of light has the Minister for Works and Railways let in upon any discussion in this Chamber. Last year he sat in the Corner, claiming to have a measure of courage and independence, and to be in sympathy to a large extent with the Labour party's views and aspirations. He was the sworn enemy and critic of the Government of which the present Prime Minister was a leading light, but. as soon as his palm was touched by a g if t from the enemy he became the Prime Minister's most docile and silent follower, acquiescing in everything he does, and endeavouring to heap ridicule upon those persons with whom he professed to be in sympathy when he was an independent member of the House. And so it is with other members of the Cabinet. The Minister for Defence (Mr Bowden) introduced two Bills to the House, and the Prime Minister said, ""Por God's sake, say no more,"" and we have not seen t those measures since. Now, apparently because they have formed no ideas, or if they have formed any they have not the courage to express them, honourable members opposite are satisfied to so parcel out the discussion of the items on the Estimates that the House may be able - to go into recess in time to enable the Prime Minister to catch a steamer for the other side of the world. If he must go, let him go. We cannot stop him. Honourable members opposite have, as they are so very fond of boasting, "" the numbers."" The Nationalist party went to the country as a strong body-not a composite party, but an independent party-and came back without the numbers. The Government obtained their numbers by association with those gentlemen of the Country party who had done their hardest to drive a dagger into their hearts when they were engaged in a contest before the people; but as ""soon as they saw that their safety and seats depended upon accommodating themselves to the views they had attacked, they did it, and today they are able to make the proud boast that they ""have the numbers."" The things of which they have divested themselves, and in respect of which they have left themselves naked, and unashamed, are the principles which they advocated before the electors. That is the reason why honourable members opposite have ""the numbers"" - that is the process by which they obtained them. Do not we, in our protest today, represent at leasthalf the people of Australia? If it is oontended that we do not, add to the numbers represented by members of the Opposition those represented by the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes) who made his protest today; the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Watson), who made his protest last night, and those other honourable gentlemen who have expressed their opposition to the closing of Parliament, and it will be found that the Prime M'nister is deserting his post in flat opposition to the expressed opinion of a large majority of the people. Against that procedure I shall make my protest at every opportunity; I shall not wait until 4 o'clock this afternoon. shall not consent to this arbitrary arrangement by the Prime Minister of what we should do, what we should say, and what we should think. The right honourable gentleman is young in politics, Mr Brennan. and his experience is slight. He has a pliant and passive majority behind him, but he has yet a lot to learn, and the first lesson must be that, having made a long and tedious speech, and having taken all the time he required, and expected everybody to listen to him as though he were expounding the Gospels-havin g uttered those words of gilded wisdom, he has not said the last word that can be said on public matters of importance to the people of the Commonwealth.  [12.36] - As I have no desire to come into conflict with the Chair at this early stage, I shall not apply to the Treasurer the words of his accusation against the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr W. M . Hughes), but I cannot help thinking that the Treasurer's criticism of the ex-Prime Minister applied equally to himself. It is very interesting to hear the Treasurer abusing the right honourable member for North Sydney, and vice versa. There is a good deal in what each says of the other; each is right on most occasions. But today the right honourable member for North Sydney has more merit oh his side than has the Treasurer. I should like <to recall to the Treasurer's mind a very interesting speech he made last year in circumstances similar to those of the present moment. The right honourable gentleman has a very short memory, but in the last Parliament he applied to a proposal, similar to that which the Government are adopting today, words of condemnation much stronger than have been uttered this morning by the Leader of the Opposition, and the honourable members for Yarra (Mr Scullin) and Batman (Mr Brennan). On that occasion, the honourable member for Cowper, from his seat in the Corner, delivered a well-merited rebuke to the Government of the day. He was then in a position to express the opinions he held; he is no longer able to do so, he must do exactly as he is told, like any little school-boy I threatened with punishment if he does not behave himself and learn his lessons. That speech was very apropos of the present situation. The honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart) had moved a motion that the debate on the Budget and Estimates should be postponed u n t i l after the elections, and he was very eh> quent in his argument that the Estimates' should not be bludgeoned through the House in a hurry. I have never heard the word ""bludgeoned"" used more often than it was by honourable members in the Corner at that time. And the then Leader of the Country party, the present Treasurer said:The amendment of the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart) has for its object the postponement of consideration of the Budget until after the election. The Chamber is now thoroughly disorganized, and is cally moribund. Many honourable members have already left to catch their trains for distant States. Yet, in a denuded Committee, itemized expenditure, amounting in all to £62.000,000, has come forward for debate. Such a position is not fair to this Committee, or to the taxpayers, or to the public at large. On a similar occasion three years ago, when the Government of the day wore preparing for an election, although there was a Government majority of about twenty members, the Treasurer did not "" push"" the Budget debate or rush, the Estimates thorough in a couple of days. The Government secured three and a half months' Supply and went to the country; and then, upon the re-assembling of Parliament, they introduced the Budget. Tl-e same course might well .be adopted now. Honourable members are weary after an all night sitting. Not one of us desires to sit again throughout the night, but it appears to me that that course 'will be absolutely certain if the Government force us to oontinue. In such an event we will not be able to give fair and reasonable consideration to the ways in which this huge sum of money is to be spent. I urge the Minister for Defence (Mr Greene) to consider the request of the honourable member for Wimmera. His amendment has been moved only in order that our position might be made plain. The honourable member for Wimmera will be quite prepared to withdraw his amendment if the Government will acquiesce in his proposal. And, thereafter, honourable members of the Country party would willingly permit the necessary Supply Bill to pass through all stages, practically without discussion; and, as there are still a few more Bills to be more or less formally dealt withbut to which we would not be abie to afford reasonable consideration if an all-night sitting were agaiin inflicted-the Government would do well to signify their acceptance of the suggestion. Almost all the members from distant States have either left Melbourne or have booked their berths to depart tomorrow. Such of the business as still remains to be disposed of, apart from the Estimates, could be facilitated. And, altogether, I commend to the Government the example which they set themselves on the eve of the last general election. The honourable gentleman protested on that occasion against the rushing of the Estimates through the House, and another honourable gentleman sitting with him in the Corner said: Year after, year, the Estimates have been bludgeoned through, but we succeeded two sessions ago in extorting from the Government a distinct pledge that such a procedure would no longer he followed. It is a burlesque on parliamentary procedure and a political debauch to deal with the Budget and the Estimates under these conditions. This is a political debauch on the part practi- of the Prime Minister to bludgeon the Estimates through this House. He said previously that he would allow two days , for this discussion. That arrangement is now to be destroyed as, according to him, the Estimates must be through by 4 o'clock tomorrow afternoon.",25

This procedure is extraordinary, in view of last night's arrangement, that the Opposition should curtail their speeches. In my case, the time of debate was shortened from one hour. and thirty-five minutes to half-an-hour. The supporters of the Government should hide their faces in shame. The Government may expect from me as a private member uncompromising hostility in debate. It has outraged all canons of political decency, and in return will receive that treatment such disgraceful conduct merits.

50,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Hunter) [2.16] This is an important vote. Seeing that Parliament is no longer a deliberative assembly, we should consider whether we are justified in spending this money. In two more weeks Parliament is to be closed. Yet we are asked to vote £60,000 for the expenses incurred by this supposed custodian of the public weal. It has often been claimed that Parliament should have full control of the public purse, and that it should sit as frequently as is consistentwith the . . 35 requirements of the nation. It cannot .. 23 be considered that Parliament, by sitting eleven weeks in two years, is f u l 12 filling its purpose. The iast Parliament closed in October, 1922 ; ten months have AYES. gone by, and Parliament. may not meet again u n t i l next June. Notwithstanding the serious problems-som e of which arose out of the war-whic h confront this country, Parliament is to be so remiss in its duty as to close down without the slightest justification. The finances of this country are in a Page, Dr Earle very unsatisfactory condition, and - require the closest attention of honourable members. Yet the Prime Minister's request that Parliament shall close in a fortnight is to be granted. In that fortnight honourable members are asked to do the equivalent of four weeks' NOES. work. We have been,sitting for additional days almost ever since Parliament opened, in order to cram as much work as possible into the short period allowed to us. That is against the best interests of the country, and does not result in efficient legislation. Honourable members cannot do their work efficiently when Bills are rushed through Parliament iike meat through a sausage machine. Many - Bills have been passed; many are still on the paper, and others PAIRS. must arise out of the Budget. Why are we asked to facilitate business in this unreasonable way 'I Why are we to expend £60,000,000 of the country's money without proper consideration ? It is simply to meet the desires of the Prime Minister. So far as I am aware, nobody else believes that Parliament should be closed. Generally speaking, when honourable members address their constituents, they say that Parliament is the watch dog of the people, and that it should keep an eagle eye on the expenditure of the country. It was also said that Parliamentary recesses should not last too long. How are we to give attention to the affairs of the country when Parliament is closed, and when honourable members are denied the right to give proper consideration to our expenditure and see that no unnecessary expense is incurred ?. People are groaning under the heavy load of taxation that has been heaped upon them. They want relief. For that reason we should scan carefully every line in the Estimates, but we are practically told that we must keep our mouths closed. Farliament is no longer a deliberative assembly. That was shown by the vote of the majority of honourable members this morning. They agreed that Parliament should close after only eleven weeks' work. I do not say that members .of Parliament do no work during recesses. I do say, however, that we are not justified in spending forty-one weeks of the year away from this House. Ib must be clear to honourable members that, at this time especially, we should exercise every care in our expenditure so that all' possible relief from taxation may be afforded the people. It is idle for the Prime Minister, or any other honourable member, to talk about us having had a free discussion of the Budget. It is the right of all honourable members to give expression to their views on a Budget. That does not solve the difficulties. not possible for us, in the time at our disposal, to deal in detail with the items in such a way that we can effect economy. It is our duty, but no opportunity is given to us, to reduce expenditure, and to use the pruning knife when the circumstances warrant. The majority of this Committee, at a meeting held elsewhere, have decided to limit our discussion. I believe that that action was taken to stifle discussion for fear certain disclosures would be made which would not please honourable members. Every reason exists for suspicion that motives such as these have influenced honourable members. We shall not be able to' say all we think on the matters that come before us, because time will not permit it. The right honourable the Prime Minister is not justified in mitting present conditions to continue in many Departments. I cannot deal with details at this stage, because I should be out of order. If an opportunity were open to me to discuss the details of the matters I have in mind, I should not be addressing the Committee as I am. Honourable members know the great need there is for re-organizing various Departments, but they are prepared by their vote to allow the expenditure of thousands of pounds under what they realise to be unsatisfactory conditions to go unchallenged.",28

53,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,I would not be making this speech at all if the prospect of a proper and reasonable debate were before us.,29
54,Mr JACKSON,Unknown,"The Standing Orders control the debate, and the honourable member knows that his party agreed to the Standing Orders.",29
55,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Standing Orders should be used in a proper way. No one can say it is fair or right to use the guillotine to prevent full consideration of the Estimates. .1 remember that last year, in consequence of consideration given to the defence vote by members of this party, a reduction of £500,000 was It is made. No one will deny that. In my opinion, at least £2,000,000 could be saved in these Estimates if reasonable time were allowed to discuss them.",29
56,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,Why can we not save that money now?,29
57,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Because time will not permit the elucidation of the facts. Honourable members opposite, having decided elsewhere to keep their mouths closed while in this Parliament, and also to keep the mouths of other honourable members closed, they must answer for the consequences. What is worrying me is that we are carrying a very heavy load, and yet it it proposed to spend millions without proper consideration. Money is being wasted in many directions today. Honourable members have only to read stateper- ments in the i press every day to know Avhat is going on. Statesmen and leading men, not of the Labour party, who have travelled, remind us of the wasteful expenditure which the Government supporters are docile enough to sanction, merely in order to enable the Prime Minister to go to England. There are in the Committee at least a dozen members who would like to express their views on particular items in the Estimates, but are precluded from doing so.",29
58,Mr R GREEN,Unknown,"A great deal more time has been given to the consideration of the Estimates this year than was given last year. ,",29
59,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"The honourable member is a political "" new ' chum,"" if I may be allowed to say so, and would be told quite a differ' ent story by his predecessor. the last occasion the Government had suddenly decided to appeal to the country, and many members had left Melbourne. A motion was submitted by the Country party to defer the Estimates until after the elections, and it was supported by the Labour party. ""Where are those members of the Country party now?",30
60,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,rTha t was an indica-' tion that members were putting their own personal interests before those of the country.,30
61,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Exactly ; nobody knows the position better than the honourable member, who, in the last Parliament, was just as anxious as any one for economy.",30
62,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,"I was, and I shall vote for any reduction the honourable member may propose that I think reasonable.",30
63,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I believe the honourable member would, though I am afraid he will not have the opportunity. We are asked to pass this vote in two hours, although there are many items which require discussion.",30
64,Mr WHITSITT,Unknown,Ye t the - honourable member is wasting time in generalizing!,30
65,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,The public will not regard me as wasting time in making these remarks. I am here to look after public interests.,30
66,Mr WHITSITT,Unknown,So am I .,30
67,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Then , we regard our duty from different stand-points. Finance is government-the very essence of government-and honourable members ought to have the fullest freedom in the discussion of the Estimates. Without consulting the House in any way, the Government takes advantage of the powers it possesses, and decrees that certain business shall be concluded by 4 o'clock today. That is the hour at which the House usually rises on F r i days, and no motion has been submitted to make Saturday a sitting day. Certain honourable members, however, on the Prime Minister's suggestion, have agreed to other arrangements. In all my political experience I have never known such action to be taken. In caucus, the Government and their supporters have decreed that we shall sit right on until Saturday at noon. I cannot imagine any decision that should be more revoltOn ing to men with any conscience. It is deplorable that such a step should be decided in a private way.",30
68,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,Ha d the honourable member no intimation beforehand that the Government proposed to do this?,30
69,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,The only intimation I had was that another sitting day might be proposed.,30
70,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,The honourable member knew that we proposed to sit on Saturday..,30
71,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"But we did not know that the ""guillotine"" was to be applied in this way - When the Prime Minister and myself were discussing the subject of procedure the other night, the right honourable gentleman said, "" I propose to submit a motion to have Saturday made a day of sitting."" To that extent the idea was in his mind, but the proposal made today is quite another matter.",30
72,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,All I said was that I proposed to sit on Saturday; I did not speak of a motion.,30
73,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"May I recall to the right honourable gentleman's mind that, when he told me what he proposed to do, I said that I should have to oppose it, and that he replied that he had expected I would do so? Obviously, I could oppose only a motion. ' The usual method is to move for an additional sitting day. The Prime Minister, if he desires the House to sit on Monday, will have to submit a motion to that effect.",30
74,Mr WHITSITT,Unknown,Why not sit on Sunday ?,30
75,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I am surprised that honourable members opposite did not propose to sit on Sunday, or make the hour 12 midnight, instead of noon, so as to escape the Sunday. Mr R. GBEEN - If we got down to "" t in tacks"" we might finish by 11 tonight.",30
76,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"If we did get down to "" tin tacks "" we should be able to do nothing. That may be the attitude of the honourable member, but I am here to represent the country. The idea of an honourable member, new toParliament, suggesting the closing of Parliament merely to allow the Prime Minister to go to England! I feel pretty sure that if he, or any other honourable member, were to contest his seat on that question he would be badly beaten. In the next two weeks ill-digested Bills will be rushed through one after the other, with the in evitable result that amending measures will be necessary in the future. Surely Parliament does not regard its duty so lightly? It can be said with some force that the exacting work imposed on honourable members seriously affects their health. Who is to blame? Usually we sit three days a week, but latterly we have been sitting five, and now we are asked to sit right on into the sixth. Three days a week is ample when we take into consideration the nature of the work. 1 know there is a general impression outside that the duties ""of a member of Parliament are confined to the Chamber, but that is not so, for we have to work every day in the interests of our constituents and the country. What will be the result if we are called upon to sit six days a week? Of course, it is easy to suggest that the extra work does not matter much, seeing that we shall shortly be in recess, but the mischief is done while we are here overtaxing our strength in an unwholesome atmosphere. I have learned from personal experience that mental work is very different from manual work. In my younger days I could do a hard day's manual work, and rise fresh the following morning.; but that is not the case with such work as we are called upon to do here. If we have to expend our mental energies, why not do it under reasonable conditions, so that we may give of our best? When we are overworked, we have not the clarity of mental vision that is necessary in a deliberative assembly of this kind. We should do everything in our power to insure that our efforts are efficiently applied, for the problems that face us require the gravest consideration. Honourable members are too prone to think that, because their party is in power, all they have to do is to give the Government loyal support. The result is that Bills are introduced, suggested perhaps by departmental officers, and passed into law without proper consideration. We are too easily led by other persons who may not themselves have given proper consideration to the measures introduced here. We are here for the purpose of probing proposals made by the Government to the bottom, and seeing that legislation is passed in the interests of the country. That duty can only be performed if ample time is given honourable members to deal with every matter brought forward. ' It cannot be done if the business of Parliament is rushed through as now proposed. It is idle to censure the Government unless we are prepared to do our part.",30
77,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Unknown," The honourable gentleman's time has expired. Before I call upon the next speaker, I should like to say that in accordance with the reference to the Committee, the time allotted for the consideration of the Estimates for the Parliament and for the l'rime Minister's Department extends u n t i l 4 o'clock. I think in the circumstances that it would be better if I were to put to the Committee the proposed votes for these two Departments at the same time, so that items included in the Estimates for either might be discussed in the time at the disposal of honourable members. This course would not preclude any amendment upon items in the Estimates for the Parliament.",31
78,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I object to the adoption of that course. It has always been the practice, in considering the Estimates, for the Committee to take Department after Departmejnt, There is now no justification for putting the proposed votes for two Departments before the Committee at the same time. I confined my remarks to the first Department, that of the Parliament, and I say we should dispose of that Department before the vote for another is put to the Committee. Notwithstanding the action of the Government, we are not going to permit the guillotine to be used against us in that way. The TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN. I have not proposed anything of the kind. The honourable member has misunderstood me.",31
79,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"The Prime Minister has linked up the first two Departments, and only the first two, in the Estimates, but the Committee should not be guided by that. We should deal with one Department at a time, and the discussion should be confined to that. The TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN. I had no idea of curtailing the debate in any way. My object was, on the contrary, to widen the scope of the discussion, and to enable honourable members to speak on either of the two Departments which have to be dealt with by 4 o'clock. As there is objection to what I proposed, that r.nds the matter, and the-proposed vote before the Committee is that of The Parliament.",31
80,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"The ' Government certainly have no objection to honourable members discussing at this stage items in either the first or the second Department in the Estimates. Those Departments have been joined because it has been almost the universal practice in dealing with the vote for the Parliament to allow it to go through without further debate after discussion on the first item. It was because of the very great difficulty of allotting any time for the discussion of the vote for the Parliament, in view of the practice which has prevailed in the past, that the first two Departments were put together.",32

The Parliament was called together for a few days in the early part of this year only because it was necessary to comply a provision of the Constitution. To suit the convenience of the Prime Minister, and in order that the composite Government might find out where stood, Parliament was then closed again, and we had another recess. Now, with all the business that has accumulated, the Government proposes to rush the Estimates through by use of the guillotine, to close Parparliamentary liament again, and let the affairs of tralia go hang. New problems almost every day that require consideraStanding Orders. tion by Parliament. Unsavoury things are constantly occurring, which should be the subject of discussion in this ber, but, instead of keeping Parliament in session, to do the work ' for which money is now being voted, we are asked to slum and muddle through the meamember sures which the Government throw upon these Estimates have been the table, and then close up Parliament, to enable the Prime Minister to go a holiday trip to Great Britain . The Treasurer and the Prime Minister contended that the Government was almost paternal in its generosity in giving so long a time for the discussion of . the , Budget, but that has nothing to do with the Estimates. No vote could be recorded against the Budget as a whole, but in the Estimates there are innumerable items, some of which should be struck out altogether, some added to, and others reduced, and u n t i l honourable members have an opportunity to hear argument on the items, these adjustments of the Estimates cannot be properly made. In the last Parliament the Treasurer contended that the Estimates should not be made a party measure. When the honourable gentleman was not speaking satirically and somewhat venomously in criticism of the last Budget, he was urging that the Estimates should not be forced through by the use of party machinery. He was eloquent in the - I country at the time of the elections upon necessity for restoring constitutional n government and the control of the purse by Parliament. He repeated the parrot cry "" Finance is government and governWe ment is finance,"" but the honourable for gentleman now joins with the Prime Minister, not only in making the Estionly mates a party measure, but in using the guillotine to force them through, in so short a time as to prevent the light of day being turned upon some items that with are being smuggled through.",32
82,Mr JACKSON,Unknown,Will the honourable member name one of the items that are it being smuggled through.,32
83,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"If we are given proper time in which to discuss the Estimates, we shall endeavour to point out such items. The Government claims to be using the guillotine as a legitimate weapon to force the EstiAusmates through, but its use in the way arise proposed is against the spirit of the The provision was made in the. Standing Orders for the application of the guillotine to meet a Champractice which had grown up in the past of "" stone-walling "" business by honourable members who spoke sometimes for five or six hours. Will any honourable on the opposite side contend that stonewalled,"" or that time has been wasted in on the debate on the Budget? If they do make this contention, let me say that, as in nearly every case a speaker on this side on the Budget was followed by one on the other side, they are as much responsible for what took place as we are. It is most improper to apply the guillotine to the Estimates. To ask this Committee to sit continuously from 11 o'clock this morning until noon tomorrow, and in that time to vote away £60,000,000. of the taxpayers' money, is preposterous. One particularly questionable part of the timetable submitted by the Prime Minister is that for the Defence Department, one of the most contentious sections of the Estimates, . in which hundreds of thousands of pounds is being wasted. It is to be discussed between 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. tomorrow. Those are the hours when honourable members will be most tired, and the Government proposal is as brutal as the military system which the Government are bolstering up with the amounts shown on these Estimates. I suppose that the Estimates will be disposed of according to the time-table, but honourable members opposite will find it difficult to explain to their constituents their action in closing the mouths of the representatives of the people in regard to the disbursement of public moneys. The erstwhile Country party is now part and parcel of the National party, which represents "" big business "" and its methods, and I hope that next time its members go before the electors they will have the decency to describe themselves as Nationalists.",32
84,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,"Kooyong) [3.3] - Eo r the last three-quarters of an hour we have listened to the solemn complaint of honourable members opposite that they are allowed no time to make complaints, I have been waiting to hear from them of what items in the Division before the Committee they desire to complain. If there are items which are being ""smuggled"" through-in black print upon white paper-it is full time we heard about them. If the speeches which have been delivered on this Division are to be regarded as a model, I shall owe an apology to the Committee for venturing to call attention to some items in the Division of 'Parliament which call for consideration. There is an item on the Estimates for ""temporary assistance, including typists for members."" I suggest that more typists should be provided for members while the House is in session. With the present staff it is difficult for members to handle with reasonable promptitude and efficiency the large quantity of correspondence which .they receive. The telephone service in the building is very unsatisfactory. It may be that the demands upon the telephones are too great; but I suggest that there should be direct lines from this building to the exchange^ because frequently members have to wait for connection with the exchange through the switch. I have no doubt that the switch attendant does his best; but is anything gained by carrying all lines through the switch ? The loss of time that results through the absence of direct lines means serious inconvenience and impaired efficiency.",33
85,Mr OKEEFE,Unknown,"Denison) [3.7] - I move That the vote be reduced' by £1. I take this course as a protest against the premature closing of Parliament, and the insufficient time allowed for the consideration of matters of the gravest public importance, including the expenditure of over £60,000,000 of public money. The honourable member for Kooyong (Mr. Latham) objects to honourable members on this side of the Chamber daring to occupy time in a general discussion. It is impossible in the short time allowed to us by the Prime Minister to discuss items in detail, and we are compelled to resort to a general discussion in order to voice our protest against the autocratic action of the right honourable gentleman and his servile followers. The honourable member for Kooyong mentioned the difficulty that members have in attending to their huge correspondence in the time at their disposal. That, in itself, is a reason why Parliament should not be asked to sit day and night to suit the convenience of the Government. I hope that, by this amendment^ we shall have an opportunity of letting the people know that their representatives, who are paid a reasonable salary to attend to the country's affairs, are being gagged by the Government. If I were sitting on the Ministerial side, my allegiance to my party would be strained to breaking point if the Government attempted to close my mouth, as the present Government have closed the mouths of their supporters. The present protracted sittings, and the proposed curtailment of the session are unprecedented in the history of this Parliament. All the talk we have heard about waste of time is, so much camouflage. The Prime Minister has taken care that there shall be no opportunity to waste time. Although the High Commissioner's office is controlled by the Prime Minister's Department, I think it is fitting to discuss it in connection with the Estimates for Parliament. I hope that the Prime Minister, while he is in England, will find time to discuss with the High Commissioner the question of immigration. 1 do not know whether it is the duty of the High Commissioner to keep a watchful eye over the class of immigrant being sent to Australia; but if that is part of his responsibility he is not carrying out his job, because many of the immigrants who have arrived during the last few months are not likely to be an asset to this country. Very many criticisms have been published throughout Australia regarding some of the new arrivals. I do not know whether the whole of the H i gh Commissioner's time is occupied in attending banquets, but if he is responsible for the selection of immigrants the Commonwealth is not getting much value from his services in that regard. Included in the Parliamentary Estimates are many items which couid profitably be discussed at some length, b ut I would not object to a limitation of the debate on this Department and that of the Prime M in ister if the time allotted to the discussion of other Departments with wide Ramifications were not to be so seriously curtailed. If honorabla members on this side are of my opinion, when the larger spending Departments are reached, they will walk out of the chamber. We are not allowed a reasonable time i u which to criticise the items of expenditure. The honourable member for Franklin (Mr Seabrook), I know, would like to discuss many items in these two Departments, but his mouth is closed.",33
86,Mr JACKSON,Unknown,That is not so.,34
87,Mr OKEEFE,Unknown,The honourable member for Bass would probably like more time in which to discuss the Estimates than is allowed.,34
88,Mr JACKSON,Unknown,W © have plenty of time for discussion.,34
89,Mr OKEEFE,Unknown,"Does the honourable member believe that he can .fool the people in that way? When he attends a meeting and his audience does not care to hear dry details of policy he can amuse them with a song or monologue, but he will not be able to explain to his constituents the action of the Government in limiting the discussion of the proposed expenditure of £60,000,000. The people of Australia are groaning under the burden of heavy taxation, and they will be looking to the national Parliament for a fair and reasonable explanation of the items on the Estimates. What chance shall we have to explain to our constituents why the expenditure of any particular Department has been in flated, reduced, or dispensed with altogether? This Parliament is composed of men who have come from the four corners of Australia to frame a national policy and the laws under which the people have to live, and under which they are today paying dearly, and no barrier should be placed in the way of a reasonable criticism of the Estimates.",34
90,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,"Wakefield) [3.31] Seeing that the schedule involves two Departments, and that the time allowed for their discussion wil l expire in about forty minutes' time, I ask the Chairman whether honourable members are entitled to deal with the two Departments?",34

92,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"I am afraid there is a misunderstanding. The Leader of the Opposition objected to the two Departments being considered together, and before the Chairman gave a definite ruling, I said that the Government did not object to the two Departments being discussed ' together.",34
93,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,"It is impracticable to take one item at a time. The Opposition, by their tactics, are curtailing the consideration of the Estimates, and if they persist, the time for discussion wil l expire before there is any opportunity to speak on either Department. If the Opposition throughout the Estimates intend to pursue this policy they must take the responsibility. An explanation w i ll have to be made outside that cannot be made here. I ask the Chairman to rule whether it is competent to discuss both items ? The TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN"". - The question before the Chair is the \ote for the Parliament.",34

(Bourke) [ 3 . 2 5 ] Statement after - statement has been made by honourable members of the other side as to what they intend to do in the interests of the country. But they do not take us into their confidence. They hold a meeting and decide whab is necessary. We also held a meeting, and decided what we should do in the interests of the country. We wish to give the honourable member for Wakefield an opportunity to voice his opinions upon the various items of expenditure. We feel that it is an outrage on the country that the honourable member for Franklin should, not be able to express his opinion upon general matters affecting the interests of Tasmania. He no doubt wishes to discuss the disastrous results of the Navigation Act.",35
95,Mr SEABROOK,Unknown,The Arbitration Court causes the trouble.,35
96,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"The honourable member will be unable to speak on that subject. It is highly important that honourable members should discuss these Estimates. We speak not for ourselves but for those who are silent behind the Government. The honourable member for Lilley (Mr Mackay) could give an interesting and passionate speech on the subject of bananas, but his remarks will be curtailed when the axe falls. The honourable member for Bass (Mr . Jackson) is more conversant with the Northern Territory than is any other person, but his information will be suppressed and his voice silenced. Honourable members on the other side are hiding their light under a bushel. interesting it would have been hear the honourable member for Indi on the subject of bacon. The honourable member for Kooyong, under the heading of "" Parliament,"" spoke of typists and attendants, but we feel that, until 4 o'clock, no subject is more important than that of Parliament. What trouble I am preventing! The Prime Minister will have no Department to defend. He will not be able to enlarge on the great value of his Department We shall have to miss the pearls of wisdom the Prime Minister had for us. The cost of living allowances for the Senate staff have increased from £454 to £469. One of the primary factors of the increase in the cost of living is the increase of prices thoughout the country. The honourable member for Martin (Mr ' Pratten) is probably putting better labels on the jam he sells. Possibly he is supplying a better quality of jam than formerly. Possibly he intends to sell the quality that he gave to His Majesty the K i ng and Mr Lloyd George on the occasion on which he received a letter of commendation from them. The honourable member may remember that the price of jam was never so high as when our country was struggling for its existence.  orable member talk about something he understands? He knows nothing about jam.",35
97,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"I have read in Who's Who about the honourable member, and found out many of his good qualities, but I will leave that subject. The child . endowment allowance for the Senate indicates that the population within the precincts of Parliament House is increasing, but that is one of the matters beyond the control of the Government.",35
98,Mr COOK,Unknown,Is the honourable member in favour of reducing salaries?,35
99,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"I am not. I am no more in favour of reducing the salaries of honourable members, or allowances generally, than the honourable member is in favour of reducing the price 'of his bacon. If the honourable member desires to make any remarks on that subject, he must make them before 4 o'clock. At that time the guillotine operates. The right honourable the Prime Minister says he must carry the Estimates through How and finish the business he wishes to place to before Parliament in time for him to go to England for the Imperial Conference. It has been said that he may be offered a title in England. Some people think that he ought not to take it if it is offered. Whatever course he adopts will be the best in his own interests, and in the interests of Australia, for the two interests coincide. An allowance of £1,100 is provided for the Speaker of the House of Representatives and £ 5 00 for the Chairman of Committees. Our present Speaker is one of the most worthy recipients of that emolument. The Chairman of Committees is to receive no increase this year. An increased sum is provided for child endowment for the House of Representatives staff. The salaries bf the more humble class of attendants at Parliament House should be increased. Senior messengers get only £212 a year, and junior messengers from £182 to £196 a year. In consequence of the increasing cost of living, Arbitration Courts and Wages Boards are awarding higher wages. An institution such as this is should set an example to private employers.",35
100,Mr JACKSON,Unknown,The cost of living allowance goes on to the amounts the honourable member mentioned.,36
101,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,How do we know that? We have to assume it.,36
102,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"I appreciate the htonorable member for Bass (Mr Jackson). If he does not address honourable' members he at least makes interjections which are helpful. The cost of living allowance for the whole of the Sergeant-at-Arms' staff is only £20 more this year than last year. That is an insignificant amount. This parliament is paying ignominious wages to some of its officers. It ought to pay better wages than outside institutions. The Committee should instruct the Government to . increase the wages of the attendants. The men should receive at least 1.0s. more a week. These men are required to keep themselves well clothed and keep their homes and families respectable. should treat them generously, and not shamefully, as we are doing. Every honourable member should utter a protest against the continuation of these paltry wages. I cannot remember any occasion on which "" The Parliament"" has occupied such a prominent place in the consideration of the Estimates. Honourable members feel that they must speak their mind now, for they will have no opportunity to do so after 4 o'clock. The guillotine is a magnificent institution. can always be handed over to .one's friends when the need arises. Precedents are being established now which may be mostvaluable in the future'. Honourable members on this side of the Committee will be able, if they so desire, to do as they are being done by. Some of my Christian friends on the Opposition benches do not agree with the policy of "" a n eye for an eye."" They think we should not indulge in reprisals.",36
103,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Unknown, Will the honourable member connect his remarks with the item now under notice?,36

105,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,"Fawkner) [3.43] I confess that I had some doubt about whether sufficient time had been allowed for the consideration of the details of our various Departments. After listening to the debate I am satisfied that more than sufficient time has been allowed for the first Department. I know that honourable members of the Opposition have the interests of the country at heart. I believe that they are actuated, in their present procedure, by a desire to serve the best interests of the country. They have made serious complaint that insufficient time has been given for the careful examination of the details of the Estimates. The Leader, the Deputy Leader, and several other honourable members of the Opposition have addressed the Committee to this effect. I am quite satisfied that these honourable members have carefully scrutinized the details of the proposed expenditure in this Department to see that there is justification for every penny of it. So far the only suggestion made by the Opposition is that we should reduce this vote of £60,000 by £ 1 . Evidently the whole effort of the OpposiWe tion is directed to saving £ 1 , in the interests of the country.",36

108,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,For what purpose?,36
109,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,"I know what the purpose is. The fact remains that the whole effort of the Opposition is directed to a reduction of the vote by £ 1 , whatever the object may be. Surely I am It right in assuming that those gentlemen, who have given such careful consideration fco every item in the Department, would have offered some criticism if they could have done so! Not one member has directed his attention to any particular item.",36
110,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,The honourable member forgets that we are entitled to discuss Parliament generally.,36
111,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,"Surely ; but I assume that those gentlemen opposite, who have the interests of the country at heart, know that this vote has to go through a certain time. Surely they would waste their time in general fulminations against the Government if they thought that, by directing their attention to any should close. particular item, they could save one penny! The fact that they have devoted themselves to a general attack on the Government, forces us to the only posclusion sible conclusion that, after careful sideration, they can take no exception any item. Honourable members opposite open. are constantly saying that we on this side have to answer to our constituents. Well, we all know that. I have to answer to my constituents, and to my constituents only. Not one member oppolong. site can say the same. They know pertake fectly well they have somebody else answer to. I am satisfied to go before my constituents and justify my in regard to a matter of this kind. .We have been told that Parliament is to be closed for a certain time. That course has been deliberately decided upon by the Government, and assented to supporters, myself included, for reasons that appear to me to justify my action. When I take that stand, I am told that gence to attempt an explanation. when I go before my constituents I shall be punished; but I am quite satisfied to abide by their decision. We that the Prime Minister is practically "" sneaking "" business through the House in order to go on a "" holiday trip."" honourable members who use that phrase believe it to be true ? Do they think this visit of the Prime Minister to the Mother Country is anything in the nature of a holiday trip; or do they believe that, rightly or wrongly, the Prime ister is going Home on a most important mission, from my point of view, at least, and from the point of view, I believe, every member on this side of the Chamable ber ? The mission with which he is charged is fraught with the gravest sequences to Australia. Do honourable members think that the Prime Minister can go on such a mission without undertaking an immense amount of hard work Will he not be working from the time he matters of debate. leaves here until he comes back to an account of his mission?",36

The TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN (Mr Bayley) - When the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) raised a point. of order a few moments ago, I overlooked the fact that we were in Committee.

Honourable members should put their political feelings aside and record their votes in support of the amendment. The Government have an accumulated surplus of £7,475,000, and there is nothing to prevent them from utilizing £2,000,000 of this amount to increase the weekly pension by 5s. On many occasions the members of this party have moved in this direction, - and I sincerely hope the amendment will have general support.",41

154,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,AB ill is to be introduced to liberalize the conditions.,41
155,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,"Yes . I feel compelled in this instance to support the amendment moved 'by the honourable member for Reid (Mr Coleman). Members who were in the House in 1918 will remember that I opposed the payment of a pension to the late Chief Justice of the High Cburt, Sir Samuel Griffith, for reasons which to me seemed quite sound. On that occasion I said that I would not be a party to being generous in that way before being just to those who had stronger claims on our generosity. I regret exceedingly the speech delivered by the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Duncan-Hughes), who is usually so logical in his statements, and who thinks so clearly. I was astounded at the arguments he adduced in support Of his contention that an increase should not be granted. One reason which he submitted in support of his argument was that in other parts of the world less generous provision than exists in. Australia is made for the invalids and old people. It is no satisfaction to one who is livin g just below is the "" bread-line,"" and .who asks for an in 1 crease that will take him just above it,-to be told that there are people in other countries even worse off than he. Another argument used by the honourable member for Boothby was that any money available to provide an increase in old-age and in valid pensions ought rather to be spent in developing the resources of the Commonwealth. I , for my part, would refuse to spend a penny in the development of Commonwealth resources while there were those having a claim upon us who were living below the "" bread-line."" Invalid and old-age pensions were first granted in 1910, when the rate was fixeH at 10s. per week; and I have been informed by the Commonwealth Statistician that it would now require 17s. lOd. to purchase what 10s. would buy in 1910, so that when we have granted an extra 2s. 6d. per week we shall be paying 4d. per week less than we paid in 1910. I desire to direct the Treasurer's attention to an amending In v a l i d and Old-age Pensions Act passed in September, 1921, - I to enable the blind people of Australia to obtain the full invalid pension, provided the amount, plus their earnings, did not give them more than the basic wage of £ 4 5s. per week'. In making provision for increased pensions I ask the Treasurer to see that the necessary amendment is made in the Act, so that blind folk can secure the advantage of the increased rate. For the ""last thirty years, I have taken a keen interest in the blind people of Australia. I have always, through sympathy, been able to appreciate to some extent, at least, their limitations, but since I became a member of the brotherhood of those who walk in darkness, I know more fully what those limitations are. I am anxious that everything possible should be done to put them on an equality with those who are not so handicapped. The blind man in possession of his other faculties is able to take his place as a citizen and assume the obligations of citizenship, and I trust that in the near future these men will get the full benefit of the pension whatever their earnings may be. If that is done they will be placed on terms of equality-so far as that is possible-wit h their fellow citizens who are not - so handicapped. Under the existing A ct only those permanently incapacitated by sickness or by blindness are eligible for the pension, if their incapacity occurred whilst in Australia, or they were brought to the Commonwealth before they were three years of age. In some instances this limitation works very hardly. instance, at the Blind Institution on St. Kilda-road, there are two old men, one of whom is sixty-four years of age, and came to the Commonwealth when four years old. He has been in the Commonwealth for sixty years and is still working at his trade in the Institution, but because he did not come to Australia before he was three years old he is ineligible for a pension. The other man, who is now fifty-five years old, has been in the Commonwealth for thirty-eight years, and he, too, is in eligible for the same reason. In order to meet such cases, the Act should be amended so that a blind person who has come to the Commonwealth after reaching three years of age, should, if he continues to reside in the Commonwealth for twenty years, become eligible. That condition would be sufficient to prevent persons from coming here to derive benefit in this way. Because I realise that anything short of an increase of 5s. per week is inadequate I intend to support the amendment.",41
156,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"Cowper-Trea surer) [4,43] - The Government full y realise the position in which invalid and old people are placed, and have attempted to deal with the matter in the most sympathetic manner possible. We are not merely providing for an increase in the rate, but for the first time since invalid and old-age pensions have been paid, a determined effort is being made to remove the anomalies which have been found to exist in administering the Act . When an amending Bill is introduced next week I shall be able to deal more full y with the question, and explain how the conditions are to be made more liberal. The present proposal involves an additional annual - expenditure of £1,250,000. This is a recurring expenditure, and our finances must be adjusted in order to meet the annual cost. In ratio to the cost of living, the proposed increase in pension will be the largest since 1909-10, when the first old-agepension legislation was in troduced in Australia. At that time the pension was 20s. per fortnight. The Act was amended by the Labour party in 1912. At that time the pension of 20s. was 3s. 3d. less than the equivalent in 1909-10. A pension of 23s. 3d. would have been necessary to meet the increase For in the cost of food, clothing, and housing. In 1916 the rate was increased to 25s. a fortnight, but, on the basis of 1909, the pension should have been 28s. 3d. to meet the increase in the cost of living. It must be remembered that the Labour party had been in office for five out of the six years from 1910 to 1916.",42

I ask honourable members not to support the amendment. G overnment' j intend to give immediate relief to meet present-day conditions by increasing the amount of the pension, and by rectifying practically every anomaly. Before the end of the session it is proposed to appoint a Royal Commission to examine the whole incidence of old-age and invalid conditions. Next session the Government intend to consider its findings and, if practicable, to bring forward a measure to deal with unemployment, and to make liberal and assured provision for the aged, sick, and infirm .

I have been in close association with those who derive a benefit from pensions, and every Sunday for over three years my wife and I visited the benevolent institution at Geelong to try to bring a little ray of sunshine into the lives of sixty or seventy of its patients. The old-age pension should be substantially increased. The pensioners, since 1914, have not re? ceived a sufficient increase in ratio to the cost of living. The present pension is by no means adequate, and it leaves the recipients nothing but a bare existence. Even then they need the support of people who are charitably disposod to them. If the Government can afford to grant large subsidies to industries, they should be prepared to grant an amount that will make the evening of l if e happier and easier for the aged pensioners.

167,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,"Y a r r a ) [ 5 . 4 ] the attention of the Treasurer to a very grave injustice that is being done to certain members of the Public Service under the Superannuation Act , which was passed last year. A Board was appointed, and it has given a ruling in respect to military staff clerks to the effect that the definition of "" service"" for these clerks means service since the passing of the Defence (Civil Employment) A ct 1918. The effect of this ruling is that their term of service is regarded for purposes of superannuation only, as five years, although some of the clerks have been permanently employed in the Service for the last thirty-four years. ' One of them, whom I know personally, joined the Postal Service many years ago, and was transferred to the Defence Department on passing an examination, but under the ruling to which I have referred this officer is regarded as having only five years' service. In every other respect, the officers are treated on the same basis as members of the Public Service generally. I believe that the ruling is unsound, and, if it is, the Treasurer should have the matter rectified. If it is not an unsound ruling, the Act should be amended, as Parliament never intended that there should be differential treatment for these particular officers. are working side by side with other clerks in the Department, some of whom reached the salary of £320 before the war. The latter, automatically received an honorary commission, and were classified as officers. In these cases the term of service is computed, not from the time of the passing of the Defence (Civil Employment) Act, but from the time they received their commission. Thus, we have all the clerks with honorary commissions enjoying the full privileges of superannuation. If military staff clerks are over the age of t h i r t y years, they are required to take all the units of pension to which they are entitled as at the rate for age, whereas if it were not for the ruling they would be allowed to take four units at the rate for the age of t h i r ty years, .and the balance of their units at the rate for age. These latter are the rates ruling for those who have had ten years' service. I shall mention a few concrete cases in the Department, and I can supply the names of the officers if the Treasurer wishes to have - I draw them. The first case is that of a major, who is fifty-six years of age and has thirty-three years' service. He is entitled to seven units. His contribution is £ 2 Is. 5d. a fortnight; but if he were a clerk his contribution, according to the ruling, would be £ 3 16s. 8d., instead of £ 2 Is. 5d., making a difference of £ 1 15s. 3d. a fortnight for the nine years he still has to serve. The increase m the contribution for the nine years would amount to £ 4 1 2 8s. 6d. I now take the case of a captain, who is forty-six years of age and has thirty-one years of service. For his seven units he contributes £ 1 2s. l i d . a fortnight. If he happened to be a clerk, he would have to pay, under this ruling, £ 1 13s. 2d., a difference of 10s. 3d. a fortnight for a period of nineteen years, making a total of £ 2 53 2s. 6d. more than he would have fco contribute if itwere not for this r u l ing. The next case is that of a major, aged forty-seven years, with twenty-five years' service. For his eight units he contributes £ 1 8s. l i d . If he were a clerk, he would pay £ 2 Os. 6d., a difference of l is . 7d. a fortnight, and for the eighteen years he has still to serve the increase would amount to £ 2 70 18s. A captain aged forty-three years, with twenty-two years' service, contributes for seven units, for which he pays £ 1 Os. 8d. They a fortnight: A clerk without a commission would be required to pay £ 1 7s. l i d . for the same number of units, or an additional 7s. 3d. a fortnight, and in the twenty-two years of remaining service the extra payment would amount to £207 7s., apart altogether from interest on the money. Let me point out the grave injustice being perpetrated in the case of a clerk aged fifty-five years, who has been in the service for thirty-four years. He is entitled to seven units, costing £ 3 8s. 7d. a fortnight. If he were 'an officer or an ordinary member of the Public Service, he would have to pay £ 1 18s., a difference of £ 1 10s. 7d., making a total increased payment of £397 l is . for the remaining ten years of service. I m mediately the decision of the Board was announced, this clerk dropped three of the seven units for which he had been contributing, because he could not afford to pay for all of them. There are only a few hundred.men affected by this r u l in g ; but justice should be done to them at once. My reading of the Act leads me to think that a wrong interpretation been placed upon it , but these men forced to contribute to the Superannuarendered tion Fund at the higher rate, and the Department i a ' taking no steps to remedy the injustice, although refind themselves. presentations have been made through their own departmental officers. The basis of the technicality that has been raised is that all the men to whom I have referred had to be re-attested every three years, after the first five years, and cause of that they are not regarded having been permanently employed. decision of the Board is that they became permanent officers only on the passing the Defence Civil Employment Act five years ago, but I can find nothing in the Superannuation Act to say that service must be permanent.",44

These clerks, Government. some of whom hav,e been in the service for over thirty years, have to intents and purposes been permanent a benefit. officers, and in no sense temporary casual employees. attested solely on the question of their health. The ruling is manifestly unfair. There is a section in the Act referring to invalidity and incapacity, and under it these clerks would suffer a great injustice. If an officer with .more than of 10 per cent, is collected. seven years' service becomes incapacitated he is entitled to draw his full pension"", . and his widow becomes entitled to half the pension, with 5s. a week for each child under the age of fourteen years. But the military staff clerks cannot ceive that benefit. I am astonished frequently. that such a palpable injustice was not rectified as soon as the ruling was given. Either the ruling should be tested, or a Bill brought down to rectify the position. It was never intended that this distinchave tion should be made. On the transfer those men to the Public. Service they tained all their existing rights, and rights are recognised with this one ception. I feel so strongly in the matter that I feel inclined to move that the vote be reduced as an instruction to the Golife. . vernment to put these men on a proper the footing. If the Treasurer will assure that he will have this done, I shall has divide the Committee, but otherwise I are shall.

172,Mr JACKSON,Unknown,"Bass) [5.17] - When demands for the Federal land tax are sent out, the taxpayers are given t h i r t y days in which to pay, after which period a fine Can the Treasurer see his way to alter this regulation so that the taxpayer may be given a longer period of, say, sixty days? Many of these people live in distant places where there is a letter delivery only every two reor three weeks, and sometimes more in This fine of 10 per cent, works out at anything from 90 per cent, to 300 per cent, of the tax, according to circumstances; and, of course, this is a should be Berious matter to the taxpayers. I should like to read a letter which I received in reference to the operation' of of (he entertainments tax in the country redistricts of Tasmania, and to ask whether those something cannot be done to relieve the exsituation ? The letter is as follows: The entertainment and amusement tax has had rather a disastrous result upon country It. has been a custom, as you know, in outlying districts, upon the organization of me entertainments, for each party to pay. These entertainments are technically liable to tax, not but the returns and compliance with the regulations were so burdensome and irritating that these entertainments are being abandoned, and country life in the winter in this State (Tasmania) has become more drab than ever. .know of specific instances of the above, notably at St. Patrick's River, where the formerly frequent functions are now a thing of the past. The young men ride their bicycles to the city, and the girls are clearing out to domestic service, also to the city. I suggest that the Treasurer somewhat relax the law so far as country districts are concerned. Those of us who haye had experience of assisting at country entertainments know the difficulties under which the promoters work. Mr F. MCDONALD (Barton) [5.20] I referred last night to some hard cases that have cropped up under the Superannuation Act, and I should like to now make some further reference to them. The Act has proved to operate very harshly in the case of the widows and children of a few public servants, who, after agreeing to take certain units, unfortunately died between the proclamation of the Act and the date on which the - first contribution had to be paid. result, their widows and children have been left in a most unfortunate position. The Board considers that it cannot legally pay anything tothose people who are suffering from a double misfortune, in as much that they have lost their bread-winners, and are now dependent on charity. The position arose by no means through the neglect of the deceased public servants of their dependants. Had 'these men remained in the State service, from which they were transferred, they would haye enjoyed the benefitsof the State Superannuation Acts. On their transfer, all their State rights were safeguarded, and those who came from States where there was no superannuation came, of course, automatically under the Commonwealth Act. I am hot personally acquainted with any of these people, of whose misfortune I happened to hear quite incidentally. - have, however, had some experience of a State superannuation, and 1 know that in New South Wales, where cases of the kind occurred, a remedy was applied. I understand that the Government has the matter under consideration, but, as yet, has not decided to take any action sooner than, perhaps, a year or two hence. The people affected are few in number, and the expenditure involved, if justice be done, can be only small. Further, I impress upon the Government that, by dealing liberally with these people, no precedent can be created, for similar cirI cumstances cannot again arise. The Government should either agree to indemn if y the Board, for payments which equity demands shall be paid to these people, or the Government should itself act. I feel sure that the instincts . of humanity will prompt the Government to do something for the widows and children of old and f a it h f u l servants. It must be remembered that the Commonwealth Superannuation Act was long promised and long delayed. For that I blame no one, but only say that if the delay had not occurred this misfortune would not have overtaken these people.",45
173,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,"Kooyong) [ 5 . 2 7 ] - I am glad that the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) has called attention to the position of the military staff clerks under the Superannuation Act. By the ruling of the Superannuation Board these clerks are placed in an abnormal position,.of which, I am sure, many honourable As a members have no idea. The military staff clerks are employed in the terms of the military regulations, and become members of the Permanent Forces, attesting at the outset for five years, and then re-attesting. I understand that the observance of that regulation has been neglected, and many have been irregularly employed, some for over twenty years. This irregularity is not at all a fault of the clerks, but is due to the Department. They were under the Defence Civil Employment Act 1918 u n t i l that Act expired twelve months or six months"" after the end of the war, when they reverted to the position of members of the Permanent Forces. It has now been ruled by the Board that they became permanent employees only when they were brought under the provisions of the Defence Civil Employment Act, and I that, therefore, they have not had the ten years' service' necessary to bring them within the operation of the Superannuation Act . The ruling of the Board concerns primarily section 35 of the Superannuation Act , which provides that "" any employee who has been in the Service for at least ten years,"" and has attained the maximum age for retirement,, shall, on retirement at - any time after the passing of the Act be entitled, to a pension in accordance with his salary. The important words are "" any employee who has been in the Service for at least ten years."" "" Employee "" is defined, in section 4 as a person who is employed in a permanent capacity by the Commonwealth, and who, with certain exceptions, is by the terms of his employment required to give his whole time to his duties. ""Service"" is defined as ""service under, or employment by the Commonwealth."" I understand that the Superannuation Board agreed that these clerks are ' ' employees""; that is to say, that they are now employees in a permanent capacity. The Board, however, has ruled , that they have not been in the Service for at least ten years. ""When we tur n to the definition of "" service"" we find nothing requiring that the service shall be in a permanent capacity as is required in the definition of "" employee."" It appears to me that there is a great deal to be said for the view that persons who now are employed in a permanent capacity by the Commonwealth, and who have been in the service of the Commonwealth for at least ten years-that is to say, who have served under the Commonwealth for at least ten years in a permanent or any other capacity-fal l within the terms of section 35. I suggest to the Treasurer that he obtain the opinion of the Solicitor-General, or such other opinion as he may think proper. If that opinion should uphold the ruling of the Board, I support the suggestion of the honourable member for Yarra (Mr . Scullin) that consideration be given to the introduction of an amending B i l do what I feel satisfied must have been the intention of Parliament when this Act was put through. There is one other matter to which I desire to refer briefly, and that is the issue of amended assessments by the Taxation Department. That Department from time to time issues amended assessments in 'cases in which it thinks that further taxation is payable. Until the amendment of the Income Tax Assessment A ct was passed last year, there was no time limit placed upon the issue of amended assessments. In the case of war-time profits tax and land tax I think that that is still so. The result is that taxpayers are placed in a very difficult position, on account of the reconsideration by the Department of earlier decisions. I propose to give one example, which will be found on reference to the Commonwealth Law Reports, to show how this practice operates. A citizen of Melbourne, who was a merchant, bought a quantity of wheat scrip, and after a time re-sold it , making a profit of £1,850. In order to ascertain his position in regard to the payment of income tax, he went to the Department, where he saw a responsible officer, and inquired whether he would have to pay income tax on that amount. He was told that he would not. "" We l l , "" he said, "" I can spend it freely?"" The answer was, "" Yes."" "" But , "" he said, "" I want to make sure of my position. What can I do?"" He was advised to attach to his income tax return a memorandum informing the Department that he had made this profit but had not in cluded it in the return. He adopted that course and was assessed for income tax on a sum that did not include this item of £1,850. He then fel t free to spend the money, and did so. Two years afterwards the Department reconsidered the matter, changed its mind, and issued an amended assessment. He protested, but uselessly. The matter was the subject of litigation in the High Court of Australia. That Court held that the first opinion of the Department was wrong and that its latter opinion was right. He had to pay the tax and the costs of the appeal. I submit that that is not a proper position in which to place any citizen of the community. A system of legislation and administration which l to leads to that result ought to be revised. Let me give another example. A firm in this city, a number of years ago, placed the whole of its position before the Commissioner of Taxation in relation to war-time profits taxation, and obtained from the Commissioner a letter stating that no war-time profits tax was payable in respect of the profits of the firm. The head-quarters of this firm were in France. It remitted its Australian profits to France when the exchange was about 30 francs to the £ 1 . Either last year or this year the Department changed its mind in this case also, and has been seeking to obtain payment of war-time profits tax from, this firm. That is a tax of, I think, 75 per cent, of the excess profits. . The money was remitted to France, where it was liable to taxation at a similarly high rate. To get that money back from France, when the exchange is about 70 francs to to the £1, will result in a tax upon it of at least 150 per cent. That is unjust. I am sure that if the Committee followed the facts it will realise this system of administration some revision. In my life I have a great with the taxation laws of the Commonwealth, and I know the under which citizens labour at present. Recently certain trustees ' paid duties on an estate worth about They have realized and distributed assets of the estate to beneficiaries in England. They ' sought definite and binding statement from the Taxation Department that they had completely satisfied .the taxation ments of the Commonwealth. present law it is impossible to obtain any decision that is safe, certain 'and binding in that respect. If the Taxation ment subsquently changes its mind it can descend upon these trustees personally and make them pay the extra tax. urge upon the Government the necessity for amending the taxation laws of the Commonwealth in the direction of providing that, after the tax has been paid, and a certain period of time has elapsed - in - the absence of fraud or non-disclosure of. material facts-the shall be regarded as settled and closed. Where there is fraud or non-disclosure of material facts the revenue should be protected. There is in the last Income Tax Assessment Act a section which provides that there shall be no further after a named period, except in cases where the Commissioner considers has been fraud or non-disclosure material facts. It will be observed that - that still leaves the matter in the hands of the Department. It ought to be possible, under our law, for the taxpayer to obtain some finality. Government Acts, of , I think, the whole of the States, there is included a section which provides that a purchaser of land may go to the clerk of a and obtain from him a statement ing the amount of rates owing upon land which he proposes to buy, and the municipality is bound by that statement. suggest that a similar provision be inserted in the taxation legislation of the Commonwealth, providing that, after the lapse of a reasonable period, a certificate may be obtained by the taxpayer the Department showing that he has comMr Latham. pletely discharged his taxation liabilities, and that thab should be final and bindhas ing, except in. cases of fraud or of nonthat disclosure of material facts. requires professional Mr Forde (Capricornia) [ 5 . 3 9 ] - I deal to do move That the proposed vote be reduced by £1. anxieties I move this amendment as an instruction to the Government to amend the Superestate annuation Act to provide for the inclu£100,000. sion of benefits to lighthouse keepers and the other public servants, who have been transferred from the State service within to obtain a ten j'ears of the passing of the Superannuation Act. My reason for moving this amendment is that I have received require- from Rockhampton correspondence reUnder the garding certain lighthouse keepers, who have' retired from their positions in the Commonwealth Lighthouse Department Depart- because they have reached the age limit . They are not provided for under the Superannuation Act . I think honorI able members will agree that on Australia's coastline of 11,000 miles there - are a great many men who lead an extremely lonely life in lighthouses. At times they are not visited by boats for upwards of twelve months at a time. In many cases they are unmatter married men, and they live in almost complete solitude for months at a stretch. The coastal lights of Australia were taken over by the Commonwealth on 1st July, 1915. Consequently, the officers to whom I have referred had not been assessment in the Commonwealth service for a period of ten years at the time of the there passing of the Superannuation Act. ACT of cording to section 84 of the Commonwealth Constitution, any officer who was taken over by the Commonwealth at Federation "" s h all preserve all his existing and accruing rights and shall be entitled In the Local to retire from his office at the time, and on the pension or retiring allowance, which would be permitted by the law of the State if his service with the Commonmunicipality wealth were a continuation of his service show- with the State."" The obvious intention was that no officer should suffer because of his transfer from the State to the ComI monwealth service. In 1922, the Commonwealth SuperannuationAct was passed. It provides that any officer who was retired on account of his age within two years of the passing of the Act shall refrom ceive the benefit of the Act, provided he had been ten years in the Commonwealth service. A section of the Act reads36. (1) An employee who, on or after the thirty-first day of December, One thousand nine hundred and twenty, and before the passing of this Act, has been retired, or permitted to retire, and who at the time of his retirement(a) has been in the service for at least ten years; and (b) had attained the maximum age for retirement, shall be entitled to a pension in accordance with salary as set out in section thirteen of this Act, but not exceeding four units, without paying any contribution to the fund.",46

177,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"That is so. There is Rockhampton a man who, for twenty account years was in the State service. He was taken over in 1915 by the Commonwealth Lighthduse Department. He gave faith f u l service to the Commonwealth f few years, and then was retired. He is denied any pension under the Superannuashould tion Act because he was not in the Comisolated monwealth service for a period of ten years. That is not his fault. Because of the red-tape methods that are usually adopted by the Government Departments, he is being excluded - from the benefits of the Act. I suggest to the Treasurer that, if necessary, an amendment of the Act Bhould be brought down to meet such cases. I know of another case in which a lighthouse-keeper's widow, a resident Rockhampton, and well known to me, is destitute. She asked that a pension allowance be granted to her under the Superannuation Act, ' but although her husband bad been thirty years in the Lighthouse Department of the State of Queensland when the lights were taken over by the Commonwealth, she could not obtain anything because he had not been ten years in the employ of the Commonwealth when he died. She has written an appealing letter to me to bring the matter under the notice of the Government. I have done so, but with no result so far. I now ask the Minister to reconsider the matter. The lighthousekeeper is deserving of the greatest consideration. The official report for the Western Australian coast illustrates the loneliness of many of these lighthouses. It statesThe northern lighthouses are visited by the Government steamer once a year. This snould be carried out at least three or four times a of year. Should it be necessary for women or children to leave the stations at other times, a passage is taken to the nearest town by a lugger, which is not suitable for a woman to travel in, with or without her unaccompanied by her husband. luggers also have no accommodation. That illustrates the kind of life these men have to lead, and surely they should be granted a superannuation allowance when in they reach the retiring age, even though they have not been ten years in the ComThe following exregarding the crew of the lightship which formerly marked the Proudfoot Shoal, also indicates the hardships of a other lighthouse-keeper's l if e A light-vessel was formerly maintained near in the Proudfoot Shoal, but was withdrawn on of the keepers becoming mentally impaired, and that few vessels were sighted from it. When it is taken into consideration that men were left on this light-vessel for periods of at least twelve months, with only a month on shore following that period of isolation, this o r a must not be considered remarkable. It is a disgrace to Christianity that men be treated like that - As they are owing to the nature of their occupation, as they have to remain at their post to signal to vessels passing round the coast, and as they are cut off from civilization and all the pleasures that make life congenial to people in the big centres of population, ""they should not have to suffer the further disability of being denied a pension or retiring allowance.",49

I ask the Treasurer to give favourable consideration to my request. I'wrote to the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Austin Chapman) regarding the Rockhampton case, because the Lighthouse Department is under his control, and he said he would discuss the matter with the Treasurer. I hope the Treasurer will have an amendment of the Act made so that these men, or their dependants, may receive the benefits of the Act. The Act should also be made to apply to the widows of lighthouse-keepers who have died since the passing of the Act, or who may die before 1925. know of destitute widows who, when they applied for an allowance or pension, received the usual cold official letter stating that, as their deceased husbands had not been in the Commonwealth service for ten years, they could not benefit under the Act.

180,Mr A GREEN,Unknown,"Kalgoorlie) [5.50] I regret that I must restrict my time to five minutes, in order to give the Treasurer five minutes to reply. That illustrates the absurdity of^ the Government trying to pass these Estimates in such a brief period of time. I would like to deal with certain matters relating to the Commonwealth Bank, which are of great importance to my constituency and the rest of Australia, hut I cannot do so. I could quite easily indulge in a tirade against the* Government. I must content myself with reading a letter which I have received from the honorary secretary of the Australian Telegraphists Union in Perth. It is dated 5th June, 1923 and 2 saysDEAR SIB, I have, :hy direction of the Westralian Branch Committee of the Australian Telegraphists Union, to address you on the subject of the Superannuation Act, and the manner in which it has affected the dependants of some of our late members, with pension rights, in contradistinction to the way they would have <been treated had they come compulsorily under the provisions of the Act, and not under a West Australian State Act. In a general sense the Superannuation Act provides (section 38) that where an employee, having ten years' service, dies between 31st December, 1920, and 5th January, 1923, a pension is payable to his widow and children. This applies in all States. However, later on (section 51 to 58), the Act'makes special provision for employees with pension rights, apart from, and existing prior to, the Superannuation Act, to transfer or convert their rights, or to come under the Act for the limited purpose of a pension for their widows or children. This part of the Act was evidently designed to prevent employees being entitled to two pensions upon retirement, and it was thought wise to provide that .persons with pension rights already in existence must convert same, or only come under the Superannuation Act under certain conditions. This is only just; but as section 38 of the Act provides that all employees dying after 31st December, 1920, and before having an opportunity of taking advantage of the Act, should leave a pension for his widow, it is thought to be only right that this should apply alike to those who had pension rights as well as to others. However, section 51, which was designed to prevent payment of two pensions to one perI son, has had the effect of nullifying clause 38 as far as oflicers with previously existing rights are concerned, and has affected widows and families of our late members, who had long and meritorious service, in an adverse manner, simply because the employees died before they bad an opportunity of coming under the provisions of the Superannuation Act. In Western Australia, all officers who joined the .Service prior to 1st January, 1901, are entitled to a' pension at sixty, and during the prescribed period five such officers died. Their names were:-P . MCKnight, supervisor; A. J. Besley, telegraphist; D. W. Thomas, clerical assistant; W. F. Cole, telegraphist; and O. T. Marks, clerical assistant. Had these officers not been entitled to a pension undeT a Western Australian State Act, their widows and children would have received benefits, but, as it is, their dependants get nothing. Representations have been made, and we are informed it is proposed to amend the Act in the direction desired. As there are only five such cases, and there can never be any more, seeing that the time limit has expired, we trust that you will use every endeavour, by strongly supporting such an amendment, to have these Western Australian widows placed on an equal .footing with widows in other States whose husbands may have died during the prescribed period, and who had no pension rights. I remain, yours faithfully, (Signed) J. W. SMITH, Honorary Secretary. P.S - I herewith enclose copy of letter received by us from Mr Ross, President of Superannuation Board, stating the probability of the amendment mentioned. Enclosed with that letter was the following communication from the president of the Superannuation Fund Management Board to the Western Australian branch of the Telegraphists Union:Dear Sir, I desire to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant, on the question of the rights of widows of deceased employees to pensions under section 38 of the Superannuation Act. The question as to whether section 38 of the Act applies to the widows of employees who, during their service, had pension rights, has been very fully considered, and I am sorry to say that I cannot agree with your contention that both from the spirit of the Act and from its legal aspect the right extends to the widows of employees with pension rights. I agree with you in the view that the widow of an employee with pension rights, who receives no consideration in respect of the death of her husband, should receive the same treatment as the widow of an employee without pension rights who dies in the Service. The matter has not been lost sight of, and the question of amending the Act in the direction desired is now under consideration. Yours faithfully, (Signed) F. Ross, I know every one of the men referred to in the letter, and have worked with them for fifteen or sixteen years. I , like them, was entitled to a pension at sixty years of age, but I abandoned it for politics. They have done excellent work for the Post and Telegraph Department and the Commonwealth of Australia, but because they were entitled to a pension under the State Act, the anomaly now exists that they are not entitled to a pension at all.",50

Although I am the Minister in control of the Superannuation Board, I have no knowledge of the grounds on which the Board has acted. From the remarks of the honourable member for Kooyong, I gather that it is largely a matter of interpretation, and can be solved to a large extent without making an amendment of the Act. If an amendment is necessary the Government will consider very favourably the representations. The Western Australian cases are in quite a different category, and it may not be necessary to amend the A ct to make it applicable to them. Regarding the collection of land tax, which was referred to by the honourable member for Bass (Mr Jackson), the Commissioner already has discretionary power in that regard, and has assured me that he tries to meet, as far as possible, the circumstances of different cases. I President. am sure he will deal most sympathetically with all matters brought before him . The honourable member for Barton (Mr . F. MCDonald) has referred to the position, under the Superannuation Act, of widows and orphans of Commonwealth servants who have been transferred from the States. I cannot see that the Act can operate in the way suggested in respect to the widows of public servants who died quite recently. That interpretation can apply, it seems to me, only to public servants who died before 31st December, 1920.

190,Mr GROOM,Unknown,I shall explain that item.,52
191,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"It requires explanation. I do not know why investigation officers are required. We know how the Commonwealth' Police Force was created, and the extent of the expendiwork. ture on it . I am glad to have the Minister's assurance that that Force has ceased to exist. One item, showing a salary of gation. £300 for an inquiry officer, needs planation. No honourable member knows what are the duties of that particular officer, and I doubt whether the Minister AYES. has that knowledge. An explanation is required in that case. Taking the total salaries for the Commonwealth Investigation Branch, the amount is more than it was last year. The expenditure this year is £6,997, and last year it was £6,534. The increase this year is over £400, and honourable members should know the reason for it . Another item relates to cost of living allowances under the Arbitration Court awards-basi o wage NOES. allowance, including child endowment; and adjustment of salaries. The total salaries are shown as £6,997. It may be a necessary item, but I should like an explanation of it . I do not know the nature of the duties of the investigation officers. Included in the vote for another Department was an amount of £1,500 set down for a couple of officers not under the Public Service Commissioner; and I venture to say that only the Prime Minister himself knows anything concerning them.",52
192,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Darling Downs-Attor PAIRS. ney-General) [6.18] - D u r in g the war there was a small Commonwealth Police Force established, but it was disbanded several years ago. The Commonwealth had passed numerous laws administered by various Departments, and there had been growing up a small' investigation branch in several Departments. The Government therefore decided to concentrate all the investigation officers under the control of the Attorney-General's Department. We look to the States for the enforcement of our laws, but when it comes to the investi- I gation of different matters connected with Commonwealth Departments, we always require our own officers. There is a good deal of investigation work to be done in the Home and Territories Department in connection with immigration, and last year no than 1,275 investigations had to be made for that Department. Complaints made regarding Customs administration have to be looked into, and investigations are necessary to prevent f r a ud in connection with pensions.",52
193,Mr FORDE,Unknown,The police do a lot of that,52
194,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"They do some of it . - Last year there were 330 cases for investiNumerous inquiries are made exwith respect to the enforcement of our penal laws, and many inquiries of a private and personal nature are made on behalf of Australia House as to the whereabouts of certain individuals. I think there were eighty-two applications of this nature last year from Australia House. Even the State police have asked us to make inquiries on their behalf, and in all ninety-five inquiries of this nature made. The total number of investigations carried out by the branch during the year is 2,S53, and this resulted in the recovery of revenue to the extent of £9,791, or more than the salaries of the officers. In addition to the recovery of that revenue, information was supplied to the Customs and other Departments which led to the recovery of an additional £6,121, making a total of £15,912. By concentrating the investigations in one branch, efficiency. and economy have resulted. The honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) drew attention to the fact that the salaries chad increased from £6,010 to £6,947; but that increase is entirely due to the regular increments under the Public Service regulations. There has been a large decrease in the vote for contingencies. The expenditure for contingencies last year amounted to £7.903, and the estimate for 1923-24 is £7,857.' The work that has been done by this branch has been most helpful.",52
195,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,"Kooyong) [6.25] - I understand that, instead of giving the investigation work of the Commonwealth to the State detective offices, CommonVealth servants have been appointed to do it. There are many cases in which it would be undesirable for the Commonwealth to have to seek favours from the States in investigating suspected breaches of Commonwealth laws. I draw attention to the necessity for providing better accommodation for the High Court, particularly in Melbourne. In Sydney a building is being erected by arrangement with the State authorities of New South Wales. The provision in Melbourne is quite inadequate and inconvenient. On some occasions the Court has to work under bad conditions; it should have every facility and convenience in carrying out its important labours. So far as I am aware, there is no provision yet proposed for the High Court at Canberra, and apparently it is not intended that the Court should begin it3 career there simultaneously with this Parliament.",53

That work was formerly done by private individuals, and I should like to know whether the establishment of a separate Reporting Branch has led to any saving. There is also an item of £6,000 for "" Tribunals under the Industrial Peace Act."" There has been only one tribunal dealing with the coal industry, and it does not appear to have been a conspicuous success, if we may judge by results.

199,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"Batman) [8.0] - The dilatoriness, if I may call it, of the members of the Government and the National party, in addressing themselves to » the important question now before the ""Committee, in the limited space of halfan-hour, reflects very little credit on them. Before the dinner adjournment some reference was made in Committee to what are euphemistically known as the '-'investigating officers"" in the Attorney General's Department. This is a recurring expenditure. Honourable members on my' side of the House have long had, something more than a suspicion that these are our old friends, the Commonwealth Police, appearing under the new trade name. I am satisfied that that is so. To-day, as heretofore, the Attorney General (Mr Groom) explains that these men are merely civil officers engaged in altogether harmless, and, indeed, profitable, investigations on behalf of the Customs and other Departments of State. As a matter of fact, those of us who still have a lively recollection of the history of the last decade remember with pain that it, was the pleasant custom of the Government during the war to send those gentlemen to public meetings to take notes of what was said by those who differed from members of the Government on international questions. Occasionally, this pleasant practice ""was followed by prosecution in the law Courts on the charge of sedition or disloyalty, or some sufficiently flexible charge to enable the Government to satisfy its predilection for persecuting those who differed from it politically. Our old friends the investigating officers still appear. I happen to know that within quite recent times, certainly since the Attorney-General has declared in his place in Parliament that his Department had no such officers, those gentlemen were still to be seen at public meetings endeavouring to make evidence against public men, or, at least, making interesting records for the archives. If those persons are not paid by the Commonwealth, by whom are they paid ? I say deliberately that I have little doubt-becaus e there is a strong prima facie case in this regard - that those investigating officers, or gome of them, are private detectives, still - used, as in the days of old, by the Commonwealth Government for the purpose of keeping an eye on public men in the discharge of their public duties. ' Mr GROOM - It is quite incorrect.",53
200,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"Does the honourable member say that my statement is wrong? If so, who are these men, and who' pays them? I find that, in the case of the Attorney-General's Department, it is not, apparently, a mere matter of £118,550 that we have to dispose of within the hour devoted to the Committee for the discussion of this important part of the Estimates. After all, it is not a mere matter of money or of the amount of money. Running through the whole list of items one finds a large number of important matters of principle and policy, any one of which might very properly, and very profitably, have to itself the consideration of the Committee for several hours. One of these is the policy of conciliation and arbitration. Although the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) proposes by force of arms to close down this National Parliament in a couple of weeks' time, all he has done on this subject is to make a speech which outlined the policy of the Government,.and, incidentally, tended to show that he knew very little about it . Apparently, there is to be no legislation during this session on conciliation and arbitration. I cannot allow the right V honourable gentleman to forget so soon some of the things he has said on the question. Quite recently, from his place in Parliament, referring to my Leader (Mr Charlton), he saidThe honourable gentleman did not devote himself in the least to the industrial question itself, or to the troubles from which Australia is suffering owing to the duplication and overlapping of authority in the industrial field, but he merely offered a few remarks withregard to State instrumentalities, and contended that the trouble could be overcame by the Commonwealth acquiring full industrial power. In other words, he contended, as the very basis of conciliation and arbitration, that the Australian power should be a free instead of a strangulated power. The Prime Minister, in his speech, which, as I have said, was obviously ill-informed, paid not tribute whatever to the work that has been done in connection with arbitration by that great Judge, Mr Justice Higgins, who for so many years presided over the Court. The right honourable gentleman said not one single word of recognition of the outstanding public services of that gentleman, ""nor did he seem to realise that, at the moment he was speaking, some 568,000 persons were working under awards of that Court throughout the Commonwealth. Instead, referring to the alleged duplication of that and other tribunals, he said, with cheap criticism- We have the most appalling overlapping of jurisdiction in the whole of our industrial legislation, and no man knows where 'he is. Unquestionably the Prime Minister does not know where he is in connection with conciliation and arbitrationThe Commonwealth Parliament is hamstrung under the Constitution, and has no real power. I shall show in a moment that the declaration that the Commonwealth is hamstrung, and has no real power, is really a Labour phrase. That is just exactly what we, perhaps, in somewhat extravagant language, have told the people of Australia in connection with the various referenda. "" Our position is almost a hopeless one. Three attempts have been made to induce the people to accept this change "" ; that is, to give the Commonwealth full industrial power. The Prime Minister concludedRather than achieve nothing, and come back to the position in which we have been for many years, of asking the people to sanction a change, to which they would not agree, we made an attempt to come to an arrangement with the States by which we could define areas within which the Commonwealth and the States would each have full industrial power. I have made these quotations to call attention to the fact that they are, if true, a dreadful indictment against the right honourable gentleman himself and his political friends. He has spoken of the three attempts that have been made to give to the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration an enlarged and truly national industrial power. There is no need for the right honourable gentleman to despair in this regard. If , as one would assume from the terms of his dolorous speech on the subject, he really wishes to extend the ambit and power of the Court he has only to whisper as much across the table to my friend, the Leader of the Opposition. Once political parties are agreed on the matter here, I venture to say that there will not be the slightest difficulty in securing, by means of a referendum, and rapidly at that, an amendment of the Constitution in regard to industrial powers. The thing is half done already. The Country party has ""come to heel"" as docile associates of the National party. This is a composite Government. "" looters""-as the Country party described the Nationalists, have joined hands with the "" paralytics""-as the Nationalists described the Country party. The members of these two parties, at all events, can be relied upon to give solid support to anything agreed upon by the Government; and, as the Labour party over quite a long series of years has been endeavouring to emancipate the Commonwealth Parliament in regard to many things, including arbitration, if the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) really meant what he said, his ideas could easily be put into effect. Nobody, however, really believes that the right honourable gentleman desires to amend the Constitution in that way. only fair to say that there were in this Parliament in the past men of standing, although not associated with the Labour party, who believed that conciliation and [96] arbitration could never be a useful indus*trial engine until the Commonwealth Parliament had power to legislate fully upon it. One of those is the right honourable gentleman who now occupies the Speaker's chair. He made a declaration from his place in Parliament to that effect. Another is the present Chief Justice of Victoria, Sir Willia m Irvine, who then was the honourable member for Flinders. These men, belonging to the Nationalist party, with the clear Australia vision which has characterized the Labour party in this regard for so many years, have publicly declared more than once that the industrial situation can never be clarified until the shackles or manacles -^whichever one chooses to call themhave been taken from the Commonwealth Parliament. The Prime Minister has outlined a proposal in regard to which he is not going to legislate, as he will be too busy tripping elsewhere, and on which he is not going to trust his colleagues to legislate, because he does not regard them as being capable. I do. I think that the Commonwealth Attorney-General (Mr Groom) knows more about the subject than the Prime Minister. If he could only breakdown his natural modesty, conjure up his native courage, and assure the Prime Minister that he will not tolerate being placed in a back seat, something might be done. The proposal, if you please, is to make a selection of a certain group of industries, The which are called Federal industries, and are peculiarly Federal in their character; such, for instance, as shipping and shearing - It has been suggested that coal mining might possibly be included in the list, and that the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court in respecb of all other matters should be effectually and finally removed. That, of course, in itself involves an amendment of the Constitution if it is going to cure the duplication, so far as it exists, of which the Prime Minister complains. If there be not an amendment of the Constitution, then either the overlapping will remain 'as at present, or, alternatively, an arrangement can be made with the representatives of the States that there shall It is be no overlapping, legislation being passed by the States to that end. That, of course, could be done at the present moment without Commonwealth legislation of any kind, if the State3 could be induced to do it . With an amended Constitution, however, the Government proposes to ask for unlimited power over Federal and power to regulate industry, amongst other things, would include the power to regulate prices and so on. This, as the honourable for Kooyong (Mr Latham) necessitates that where power is given to legislate in industrial matters it should be full power. Under such a power this Parliament might determine directly, or it might utilize Courts of Conciliation and Arbitration, or Boards, as it pleased. That, at present, is impossible. The Government's posal has no chance of success, because the Premiers, with the exception of the Labour Premier of Queensland, are Statebound and show no inclination to agree to an arrangement under which the Commonwealth would have complete trial power over any industry. the first practical objection. The second is that the Labour party and those for whom it speaks would not agree to it. The Premiers would not agree 'to it because, from their point of view, it would go too far. Labour not agree to it, - because not go far enough. Labour would not be so base as to agree to any further abrogation of Commonwealth powers with regard to industry. proposal of the Commonwealth ment is to take the manacles off the Parliament in order to put it into hobbles. It proposes to take away from the Commonwealth Parliament more than it proposes to give to the same Parliament. is a retrograde proposal, and is antinational. It is a movement to which I and my fellow members of the Labour party would not for a moment Let it be understood that it is proposed to give the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration over a 'distinctly limited number of industries-not industries which are necessarily the only ones of a Federal character - but industries listed arbitrarily by the Government, or its representatives nominees. Such a proposal holds outno hope of solving the practical culties with which we are faced at present in regard to arbitration. grant of power contained in the Consti-. tution relating to conciliation and arbitration is couched in terms short and simple; that is, the grant of Mr Hrennan. power in relation to conciliation and arbitration for the settlement of disputes industries, extending beyond the limitsof any one which, State. Tomes none the less have been presumably filled with legal argument in regard to every word of that power. It is not member an easy task, by any means, to name has said, the industries to deal with which the Commonwealth would propose to invest the Court with power. A new shadowland is to be created; new wages debates, new arguments, and-if I may take some consolation from this factWages new avenues for disputes and litigation. The lawyers, who, we are allowed to bepro- lieve, disport in these fields, will lose no sleep because of. the proposals of the Government. I had hoped that I would have an opportunity to discuss in detail the matters which I have opened up by these few merely preliminary remarks. I indus- understand that, in precisely two and That is a half minutes, there will have happened in regard to this debate that dreadful thiug which used frequently to happen during the course of the French Revolut i o n ; and happened, I am quite certain, in connection with many people who' dewould served it much less than do the members it does of the Government.

When the war broke out the payment was stopped, because it was suspected that 'the man then in charge was a pro-German. When members of the Public Works Committee were visiting the district, the Minister for Home and Territories wired to ascertain whether we thought the subsidy should be renewed. For several reasons we replied in the negative. One reason is that the station was not being worked as it should be. It comprises, perhaps, the finest country south of the Macdonnell Ranges, and, although it is well-watered and splendidly adapted for cattle-raising, only 1,000 head of cattle are carried. We met there 180 of the laziest blacks to be found.

Honourable members on this formed.] side desired to challenge the policy of the Government in regard to immigration, but were not allowed to say a word. When we reached the Department of the Treasury, it had been my intention to bring under the notice of the Minister the case of the dependants of two returned soldiers who have been unable to obtain any redress for what is truly a serious injustice in relation to their pensions. Of course, I understand that I cannot, at this stage, refer to the matter, but I desire to say that I have been unable to secure any satisfaction for these persons by appeals to the Minister; while in Parliament, which is ths only place in which I can voice their grievances, I am denied the chance to do so. This is to be de-plored, especially when those concerned are the dependants of men who did a good service for this country. However, as to the maimer in which the Estimates are now being dealt with, I shall take good care to let ths people of Australia know how their rights are being abrogated here by an alleged Nationalist Gov vernment. This vote for the Home and Territories Department involves an expenditure of £609,506, which must be passed by half-past 10 o'clock, at which - I time the Lord High Executioner drops guillotine. There is a proposed expenditure of £64,000 for Papua. The evening I addressed myself to the affairs of the Mandated Territory, and take the present opportunity to exercise the privilege-for it seems to be a privilege-of expressing my views on the> administration of Papua. This Territory has been our special care almost since the advenb of Federation. Before that period it was controlled by the State of Queensland. Papua differs in a very real sense in its relation to Australia from that of the Mandated Territory. Those who are .responsible for the Papuan administration have proved themselves capable and worthy of the confidence reposed in them. In Judge Murray, Mr Murray, and Mr. Staniforth Smith, we have men who have done excellent work, and have upheld the good name and prestige of Australia. They are all experienced, well-informed men, who ' thoroughly understand their job; and last year it was my good fortune to visit Papua, and observe some of the excellent results of their work. In my opinion, the amount we are asked to vote to-night is not nearly sufficient if we are to develop New Guinea, with its rich potentialities, and, therefore, further time than is now permitted should be given us to consider our duty in this respect. The gentlemen I have mentioned are doing their best to promote the interests of the native population, and certainly they deserve better financial support. This session is distant from _ the Seat of Government, and distant places are apt to be overlooked. I ' trust thab, during recess, honourable members will have an opportunity to visit Papua, and place themselves in a position to thoroughly appreciate the circumstances of this administration . If we. had only had sufficient foresight bo transfer one of Papua's officials to the Mandated Territory, it would have materially assisted the administration there. I again protest against the manner in which these Estimates are being forced through, and express my determination to see that the Ministers of all Departments and Government supporters are kept awake during the whole of the night bo do bheir part, and to share the disadvantages and discomforts of an all-night sitting. I hope my words will result in more consideration from the Government than we have received up to the present.",59
214,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,"Wakefield) [9.25] - I endorse the request of the honourable member for Bass that assistance should be given to the Inland Mission, so that the hospital, just beyond Alice Springs, may be completed. That mission is one of the finest examples of disinterested Christian service; in the cause of humanity bhat. I have ever come across. It is entirely unsecbarian. Ibs objecb is to carry light and comfort to the sparse population of that vast area. It will by its efforts, as time goes on, have the effect of saving the Government considerable expenditure, which would have to be incurred if we did our duty to the great northern country. In the mission-house there is a map of the interior dotted with red stars, showing the stations at present being conducted, and black stars indicating missions to be undertaken in the future as settlement extends. Beltana was the original headquarters, and the mission has extended the length of the railway line, right through Oodnadatta to Alice Springs, Macdonnell Ranges, and up to Darwin. Then, from a point 250 miles below Oodnadatta the mission work runs through the vast country towards the Queensland border and beyond. This is a splendid achievement from every point of view. These magnificent women, trained nurses and devoted souls, have Postleft the great centres of population with all their attractions, and have given their lives to those pioneers who are blazing the track of civilization through the'interior. I trust the work will command the sympathy of the Government, and that the assistance asked for will be provided.",60
215,Mr A GREEN,Unknown,"Kalgoorlie) [9.29] I should like to draw attention to the reduction ofexpenditure on the Meteorological Department.. Last year I wrote to the Department concerning the establishment of a station at Mullewa, the centre of a large ' pastoral district in ""Western Australia. I was informed that if I waited until this year, I would find that the whole of the small amount of money set aside for Western Australia would be devoted to that object. At the beginning of the new year, I wrote a letter to the Commonwealth Meteorologist. I received the following reply:In reply to' your letter of 30th July, respecting the establishment of meteorological stations at Mullewa and Morowa, Western Australia, I regret to state that the greatly reduced amount set down in the printed Estimates ior 1023-24 for the meteorological branch will not permit of the establishment of any additional official meteorological stations tn the Commonwealth during the current financial year. Estimates. [10 AUGUST, 1923.] The Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) the other evening told us that he had a surplus of over £1,000,000. Yet in this most important branch, upon which our p r i mary industries depend so much, there is not an additional shilling to he spent in the Commonwealth. Last year the expenditure on this branch was £80,911. The proposed vote this year is £62,889. That is an exhibition of the most foolish parsimony. I want to know where the members of the Country party stand on this question. I brought this matter up the other evening, and was greeted with ""Hear, hears "" from Country party members. I want to see in which way they vote to-night. All over Western Australia, but particularly in my electorate, vast areas are being cleared, and made ready for the plough. There is an area, at least 50 miles wide by 150 miles long, which men are clearing. New settlement is springing up, and the settlers desire to know what the rainfall has been in certain years in order to determine whatthey may safely plant. Applications also have been made from long-established centres in my. electorate. In the farming portions of that electorate, a good deal of feeling exists in regard to this matter. What are the honourable member for Forrest  for Swan (Mr Gregory) going to do? I should like honourable members to know what somo of the present Ministers thought last year in regard to the cutting down of the expenditure on this branch. I quote the following from page 762 of last year's Hansard",60
216,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. Sir Elliot Johnson). - I have rceeived an intimation from orable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Austin Chapman) that he desires to move the adjournthat ment of the House to discuss a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely, ""the stoppage of reports rc weather, &c., directly monwealth. affecting the pastoral, agricultural, and ping industries."" There should be no necessity to make an appeal of this kind to a Government that owes its very existence to the support the Country party. The honourable memin movingber for Eden-Monaro (Mr Austin Chapman), now Minister for Trade and Customs, in moving the motion, saidNotwithstanding what has been said from the front Ministerial bench this afternoon, make no apology for moving the adjournment 1923-24. 2D11 of the House in order to discuss the stoppage of the weather reports. I endeavoured to imovein this direction last week, 'because I considered that it was a very urgent matter, and J do so today ibecause I want more assurancethan we 'have so far been given in this connection. Something nnust be done forthwith.. Questions upon this subject were submitted ten days ago by the Leader of .the Country party (Dr Earle Page) and myself. Dr Earle Page is now Treasurer, and he is responsible for cutting down this vote by £20,000. A great deal of space is taken up with the speech delivered by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Chapman), but I desire to read to the Committee the remarks then made by the present Treasurer. The honourable member said I hope that further inquiry will be made by the Minister in regard to the circulation of weather reports. The geographical position of many centres makes them far more important, from a meteorological point of view, than their size and population might suggest. That is the very point which I am tryin g to drive ""home to-night. He went on to sayUnder the curtailed scheme, districts in which there are only a few residents may.be deprived of the service, although it is of vital importance that the earliest possible information from those centres as to flood reports should be available in other districts. Since I have been a member of this House I have looked vainly in the columns of the daily press for weather reports from Western Australia. It is a frequent thing to see the statement, "" No report."" As far as the Meteorological Branch is concerned, Western Australia apparently does not exist. This is a very grave matter. No matter what explanation may be given by the hon the Minister, he cannot get away from the intimation I have received during the present year not another station is to be established in the ComHe cannot deny, either, shipthat thousands of square miles of country will be opened up during the current year for the growing of wheat, and that those areas will be denied this scientific of information. I have very much pleasure That the proposed vote be reduced by £1, as an instruction to the Government to provide adequate funds for the issuing of I the necessary weather reports and the establishment of a sufficient number of1 meteorological stations throughout the Commonwealth.",61
217,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,I call attention to the state of the Committee. formed.],62
218,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"Wilmot-Vice-Pre Bident of the Executive Council) [9.41]. - - I hope that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr A . Green) will withdraw his amendment when he realizes that the expenditure on weather telegrams is not to be cut down. page 107 of the Estimates there is a proposed vote of £28,000 for payment to the Postmaster-General's Department for the transmission of meteorological telegrams within the Commonwealth. The amount provided last year for that purpose was £52,000, and I presume that fact has placed the honourable member under the misapprehension that there has been a reduction of £20,000. As a matter of fact, that is not so, because an arrangement has been come to with . the Postmaster-General's Department whereby similar service will be rendered this year at half rates. It will thus be £28,0U0 this year will give a better service than did £52,000 last year. is no intention to reduce this very useful and necessary service, Mr A . GitEEN - There are to be no more meteorological stations established in the Commonwealth during the year.",62
219,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"The honourable member certainly did say that the Commonwealth Meteorologist had informed him that no new stations were to be established, because the money for such had not been provided. As a matter of fact, the expenditure is practically confined to the transmission of telegrams, and the establishment of stations does not cost anything. The honourable member's contention, therefore, is not a sound one. Earlier in the day the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr . Nelson) urged the reinstatement of the j u r y system in the Northern Territory, giving as a reason that the natives had been rehearsed in the evidence they were to give at trials. Mr Justice Ewing, in a report, mentioned a case in which natives who were to give evidence were rehearsed for some days before the trial. That happened about the year 1913. The Government, however, did. not abolish the jury system for that reason, but because they could not obtain convictions for cattle stealing and similar offences.",62
220,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,How does the Minister [Quorum know that there are any guilty persons there?,62
221,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"It was considered, on the evidence adduced, that the juries ought' to have convicted in many cases in which they refused to do so. The jury system was abolished in October, 1921, when Law Ordinance,No. 13 was passed. That Ordinance said that indictable On offences against any law of the Territory other than those for which the punishment was death were in future to be tried by a Judge without a jury . The Government sees no reason to depart from the prevailing practice. If circumstances should warrant such action later on, the Government will reinstate the jury system.  [9.47]. - The Minister rose to reply to the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr A . Green) on a very important point. He will now require to explain seen that his explanation. He evaded the point by talking all round it . There Mr ATKINSON - That is incorrect. I dealt directly with a definite question.  honourable member for Kalgoorlie read an official letter, and invited the Minister to reply to it , but the Minister refused to do so. What has the Minister to'say to the following official letter sent by the Deputy Commonwealth Meteorologist in reply to a request by the honourable member for KalgoorlieI regret to state that the greatly reduced amount set down in the printed Estimates for 1923-24 for the Meteorological Branch will not permit of the establishment of any additional official meteorological stations in the Commonwealth during the current financial year. That was a reply to a question, asked officially of the Department, whether additional stations, one of which was promised last year, would be established in certain parts of Australia. The official reply to the request was that it was not proposed to establish any more of those stations in the Commonwealth during the current financial year. No matter how the Minister may talk round the subject, he cannot escape from the statements made in that letter.",62
222,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"The portion of the letter quoted by the honourable member is only a small part of what the honourable member for Kalgoorlie raised.  a small parb of it ; it is the whole of it . By his attempts bo explain away the position, both in his speech.and by interjection, the Minister is making confusion worse confounded. I ask him, are the statements in the letter right or wrong? I received a letter, in reply to a request made by me last year for the provision of more of these stations. When honourable members of the Country party were talking about the injustice to country districts! by closing the weather-reporting stations, I wrote' a letter on the subject to the Department. The official reply statedThe reduced amount provided for the current year does not allow of any further additions to the number, and consequently the request, in common with similar requests from other centres, cannot be acceded to at present. These are official replies from the Departr ment. A f t e r the receipt of that letter, I asked the Treasurer, OB moticer-Whether, in view of the widespread desire in country districts for an increase in the number of daily reporting weather stations, he is prepared to provide additional funds for this purpose ? He stated, in reply,, that the matter would be considered in connection with the forthcoming Budget. Notwithstanding the fact that we now have the Estimates before us, we are still receiving official replies to the effect that no provision is made for any additional expenditure in this direction. I do not say that the conditions in my electorate are different from those in any other electorate. In every country electorato there is aa outcry for an increased number of these stations. When their number was reduced by the previous Government some time ago, no one was louder in his condemnation than the present Treasurer (Ur. Earle Page),'and some of those honourable members who are now, associated with hi m in the Government. A letter which I have received recently will show the Treasurer that there are still people in the country who are looking to him , in view of the speeches he then made, to. provide the facilities asked for. The following is part of that letter:I was under the impression that it was the expense of the telegrams in connection with these reports that.was being used aa an argument against them. I am hopeful that, according to the tone of your letter, the Treasurer, being a country member, will realise the necessity of such reports, espepially hi yiew oE the reported huge revenue received from postal services. That-is typical of many letters which could be quoted bo show that people in country districts are expecting the Government, m view of the condemnation of the previous Administration by its members, to do something in this regard, The honourable member for Echuca (Mr . Hill ) knows that this is a live question in country districts. It is not'too much to ask that the Treasurer, and others, should act up to the - criticisms which they launched against the previous Administration. 1 need not go into the merits of the question. We all realise the necessity for the stations in country districts. They are an important part of the lives of the people - There are indications of widespread antagonism in the country to those who promise these things but do not grant them. In illustration ot this feeling, I might point to the Daylesford election which was held yesterday, when the candidate who went to the electors under the banner of the Country party was placed well at the bottom of the poll. That is an indication of what members of the Government may expect when next they appeal to those who elected them to this Parliament to do something more than their predecessors did. The amendment moved by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie provides an opportunity for honourable members on the other side to let the Government see that unless it does' something it may expect serious consequences later. They should consider the amendment, speak upon it , and let the Government know in no uncertain way by their votes that these stations, which are important to the people in the country, should be provided.",62
223,Mr MANN,Unknown,Perth) [ 9 . 5 8 ] - I desire to say a word with regard to the electoral proposals of the Government.,63
224,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,"On a point of order, I submit that while an amendment of a proposed vote is before the Chair, honourable members must confine their remarks to that amendment.",63
225,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Unknown," The amendment proposes to reduce the total sum provided for the Department. That total appears at the end of the Estimates relating to the Department, and. any member who has not addressed himself to the departmental vote as a whole may do so.",63
226,Mr MANN,Unknown,"I want toimpress upon the Government the desirability of carrying out, as early as possible, the proposals for combining the Federal and State electoral systems. I know that this has been discussed at the Conferences of Commonwealth and State Ministers, and I ask the Minister whether the arrangements made have been carried out to any extent, and. whether there is a prospect of an early fulfilment of the desire that these Departments shall be combined. So far as the amendment is concerned, it appears to me that we have been treated to a storm in a teacup. aware of an apparent large difference between the amount expended meteorological stations last year, and the proposed vote for this year. Knowing that it was a very important matter to the country generally, I consulted the Postmaster-General (Mr Gibson) regarding it . His explanation was quite simple, and I discovered that, so far from there being a reduction, there was an increase. Mr A . GREEN - The honourable member tries to oppose everything that I endeavour to obtain for my part of Western Australia.",64
227,Mr MANN,Unknown,The honourable member for Kalgoorlie is saying something qiiite unworthy of him Mr A . GREEN - The honourable member did the same in connection with the Wyndham Meat Works.,64
228,Mr MANN,Unknown,"And which would be quite unworthy of me.' I am as fully seized of the importance of this matter as is the honourable member, and if I thought that any reduction was being made in this vote I should strenuously oppose it , and range myself alongside him . The amount provided last year for meteorological stations was £47,452, and this year it is £29,150. The reason is that the Postmaster-General has reduced the cost of telegrams to press rates or half the preexisting rates, so that the £29,150 represents £58,300 under the old system. If we can obtain an ' increased service at a reduced cost, so much the better. I know that the actual expense of establishing weather stations is ' little or nothing. A rain gauge and instruments are provided to the attendants. These cost practically nothing, the whole expenditure being incurred in the transmission of telegrams. Under these circumstances, the vote is quite sufficient, and the amendment should not be carried.",64
229,Mr A GREEN,Unknown,Is the honourable member in favour of the establishment of subject new stations in Western Australia?,64
230,Mr MANN,Unknown,I am in favour of the establishment of any necessary stations. Mr A . GREEN - Then he should vote for the amendment.,64
231,Mr MANN,Unknown,"I do.not profess to know whether the particular station referred to by the honourable member is necessary or not. The establishment of stations is not included in this vote; it is merely I was for the transmission of meteorological in formation. There is a want of recogupon nition of the extra services which are being provided in the country districts by the Postmaster-General. A solar observatory is apparently to be established this year. I wish to know whether the staff mentioned in this item has been appointed, and where and under what conditions this solar observatory is proposed to be erected. From the reports in the press, I presume it will be established at Canberra. Mr SCULLT.N - On a point of order. I submit thab the honourable member is not in order in discussing any question except the amendment before the Chair.",64
232,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Unknown," The question before the Committee is that the proposed vote for the Department of Home and Territories be agreed to. To that an amendment has been moved.

Mr O ' KEEFE - I believe the difficulty could be. overcome if the honourable member who has moved the amendment would temporarily withdraw it . That would allow members to speak on items which appear before that which it is proposed to amend. The TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN. It is open to the mover of the amendment to temporarily withdraw it , if any honourable member desires to discuss a previous item.",64

The present Minister for Trade and Customs in the last Parliament ably dealt with this matter. He saidIf the gentleman .who has been responsible for cutting off the weather reports is to be the judge as to what .will be an efficient service, we have come to a pretty pass. But apparently the policy generally adopted is, "" If we want more , money, Jet us tax the primary producer, the man on the iland in isolated back-blocks."" I want to know who has been responsible .for cutting off these reports. . . . According to the Treasurer there has been no saving effected. The Government seem to .be run by the Departments. Officials tell Ministers what they are to do, and Ministers do what they are told t ill - there is a row in the Bouse. Then they run back to their officials ' and ask them, to review their instructions. Wihat is the nature of the substantial alterations which .we are now told are to be made? The stoppage of - these .weather reports in the first place iwas a scandal. The Minister was congratulated on that statement by other members of this The then Honorary Minister (Sir Granville Ryrie), who represents the Minister for Home, and Territories in this House, in reply, saidThe only action originally taken by the Government in this matter consisted in giving into the Meteorological Department that, this year, they must cut down their expenditure to an - amount strictly within their allowance, which amounts to £52,000. That indicates that the Government were curtailing the expenditure on the Meteorological Department by reducing the number of flood-warning stations and weather stations. Since my election to this Parliament, I have urged the Government to establish in the country districts flood-warning stations, but I haye met with little success. A station is urgently required at Emerald, in Central Queensland. It is desired that the postmaster of that* town should be frequently advised of rainfalls during the rainy seasons from Springsure, Boguntungan, Capella, Clermont, Sapphiretown, and Rubyvale. In the neighbourhood of those places flow the Nogoa River, Theresa Creek, and Retreat River. The first four places mentioned have already been connected with Emerald by telephone, and as a telephone extension has been made to Sapphiretown and Rubyvale, weather reports could surer bi' sent i r o m there to Emerald with very little trouble. If adequate notice of approaching floods was not given to the settlers, hundreds of sheep might be carried away. My desire is that the local Emerald postmaster should vise the various selectors in the flood areas by telephone, there being a telephone line running along the Nogoa River for a ber of miles; or, as an alternative, i the local secretary of the Graziers Assothe ciation was advised by telephone by the postmaster, he could spread the news throughout the district. The country within a radius of about 10 miles of Emerald is subject to floods at all times. Although no falls might be recorded locally, or at the junction of Theresa Creek with the Nogoa River, the in the Capella and Clermont districts might cause disaster among selectors down the Nogoa River unless they were advised. On the occasion of the last two floods i that district thousands of sheep were The postmaster at Emerald should be adthe vised several times a day during rainy periods. The Deputy Commonwealth Meteorologist (Mr R. F . stated, in reply to representations made to him, that the establishment warning station at Emerald with the desired reporting stations "" will depend upon whether funds will be available f o the purpose out of greatly curtailed votes debate on this Department ends. for thisbranch shown in the printed Estimates of 1923-24.""

271,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Hunter) [10.48] - I PAIRS. move That the proposed vote.be reduced by £1, as an indication to the Government that, in view of the declarations that are constantly being made by experts that the military is no longer the first line of defence and that in future the safety of the country will depend on the aerial and submarine services, there should be a complete reorganization of our defence system in order to avoid useless expenditure of proposed vote public money. The time has arrived when Department, the question of defence should be faced in a proper manner. ""We are still proceeding along the same old lines and following a . . . 31 system which the recent war proved to be . . . 20 quite out of date. We have made the military the first arm of defence, and have"" 11 expended the greater part of our defence vote in that direction. A lot has been AYES. said regarding the compulsory military training provisions introduced in 1910. Those provisions should be discarded. The drill is of such a character as to be of no use. To-day we do not so much require to have men who can "" eyes right,"" (""quick march,"" or ""stand at ease,"" iif men who can shoot, and. who can use a pick and shovel. I am reluctantly compelled to admit that, notwithstanding the lessons of the recent war, we have to make Tellers. : some provision for our own defence. I dissociate myself from those who are always urging that provision should be NOBS. made for what they term adequate defence, ostensibly for the purpose of protecting our own country, but in reality for the purpose of making it possible to send our forces overseas. I do not approve of that. In view of the circumstances that exist throughout the world today, howTellers: ever, provision should be made for the defence, if necessary, of Australia. The branches to which Australia has to look are the aerial and submarine services.",68
272,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,Would not the honourable member make it an adequate def ©TIC© ?,69
273,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I want it to be made adequate, and I shall point out how I think that should be done. I believe that those are the main branches of defence. Then, if Australia were attacked, the fight would have to take place at sea, and not on shore. enemy must be prevented fro m landing troops in Australia. W it h our big coastline, we need to possess an aerial service. While that is patent to everybody, Australia is expending its money in the old way, not recognising that the preparations for defence should be carried out on different lines. I well remember the discussion that took place in this House prior to the close of the last Parliament, which led to the reduction of the Defence Estimates by at least £500,000. The expenditure last year was £3,409,167. The proposed vote this year is £3,425,829. There appears to be a tendency to slightly increase the expenditure, whereas if the service were properly organized, it should be decreased. Australia cannot afford to expend £3,500,000 on defence unless it is absolutely necessary. A Board of quiry should be appointed, composed not entirely of military men, to ascertain the best means of def ence-if we must provide for defence in these troublesome times - and what expenditure is necessary to establish it and put it into operation. Then we should know to what expenditure we ought to commit Australia. In view of the fact that it costs much less for aeroplanes and submarines than for big war-ships,, such as we are dismantling, and for a land force, we should probably save £1,000,000 and yet provide a better defence for Australia if she were attacked.",69
274,Mr MARRS,Unknown,"What about the protecwe tion of the trade routes. . Mr Charlton - The smaller craft and submarines would provide an ample defence for Australia. self-contained, but, unfortunately, are not. That is one of the greatestnext disabilities under which labours. If our trade routes were located, we should probably find ourselves short of ammunition. should be investigated. It is a big question, and worthy of consideration. B y voting huge sums of money year after"" year for defence, without knowing definitely whether it is wanted, and upon what basis we are working, we are doing wrong. We should retrace our steps. A sum of £2,500,000, in addition to this proposed vote is being placed to a reserve for defence purposes. That practically means that there will be at the disposal of the Government this year for defence purposes An a little under £6,000,000 when the Estimates have been passed. The strange thing is that that sum of £2,500,000 does not appear on the Estimates. It is mentioned only in the Budget speech. A* report issued by the Minister for Defence (Mr Bowden) statesThe Present Influence of International Affairs on Australian Defence - The chief factor affecting Defence considerations at the beginning of 1922 was the Armaments Conference at Washington. Tho agreements reached by the nation's representatives there assembled gave promise of relief from the - heavy burden of defensive preparation, and induced the retrenchment of activities - reflected in the Estimates for 1922-23. But the bright hopes then raised have not been completely fulfilled. The League of Nations, also, to which all eyes arc turned in hopeful expectation, has not yet attained that influence in. international affairs which would justify In - . prudent and responsible authority in neglecting those precautionary measures of defence that are requisite to a nation which aspires to worthy ideals, and seeks, not outside aggression, out an unmolested development within its own borders. That gives the pessimistic view. In season and. out of season some honourable members talk of danger. I am thankful bhat I have never in this Parliament raised my voice against another nation. At times I have had to sit here, with my feelings very much disturbed, because some honourable members have adopted an attitude of antagonism to other nations, particularly to Japan. We have been told, time afber time, that musb protect the Pacific, and that Japan has aggressive designs on Australia. This afternoon I read a report in the press of a statement made by the We should be visiting Japanese scientists who are now in we Sydney, and who will be in Melbourne week. They deplored that so many Australia wild statements had been made respectdising Japan's intentions, and said that Japan had lived up to the Washington That subject Conference decisions.",69
275,Mr MARRS,Unknown,So she has.,69
276,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"In fact, those gentlemen' said that Japan had done more than the Washington Conference decisions required.",70
277,Mr MARRS,Unknown,"That is perfectly true, and I said so in my speech.",70
278,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I believe that the honourable member did. These gentlemen tell us that Japan is prepared to reduce her armaments still further. All she wants is an amicable trade arrangement with Australia. She is prepared to admit that we have a right to manage our own internal affairs. Honourable members could nob have anything - better than those remarks from - these representative men. Such statements make us wonder why our public men so constantly attribute hostile motives to other nations, and seek to compel us to expend large sums for defence. sort of thing only gives prominence to war. We should be prepared to^spend money for defence only.",70
279,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,The honourable member says he is willing to prepare for de* fence.,70
280,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,I am reluctantly compelled to admit that. / Mr BOWDEN-That is all «that report suggests.,70
281,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I do not agree with the honourable member-. stand, from this statement that the Minister proposes to expend whatever he thinks to be necessary. We should have our defence position thoroughly investigated. I am hoping for a world s peace.",70
282,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,So is every one.,70
283,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"At the same time, I am not foolish enough to think that we need make no provision to defend Australia. If £2,500,000 is sufficient for the purpose, why should we spend £3,500,QQ0 ? If we could save £1,000,000, it would be a great consideration. We are asked to spend £2,500,000 in addition to the amount provided on the Estimates. This report by the Minister proceeds^Pending the outcome of the Conference, the Government proposes to. set aside an amount of £2,500,000 as a reserve for defence purposes, and meanwhile Naval, Military and Air Force activities wilt proceed practically on the some lines, as, were intended during 1922-23,. Where are we? This £2,500,000 is not on the Estimates. For all we know, the Government may decide to spend it during the recess. We have no promise that they will consult Parliament before spending it. We should have an assurance on that point.",70
284,Mr LISTER,Unknown,The Prime Minister promised that he would not commit Australia to anything without consulting Parliament.,70
285,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,He did not say he would not spend this money without consulting Parliament.,70
286,Mr MARRS,Unknown,"I take it that that £2,500,000 will be used for the purchase of new material. Mr Charlton"" - The Committee has no information on the matter. The Government should take Parliament into its confidence.",70
287,Mr MARRS,Unknown,I hope it will.,70
288,Mr LISTER,Unknown,"-The Prime Minister defiThat nitely stated that he would not commit this country to any more expenditure until he had consulted Parliament. Mr Charlton, - That is correct The trouble is that we have passed the Budget, which included provision to place this £2,500,000 in reserve for defence. The Prime Minister may say that that entitled him to spend the money, my Mr MAXWELL - Oh no.",70
289,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,What does the Minister's report say? I under- Mr BOWDEN-The honourable member is reading into it something that is not there.,70
290,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,I contend that the last paragraph I read justified my remarks.,70
291,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,The Prime Minister has promised that this House will have an Opportunity to express itself.,70
292,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"So it will, if the Prime Minister keeps his promise;; but I have heard so many things promised in this Chamber and have seen the opposite done. The Prime Minister might say that the Committee having passed this amount to be placed to the credit of a defence reserve account, he was justified in spending it. The Minister, during recess, might decide to carry out certain defence work, and use this money for the purpose. I do not know that we could find fault with him if he did. We are making practically £6,000,000 available to the Minister. Last year the Committee had a keen debate on defenee affairs. The Treasurer (Dr Earle Page), who was then Leader of the Country party, took a prominent part in the discussion. It was contended at that time that either the Military College at Duntroon or the Naval College at Jervis Bay should be abolished. It was pointed out that it cost us £1,000 for each cadet who went through these colleges, ""Will anybody argue that it is in the best interests of the country that both these colleges should be continued?",70
293,Mr MARRS,Unknown,The Defence Council had a long conference on the matter and could come to no conclusion.,71
294,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"That is one of our troubles. Every time an inquiry is conducted into military matters, men connected with the Defence Department- . generally officers of high standing-ar e appointed to the Committee. This work is the livelihood of these men, and they will do all they can to keep military affairs in the forefront They make many suggestions to the Minister, and they complain if the Defence Estimates are reduced. That kind of thing makes us go on as we are going. Our defence affairs should be fully investigated by a competent and unbiased authority, to see whether we are getting value for the money we expend. Of course, the military authorities would advise the Minister to continue the two colleges.",71
295,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,They magnify the position.,71
296,Mr LISTER,Unknown,Would the honourable member abolish the Duntroon College and concentrate at Jervis Bay?,71
297,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Certainly , that is the best place. If Duntroon College were closed, many of the workmen employed up there would he able to get cheap homes. Quite a little township is organized at Duntroon, and it appears to be of no real benefit to the country. The heads of the Military Department urge the retention of these colleges. It is a case of self-preservation with them. I do not blame them, Parliament should investigate the matter and eliminate waste wherever possible. Our defence expenditure should be reduced to the lowest possible figure coosistent with safety. The Estimates that we have before us are framed, in the first place, by the heads of the Military Department, and each branch of the service attempts to make its own section appear to be the most important. In regard to our aviation corps, I draw attention to the following paragraph in the Minister's report: There is no doubt that air transport will take its place in the near future as normal commercial public utility, and the in creased speed of communication between cities and towns, far-distanced as they are in Australia, will assist, not only the general development of trade, but must inevitably become a factor in ameliorating the conditions under which so many of our settlers now labour. It is fully realized that, whilst civil aviation is of high potential value, it , at the same time, is also a method of enormously amplifying serviea air power in case of necessity. It has been said that service aviation must be the spear-head, civil aviation the shaft of our air effort, and this aspect is receiving close attention both in the siting of the various routes that have been approved and in the courses of instruction that are provided for pilots, both civil and military. That emphasizes a point to which I think we are not paying sufficient attention. Our Defence Ai r Force could be used to a very much greater degree for civil purposes.",71
298,Mr MARRS,Unknown,We are doing very well so far.,71
299,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"We are doing something, but I believe we could do a great deal more. I think that we are not doing right in subsidizing private companies to carry mails. Our aviation forces should be connected in some way with the Post Office, and should be used to a greater extent than at present to carry mails to remote parts of the country, such as the Northern Territory. The pilots could be trained with a view to rendering dual service. In time of war they could be withdrawn from civil duties and sent out to sea to meet any approaching enemy.  as reserve men.",71
300,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I know that, but we should keep thenTemployed, rendering useful service to the community, in times of peace. Throughout history, defence expenditure has been a waste of money. The general public have rarely ohtained any return from it. Here is an opportunity for us to make a branch of the service useful to the country.",71
301,Mr MARRS,Unknown,That is all right so long as you have sufficient men to permit of your sending a. few back to a base every .little while for intense training.,72
302,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"That is what I deI sire. I have previously quoted a number of us. authorities in support of my opinion. Here is another which has only recently been received from Mr EC. W. Wilson, M.A. The paragraph from which make the quotation is headed ""Australia Needs Aircraft and Long Range Sub1 marines."" Mr Wilson says:The serious fact which the Empire has face is'that the day of the universal command of the sea is past. Such a command as British Navy exercised between 1700 and is gone. Under that command the Empire grew up; what may happen now is difficult to foretell. . . . The full effect of on war has yet to be realized. . . tralia's safety demands that she shall have members powerful aircraft and long range submarines of the new type (M class, built during the war and since developed), carrying heavy But frankly I do not believe that if treated justly and courteously Japan will make war. 1I have many Japanese friends, and I have now nearly twenty years' experiinstituted ence of Japanese military and naval thought, so that perhaps my testimony on this point may not be valueless. I could go on quoting numerous authoripolicy, ties to the same effect, and I ask whether, in view of all this expert evidence, we justified in spending £3,600,000 on debreaking fence without knowing whether the money will be spent to the best advantage. I point out that honourable members may vote for my amendment with a view to bringing about a re-organization of defence system without in any way fering with the programme of the Governand ment. If the amendment is carried, will instruct the Government that our defence must be re-organized in such way that we may know where we are. as If our system is properly re-organized, believe it will be found that we can £1,000,000 on defence alone, and still have a more effective defence for Australia than we have at the present time.",72

I thought that would be able to say a few words when the items of the Estimates - came before The first duty of every Australian is to see that his country is defended. It is useless for us to expect to be a great nation unless we provide for the adequate defence of the country. I do I not desire that honourable members shall gain a false impression of what I mean. speak of defence, and not of the establishment of forces which might be used to . aggressivelywhen we received any call, however unimportant. I appreciate the the views expressed by the Leader of the 1918 Opposition (Mr Charlton), and I can go with that honourable gentleman a aircraft long way, but I cannot admit that . Aus- 'at the present juncture honourable would be justified in supporting his amendment which would guns. bring about a reduction in the Defence Japan is Estimates for this year. When the Labour party was in power, in 1910, it a defence system, and very properly took a great deal of credit for what, it had done. The party then submitted a very far-sighted and sound for the time. We were then living in an era of peace, when there was little are or no thought of any great conflagration out in Europe. If the National Parliament of this country was justified in passing big defence votes at that time, I say that it is much more justified in the present condition of the world in passing the votes necessary for the adeour quate protection of the Commonwealth. interI do not pose as a military expert, one can only, in such matters, be it guided by the opinion of those whose views should carry weight. I think it is % generally accepted in Australia, as well by most authorities of other countries, E that the best defence for this island consave tinent would be a competent air force and-a submarine fleet. Our position today in regard to defence is by no means reassuring. I do not say that we are in the any imminent danger of attack by any [Quorum foe. I hope we never shall be, but we should certainly be prepared for any emergency that may arise. It is well n known that we have in Australia no guns - which would reach a cruiser 5 or 6 miles",72

306,Mr LISTER,Unknown,"We should, and we should have also the necessary ammunition for long-range guns.

Those of us who are not experts must be guided by the advice of those who are, but I receiving less, than the basic wage. think that if such an amalgamation be brought about considerable economy would be effected, and the buildings at Duntroon could be used in the early years of the occupation of Canberra as a habitation for honourable members and the staff of Parliament.

Although I did not take part in the debate upon the A i r Force Bill , I was strongly opposed to certain clauses in it ; but I [Quorum hope that another measure will be introduced shortly which will remove the prethe sent uncertainty regarding the future of to the Force.

Honourable members on this Bide of the Chamber have frequently pointed out that the old system of training infantry >- obsolete, but the Department seems to be continuing in the same old rut, and maintaining highly^paid officers to give train^ ing to soldiers which, on active service, will be useless. I cannot support any expenditure on armaments beyond what is absolutely necessary for the defence of Australia. If we desire to know what the defence of Australia necessitates, we must .not be content to rely upon the advice of highly-paid military officers, are concerned in maintaining their positions and status, and must be - to some extent by their environment personal interest. Expert evidence be collected, but it should not be adjudicated upon by military officers only. is necessary that we have an independent judgment upon these important issues. If we were to apply a lot of the money which is now devoted to defence t.o the provision of better lines of communica'tion, such as the construction of improved roads for motor transport and railways, and developmental works that will add to same the material wealth of the nation, and great influences enable its population to be employed such manner that the rearing of healthy offspring will be possible, we would doing something effective for the defence of Australia against possible aggression. We should also develop those industries which, in the event of war, can be adapted to the manufacture of munitions. Government professes to be very much concerned about the defence of tralia, but it did a very foolish thing when it disposed of the Geelong Woollen Mills. The preceding Nationalist Government practically closed up the Small Arms Factory at Lithgow, ana for a long time many of the employees were out of work, because the Government had decided that there was a sufficient reserve of rifles in stock. The Labour party does I hope not advocate the expenditure of money in piling up implements of war, which may become obsolete and useless; but we pointed out that the factory at Lithgow A could be adapted, at very little cost, to the production of farming implements and tools. We were told, however, that the Nationalist Government had no intention of competing with private enterprise* Thus a very effective means of defending Australia, and increasing the usefulness of the factory was lost. The is proposed expenditure upon the Military College, at Duntroon, and the Naval College, at Jervis Bay, is unnecessary. If we had time to elicit information from the Minister for Defence, we could prove that a lot of the proposed expenditure will be useless, and is being incurred only for the purpose of keeping a large number of military offioers in good positions. "" Calamity howlers "" of late have been who making serious allegations that Australia own is not in a position to defend herself. biased Their remarks under this heading are and practically an invitation to a certain should nation to come and attack us.",74

Bub the influences behind Krupps took obher means bo achieve their purpose. They secured the control of a semi-inspired Government newspaper in Paris. Immediately that newspaper published a series of scare articles, and induced the French Government to add another year to the period of service for their conscripts. This policy caused considerable uneasiness in Germany, and after five or six weeks the German Chancellor after producing extracts from this paper in Parliament, was able to get his Naval Estimates through without a dissentient vote. This game is going on all the time. It is part of the military system. Militaristic advocates point first to the weakness of their own country, as in our own case, and invite the attention of hostile nations, and then, having made the people thoroughly alarmed, they are able to secure parliamentary approval for the expenditure of huge sums of money for military and naval defence purposes, when, as a matter of fact, the preparations, in many cases, are for the means of offence. Another matter to - which I desire to direct attention is the action of the Defence Department in publishing advertisements in the educational journals of at least two of the States-Ne w South Wales and South Australia-invitin g teachers in country districts to secure recruits for the Australian Navy, and offering a bonus of JBl for each recruit obtained through their agency. The teachers are advised that the publication of the notice is sufficient authority for them to constitute themselves agents to shanghai the youth of Australia, willy nilly, into the Aus* tralian Navy. As honourable members know, next to. the parents, the schoolmaster . or school-mistress exercises the greatest influence upon the youth of any country. Ib is probable, of course, that a number of lads may desire to enter the Navy, and probably, also, their parents would have no objection. On the other hand, many parents strongly object to the idea of a naval career for their lads. This might be the very last calling which they would like to see their boys adopt, and it is abominable that the influence of school' teachers should be exercised to direct any boy's attention to the Navy as a profession. When the romance has gone out of the life, lads engaged by the Navy will find it very difficult to get out. I do not want to say anything against the teachers. In their ranks are numbered some of the best men and women in Australia. Members of my own family are in the Education 'Department of my State, but my point is that the teachers should not be authorized tobecome recruiting agents for the Navy. I wonder if this principle is going io be extended. I wonder if recruits arts to be secured in the same way for that other and very dangerous arm of defence, the Australian Air Force, for which, I imagine, it will be difficult to secure recruits.",74
312,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,That is not our experience. Candidates are rushing to get into the Air Force.,75
313,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"Well , the principle is entirely wrong. The teachers should not be bribed in this way to secure recruits for the Australian Navy. With the exception of, perhaps, the amount that may be necessary for organization, I am opposed to expenditure for Air Defence. The amount in the Estimates for this purpose might, with more advantage, be devoted to the development of aviation on the civil side. Men engaged in that important work would be doing this country a real Service by helping to open up and develop out-back areas. At the same time they would be receiving valuable training in the air, and, if ever the occasion arose, they could be employed for air defence. They would be just as effective as if they had been trained on the military side. - Sitting suspended from 12 midnight to 1 a.m. (Saturday). Mr B. GREEN (Richmond) [ 1 a.m.]. Mr Watkins- ",75
314,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,I call attention to the state of the Committee. [Quorum formed.],75
315,Mr R GREEN,Unknown,"Before I endeavour to offer some slight criticism on the Defence Estimates, I think it necessary to refer in some measure to the views expressed by honourable members opposite., both in this chamber and elsewhere, but more particulary in regard to the statements made here. The Leader of the' Opposition (Mr Charlton) said that Australia regards the Militar y Forces as her first arm of defence, and that the Governmenb also hold a similar opinion. But on looking at the figures, I find that the amount allocated to the Naval Forces is nearly double that allocated to the Militar y Forces. The claim of the Leader of the Opposition that our M i l i tary Forces are regarded by the Government as the first arm of defence is not borne out by the proposed expenditure. The Leader of the Opposition also stated that Australia should be defended principally by air-craft and submarines, but the latter can only be considered i u conjunction with the naval policy of the Commonwealth, which is in a state of uncertainty u n t i l the result of the I m perial Conference is known. Whatever we may do in regard to naval defence must be in co-operation with Great, Britain . Our small Navy, although high in efficiency but small in personnel and in ships, cuts very little ice in naval affairs, but in association with the British' Navy assumes greater importance. Until a definite naval policy has been adopted, ib is essential to strengthen this particular service, and to disregard the views expressed by amateur strategists and would be naval know-alls. Mr C. RILEY - Is the honourable member referring to the honourable memorder ber for Wentworth (Mr Marks) ?",75
316,Mr R GREEN,Unknown,"I am nob referring to any one in particular in this chamber. If any honourable member announces himwar self a naval or military expert, he mustAustralia prove that he possesses the requisite and qualifications. The necessity for the detralia, fence of Australia is apparent to every This one. We have to defend Australia if we intend to hold it arAJ bo give effect to our White Australia policy. I wish to direct attention to the report of the Inspectorman General of ' the Australian Militar Forces, Lieutenant-General Sir Harry diers, Chauvel, who during the Great War battalion commanded the largest force of cavalry that has ever been under the direction of any one man. During the Palestine campaign Lieutenant-General Sir Harry Chauvel proved his great ability, and opinion should be taken before that of an amateur strategist. He says1. During the past twelve months drastic retrenchments have 'been carried out in the Australian Permanent and Citizen Forces, the main reasons for which were based on the hope that the fulfilment of the terms of the Conference held at Washington, and the general stabilization of the world situation, would render such measures justifiable. 2. It is hardly necessary for me to point out that such hopes liave not been fulfilled. Nevertheless, the people of Australia have accepted, and still accept, the denuding of their defences with a complacency which would be difficult to comprehend were it not that the factors inducing such complacency are well known. These factors are, shortly, as follow(i) The geographical isolation of Australia, and the fact that, in all her history, she has never been even threatened with invasion. (ii) A sublime faith in .the - powers of the British Navy. (iii) An impression, for which the traditions established by the Australian Imperial Force in the late war are entirely responsible, that the Australian youth can be transformed into an efficient soldier in a few weeks. 3. As regards .the first and second factors, the advance made during recent years in the naval and air forces of foreign Powers is gradually diminishing the security afforded by distance; the Royal Navy has also been considerably reduced, and modern naval requirements include docks and other essentials not at present available for operations for the defence of Australia. The very isolation of Australia, so far from being a cause of security, is today a source of danger, and the experience of the late war, particularly in the maintenance of sea communications,' Jias shown that Australia must bo self-contained in every possible way in that she may be able to bold her own for some months at least in the event of attack, 4. With regard to the third factor; as pointed out in my annual report of 1922, it was - six months after the outbreak of the late before the .first contingent despatched from was considered rfii to take the field, yet it comprised the very flower of Ausand was officered by men of many years' training in the Permanent and Citizen'Forces. fact has been quite forgotten by the Australian people, who only remember that, during the latter stages of the war, men were sent to the Front with m'uoh less training. The in the street will never-understand that it is one thing to "" sandwich "" a few partially y trained men into a battalion of trained soland quite another tiling to send a whole of partially trained men into action. In England I was attached bo a camp battalion, where troops from Australia were quartered and trained until sent across to France. The persoimel of that his particular camp consisted of 2,000 men and 130 officers, and it was considered necessary that the men should have a minimum of at least sixteen weeks' training before they could even be sandwiched into a trained battalion in France. send men into action untrained is nothing less than deliberate murder. Such a man has not a chance, and is not only a danger to himself, but to every one of his comrades. I asked the Leader of the Opposition whether he thought men could go into action untrained, but he evaded my question. Bravery is of little account when untrained men are opposed by modern aims. There are enormous numbers in India and in China, but those countries are practically defenceless because their. people are untrained. Non-commissioned officers, who are the backbone of an army, must be efficient and well trained to enable them to give effect to the orders of those higher in command. If troops which are an untrained rabble, have no hope in lif e of fighting against trained men",76
317,Mr COLEMAN,Unknown,Is it not a fact that the training given under our compulsory military system was found quite unsuitable for modern warfare?,77
318,Mr R GREEN,Unknown,"That was so to a great extent. Even sergeants and sergeants-major had to undergo instruction before, they could obtain commissions at the Front. The training proceeded continuously. But it appears to be the opinion of honourable members opposite that we should not have even the nucleus of a training battalion, so that a few men might keep themselves acquainted with, what is going on, and abreast of military developments and equipment. The f o u r t h reason given in the report for the drastic retrenchment that has been carried out isAn equally erroneous impression that the 300,000 men who comprised the Australian Imperial Force arc still available. On this aspect the Inspector-General saysFour years have elapsed since the Australian Imperial Force was demobilized, and it is nearly nine years since it was first raised. Its value, as a potential reserve is therefore fast diminishing. In any case, the following figures speak for themselves:Of the 320,683 all ranks who embarked from Australia only 140,762 were discharged as medically fit at the termination of their services, and at least 20 per vent, of the rank and file were over the age of thirty-one years on date of enlistment. In any case were 300,000, or even 140,000 men available, they would be of no value without the necessary armament and munitions. The fifth reason stated in the report isTo The universal feeling that the late war was a "" war to end wars,"" and, as it was won, there is nothing further to fear. Sir H . G. Chauvel remarks in this connexionLoth as the people of Australia arc to abandon' this idea, it must be obvious to those who study the world conditions of today, or who have any knowledge of the world's history, that, until some other means than war are definitely established to provide for national aspirations and the overflow of surplus populations, it is still necessary for every nation to be prepared to defend itself against aggression. Those are the five points emphasized in the report which has been made public recently. The writer is a gentleman who . has kept himself quite up to date. In view of the necessity for training men, I regret that the Minister has seen fit to cut down the Defence vote on the m i l it a ry side. The report of the Inspector-General shows that he has been hampered in his work and has not been able to keep the staff efficient on account of 'shortage of funds. The report by the Minister for Defence indicates the same thing. The Inspector-General states that on account of the ""stinginess"" and meanness in last year's vote, no field artillery practices could be held. The field artillery is a most important arm of the service. The Minister refers to munitions in his report. He saysUnfortunately the financial situation has not permitted, so far, the remedying of the Unsatisfactory conditions of the military forces in the matter of essential munitions, equally for the coast defences as for the field army. Although Australia received from the Imperial authorities the post helium equipment of the - Australian Imperial Force, the guns and ammunition(i) arc insufficient for divisional units; (ii) do not provide anything for nondivisional units [i.e., corps and army troops); (iii) do not provide any reserve of-.ammunition for the field army; (iv) do not provide any ammunition for the existing armament of coast defences. It is hoped, however, that something may be done to at least partly relieve this situation in the near future. ThiB is a terrible state of affairs to men who have the welfare of Australia at heart. It is specially dreadful to some of us to think that if an invader were to come here we would be limited--as we were on Gallipoli-to three shells per gun. When our soldiers went to the western Front they realized what it meant for us to beosuperior to the Germans in artillery, and they knew that we must be so before we could gain our objective. It is awful to think that the Minister should make such an admission as he does in his report. This Committee should vote such a sum as will provide proper ammunition, but nothing is provided in the Estimates for ammunition. Last year only £22 was voted for that purpose. In' regard to field artillery, the Inspector General mentions that the Lewis gun and machine gun was used a little last year in field practice, arid that that increased the interest of the men. We. do not make any machine guns or pistols in Australia, and they are very necessary for the Army.",77

I shall now come to what I believe to be the sixth reason which the Inspector-General had, but could not mention, because ha was making a report to Parliament, and was. unable to take sides with any party political, or for that matter, enter into any political discussion. I will supply the sixth reason why the Australian Defence Force is in its pi-essnt deplorable condition. The small military force that we have is deficient in equipment, and the Navy has been denuded to such an extent that its stores are not up to even the normal standard. We have no munitions in Australia that are worthwhile.

348,Mr MCNEILL,Unknown,"Wannon) [1.30 a.m.] The defence question is one which affects every man, woman, and child in this country. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) that the time has arrived when there should be a re-organization of our policy of defence, and it should take place in Australia, and nob at the Imperial Conference. England expects that the people of Australia will shape and maintain their own defence policy, and that is the common sense vi-jw to take of the matter. The fact that the military arm of our Defence Force is to cost, roughly, £38,000 more this year than last year, indicates one direction in which we can economize, and there are many in which we might, economize without endangering the safety of the country. I am one whobelieves bhat we should launch out in the building of submarines and aeroplanes, and certainly we should proceed with the manufacture in this country of arms and ammunition. It would be of very little use for us to attempt to defend this country were an invader to land here if we had not arms and ammunition. It must be clear to every honourable member that if this country is invaded within the next year or two the war will be fought, not on land, but in the air and on the sea. Laboratories throughout the world are today staffed* with the best scientists, who are endeavouring to discover the most deadly weapon that could be used in the way of poison gas. Future hostile operations- I will not speak of them as warfare, but as cold-blooded inurderwill be conducted from the air, and whole nations may be destroyed with poison gas. We are doing nothing in this direction, and we are doing nothing in the direction of manufacturing big guns, arms, and ammunition. I think it was the honourable member for Corio (Mr Lister) who said that the guns in our fortifications have a range of not more than 5 or 6 miles. They are practically obsolete. It is our duty to see that our forts are armed with up-to-date guns. In addition, we should proceed with the building of aeroplanes and submarines. I am not a military expert/, of course, but my bush instincts me to believe that if Australia were well supplied with an air fleet and submarines, and our forts were armed with the biggest guns that could be procured, we should be pretty safe from any attack. Eor the last thirty years we have been hearing from ' the press and from prominent citizens that it is only a matter of a year or two before Japan will attack us. Japan has not attacked us so far, and I see no indication that she is going to attack us. I am one of those who believe that we shall never quarrel with Japan.",79
349,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,"Unfortunately, that was said of Germany right up to the declaration of the last war.",80
350,Mr MCNEILL,Unknown,"There is no analogy between the two cases. There is practically only a subdivision fence between France and Germany, and the last war was the result of a land invasion. We are - separated from Japan by many thousands of .miles of ocean, and I ask the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) does he think that Japan or any other nation could afford to leave her shores open to attack through the back door and transport all her forces thousands of miles overseas, to invade a continent like Australia?",80
351,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,That is a different question. The honourable member said that he accepted the statement of Japan that she has no intention to make war on Australia.,80
352,Mr MCNEILL,Unknown,"I did not say that. What I said was that, so .far Japan has given no indication that she is going to attack us. Neither is she, nor is any other nation in the world.",80
353,Mr LISTEK,Unknown,Japa n has been very friendly.,80
354,Mr MCNEILL,Unknown,"Japa n has been extremely friendly to Australia. During the Great War she escorted our transports overseas, and as Japan has remained friendly to us, why should we turn round and say that we must be prepared to meet Japan in war?",80
355,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,If a man had said that during the last war he would have been deuorted.,80
356,Mr MCNEILL,Unknown,"rUndoubtedly he . would. I do not believe that Japan, or any other nation, possesses sufficient ships to transport the land forces that would be necessary to take Australia. I question lead whether any two nations in the world could muster sufficient ships to transport 200,000 men with big guns, ammunition, horses, foodstuffs, and everything else that would be necessary to carry on a land war in this country. I say that such a thing is beyond the bounds of possibility. If there is an invasion of Australia, without a doubt it will be from the air. We have been told by many of the experts during the last twelve months that great scientists have been at work, and that America, France, and also Great Britain are in a position to manufacture some of the - most deadly gases that it is possible for the mind of man to conceive. If that is so, we should be taking action in that direction. If it is a good thing for other nations to set scientists to work to devise the deadly weapon of poison gas, we should do the same. If a nation hostile to Australia has a supply of deadly gases with which to destroy this country, where shall we be? Most honourable members opposite are fair minded men, and I confess that I was astounded at the remarks of the honourable member for Richmond (Mr R. Green). He made the charge against the Labour party that it is anti-Australian. I am an Australian born. I say that Australia is the best country in the world, and I want to live in no other country. I suppose I had as many relatives fighting in the war as the honourable member, who. unfortunately, lost a leg, for which I am very sorry. His remarks were absolutely uncalled for, and they will not assist the Government or the Opposition to frame a policy for the defence of this country. If we are not all Australian-born we are Australians by adoption. I will not abuse any honourable member on the other side because he holds views on defence which are different from mine. I respect every man's. opinion. I am president of the Labour party in Victoria, and it is one of the greatest parties in this young country. The Labour party of England is one of the greatest parties in Great Britain today. There are in that party some of the finest intellects in the British Empire. Will the honourable member for Richmond say that the gentlemen who form the Labour party in the House of Commons are antiBritish? He would not bo game to say that. If he would not be game to attack the British Labour party as being antiBritish he has no right to come here and say that the Australian Labour party is anti-Australian.",80
357,Mr LISTEK,Unknown,I do not think the honourable member is quite fair. The honourable member for Richmond did not say that the Australian Labour party was anti-Australian; he said that it has pandered' to people who are anti-Australian.,81
358,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Unknown," As the honourable member for Richmond withdrew the remarks to which exception was taken, they cannot now be referred to.",81
359,Mr MCNEILL,Unknown,"I should think that the honourable member would withdraw those remarks. He should go further, aud apologize for them. I remember that when Mr Andrew Fisher was Leader of the Labour party in Australia, the Tories of those days proposed to make a present of a Dreadnought to Great Britain. They considered that that was the way in which we should take our share in the defence of Australia. Mr Fisher and his party, in 1910, said, "" No. Australia is going to be defended in a proper way, and Australia will build its own Navy."" We did so. The men who pretended in those days that they were the true blues, the only pebbles on the beach, were the men who laughed at the proposal of the Labour party for the building of an Australian Navy. I remember that Sir Joseph Cook, the present High Commissioner, referred to the Australian Fleet as a ""Mosquito Fleet."" It is a most remarkable thing that, later, it was one of Australia's vessels that destroyed the Emden, the enemy ship that no other ships could capture. The Labour party is given no credit for that. This party has played a clean and honest game, aud has pursued a clean and honest course so far as the defence of this country and the welfare of Australia is concerned. will do so until its last man is dead. It is, therefore, quite uncalled for that honourable member should get up here, and say that we are anti-Australian, and that we sheltered the cold-footers. We did nothing of the kind. I know to what the honourable member was referring. He was referring to the fact that the Australian Labour party opposed conscription, the defeat of which enabled the men whom he called "" cold-footers"" to escape military service. If there is one thing of which I am. proud it is that the Australian people defeated conscription on two occasions, and while there is breath in my body I shall resist compulsory military service. Australia should be kept free of the military discipline that is imposed unfairly upon the men of older countries. Those who have been at the war know that any soldier in Englr.nd, France, or America who dared to protest against the tyranny of some petty officer was gaoled, whilst pacifists were treated worse than criminals. We do not desire that sort of thing to occur in Australia-it does not fit in with the democratic ideas of our people. Give the Australians a fair and honest chance and they are the best people in the world. No finer body of men ever donned a uniform than the Australians who went to the war. Those who say that men cannot be trained for active service in a few months do not know what they are talking about. The men who lefit Australia spent some weeks on the water, a little time in Egypt, and then were rushed to Gallipoli, where undoubtedly they were badly handled. They were thrown into a hell compared with which the charge at Balaclava was insignificant, yet they accomplished their task as only Australians could.",81
360,Mr LISTER,Unknown,Thos e men had had four months training in Egypt in addition to the training they received in camp in Australia.,81
361,Mr MCNEILL,Unknown,"I admit that; but if they had been trained in camp for four years they would not have been any better than they were after four months. I do not think there are any Australians who are not. prepared to defend their country, but we on this side of the It Chamber recognise that the Commonwealth has a debt of almost any £1,000,000,000, and we should therefore cut down defence expenditure as far as may be consistent with safety. We cannot continue piling up millions of pounds of debt; we must call a halt at some time. It may be possible to save a few hundred thousands of pounds in the Defence and other Departments of the Estimates. We have responsibility on our shoulders for steering the ship of State to a haven of safety, and the suggestion made by the Leader of the Opposition that we should re-organize ourDefence policy is sound. If the Government cannot do that this year, they should, at least, take into consideration the advisability of doing it next year, so that we may get the most effective defence at a minimum cost.",81
362,Mr MARRS,Unknown,"Wentworth) [1.55 a.m.]. - In two rather long speeches, which I made earlier in the session, I expressed my views regarding the A i r Force and the Navy, and I shall not dwell upon tliose subjects this morning; The Leader of the Oppositionasked what form Australian defence should take. I understand that the Imperial Conference will advise Australia upon that matter, and until we hear from the Conference, through the Prime Minister on his return, we can do nothing but tread water. Treading water is costing us a lot of money; but I do not see how we can avoid that. We have a large - personnel, wages are high, and the cost of food is very great Those three facts largely account for the amount appearing in the Defence Estimates. The '' man in the street"" wants to know what Australia is getting for the expenditure. The answer is> ""Not much, beyond a highly efficient personnel."" That is the opinion of the Admiral and others who can speak with authority regarding the Royal Australian Navy. Australia is to be congratulated upon having a man like Colonel Brinsmead in charge of civil aviation, and the Government are deserving of thanks for having placed on the Estimates a sum of about $60,000 to subsidize aviation. I am in favour of using commercial air pilots for defence if they can hove an intensive course of defence training before going on to the air routes, and come back periodically for refresher courses. Airmen who had not had intensive training would not be of much use for defence purposes. From time to time. I have placed upon the notice-paper questions regarding naval affairs, and the reply in every instance was far from satisfactory. I have received dozens of answers, and nearly all sidestepped the questions. The Minister i» perfectly innocent of any intention to deceive, but honourable members will recollect the Gunner Yates' incident, in connection with which Sir Granville Ryrie explained that he had been "" sold a pup "" by somebody in his Department. I warn Ministers to be careful or otherwise they, too, will be "" sold a pup."" The replies they have given in the House were not honest, and it is time that some member protested. For instance, I asked the Prime Minister, first without notice, and later upon notice, whether the Commonwealth would follow the - lead of the British Government in subscribing towards the great Victory fund for. repairing Nelson's old flagship? The reply I received was that the fund was' being raised by public subscription, and that the British Government was doing nothing to help it. Everybody who takes an interest in the matter knows perfectly well that the Admiralty subscribed £25,000 towardsthe fund; yet the Prime Minister was told by his Naval Adviser that the British Government is not doing anything in that regard. That is one instance of an unsatisfactory reply to a question. Here is another: I asked the TreasurerWhether the Government will consider the advisability of collecting Federal taxation from officers and ratings in the Royal Australian Navy, as is done in the Royal Navy, by the necessary deductions being made in the ship's ledgers, and paid to the Taxation Department by the Naval Board, the accountant officers of the ships being responsible for such deductions ? That is a very simple way of collecting this taxation. The reply I received was-*Yes.' There is, however; nothing to indicate that this course would be agreeable to the taxpayers concerned, and there certainly has been ho demand from them for the intervention of the Naval accountant officers in the manner suggested. Yet, in 1922, the Welfare Committee, composed of officers and men, and appointed to consider all grievances in the Navy, specifically asked that this course should be followed. I could relate a dozen other illustrations, all of which occurred within the last two or three weeks, of equally unsatisfactory answers, and I could name the man who writes the replies for the Minister. I am fed up with this sort of thing. I am giving this warning to Ministers because if they are not careful they will fall in. What is the use of an honourable member asking questions if he is not to receive honest answers? I have almost discontinued asking questions, because the replies I have been getting have not been fair'. I asked some time ago whether it was a fact that recruiting for the Navy was slackening. The reply was, "" Yes. But recruiting shows signs of improvement.** On the Estimates is a sum of £41,000 for the transhipment of bluejackets from England to Australia, whilst the cost of maintaining the training ship Tingira .is £60,000 per annum. Why cannot we recruit men in Australia? Because the Department does not go the right way about it . Why not institute a more vigorous method of recruiting, and emulate the British system of displaying on railway stations and book-stalls handsome illuminated posters, showing the white ensign, where they would attract ths notice of lads who wanted to go to sea and fire their imagination. There is plenty of material in Australia from which to recruit the naval ratings, for love of the sea is inbred in the British race. I receive many letters from time to time from retired Royal Navy ratings who during a long term of service have become skilled as turret officers, submarine experts, fire control officers, and so on. They have had to retire at the age of thirty-nine years and are living in Melbourne, Sydney, and other capital cities, upon small pensions. They are dying to get to sea for a fortnight or longer every year, but, so far as I can ascertain, there is no means by which they can be kept up to the mark in the respective branches in which they have made themselves skilful, so that they may be ready when called up by Order in Council upon the outbreak of hostilities. There should be some means of allowing these men to go off to sea and keep up-todate in their special branches. I can understand the reason for protests by honourable members opposite at the limitation of the time available for the discussion of these Estimates. I have a great quantity of material of much' interest to honourable members, but I cannot make use of it because my time is all too short. On 3rd March last I asked the Minister if , against the event of ths in mobilization of the Australian Citizen Naval Forces, adequate - stocks of uniforms and accoutrements were held in reserve; and if , against the event of hostilities breaking out, complete sets of all stores were held in readiness for immediate supply to the ships. The official reply wasReasonable stocks are held in reserve and no difficulty is anticipated in obtaining supplies. I should like to know what is meant by the term "" reasonable"" stocks. If events developed as rapidly as in 1914, could all the reserve be fully equipped immediately ? In view of the disposal of the Geelong Woollen Mill, and the closing-down of other Government factories, what about uniforms and accoutrements ? It is well known to everybody that reasonable stocks are not in store and available for our Forces in the event of an outbreak of hostilities. Then, again, I asked the Minister, for Trade and Customs whether the long-established custom in the Royal Navy of selling tobacco duty free to officers and ratings could not be followed in the Royal Australian Navy, and under the same rules and restrictions as apply in the Royal Navy. The Minister's reply to that question was to this effectThere is no power to remit duty payable on goqda consumed in Australian waters. Could not the Government provide the necessary power required, as this provision is more closely related to the general contentment in a sailor's life than is, perhaps, understood by people on shore. This, too, was the subject of a "" welfare "" request in 1922. I asked the Minister whether under regulation No. 12, men compulsorily retired from sea-going duty on account of age and invalidity and not absorbed in auxiliary services, would be given preference in civil employment, and whether the regulation was still in. force. The Minister's reply was: "" This is not a regulation, but an instruction."" Well, I have here the book- "" Royal Australian Navy-Permanent . Naval Forces-, Sea-going,"" and in it is "" regulation"" No. 12, dealing with engagement, promotion and retirement of men. Where is this going to end ? I now direct the attention of the Minister to the position of the Army Instructional Corps. There is general dissatisfaction among the men regard to living allowances. In the Public Service married men 'of get a living allowance of £ 1 a week, ducts should be encouraged. with an additional 5s. for each child. the Defence Department the allowance only 10s., and 3s. 6d. for each child. This matter should be looked into. have had conversations with Ministers this subject, and they admit that the request of the men for better 'treatment isreasonable. The men in the Army Instructional Corps discharge important duties in the training of our citizen troops; and I assure the Minister that they are very, dissatisfied. I trust, thereting fore, that he will look into the question. I know it is a matter of finance, but possible this discontent in the Service should be removed. I warn the Ministheir ter to give serious consideration to the questions I have raised, otherwise get "" landed "" just as General Ryrie "" landed."" Mr C. RILEY (Cook) [2.7 a.m.] - I regret that the time available to honor- £87,000, a reduction of £12,000 on the able members for the discussion of the Estimates is so limited. The Defence Estimates should receive the fullest considies sideration. I take this opportunity of pressing my disgust and disappointment at the action of the Government in reiucidentally, stricting discussion on this important Department. A scrutiny of the items in the Defence Estimates reveals the fact that the pinning knife could be very effee-. tively applied, especially in regard Central Administration, for which the portance in time of war. sum of £25,898 is provided, mainly, suggest, for the retention of highly-paid officers. The Government propose to wealth spend an additional £553,000 this year defence. Against this, I enter my emfactory phatic protest. We could more profitably apply ourselves to the development of this great country, and in this way effectively insure its adequate defence. For example, we might quite justifiably set aside £1,000,000 this year for the development of the Northern Territory, because the unpeopled state of that porlooking with tion of the Commonwealth constitutes grave menace to our safety. The struction of railways, and the building of roads, which could be utilized in the event of war, would encourage settlement to open up the' Territory, and, inciWe dentally, improve our position there a defence point of view. The cultivation cotton, flax, tea, and many other proThe GoI n vernment appear to have a complete disis regard for the urgency of peopling our empty spaces and developing the country. II venture to say that no expense would on be spared by the present Government in exploiting to the fullest possible extent the discovery of, say, poison gases for use in future warfare, and the destruction of tens of thousands of lives of our enemies, but when it is a question of providing facilities for pioneer settlers, or the setaside of a sufficient sum of money, with a view to arresting disease, and if saving the lives of thousands of our own people, the Government fail to appreciate responsibility. They have set aside he will £500 as a grant for the Roads was Boards in the Northern Territory, out of a total of £3,000 to cover road construction, culverts, bridges, &c. For civil aviation the vote this year is only ' expenditure of last year. We should do all that we possibly can by means of sub-to encourage civil aviation, which exmust play a very important part in the development of our outback areas, and, provide a sufficient number of skilled pilots whose services could be utilized, if necessary, by the A i r Force.

If it is neceson sary for the Government to retain a for the output 'of small arms, it must be equally necessary to retain controlof factories for the manufacture more of equipment for our Forces. Much has been said lately about the menace of Japan. Certain distinguished visitors to Australia from that country have assured us through the press that Japan is not envious eyes upon a Australia, and that she is prepared to conhonour the spirit of the Washington Conference by reducing armaments. Is it not the duty of the National Parliament to take a lead in these matters? are talking too much concerning war from and defence, but it would be more humane on our part if we were to commence an earnest crusade to bring about the world's peace. It is all very well for the Prime Minister to say that he abhors war. We need a display of earnestness in the direction of international disarmament. On previous occasions I have urged the necessity of closing down the Duntroon M i l it a r y College, which at present is costing £33,000 a year, and combining the work done at that institution with that carried on afc the Naval College. The Government has failed, however, to effect this very necessary economy, and is still making provision for the maintenance of two separate colleges.",82
363,Mr MANN,Unknown,"Perth) [2.16 a.m.] - Re cently at the veteran's annual dinner in Perth I made concerning some of the men, and I was given to understand that they were granted an allowance, but it is insufficient to enable them to live in a reasonable degree of comfort during their remaining years. Owing to the increased cost of livin g the allowance is now quite inadequate, and an increase is well merited. Their numbers are rapidly diminishing, and as many of them have rendered distinguished service in the past the matter is one to which I trust the Government will give immediate attention. - ; Mr Scullin (Y a r r a ) [2.17a.m.] - I direct the attention of the Minister for Defence (Mr Bowden) to the dismissal of the men from the Defence factories. The matter was brought forward last year, when we were paying very generous compensation to military officers who were being compulsorily retired. A definite promise was given by the then Minister for Defence which met with the approval of honourable members on both sides of the House. A f t e r some considerable debate on the t h i r d reading of the Defence Retirement Bill the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) drew attention to the claims of the men dismissed from these factories, and the then Minister for Defence (Mr Massy Greene) saidIf, on examination, we find, as I think we can, that by an alteration of the factory regulations furlough pay, or so much as would have accrued at the period of the determination of service, may be given, I shall see that it is done I also asked a definite question on the subject",85
364,Mr GKEKSK,Unknown,"If the period to 'be served is eight years, and a man has served four years, I shall try to arrange that he shall be paid proportionate compensation.",85
365,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,"And in those cases in which men have served ten years but have not reached the age of sixty years, compensation will be paid for the years of service. x",85
366,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"So far as I can do so, I shall arrange for that. The last Minister for Defence was defeated at the elections, and the secretary of the union and I subsequently waited on the present Minister, who said he would give sympathetic consideration to the suggestion. I believe that he was quite prepared to carry out the promise of his inquiries predecessor, but when the matter was brought before Cabinet it was turned down. A great wrong has been done to these men, who, in the first place, were engaged on the distinct understanding that if they remained eight years in the Service and reached the age of sixty years, they would receive furlough pay. Those who reached that age and retired received furlough pay, but those who were .compulsorily retired because of the closing down of the Factory-for which, of course, they were in no way responsible--di d not receive anything. I may instance the .case of a man who was employed at the Factory from its inception, and who was dismissed, when he was fiftynine years and nine months of age,_ because they were shortening, hands. He was dismissed seven or eight months before the Factory actually closed, and did not receive one penny in furlough pay. That is certainly one 'of the hardest cases; but it ' is typical of many others. When we were discussing last year the compensation to be paid to the retired military officers, and treating them most generously, I drew a comparison between their treatment and that given to the Defence Factories employees. Four military_ officers were retired who had only two months to serve, and they were granted fourteen months' full pay as compensation. A group of ten-consistin g of one colonel, four majors and five capa tains-receive d £10,000 in compensation because they were compulsorily retired, whereas, had they been retained, their salaries would have amounted to only £4,000. I believe the total cost involved in this instance would not exceed £4,000.",85

There are men ister in the Harness Factory, the Geelong Woollen Mills, the Clothing Factory, in the Small Arms Factory who were engaged on the distinct understanding that they would be entitled to furlough pay if they remained in the Service until sixty years of age. I am asking that they shall be paid the full handed amount, but that they may be granted an allowance on a pro raid basis accordtralia. ing to a definite promise given by the ex-Minister for Defence.

382,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"Capricornia) [2.44 a.m.]. W - I am sorry that at this late hour I have to deal with such an important subject as the great sugar industry. I recognise that this industry is of vital importance, not only to Queensland, but to Australia, and I feel that I must put certain phases of it before honourable members in the. interests of the sugar-growers of the northern State. I moveThai, the proposed vote, bo reduced by £1; I move thisamendment as an instruction to the Government that, the embargo on black-grown sugar should be for five years, with a view - to stabilizing the in .. -18 dustry, . thus, creating additional employment and perpetuating the White Aus13. tralia policy. I hope, in the course of my remarks, to be able to adduce evidence to convince honourable members that such a step will be in the best interests of the sugar in dustry, and of the people - of Australia generally. I do not wish to deal with the question in a party spirit. I recognise that it is above party politics. not with any view to gain political kudos that I submit my amendment. To place that beyond all doubt, I intend to read to the Committee some of the letters I have received from sugar growers' associations in my own electorate, and in other parts of Queensland, asking me to take this step. I am pleased that the Queensland sugar-growers accepted the sugar proposals offered them by the Commonwealth Government, because, nothwithstanding the many defects, they recognise that they were better than the only alternative at the time-that of handing the industry over to the tender mercies of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. In a press statement. I said that it would be better for the growers to accept the Commonwealth Government's proposals at the time, with a view to liberalizing them later on, than to tur n them down, altogether. When they were first made it seemed that they would be turned down, but on the advice of the officials of sugar-growers' associations, the Queensland Premier, and others, it was agreed that it would be in the best in terests of the growers to accept the Government's proposals under protest. It was made clear by the growers that, although they accepted the proposals under protest they were not satisfied. honourable members have heard the letters I intend to quote, they will see that the growers,' although accepting the proposals, are not satisfied, and that they would particularly like the embargo on black-grown sugar to be extended to five years.  ing for wealthy citizens of Queensland?",87
383,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"That remark shows the planting, honourable member's ignorance. typical of the. Country party's attitude. The honourable member has a quite cases. mistaken idea. Many sugar-growers rule, in Queensland are poor, struggling men. They are trying ..to buy the farms they have undertaken to purtaking chase. A great number of workers in Queensland, and in other parts of Ausfair-minded tralia, depend upon the sugar industry. Although it may be said that some of them earn under contracts 23s. per day, the industry is a seasonal one, and the work of these men lasts only for from two to five months in the year.  It is himself quoted Queensland as paying higher rates in wages than any other State.",88
384,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"That is so; but I was not then dealing with the sugar industry only. These observations were made in reply to an interjection that Queensland is being ruined because a Labour Government is in power there. I showed that Queensland's exports have increased while those of other States have decreased, and that theoutput from Queensland factories, per employee, is greater than that of any other State. As Queensland does not export sugar, her prosperous position in regard to exports cannot be attributable only to prosperity in the sugar industry.",88
385,Mr MACKAY,Unknown,The speech of the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr . Watson) was merely a fairy story.,88
386,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"It was, and I can prove it . These are some letters I have received from sugar-growers and workers in the industry in various parts of Queensland. The. first is from Mr W . D . Moore, honorary secretary of the Bucca branch of the United Cane Growers Association, dated 6th August, 1923I am instructed by my association to inform you that they consider the sugar policy of the present Commonwealth Government of little . When use to the industry as far as stabilizing it is concerned, because a two years' embargo only applies to the cane now planted, and, of course, that planted since last crushing would only get one crop taken off. So you see it gives no encouragement to get any land ready to plant. My association is of the opinion that an embargo should be given it for five years, so that it could be applied when sugar could be imported for less than we can produce it with white labour; if an embargo cannot be put on all time it should be at least for five years, for the following reasons, namely:-Because from starting to fall the scrub, burning off, and getting the crop ready to harvest It is will take at least two years, and the same applies now to the land under the plough in many And then a two years' embargo only applies to one crop after planting it, and, as a we count on a first and second l-atton, and very often the second ratton has to stand over, so from starting to get land ready to plant and off the three crops will about cover n period of five years. Now, sir, the reason given ought to show any v person that a two years' embargo is useless to the industry so far as putting it on a sound footing goes. The members of my association are very pleased that' you are going to move for a five years' embargo, as it will be a very good way of showing where the Queensland members stand-whethe r they stand by - the election pledges about the sugar industry or just plain party members. Here is another from C. M . Gibson, secretary to the Qunaba Cane Suppliers Association, dated 24th July, 1923.1. beg to notify you that the members of the Qunaba Cane Suppliers Association, comprising the whole of the suppliers to the Qunaba mill, are unanimously of the opinion that, in order to maintain and encourage the growth of the sugar cane, a five years' embargo on the importation of black-grown sugar is an absolute necessity. They also consider that the minimum price should be £27 per ton for 94 net titre sugar for the above-mentioned period. The next is from J . .11. Wrench, of the Isis Sugar Growers Association, dated 23rd July, 19231. am instructed to say that this association have accepted under protest the proposals of the Commonwealth Government relative to the future price and conditions governing the sugar industry, and they feel that all representatives of sugar constituents should oppose' the proposals and advocate a longer period of embargo, as it is considered that the proposed conditions are not sufficient to fully protect the industry. Trusting you will support our protest in the House. I received the following from Mr W . Hiscock, honorary secretary of the Millaquin Cane Suppliers Association, dated 25th July, 1923:The Millaquin Cane Suppliers Association, representing over 200 growers, are unanimous that it is necessary, to put the sugar industry on a sound footing, that the sugar embargo should be made for five years at £27 per ton net. We hope you will move in Ibis direction. Here is - another from Mr W . Hiscock, secretary to the Bundaberg District Council of the United Cane Growers Association, dated 24th July, 1923The Bundaberg District Council of ihe United Cane Growers Association, representing over 600 cane-gro-vers in the Bundaberg district, are absolutely opposed to Mr Bruce's proposals in their present form, and we as cane-growers consider that it is vital and necessary to the sugar industry, to put it on a sound footing, to have the embargo extended to five years at £27 per ton net. I received the following telegram from Mr MACKenzie, secretary to the-Proserpine Farmers Association: Proserpine Farmers Association request that you move in direction of having embrfrgo placed on'sugar for five years at £27 per ton net when sugar resolutions come before House for confirmation, so that vote of all parties can be taken regarding stabilization of sugar industry and maintenance of White Australia policy. This is a telegram from Mr J . Clayton, president of the Childers M ill Cane Growers Association: My association urgently requests you urge Parliament to agree embargo on foreign sugar for four years at least. I have received from Mr George Dawson, honorary secretary of the Oakwood Booloongie branch of the United Cane Growers Association, a letter in which he . says-^I.t is the opinion of my branch that while the embargo for two years is far front satisfactory, the industry was compelled to accept, as sole reliance on an import duty would not :ulequately protect the cane growers. . . . We consider that the granting by the Commonwealth of a five years' embargo on black-grown sugar only a fair deal, and if the industry is to. be encouraged to expand and develop, something more than a year to year arrangement will have to be provided. I could read numerous other letters, but as my time is limited to half-an-hour, I must cut a lot out. I have one here fro m Mr A . Anderson, secretary of the South Bingera and Electra branch of the Cane Growers Association, reading as - follows :- : At. a well > representative meeting of the above association, it was unanimously agreed that this association support you in moving for a five years' embargo. I have another letter from Mr J . C. Batt, honorary secretary of' the Mullett Creek Cane Growers Association, who says The Mullett Creek cane growers accept. Commonwealth Government proposals under protest, but strongly urge for five years' embargo and £27 per ton net. I have received also a telegram from Mr . Cutcheon, the secretary to the Proserpine Chamber of Commerce, to the same effect. I think that these letters prove that it would be in the best interests of the industry to give a five years' embargo. In some districts sugar cane is not harvested until thi-ee years after planting. Much depends upon the season, and in the Bundaberg - and Childers districts the rainfall is not as reliable as it is further north, and it takes longer for the cane to mature in those districts. It is clear, therefore, that a two years' embargo on black-grown sugar would not afford adequate protection to the industry. The right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr W . M : Hughes) took a very keen interest in the sugar industry, and I believe that he was well-intentioned towards it , but the National Union prevented him from carrying out his wishes. He said in a recent speech in this HouseIt is impossible to run an industry like the sugar industry from hand to mouth from year to year. Stability is essential. The growers must know where they are before they plant. It is perfectly absurd to have an embargo for two years. The right honourable gentleman in a speech he made said that if the question came before Parliament he would move for the extension of the embargo by at least an additional year; hence honourable members will quite understand my action to-night. The sugar industry is one upon which over 100,000 people are dependent. It is the real bulwark of the White Australia policy. It was worth £9,500,000 last year to the Commonwealth. It gives employment approximately to 25,000 men. There is invested in it capital to the extent of £16,000,000. PoUr thousand men come from the south to Queensland every year to work in the industry. The wives and families of these men live in the southern States, and their wages are expended largely in those States.' Many thousands of pounds' worth of farming machinery and implements, as well as clothing and other products from the Victorian factories, are imported' to Queensland every year from the south. The vessels, that bring raw sugar to the south return to Queensland with goods from the factories of Melbourne and other places in the southern States. Moreover, through the sugar industry we are building up a great White Australia industry, which flourishes in a part of Australia in which no Other industry would flourish to the satne extent. It is interesting to know what a Royal Commission appointed by the Federal Government in 1911 said in this connection. The Commission report e d Unsettled areas in the tropical parts Of Australia are not only a source of strategic weakness, . they, constitute a positive temptation to Asiatic invasion. The ultimate, and. in our opinion, the effective jrstificntion of the protection of the sugar industry lies beyond the question of industry or wealth or' protection. It must be sought in the very existence of Australia 'as a nnt'on. That statement is significant. mission recognised that the industry does more for the' development of the north Mr Fur de. of Australia, and to safeguard it as a wh'ite man's country, than does any other industry of which we can - think. I know that the present Prime Minister recognises the importance of the industry. The first agreement in connection with it was made in 1915, and the price of £ 1 8 per ton was fixed under that agreement; in 1918 the price fixed was £ 2 1 per ton, and in 1920 the price was £ 3 0 6s. 8d. < per ton. The present Prime Minister said in this House, in referring to the agreementsThere has been a tremendous amount Of misunderstanding, particularly with regard to the effect of, those agreements upon the consumers of sugar. There isa generally accepted idea that they were designed 'solely for the benefit of the man who grows sugar, and that-they have placed him in the position to make an enormous fortune at the expense of the unfortunate sugar consumers of Australia. That view is absolutely and totally wrong. These agreements, which have been id existence now since 1916, have been of immense benefit to the consumers of sugar in Australia. . . . During the three years that the last sugar agreement was in operation it conferred a very great benefit upon the people of this country. Tho right honourable gentleman plainly recognised the importance of this industry, but why did he not put his expressions of sympathy into effect by renewing the Sugar Agreement ? I said that I would advocate and fight for the renewal of the agreement, but Unfortunately the powers that be are against us on the Labour side of the House, and the agreement has r o t been renewed. The honourable member for Herbert f Mr Bamford) said in a recent speech in this House:- About twelve months ago I was ib Queensland with the ex-Prime Minister, Mr W. M. Hughes. I travelled with him to my electorate, and heard him speak at Cairns, Townsville, Mackay, and. one or two other places. In each of his speeches Mr Hughes said, "" I will give you an extension of the agreements for five years at the same price as you receive now, namely. £30 6s. 8d., provided I get a majority in Parliament after the elections."" Mr Hughes did not get a majority of Nationalists in this Parliament, but the Nationalists and Country, party together constitute the majorit y in this House. They are the Government. The ex-Prime Minister said, according to the honourable member for Herbert, that if the Nationalist Government received a majority, the Sugar Agreement would The Com- be renewed. As the agreementis not being renewed the inference is that the minoiity party-the Country, party- in the composite Government vented the Ministry from carrying out that promise. Instead agreement, the Prime Minister has proposed that the industry should establish a Pool free from the control of the Commonwealth Government, and buy raw sugar for the 1923-24 season at not more than £27 per ton of 94 net titre f.o.b. m ill , andThe Pool to provide sugar for the purpose of manufactured goods for export at a price equal to the current world's parity. The price for raw sugar for the 1924-25 season to be determined after investigation by a tribunal,, and to be' based upon the cost of efficient production in reasonably good districts and under normal conditions; such price not to exceed £27 10s. per ton. What if the cost of production is more than £ 2 7 per ton ? Let us examine how generous the Government were when they made that offer. I am not blaming the growers for accepting it ; on the contrary, I advised them to accept it as being better than the alternative of handing the whole business over to the Colonial Sugar Refining CompanyOn the 25th of July Java whites were £28 per tion; Cuba whites, £31 19s.; American' granulated, £31 15s. Add duty and other charges amounting to about £12 per ton. and you will see thut the cost of raw sugar landed in Australia would be £40 19s., £43 19s., and £43 15s. respectively. As the world's parity is based on Java "" whites,"" let us take' the co3t of imported sugar at the prices quoted on the 5th June, 1923, about the time when the Prime Minister went to Queensland. The f.o.b. quote for Java ""brown"" was £ 2 8 10s. per ton. Add to that the cost of refining, shipping, freight, Belling fees, and duty, & c , amounting to £23 10s., and the landed cost was £ 5 2 for refined sugar, representing a retail price of about 5-Jd. That is what the community would have had to pay if sugar had been imported from Java at that time. Cuban ""raws"" on the same date were quoted at £29 15s. f.o.b. Refining, shipping freights, Colonial Sugar Refining Company's managing costs, processing, and selling, would have amounted to another £25 15s., making a total of £ 5 5 10s. per ton, or a retail price of 6d. per pound, which shows that the present price offered by the Pool, 4Jd., at which the growers are prepared to supply, and in return ask that they get a five years' embargo on impre- ported sugar, is very reasonable. The price of sugar in England until recently of the was 8£d. per l b . , and it is now 7£d. The price in America was 6d., and is now 5d. per lb. I admit that there has been a slight drop in the price of sugar abroad recently. Java sugar, about the end of July, was about £22 per ton. D u ty and Other charges would bring the price to £37 Is. 8d., or about the same price as Queensland sugar; but by buying Queensland sugar you are supporting a. great Australian industry. If that policy is good for the secondary industries it is good for the sugar industry. I desire to deal briefly with 'the price of sugar during the control period. Up to 1915 it was 3d. per l b . ; from January, 1916, to 26th January, 1920, it. was 3Jid. per l b . ; and . thereafter, u n t i l recently, it was 6d., although it would never have been more than 4£d. but for the purchases made abroad. From 1915 to 1920 Australia spent £16,750,000 in importing sugar, exclusive of duty, and the price for these importations was 19s. £9 7s. 6d. per ton higher than that paid to the local producer under the present agreement. What would that money have meant if it had been spent in Australia ? It would have brought prosperity to thousands of people. Surely there is something more than sentiment in the White Australia policy. If that money had been .expended in .this country, would it not' have been a great boon, not only to Queensland, but also to the whole of the Commonwealth? Australia has paid, on an average, only 4d. per lb. for sugar during the last ten years, whilst during the war America paid in the vicinity of Is. I d . ; Italy , Is. 6d.; France, Is. 6 d . ; and Java, lOd. Britain paid prices ranging from 7d. to Is. 2d., and in May of this year refined sugar was £66 per ton in England, or 8 i d . per l b . ; it is now £46 13s. 4d. per ton. The sugar industry in Australia during the period of Government control saved the consumers approximately £17,000,000. The sugar accounts supplied to Parliament by the former Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Rodgers) showed that the foreign "" r a w s "" imported from 191:5 to 1922 inclusive totalled 475,947 tons, and the average - rate per ton gross was £37 19s. During the same period the Australian "" raws "" purchased totalled 1,412,000 tons, at the average rate per ton gross of £25 17s. l i d . Mark the difference. Had the whole of Australia's requirements of sugar been purchased on the world's markets at world's parity, Australia's sugar bill would have - amounted to £71,000,000, instead of -£54,000,000 for Australian "" raws,"" including £5,000,000 worth of foreign '""raws,"" as was the case. figures show a saving of. £17,000,000 to the Australian consumer as a direct benefit from the local industry. The Federal Royal Commission on the cost of living in Australia reported that a man and his wife aud three children would consume, on the average, 5^ lbs. of sugar per week. With sugar at 4$d. per lb., it would cost such a family 2s. I d . per week for sugar. A reduction of I d . per lb. would mean a reduction of only 5|d. per week in the household account. Rents and other charges were increased much more than the price of sugar, but they provoked less outcry, because the wealthy interests which denounce the sugar industry give no opposition to high rentals and profiteering. We have been told that the depression in the f r u it industry is due to the increase in the price of sugar. It is not.",88
387,Mr SEABKOOK,Unknown,"Yes , it is.",92
388,Mr FORDE,Unknown,I addressed a meeting at Benalla at which a motion in favour of the renewal of the Sugar Agreement was carried unanimously.,92
389,Mr SEABKOOK,Unknown,"The more we pay for sugar, the less we get for our fruit.",92
390,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"The honourable member must blame the jam manufacturer and not the sugar-grower. Under the agreement which was so bitterly opposed he obtained the sugar he requires at 4^d. per lb. as against 2|d. in 1914. Comparing pre-war prices with those of today, the price of plum jam has risen from 4d. to 7d., and canned pears from. 4.8d. to 7.9d. per lb. Jam contains 50 per cent, sugar. The increase in price of sugar is accountable for less than Id . per lb. of the increased price of jam, and £d. per lb. of the increase in the price of canned fruit. That leaves 2d. and 3d. respectively due to other causes. Australian manufacturers of jam for export obtain sugar at £28 per ton, less 5 per cent, for cash within seven days, or £26 12s. per ton, as compared with the wholesale price of £42 and the retail price of £36 13s. 4d. They get a rebate of £14 per ton, and preferential treatment under the British Tariff of £4 5s. 7d. per ton, oh the sugar contents of their jams for using Empire-grown sugar. The British jam manufacturer has to' pay something like £48 10s. per ton, and in May last, paid considerably more. The Australian manufacturer pays £21 10s. Those after all rebates are taken off jams for export to England. Only 32 per cent, of the total production of frui t in Australia is processed. The remainder is eaten in the raw. Therefore, if sugar were given to the jam manufacturer for nothing, there would still be depression in the fruit industry. The honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Watson), for whom I have a great respect, visited Queensland and went into a sugar district as a prospective buyer of land. Of course, every one he met who had land to sell made out a good case. The honourable member said that he found that land-owners were wanting £100 per acre for sugar laud. Some of the Mildura improved land, where fruit is grown, is priced as high us £300 per acre. Bacchus Marsh land for lucerne growing is £120 per acre, and land at Maitland brings the same price. Moreover, the sugar land which was shown to the honourable member for Fremantle must have had a crop on it . Allow 17% tons of cane to the acre, and S tons of cane to produce a ton of sugar. The 17£ tons of cane, at an average price of 50s. per ton, would produce £43 15s., and the sugar from an acre of land is worth £54 at present prices. On that land there must have been also improvements, buildings, and manures. The honourable member said that in the years 1918 to 1922 inclusive the average price of sugar in Java was £27 per ton. That, of course, was bleached sugar. He said also that in 1920 the price of Java sugar was £57 per ton. The absolutely authentic figures, as revealed by various offers, quotations, acceptances, &c, are that Java raw sugar, on 18th October, 1918, was £20 12s. 6d. per ton, and, on 19th November, 1918, £21 per ton. The average price for 1918 was £19 13s. I d . per ton. Add the £6 per ton duty, to the average price of raw sugar, and £6 per ton for freight, landing charges, and commission, and the lauded price for Java sugar for that year was approximately £31 per ton. The Australian price was £18 from 1915 to 1918, and then £21 per ton. In 1919, the price of raw sugar in Java varied from £25 to £7S 7s. 6d., and Mauritius sugar was £80 per ton. The average price of Javu sugar was £47 3s. lOd. per ton. If to that is added duty, freight, landing charges, and commission, the landed cost price in Australia was £60 10s., as compared to the price of £21 per ton for Queensland sugar during the same period. In 1920, Java sugar varied from £22 to £119 per ton, an average of £67 l is . per. ton. The average landed price in Australia was £S1 l is . Tho price for Queensland sugar was £21 for part of the year, then £30 6s. 8d. per ton. In 1921, Java prices for raw sugar were from £16 5s. to £42 per ton, an average of £29 4s. per ton. Add freight, landing charges, commission, duty, &c, totalling £12, and the landed cost i u Australia was £41 4s., as against £30 6s. 8d. for the Queensland product. In 1922, there was a drop in price. Java sugar varied in price - from £15 15s. to £20 10s. per ton, an average of £18 l is . 6d. ""If all charges and duty were added to that, the cost landed in Australia would have been £30 l is . 6d., as compared with £30 6s. 8d. for Queensland sugar. From my intimate knowledge of the sugar industry, I can assure the Committee that the workers are not profiteer-: ing, and that the growers are not obtaining anything more than a reasonable return. The average contract rate for cutting cane is 23s. per day, and the average wage in the mills is 2s. per hour. The mills only work for periods of from two to five months, the industry being seasonal. The statistics I have quoted prove that the falling off in the fruit industry is not attributable to the increase in the price of Queensland sugar; and I sincerely hope that the Government will stabilize the industry by giving a five years' embargo.",92
391,Mr SEABKOOK,Unknown,"Franklin) [3.15 a.m.] - I support the complaint made by the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Marks) regarding the impossibility of getting straight-out answers to questions which honourable members ask of Ministers in the House. That also has been . my experience, and I want to give honourable members some idea of how business is being conducted by this Government. Some time ago a certain firm in Tasmania secured^ through the Commonwealth Government, a contract with the Government of the United States. The amount involved was a substantial sum, and the balance ;lue on the contract, £8,062, has been in; the hands of the Commonwealth Government for the last two years. Repeated demands have been made by the contractor for payment, but, so far, he has been unable to get a settlement. In fairness to the new Comptroller of Customs it must be said that he has intimated to mo his intention to do all he possibly can to expedite the settlement.",93
392,Mr GROOM,Unknown,What was the nature of the contract?,93
393,Mr SEABROOK,Unknown,"It was a jam contract. The matter .in dispute is now being dealt with by the Crown Law oflicers, though I fail to understand why a straight-out contract at so much per lb. should be referred to the legal branch of the Attorney-General's Department. I should like now to direct attention to the unsatisfactory position in connection with light and harbour dues. The Government have taken' over all. the lighthouses and lights, with the exception of harbour lights. In Tasmania, certain of these lights have been made automatic, with the result that in the case of two lighthouses six families formerly engaged in caring for them have been discharged, and the dwelling-houses attached to the lighthouses removed. I have no objection to this course, which I realise is dictated by economy, but it is extraordinary that, since the Commonwealth Government have taken over control of lights and lighthouses, the light dues on a 1.2,000-ton vessel visiting Hobart amount to £250, compared with £25 when the lights there were under the jurisdiction of the Hobart Marine Board. If the Commonwealth Government have effected economies in expenditure on lighthouses and lights, why this great increase in light dues? This is a matter which, I think, deserves serious, consideration, because of its effect upon shipping. Thousands of tons of shipping have gone out of Australia since' the war. I think it is a well-established fact that increased port charges are having a damaging effect upon our shipping trade. I did not intend to touch upon the administration of the Navigation Act, but I suggest that the Government snould not proclaim certain sections of the Act, due to come into operation on 1st October, until a report has been furnished by the Select Committee which is now inquiring into the administration of the Navigation Act as it affects Australian trade.",93
394,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,I direct attention to the state of the Committee. formed.1,94
395,Mr SEABROOK,Unknown,"Referenc e has been made in the debate to the unsatisfactory position of the fruit-growing industry, and t suggest that, to give relief, the Government should agree to pay a bounty on the export of apples. Hitherto the apple-grower has never had one penny piece from the Government; but assistance has been given to the grower of soft fruits. If the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Austin Chapman) is anxious to help the fruit-growing industry he should treat growers of apples in the same way as those engaged in t i e meat industry in Queensland have been treated, by giving them i d . per lb. bounty, and the export of all, apples should have the same.  endeavour to insure cheaper freights.",94
396,Mr SEABROOK,Unknown,"Unde r present conditions I cannot see how freights can be: lowered. Arbitration awards and the Navigation Act are an effective barrier. The only way in which the Government can. help the industry is by the payment of a bounty. The honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Forde) had a good deal to say about sugar. put the position of the f r u it industry in its relation to sugar costs in Australia. One-half the soft f r u it produced in Tasmania is made into jam, and I remind the honourable member that in at in of jam there is over 200 per cent, more sugar cost than f r u it cost. The more we have to pay for sugar the less the fruit-grower can get for his product. - Mr Forde - The proportion of sugar in a Ib. of jam is 50 per cent.",94
397,Mr HILL,Unknown,S i x t y per cent.,94
398,Mr SEABROOK,Unknown,"I know what I am talking about. A 2-1L. t in of jam contains 50 per cent, of f r u it and 50 per cent, of sugar, but sugar costs the manufacturer 3^d. per lb., and the f r u it I d . per lb. The honourable member cannot get away from this important fact. The jam manufacturer has to pay £.30 18s. per ton for his sugar, and only I d . per lb. for his f r u it . Thus the sugar cost of a tin of jam is 200 per cent, above the cost of the f r u it . It follows, therefore, that the more the manufacturer has to pay for his sugar, the less the f r u it grower can get for his f r u it . The M in ister for Trade and Customs informed the [Quorum members of the F r u it , Council in Melbourne this week that there had been a loss of £500,000 on the F r u it Pool. The price of sugar was largely responsible for the loss.",94
399,Mr FORDE,Unknown,The honourable member is quite wrong.,94
400,Mr SEABROOK,Unknown,"I trust the Minis, ter will carry out his promise to the F r u it Council and assist the growers, because, there is no section of producers which has suffered more during the last four or five years than the apple-growers. One grower who sent twenty-five cases of apples to England received only 7d., and in another instance a returned soldier exported twenty-five cases of apples, which realized £ 5 5s. in London, but after expenses were paid he received only 1.3s. 9d. Out of that amount he had to meet the costs of orchard, materials, cases, and cover the cost of his own labour."" The account sales in connection with/this case have been submitted to the Minister. ' I could quote hundreds of instances of men who had similar experience dur1 ing the last season. The vessels carrying the f r u it to Great Britain, including those of the Commonwealth Government Line, have landed it in a very bad condition in consequence of the faulty I desire to refrigerating chambers. I trust the Government will take these facts into consideration and assist the growers in every possible way.",94
401,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"Bourke) [3.34 a.m.]. - This fiery, ferocious, old gentleman who has just resumed his seat appears to blame everything, including the price of sugar and the faulty refrigerating chambers in Commonwealth and. other ships', upon the inadequate price received for apples. What has sugar to dowith these particular items ? The honourable member sees no prospect of saving the in dustry unless cheap black labour is em-, ployed on vessels carrying his products. I understand the honourable member is a member of the Select Committee inquiring into the operations of the Navigation Act. He comes here and airs his opinions, based on information which is not in possession of other honourable members. Mr .SEABROOK - I do not.",94
402,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown, Will the honourable member for Bourke Address the Chair. - Mr ANSTEY - Certainly .,95
403,Mr SEABROOK,Unknown,I am not doing what the honourable member suggests.,95
404,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"The honourable member is quite wrong. If we had an i m partial Chairman he would rule that in terjections were disorderly, and would f ive me the right to address the ChamI er. I desire to say one or two words in connection with the Navigation Act . Various Departments are under the conthe trol of the Minister for Trade and toms (Mr Austin Chapman), one of which is the Department of Navigation. The Oommittee of which the honourable member is a member is inquiring into the freights? the operations of the Navigation Act . This matter has also been investigated by the Tariff Board, and, perhaps, it would please the honourable member for Forrest  graphs from that report. The honourable member for Forrest, and the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Seabrook), are advocating the employment of black labour,, and would like to see vessels the Peninsula and Oriental Company, f and the British-Indian Steam Navigaable tion Company carrying our produce, thus preventing our own men from earning a decent wage. The following is a paragraphgraph in the Tariff Board's report: Many bitter complaints have been made .to the Tariff Board that the workingof the NaviAustralia gation Act is acting detrimentally at .present to the best interests of Australian - industries, to Western Australia. both primary and secondary. It was stressed whilst the Government fesses to do all in its power to encourage centralization, and the peopling of our distant tralia. parts, yet it endorses the policy of the Navigation Act, which more than any other legisThat is quite true. lation discourages the settler on our coasts removed from industrial centres. It was also urged that the oversea merchants are assisted in their trade against - our own producers by the fact that our present of administering our shipping heavy freights on our own products whilst overseas goods are carried for much lower freights. Apparently departmental officers are responsible for the administration of our' shipping laws, and everything is done without reference to Parliament,  ister according to the Act .",95
405,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,I thought the honourable gentleman was complaining that they were not doing that.  thing of the kind.,95
406,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"Then the honourable member supports the action of the Board. Another paragraph reads- The Board has no hesitation in reporting . that the present Navigation Act is working very detrimentally against the best interests of the primary and secondary produoers. do not object to the Board furnishing a report if it thinks it worthwhile to submit information, but if , in its opinion, Navigation Act is operating detriCusmentally to the best interests of the country, should it not give reasons'?

Here is another .paraInquiries made by the Board showed that the cost of shipping certain goods from South .to Western Australia was greater than the cost of shipping them from Europe Again, it was frequently - stated to the Board that the freight proon butter from Queensland to other States was demuch heavier than from New Zealand to AusThat was the far position before the Navigation Act was in operation.

409,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"Yes , I am coming to that. The report goes on to sayMuch of the benefit conceded by the Tariff is lost through the additional cost in freight on Australian goods, and our primary producers aud manufacturers will not be able to - obtain the full share of the markets they are .entitled to until some other methods can be .adopted to provide a service that will not place our shippers at a disadvantage. If such action can be taken whilst preserving the present benefit to Australian seamen the Board believes that our Australian producers and manufacturers .will receive material advantage. That is all right for a general statement, but why is not Parliament furnished with the facts ? In addition to stating that the Act has had a disastrous effect, reference is made to Arbitration Court awards. Why has the Board not entered into other phases which have an important bearing on this question?  with the position very fully.",96

(Lilley) [3.47 a.m.] r The honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Eorde) has taken a considerable interest in the sugar industry, and I give him credit for the manner in which he has brought it before the people of Australia, and before this Parliament. I hope that the honourable member will use his influence in the party room,- and bring the members of his party to his way of thinking. The Labour party had an opportunity to assist the sugar industry when the Tariff Bill was before this House. The Hughes Government brought down a proposal to protect the industry through the Customs to the extent of £11 6s. Sd. per ton. Owing to the action of the Labour party that proposal was defeated.",96
430,Mr FORDE,Unknown,You know* that the growers want a renewal of the agreement ?,96
431,Mr MACKAY,Unknown,"I am not dealing with that point at the moment. I am recounting a little ancient history for the benefit of honourable members. At present the sugar-growers would prefer an extension of the embargo. They have accepted the proposed agreement, but they would' like the embargo to be for four years instead of two. If the industry had been protected by a duty of £11 6s. Sd. a ton as was proposed an embargo would not have been necessary with the world's price of sugar as it is at sent. The embargo is of very little use. I look upon it more as an insurance against loss by the Government than anything else. If the Labour party had been anxious to help the sugar-growers it had the opportunity when the Tariff was before this Parliament.",96
432,Mr FORDE,Unknown,The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) moved an amendment which provided for an agreement.,97

439,Mr MACKAY,Unknown,"The honourable memremarks ber for Capricornia might have selected a more appropriate occasion on which "" to bring this matter forward. It must be clemto him that as the agreement has been accepted by the growers and the Queensland Government, and has practically been completed, his amendment can do very little good. The honourable member has dealt with this subject previously in the House. Ho knows how difficult it is for the ton members from Queensland to get all their own way with the Government. If the Government gave way to the Queensland members it would very soon be in trouble with members from other States. preI t is impossible for the honourable member to do any good by his amendment, even if it was possible to ""carry it by a vote in this Committee. It can only create serious difficulties. The honourable member for Fremantle (Mr . Watson) delivered a most interesting and informative speech on Thursday evening. I regret that his remarks on sugar were sadly astray. He had been misinformed. I cannot think that not the honourable member went out of the southern part of Queensland in search for information about the sugar inOppodustry. He admitted that his knowComledge was gained from hearsay. The therehonorable member is a business man, and he must know perfectly well that it is impossible to find a sensible man who would attempt to borrow money at Min15 per cent, to buy land at £100 per If the honourable member had visited the districts where this land at £100 per acre was said to be, he would probably have found that ib was highly with fencing, wells, and dams, and that it had a residence upon it , . with' possibly a crop ready to harvest. I am Under such conditions £100 per acre would not have been too much. If he had gone in search of unimproved land hecould certainly have found it at less than £25 an acre. I regret that the honorcapiable member made the remarks he did about the sugar industry, because they Unforthis industry are misunderstood in these southern States. I do not believe the honourable member intended to do it injury. The honourable member for Franklin (Mr Seabrook) has also made some to which I must refer. I assure him that the people *engaged in the sugar industry have no quarrel with the fraitgrowers of Australia. The f r u it industry in Queensland have no complaints. Recently I asked in this House a series of questions of the Minister for Trade and Customs, and I find that loss than 20 per cent, of the frui t grown in Australia , is manufactured for export. I think the questions, and the replies, which I will read, answer the points raised by the honourable member for Franklin. They are as follow:1. What is the percentage of Australian grown fruits processed into jams and canned fruits for export?-Australia n fruits processed (a) into jams for export equal 1.53 per cent, of the total fruits produced; (6) nito canned fruits for export, equal .49 per cent, of the total fruits produced. 2. What are (o) the estimated quantity of added sugar contents per lb. of jam and canned fruits; and (6) the cost of such sugar?-(a ) Jam, 9.6 oz.; canned fruits, 1.6 oz.; (6) jam, 2.55d.; canned fruits, .425d. 3. Is it a fact that a rebate of import duty is granted by the British Government on all Australian jams and canned fruits containing sugar produced in the British Dominions?Yes; the rebate is one-sixth of the ordinary sugar duty, or £4 5s. 6d. per ton on the sugar contents. (The information contained in 1 and 2 is based on the average quantity of Australian fruits processed into jams and canned - fruits for export during the nine years 1912-13 to 1920-21.) It is quite apparent, therefore, that so far as the cost of the sugar content of jam is concerned, it is comparatively trifling, and certainly would not interfere in any way with the sale of jam. think the public will understand that the remarks of the honourable member for Capricornia to-night were not made with the sole object of assisting the sugar industry.",97
440,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"They were, absolutely.",98
441,Mr MACKAY,Unknown,"I believe they were made to embarrass the Government, and could not therefore benefit the sugar in dustry, otherwise I would gladly support the amendment.",98
442,Mr YATES,Unknown,"Adelaide) [4 a.m.] - I think that by this time the Government must realise the harm they are doing to the country by l i m it i ng the debate on the Estimates in the way they have done. I wish especially to deal with the regulation issued by the Minister for Trade and Customs imposing restrictions on the exportation of the fauna of Australia. I am inclined to think that the Department is not full y seized of the harm which this - regulation is doing. If the M in ister will go into the matter further he will realise this. In proof of my statement. I propose to read some correspondence which passed between myself and the Minister on this matter. the 29 th March there was published in the Commonwealth Gazette, No. 23, a regulation prohibiting the exportation of certain birds. It was noted by b i r d dealers in South Australia, and I was approached by them. They are not very numerous, because as honourable members are aware, their's is not a very flourishing business. The regulation imposes very great hardship upon those engaged in that business. I have not very much knowledge of the . birds of Australia, .but I believe that the restrictions placed upon their export are more drastic than they need be. I received a letter from a bird dealer in ' Adelaide on the subject, and I interviewed the inspector of game and fisheries in South Australia. I want to make it clear to the Minister that the exportation of game and birds from South Australia is regulated by the Game and Fisheries Act of that State. I have not only seen the inspectorof game and fisheries, but have had conversations with a son of the curator of the Adelaide Zoological Gardens. This gentleman is honorary zoologist to the London Zoological Museum, and has gone I to the Old Country. The Minister will realise from the information I am in a position to give that the opposition to the regulation is not merely a factious opposition. ""When the regulation was promulgated, the bird dealer to whom I refer wrote to me, and I forwarded extracts from his letter to the Minister in the following terms:12th June, 1923. Hon. Austin Chapman, M.H.R., Minister for Customs. Dear Sir, I desire to bring under your notice what is urged to be an injustice entailed upon the dealers in birds, &c., by the Proclamation No. 75, published in the Commonwealth Gazette, No. 23, of 29th March '.ast, having relation to the export of birds. In doing so it would, perhaps, be best for me to quote you a letter I have received on the subject from one of the largest exporters of birds in South Australia:"" This proclamation prohibits the export of a large number of birds on the unprotected list in this State, which we in the past have been able to export. "" AH birds and animals exported by me are forwarded under permit issued by the Minister of Industry. The Chief Inspector of Fisheries and Game also personally inspects all birds and accommodation provided for them at the time of shipment, and his approval, is necessary before they ore allowed to leave. "" I have on hand at present £200 worth of On fresh material for making cages for export trade, and nearly £100 worth of new, thoroughly, clean, and disinfected boxes ready for next season's shipment. "" On all my shipments I accompany the birds to the place of destination, and an attendant is also engaged. A limited number only are put iuto each cage, and are well looked after, the mortality amongst them being practically nil. I also import and accompany birds from South Africa and other places under the same conditions. Mr Seth Smith, of the London Zoo, was greatly impressed with the conditions under which my birds travel and the health in which they are, landed. The London press has also favourably commented on all of my shipments. "" I have orders MI hand now for the shipment of birds in the coming season for the London Zoo, and if I cannot export them my loss will be a severe one. I trust that, in view of the above facts, you will place this matter before the Minister on my behalf,- pointing out to him how harshly this proclamation will affect genuine dealers desiring to carry on a botiu fide business in this direction, and request that I be allowed to continue my shipments of birds under permit and inspection as in the past. I am dependent on this business for my living, and if the proclamation is adhered to, my living wili be taken away and my trade ruined. "" Might I also point out that thousands upon thousands of ducks and quail are shot and killed annually in Australia, and yet the proclamation will not allow live birds to be exported. Many of the birds covered by the proclamation have been proved to be terribly destructive on farms, orchards, &c."" I have also been interviewed by others interested in the export of animals and birds, and the consensus of opinion is that the objected to proclamation will do untold harm. The stationinaster at Ivimba, on the west coast of South Australia, avers:- "" There arc thousands of Ring Neck Parrots (Pt. Lincoln); they do great damage to the wheat in stacks and on trucks, boring boles, in the bags, and in consequence a lot of wheat is lost between here - and Pt. Lincoln."" Mr Minchin, who is proceeding to London Jia Honorary Curator to the London Zoological Gardens, states :- "" My experience is that the Blue Mountain and Pt. Lincoln Ring Neck Parrot infest the whole of the west coast, and docs great damage to the fruit crops, and is a groat trouble to the new settlers in those areas. The Chief Inspector of Fisheries and Game in Melbourne informed me that when he was here in April last, he was surprised to find how numerous and destructive the Pt. Lincoln parrots w*re on fruit, &c, also the Blue Mountain parrot on fruit. As an example, at the Government Forest all fruit is bagged on the trees to protect it. Many farmers said they were partially protected, and asked me to let the authorities know that they rivalled the - Ttogella in destruotiveness."" He also veferred me to letters sent by Mr L. R. Scainniell to Mr. Rodgers, late Minister for Customs, on the 17th October, 1922, and Mr A. G. Rymill on the 27th September, 1922. I would esteem it a favour if you would have these letters brought before you, and give consideration to the matters contained herein.",98
443,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Are those parrots the only birds that are being exported by the dealer to whom the honourable member refers?.,99
444,Mr YATES,Unknown,"Wo ; he exports all kinds of birds, but none the export of which is forbidden by the Game and Fisheries Act of South Australia. Messrs. Rymill and Scamm°n a -.* 'sid y l.iituential men in th« .:i 'y - i They are interest?-u M.>a'v "" the f r u it industry,, and ; they co*i-.j"".um that these birds are a thorough pest. The Minister for Trade and Customs should have known that. He replied to my letter to the effect that he was having inquiries made into the matter. It was an urgent matter, so far as the bird dealer was concerned, because trapping takes place in August, September, and early in October, as that is the best time for shipments to be made to the Old Country. A week or so ago I brought a letter from the bird dealer and a covering letter from the inspector of game and fisheries to the Minister, and I received the following reply from him, dated 2nd August:I am in receipt of your letter of the 13th inst., forwarding extracts from eommiinicfttions received by you. Adverting to your letter of 12th June, l beg to forward herewith for your information list showing names of gentlemen who have been appointed to the Victorian advisory committee to assist this Department in' oonnexion with applications which may be received for permits to export Australian birds and animals. Action is being token for the appointment of similar committees in other States. With regard to future applications which may be received for permits to export birds and animals which are on the prohibited list, fcliia Department will be guided by advice from the State Advisory Committees. It has been decided that the exportation of such birds and' animals for purely commercial purposes will not be permitted. That is to say, the request was turned down, apparently on the advice of the' Advisory Committee for - Victoria. The - members of that Committee are the following : - Representin g the ""University and learned societies, Sir Baldwin Spencer; deputy, Professor Agar; Zoological and Acclimatization Society, Dr Colin Mackenzie; deputy. Mr A . Currie; Museum, Mr J . Kershaw; deputy, Mr . G. Hill ; Field Naturalists and Allied Bodies, Mr F . Barnard; deputy, Mr . Menzies; the Ornithologists .Union, Dr. J. A . Leech; deputy, Mr A . J . Cameron; National Parks Committee, Mr W . F . Gates; deputy, Mr Croll; Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, Mr. Latham; deputy, Dr G. Horne. I suggest that the majority of the organizations represented on the Advisory Board in Victoria, with the exception of.. Ihe Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, which justifies its existence, are really associations, of enthusiasts who quite miss the practical side of. the question. Birds exported from Adelaide are inspected on the boat, and their cages examined. The bird dealer who has communicated with me does not require to have his birds counted in London. He can sell at sight, because the mortality amongst the birds he exports is practically nil. There have been shipments - of birds from other States which, when they arrived at Adelaide, have shown great neglect in the accommodation provided for the birds. Some persons export birds by giving the butcher or the cook on board a boat a few pounds to look after them on the voyage, and they are sold for' what they 'will fetch on arrival in the Old Country. That kind of thing should be prevented. I have .been informed that the Game aud Fisheries Department in South Australia see that all necessary care is - taken in the export of birds. The Advisory Committee in Victoria, can do no more in this matter than the Inspector of Game and Fisheries is doing in Adelaide. I ask the Minister for Trade and Customs to agree to accept the recommendations of the South Australian inspector. Mr R. COOK - Hav e you the white cockatoo in South Australia ? It is a very great pest.",99
445,Mr YATES,Unknown,"I suppose the honourable member refers to the sulphur crested cockatoo. That bird is mentioned in the correspondence, and galahs are also referred to. I .should like the Minister v to look further into this matter. must realise that his regulation flies in the face of the authorities in South Australia,, and is ruining the business of at least. one man there.",100
446,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,"Kooyong) [4.17 a.m.J. - The ' honourable member for Adelaide has raised an important question. It is desired to prevent cruelty in the export of birds and animals, because other animals than birds are. covered by the regulation. The State authorities have no power to control the export of anything, but in most States make provision for the protection of birds and other animals against cruelty. It may be, as the honourable member for Adelaide has said, that conditions are all that could be desired in South Australia, but the matter has to be looked at generally. Recent experience has shown that further precautions than those adopted in at least some States are required, and there is, therefore, good i ground for Commonwealth interference in the matter. Another aspect of the subject is that Australia is being denuded of certain rare birds and animals. Not long ago four birds were seen in New South Wales not far from Sydney, which had not been seen in the vicinity for about twenty years. Their discovery was reported in one of the bird journals. No more was heard of them until it was known that two birds of the species had appeared in New York. Surely that kind of thing shows the need for rigid control. Some of our animals are very rare,- and scientists say that some may hold secrets which may be of the very greatest value to humanity. One name mentioned by the honourable member for Adelaide was that of Dr Colin Mackenzie, who has conducted extensive researches relating to Australian animals. He is my authority for the statement that a great contribution, may be made to science and human well-being by a proper study of Australian animals. Some of these auimals are being exported, and their export should be rigidly controlled. I agree with the honourable member for Adelaide that birds which are pests may be freely exported. It has been suggested that a disinterested committee should be appointed, which would not look at the subject from only one point, of view. Mr COOK"" - As the birds find animals He are being, destroyed, they might as well be exported ",100
447,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,"I understand that it is proposed to form committees in other States so that f u ll local information will be obtainable. I agree that birds and animals that are a pest in this country may well be exported under humane conditions. I desire to say only a few words about sugar. During the war the Commonwealth had power to fix prices, but that power no longer exists. It appears to be assumed that the Commonwealth has power to arrange for the purchase of sugar, a.nd'to control the retail prices at which it may be sold. The Commonwealth has no power to enter into agreements in time of peace, the purpose of which,is to control the wholesale or retail price of any article. It may impose a Cus- toms duty or an Excise duty, or grant a bounty, but otherwise it can exercise no control. In view of the decision of the High Court in the recent wool tops case, any persons relying upon the supposition that the Commonwealth has power to make an agreement to control sugar, .and to regulate its sale at certain prices, may tind that they are making a very serious mistake. Mr A . GREEN (Kalgoorlie) [4.22 a.m.] - During the long recess I travelled 4,000 miles in my electorate collecting information regarding the requirements of my constituents. intended to speak* at length upon the need for more lighthouses on the Western Australian coast, but I shall not attempt to deal with the subject in the seven minutes remaining before the guillotine will operate. There is a stretch of 625 miles of Western. Australian coast, from Cape Leveque to K in g Sound, without a light, and I ask Minister to contrast that with the manner in which the Dutch East Indies are lighted. There is no other coast in the world so badly lighted as the north-west coast of this continent I protest against the Government curtailing the time available for the discussion of the Estimates to such an extent that, although I have travelled 8,000 miles to gather information, I am unable to bring important matters before the Committee. When I spoke i u the Budget debate I intended to deal with the matter of lighthouses, but as my notes were rather lengthy, the Treasurer suggested that I should defer my remarks, and promised that I should get an opportunity later. This is the opportunity - seve n minutes to deal with highly important and technical subjects. The Government, deserve the most severe condemnation for forcing the Estimates through the Committee without allowing an opportunity for my constituents to have their views properly represented.",100
448,Mr OKEEFE,Unknown,"Denison) [4.25 a.m.]. - I join in the protest made by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr A . Green). There are at least half-a-dozen items ' in this Department concerning which I would have sought information from the Minister had an opportunity been afforded. But what chance have I to deal with these matters when I know that the guillotine w i ll operate in a few minutes? j-'he procedure adopted by the Government is a damnable outrage on the rights of the people. I do not think it will be repeated, because the people are not fools or blind, and they will not stand this sort of thing more than once. The Government, and the party behind it who are responsible for taking away the rights of the people's representatives, will sooner or later "" get it in, the neck.""",101
449,Mr COOK,Unknown,"The honourable member spoke for an hour and a half on the iiudget. Mr O ' KEEFE - I did not; but does I had the honourable member suggest that an hour and a half is too long for a membeif to speak in a session that has extended over ten weeks? If I had occupied the full time which the Standing Orders' allow me, what right would the honourable member have to complain ? Do the people who send us here expect us to have our right of speech taken fro m us the because the Leader of the Government, m pursuance of his intention to represent Australia at the Imperial Conference, fails in his duty to the people of the Cornwealth ? If there is no other man on the Ministerial side strong enough to lead L Parliament during his absence, if the right honourable gentleman does not trust nis Ministerial colleagues, and, therefore, thinks it necessary that Parliament shall be closed before he departs, he should have convened Parliament at least eight or ten weeks earlier. During this short session, I have exercised my right of speech only in regard to subjects which I knew were of special importanceto the people. What chance have I of getting the information that I had intended to seek' in behalf of my constituents? I wanted particularly to question the M in ister regarding a matter that vitally affects the people who sent me here, and who, though small in number, have rights under the Constitution.",101

The present Adelaide Post Office had to be enlarged twenty or thirty years ago. At one the police station was next to the post office. The police station was removed and the post-office extended. It is impossible to tell on the frontage of the building where the extension began, so well did the architects builders of that day do their work. it will Later the Commonwealth Government decided to erect a telephone exchange on the Franklin-street frontage. The building was constructed of cut stone. It is to be pulled down now and a concrete fat-faced building put in its place. Our architect-in-chief, Mr Murdoch, seems to be a troglodyte. That is the only opinion I can form after reading the evidence he gave to the Committee. ,",104

Maloney) has given notice of a motion to the effect thab in future competitive designs for all public buildings shall be invited from. qualified architects. years ago I was instrumental in having a similar motion carried in the South Australian Parliament. It has not been acted upon, because no big public buildings have since been constnicted. Adelaide Post Office additions and the building alongside the Adelaide Office will be no credit to this Government and no adornment to Adelaide. my opinion it will be a disgrace to the Commonwealth. Mr Murdoch says that the craft of the stone-cutter is dying out. It must die out if the men who do this class of work cannot find employment. Are the buildings to be erected at Canberra to be of flat-faced reinforced concrete 1",104
463,Mr JACKSON,Unknown,The power-house Canberra is a very fine example of architecture.,105
464,Mr YATES,Unknown,"That is far more, than can be said of the new public buildings in course of erection in Adelaide. I in vite honourable members to examine the plans of the additions to the Adelaide Post Office. The Post Office building which, this Government took over from the State of South Australia-lik e this building in which we are sitting-wa s erected when the country was not half as wealthy as it now is and when it had not half its present population. If it is proposed to build reinforced concrete buildings at Canberra, my advice is that we .do not go to Canberra. The Commonwealth Government-and the Governments"" of all the States-la g far behind the Australian Governments of ' other days in the construction of public buildings. The House of Parliament in Adelaide-the Marble Hall-is a halffinished job, and if we expect to see it completed, we shall be like the man in the Northern Territory who went grey, and then bald, and afterwards died, while waiting to see an improvement that he desired. This Parliament House is not yet completed. Some time ago I made a proposition that the Commonwealth Government should induce the State Government to allow it to complete the building of the South Australian House of. Parliament, and make provision in it for housing the Commonwealth public services in Adelaide. It was too big a. pro-. position for the Government. A suggestion was made that another story should Some be put on the Adelaide Post Office in a style of architecture which would conform, with that already there. We were told that the tower of the Post Office would have to be pulled down before an The extra story could be added. I invite the members of the Public Works Committee Post to look at our Bourke-street Post Office. It has a tower and also three stories. It In was a mere quibble to say that an extra story could not be put on the Adelaide Post Office. When this Governmentadopted the policy of erecting flat-faced concrete buildings it sounded the deathknell for stone-cutters. We should reconsider that policy. . It is highly desirable that Governments should set an example to private builders and investors by constructing well-built cut-stone buildings at for public purposes. We are told that reinforced concrete buildings are equal in appearance and durability to cut stone buildings. They may be equal in durability, but no one can say truth full y that they are equal in appearance. Every time. I walk down K in g William-street in Adelaide-whic h is one of the finest thoroughfares in the world- I am forced to compare the efforts of our pioneer builders with the efforts of our builders of today, and the comparison is to the discredit of the modern workers.",105
465,Mr JACKSON,Unknown,The modern idea is to erect buildings in 'concrete and to face them with cut stone.,105
466,Mr YATES,Unknown,That is not the modem idea. If it were I would not have to complain.,105
467,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,The Commonwealth Bank in Sydney is a case in point.,105
468,Mr YATES,Unknown,"But that is in Sydney, and it shows what a lovely pull Sydney'has. I have seen the plans of the alterations of the Sydney Post Office, and they are to be carried out in conformity with the original design of the building. In Adelaide, when the blank wall of the post office is erected, space on it can be sold for advertisements. I want to prevent a recurrence of this kin d of thing. The Register office in Adelaide is a most modern building and reflects credit upon those who are responsible for it , but most of the buildings of big business firms are constructed of brick. Two of the most modem and handsome public buildthis ings in Adelaide were conceived by Labour Government. On the North Terrace, which is oue of the finest avenues in South Australia, alongside the versity buildings, there is the public ing room and museum. There are there two of the finest structures in the State, and between them there is the museum, which is a flat brick building. On other side there is a wing, which is replica of the main building. That was put up by a Labour Premier. Honourable members when they go to Adelaide should look at the educational block of buildings, and when they do so, should take their one Commonwealth horse. hats off to the late Tom Price, who responsible for these buildings, and had right ideas as to the public buildings which should be erected. I raise protest against the Commonwealth vernment erecting buildings outside city of Sydney that are not a credit to them. I wish to make a reference to the Augusta to Oodnadatta railway. In the only in name. Treasurer's Budget speech the statement is made that a total of £215,000 is to be . expended on rolling-stock and other works for the Port Augusta to Oodnadatta railway. I believe that it is intended to practically refit that railway with new rolling-stock.",105
469,Mr STEWART,Unknown,That is so.,106
470,Mr YATES,Unknown,"I remind the Minister that this railway is built on a 3-ft. 6-in. gauge. It links up with other South Australian railways, and the Government - propose to spend £218,000 on new rollingDepartment stock for it.",106
471,Mr JACKSON,Unknown,So as to be ready for the Alice Springs railway.,106
472,Mr YATES,Unknown,"We have twenty enpay gines at Port Augusta that are not being made any use of.

Si in. if the Government sincere about the conversion of our ways to the standard gauge ? If that were done the twenty locomotives I have ferred to could be used. They represent nearly as much money as the Government propose to spend on new rolling-stock for line. If it is the intention of the a Government to build the Oodnadatta to Alice Springs railway they should start the work now. I see that the Premier of .UniSouth Australia is talking of widening readthe gauges of railways south of Port Augusta to the 5-ft. 3-in. gauge. This will be in direct opposition to the expressed will of the people of the Comthe monwealth. It will mean added expense, a ' more loan money, and more taxation. We - are told that we should reduce taxation, but before we can do so, we must put our house in order.

474,Mr JACKSON,Unknown,"Bass) [5.25 a.m.] - I should like to direct the attention of the Minister to the work of his Department in the State of Tasmania. Work for the Department in that State is carried out under the State Works Department, and it seems impossible to get anything done without a very great deal of delay. I have great trouble in inducing the State' to send inspectors in , <?onnexion with Commonwealth works. The officials appear to be too busy with State matters to give proper attention to Commonwealth business. As the Government the State for the services of its officials, it should not involve greater expense for to establish a branch of the Commonwealth Department of Works and RailWhat ways in Tasmania. A' Commonwealth officer might be located in a central posit Launceston, for instance-sinc e are four-fifths of the postal buildings are in railthe northern part of the island. There would be no necessity for a big staff; a recompetent inspector, and perhaps one clerk could do all the work that is to be clone. I ask the Minister to give this suggestion his very serious consideration, because the present arrangement is most unsatisfactory.",106
475,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,"Yarra) [5.27 a.m.] This is a very suitable hour of the morning for the protest I am about to make against the parsimony of the Government at present in office. Their treatment of some of the most hard working employees in its service is only what one would expect from. a miserable sweater. I refer to the office-cleaners in the employ of the Commonwealth. Those, in this city are paid on a basis calculated on the determination of a Victorian Wages Board, which fixes £ 3 2s. 4d. for a week of forty-four hours. That works out at Is. 5d. per hour. Government do not employ these officecleaners for forty-four hours per week. They employ them for only twenty-four hours a week, and pay them the miserable wage of Is. 5d. per hour or 34s. per week.",107
476,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,Is this work their only occupation?,107
477,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,"It is. They have no opportunity to engage in any other occupation. Most of them are widows who have lost their breadwinners. They leave home about 5 o'clock in the morning to do office cleaning, and return to their homes to get the.ir children ready for school. They return again in the afternoon after office hours. get twenty-four hours' work week, and are paid at the rate of Is. 5d. per hour. Under the determination of the Victorian Wages Board, if they were employed for only twenty-two hours per week, they would have to be paid at the rate of Is. l i d . per hour. In order to avoid the necessity of paying these people casual rates, the Government employs them for two hours over the minimum, and at the rate of Is. 5d. per hour. It should not require any stressing of the matter to convince the Minister that this is not fair treatment for these women. There are not many of those women, and the sum that would be involved in the suggested increase would not be great. The Government should be a little more just to those who are probably the lowest paid workers in its employ.",107
478,Mr MANN,Unknown,Hav e they not to supply some of the cleaning material they use?,107
479,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,Possibly; but no complaint on that score has been made to me. No one will deny that these women are badly paid. Representations have been made by their union.,107
480,Mr STEWART,Unknown,I have no recollection of any such representations since I have been in office.,107
481,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,"I understand that representation's have been made to the Department, and that the complainants have received no satisfaction. I do not like mentioning these grievances in Parliament, if tliey can be rectified in any other way, but I have been told that the cleaners could get no redress from the DeThe partment. There are plenty of private employers who' would not take such a paltry advantage of their employees as the Government are taking of the women office-cleaners.",107
482,Mr R GREEN,Unknown,"Richmond) [5.32 a.m.] - I congratulate the Minister for Works upon the effort he has made in the House and in his Department to have, this Parliament removed to Canberra as soon as possible. Even before a motion had been carried in the House, at the instance of the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony), the Minister had given proof of his bona fide intention to do what lay in his power to have the Constitutional provision regarding the They Federal Capital honored. This House per has now definitely resolved that the Goveirnor-General shall be asked to convene the next Parliament at Canberra. I am sorry that there is not on the Estimates-a small amount for the survey, or some other preliminary work, in connection with the proposed railway between Kyogle and Brisbane. This line has been discussed between Commonwealth and State Ministers as part of the scheme for the unification of gauges. Recently the Minister for Works, whom I commend for endeavouring, by travel, to learn first-hand Australia's requirements, made a trip through Southern Queensland and the Kyogle district, covering a portion of the proposed route. He saw some of the magnificent country that a railway would open up, and the terrible isolation of the settlers there, and he expressed surprise that such a fine territory should, be absolutely undeveloped. He was already strongly predisposed towards the line, and his trip influenced him further in its favour. The Treasurer (Dr Earie Page) and the Postmaster-Genera] (Mr Gibson), who accompanied him, were equally favourably impressed. I am disappointed, therefore, that there is not a sum on the Estimates to indicate that the construction of the line is to be proceeded with. I know that the Minister for Works is quite in earnest in his advocacy of the railway, but the five State Governments of the mainland are concerned in the question of cost. The Kyogle-Brisbane line is not to be merely a district utility; it is to be portion of a greatscheme affecting the whole Commonwealth in respect of defence and transcontinental communication. The States of New South Wales and Queensland have already expressed their approval of the line, but I should like to know more concerning the attitude of other States, particularly South Australia, the . Premier of which, Sir Henry Barwell, appears to be- a most benighted individual, with a very limited conception of the national interests. I quite ' understand that the absence of any reference to the Hay-Port Augusta line is due to the difference of opinion amongst the State Premiers, again headed by Sir Henry Barwell. The Minister for Works and Railways was mainly responsible for the main roads development scheme, which was recently approved by the House. I congratulate him upon that proposal, because the expenditure involved will be of inestimable benefit to country districts. Roads, particularly those in the country, play a peculiar part in our national life. They are free to all. Whereas one may travel by trains only at such times as are suitable to the general community or the Department, the road is Open to anybody at any time. And all may travel on it as they please-in Rolls-Royce motor car, on horse, on a bicycle, or on foot. Roads make travel more convenient, and transport' easier and more rapid. They are necessary, not only as great highways between cities, but also as the arteries of industry in the country, carrying produce from outlying hamlets to the towns and goods from the town shops to the settlers. A good road means less freighting, a saving of time, and an increase of comfort. Mr It. Green. Anything that will add to the comfort and prosperity of the people should be strongly supported by honourable members, and roads should be recognised as of great assistance to pioneers in the back-blocks, who are fighting so hard to make this country the success it should be. As a general rule, the city gets all the plums in the form of expenditure, but the grant for new roads is an exception. The roads are not to be built in the cities, but are to be developmental in character, and to link up great country districts. I again congratulate the Minister for Works and Railways on the service he is rendering the Commonwealth. Mr C. RILEY (Cook) [5.45 a.m.] I direct the attention of the Minister for Works and Railways to the necessity of providing adequate accommodation for workmen engaged at the Federal Capital site. During the last two months the weather has been anything but pleasant, and a number of cases of influenza has been reported. Most of the men are housed in old military huts or .canvas .tents, and therefore their living , conditions are anything but satisfactory. If we are in earnest in connection with the construction of Parliament House, the hostel, and other public buildings, it will be necessary to insure an adequate supply of skilled labour. To do this it is essential that suitable accommodation should, be available, not only for the workmen, but also - for their wives and children. . The contractor for the hostel has made the suggestion that suitable' temporary weatherboard dwellings of three or four rooms could be erected quite handy to where building operations were being carried out for about £180 each. These would serve the workmen during the period of a capital construction, and they could afterwards be removed. If this suggestion were adopted, the Government would not be embarrassed in their building operations by a scarcity of suitable* labour. I know that scores of expert tradesmen, bricklayers, carpenters, and other artisans would be prepared to go to Canberra and take up work there if they could depend upon having accommodation for their wives and children. This proposal is a practical suggestion, and well worthy of the Minister's earnest attention. The honourable mernber for Yarra- (Mr . Scullin) mentioned that the women cleaners in the employ of the AVorks and Railways and Postmaster-General's Departments were not receiving fair treatment. Women employees in Commonwealth Departments who are widows, and have children, should receive the same consideration as male employees with children dependent upon them, and receive the benefit of child endowment. . In the Governor General's establish-, ment, on page 271, there appears an iteni - £ 4 0 0 for telephones at, I presume, the Melbourne and Sydney Government Houses. There seems to be something wrong. Is it that the servants' rooms, the garage, and outhouses are connected by telephones ? If the pruning, knife is to be applied to employees in the Public Service, we should also insist upon proper economy being observed in the Governor General's establishments. The sum could very well .be cut in half. The Governor General is paid £10,000 per year, and he should be expected to pay his own telephone bills. Honourable members are expected to have telephone connection from their residences, and to pay the ground rental and for all originating calls. It is not fair that the taxpayer should be saddled with this huge amount in respect of the Governor General's telephone services. There is also an item for china and glass at the Governor General's establishments. This, too, is quite unnecessary. If , through any. carelessness, breakages occur in the Governor General's household, the taxpayer should not be called upon to replace the broken articles. Another item, is £100 for fittings and furniture. Last year the expenditure under this heading was £ 1 9 6 , making the total for the two years just under £ 3 0 0 . We are entitled to some explanation from the i Minister. Does this expenditure represent the removal of fittings or cupboards to suit the likes or dislikes of some of the Governor General's household? One other item, £2,550, is for non-recurring works at Melbourne and Sydney Government Houses. What' does this mean ? explanation should be given. W it h regard to the Federal members' room at the Commonwealth Offices, Sydindeed, ney, I desire to bring under the notice the Minister the case of the attendant, and to make ap appeal on his behalf. This officer is most discreet and polite to the numerous callers seeking interviews with honourable members, and is, of very great assistance to the twenty-eight members and six senators from New South Wales. He is a returned soldier, and I know that his salary is inadequate. I trust that the Minister will take steps to have this officer's position re-classified, and see what he can do to pay adequately an officer doing such good work.",107
483,Mr LISTER,Unknown,"Corio) [5.53 a.m.] - I desire to direct attention to the apportionment of the money which the Government has granted for road construction. I may mention, by way of explanation, that when the Minister for Defence (Mr . Bowden) visited Queenscliff a month or two ago he was taken over a road which connects Swan Island and' the fort, to see for himself the damage that has been done by the very heavy traffic of the Defence Department. He was so impressed by what he saw that he felt that something should be done by the Government to help keep the road in a good state of re-pair. The borough is in an unfortunate position. It is very small in area, and the rateable properties are so limited that it is obliged to appeal to the Government for assistance in the maintenance of this road which, as I have said, is used almost exclusively by the Defence Department. The same may be said of another road in another shire of my electorate, namely, the road from the Laverton Railway Station to the Point Cook Flying School. This is also used almost exclusively by the Defence Department, and up to the present the Government have contributed nothing towards its upkeep. I understand that in connection with, the Queenscliff road the Government have previously given a grant, but I am informed by a ' councillor of the Werribee Shire that there has been no grant towards the maintenance of the Laverton-Point Cook"" road. To make the position worse, there is, along the latter road, a considerable area of land owned by the Federal and State Some Governments, and, of course, it is not ' revenue-producing. Honourable members will understand from what I have said that the shire is very heavily handicapped particularly as the major portion of of its revenue is swallowed up in the heavy :cost of - contributing to the (Country Roads Board .towards the .maintenance of a section of the .main road 'between Melbourne ami Geelong, one of the - finest roads dn Victoria. I hope the Minister will ssee that some portion of the money voted by this - Parliament 'for Toad construction in ""Victoria is allocated to the roads 3 ""have mentioned. Mr A. 'GREEN (Kalgoorfej) £6.0 ,a.m.] - I .desire to ideal with ithe question raised by the honourable member for Grey (Mr Lacey), namely, the accommodation on the East-West 'transcontinental railway, but before doing - so I should - like to .pay a - tribute to the ter *for Works and Railways (Mr. Stewart.) for having made it his business, almost immediately after his accession to Ministerial office, to travel over ""the line - and 'become personally ^acquainted with it . I ;also appreciate 'his energy in trying 'tt> push f orward the work of housing the men 'employed <on tihe line. Overseas ipassengers landing at '-Frem-antle, - and .travelling >over ""the transAustra&Ian line to 'the eastern States, ""naturally form a very - bad impression, particularly 'during the 'hot weather, from what they see of 'the 'living conditions 'along tihe .route. Being unaccustomed to the Australian 'clirnate they would not 'be favourably .impressed with the little huts provided by the Commonwealth Government for their railway employees. However, there has been an improvement since Ithe present Minister assumed olice., and although consideration has been shown to the single men 'there is stall room 'for .further improvement. The honourable member'.for Grey :(Mr Lacey) referred to the houses at Raw'Iinua, which are -.a big improvement on those constructed at various other points. We have been informed that the cottages cost the ""Department £450 each to construct, and that the rental of JJa. fid. per week is to cover the interest at 6 per cent, on .the capital cost, and water and ' sanitary charges. Considering .the type of .the houses, similar - acGomrriiodati'on could be 'obtained in Melbourne or .suburbs for very tmnch less. Considering the - tirOTmstanoes in which these people have to live, particularly the married couples, it - would %e good policy on the part of the 'Government to allow .tbem to occupy the 'cottages rent free. The employees are naturally 'dissatisfied with the present conditions, and I trust that, at an early date, a .marked improvement will be made. I am indebted to the Minister for advising me that this would be 'a .good opportunity to deal with the question of lighthouses. During my trip to Kimberley a few weeks ago, I wasistruck with the absence of lighthouses along the north-west tcoast of Western .Australia. JErom. Cape Leveque, .which is the western point on Kings Sound, upon which Derby stands, to Port Darwin, which is a distance of '625 miles, there is not a single Minis- lighthouse. Apart Jrom the Australian Bight, where the traffic in the immediate vicinity of .the shore is .very small, the distance I .have mentioned is perhaps the longest on which .there .are no lighthouses. The risks are indeed great. I ask ionorable .members to examine the plan before me, .and they will see that this particular portion of the coast of Australia is .heavily indented. In the {pilot book of the Australian coast, which is the .master mariner's guide, it is stated that this portion of the coast is the most indented .of - any of our littoral. Along that coast, with the exception perhaps of the Bay of Pundy, the highest tides in the world prevail, .and .©r.dina-ry spring lides of .2.8 feet /rush - along the coast and create & current,, in places, equal to 10 knots an hour. Some 1 of the steamers trading along that portion of the coast 'do imt average 10 knots, and it will 'therefore be seen that if vessels ;are in the vicinity of theicoast their danger is very great owing to the presence of numerous islands. The number of 'shipwrecks has not 'been large because the trade on that portion of the coast is comparatively small, and the skilled master mariners in charge of the vessels exercise great caution. I have been in conversation with some of these men, who have made certain recommendations as to where lighthouses should be placed, which I shall now submit to the Minister. The lighthouses on the whole of the Western Australian coast number only nineteen, whilst the number on other parts of the Australian 'coast 'is over 100. As the Western Australian coast is 'etraal to one-third of our whole coast line, - it will be seen that ""the lighting; is altogether inadequate^. It may be - said that, because vessels, pass, along, that coast, only occasionally,, lighthouses are not required,, but tha need, is all the greater, because on the well-lighted' portions of the coast the course is well known.",109
484,Mr MANN,Unknown,"Are . there, onlynineteen lights apart, from the leading lights, into the. harbors?",111
485,Mr A GREEN,Unknown,"Yes- . There are-only tfwo», ships a monthtoPortDarwin, but the Government have provided ten lights between Cape Don and PtortDai-win, which is a very short distance, while on the ©Cher stretch of 625-* mileswhich I have mentioned there is not one.

At that. De Rougement collapsed. A light, is necessary at. La Crosse. Island, where, thera is considerable shipping at this time, of the year,, and vessel's,, including those, of the; Ccwnmonr wealth Government Line, are. in danger if they arrive at night, as there is a. 10-knot current. mariners, have said that, even when their vessels are anchored, swirl of the. tide is alarming, and the greatest precaution has to be taken to prevent dragging. If a light; were stationed at that point, they would be able to know their bearings. I do not profess to possess any nautical knowledge, but I have travelled up and' down the.coast, occasionally formany years. There is a. 2'1-ft. rise and fall at the. mouth of Cambridge Gulf, uponwhich Wyndham issituated. A lighthouse should also be built, afc TroughtonIsland, another at Low Rock-probably a gas= buoy would dothere-and one at CbraeiUe Island. That would enable boats to. gothrough the Peneton Pass, 1 Tiroughton Pass, andmakei t unnecessary for vessel's going from Wyndham to Derby to go out past the HoMhura Bank, thus saving27 miles-. Ships, working up tihe: north-west coast have to. proceed with great caution at night owing to, the. strong currents-.. The* next suggested sites; are on. each side of what. is. known as. the Medai Pass, going intoDerby,,, one each on. The: Twins Island and. Hunter Island: There is a hightide andi a. 10-knot rip through the Medai and Escape Passes-, through, which . I hawe. been when there 1 has been a, wall of water 5 or 6 feet,high. At present, boats coming ta Derby at night must anchor outside King Sound!, but if' there: were, lights, at the islands; I have mentioned,, they could proceedto port, instead, of losing probably/ twelve hours, waiting foe day/light, which involves a cost, of £59:. The tides at Ring'sSound, areas bad asat any place Known to man-. There, is a portion of King's Sound which has long been known as' the "" grave-yard."" The divers, for pearlshell-like , all men. who work for therecoweny of preciousgems>frequently take, great risks,, and numbers of them have lost their lives by having had their air-line cut, A number* of deaths have occurred in the. last few years. A light is required at the East Lacepedu Group, on theroute, to Broome-. If a light, were establishedthere it. would' enable shipsto take the inside channel at night, and save thirty-sixmilesof the 'journey, by enabling them to. make.

Atpresent, no light is; to be> seen un-ttil shipsget right round the the point of the island. Several' ships have been wrecked on that coast.. It. would be impossible few an outsider to, get, alongthe north-west coast, successfully-, even with charts'. Only a master mariner, who knows: the. coast, can travel; insafety. The cost of installing theselightswould not be, very great. I understand that the Governor Musgrave, which attends the lighthouses once in six months., will not attempt this, coast at certain periods. The. Government, could, install lightsthat would not need attendants. The Governor Musgrave makes 1 periodical visits to theautomatic, lights already established, and Keepsthemin order. The lightss installed iin what is known, as; Mary Ann-. Passageare ineffective. The light on the north side is» at Sandy Island, and on the south side at Airlie. Island, but a mile of the; channel half way between the lights is obscuredas the lights are out or range. A gas buoy should be placed at Sandy near Large Island. It would be visible for 10 miles, and it would cost very little. No white man cares to go to certain parts of the coast in this locality, between Derby and Wyndham. country is in the possession of well-fed and fierce Australian blacks. At different times fifty or sixty men have landed on the rocks from pearling luggers which have been wrecked. They were daring men, but few of them have been heard of after the landing. The writer of the pilot book gives some particulars about the natives in these districts. On page 154 of the book, referring to the natives near Cape Londonderry, he says The reports of the treacherous character of the natives should be borne in mind. Of Napier Broome Bay, he says-;The natives on the shores of Napier Broome Bay, and also on Eclipse and adjacent islands, were hostile at the time of survey. That was in 1884. No missionaries have been near since then to teach them the white man's idea of civilization. W it h respect to Bougaiueville Island the book states:The country is inhabited by a suspicious of aborigines, who appear to have DO contact with white people. It has been unsafe to land singly or without firearms. Bigge Island, west of Montague Sound, mentioned and the inhabitants described as follows: The natives are a savage race, of good worth the money. physique, armed with spears, clubs, and rangs, and remarkably agile. They appear to be unaccustomed to white people. Landing was resisted. No attempt should be made hold intercourse with them in small parties, or without firearms. Of the natives in the Maret group, i statedMaret group is frequented by natives, caution is necessary when landing. These interesting remarks are made on cottage. Camden HarborFrom a high hill on the southern shore Camden Island most luxuriant and - well-watered country was seen over the low southern shore, extending in an east-south-easterly direction towards the Glcnelg River. Part of this land approaches within five miles of Camden Harbor. In the vicinity of Camden Island, natives were hostile. A settlement, formed its shores, was abandoned long ago for this in this matter. reason. Mr A. Green. Honourable members have heard something Bay, of Y a m pi Sound, in the Buccaneer A r c h i pelago, because of the famous iron deposits there. Several pearlers who have gone out from Derby towards Y a m pi Sound have been wrecked, and on landing The in the sound have been murdered by the natives. Sufficient has been said to show how necessary it is that these lights should be installed. This portion of the coast should be treated in the same way as other portions of our coast are treated, . and we should do what we can for the hinterland country. If the Minister for Works examines the chart I have on the table he will find that in the East Indies the Dutch people have all their channels and water-ways lighted like Bourke street, although many of the places have only a ship a month.",111
486,Mr STEWART,Unknown,"Wimmera-Minister ' for Works and Railways) [6.25 a.m.] I shall only be able to reply briefly to the points raised, because the time at my disposal' is limited . The honourable member for Grey has moved that this vote be reduced by £ 1 , because he says no provision is made for improving thehousing accommodation along the EastWest line. I in for m him that an race amount of £23,662 is provided - on the Loan Estimates for the construction of residential accommodation along the East-West line. I inspected Rawlinna is with the honourable member, and know exactly what the position is. It is said that the houses erected there are not All honourable memboomebers know that it is impossible, under existing conditions, to build, a very good to type of house for £400, whether it be at a spot half-way along the East-West railway line or in the capital cities. t is What struck me about the accommodation was that there was no privacy. I and have instructed the Railway Commissioner to erect a,paling fence round each That will cost a fair amount of money, but no extra rent will be charged for the added' convenience. I of - do not deny that the accommodation at some of the stations on the East-West line is poor and of a. temporary character. rich That is largely because many of the stopthe ping places are not yet permanently deteron mined. Water is one of the main' factors Rawlinna is a permanent station, and for that reason the accommodation there is better than in some other places. soon as we establish permanent stopping places a better class of accommodation will be provided. With respect to the Kyogle-Brisbane railway, I can assure honourable members that the Commonwealth Government is anxious to cooperate with the State in constructing the line. Negotiations are going on at present. A very fine speech was made by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie in explanation of the need for lights on our north-west coast. As an ex-sailor I appreciated very much what he said. Lighthouses are under the control of the Department of Trade and Customs. An amount of £140,000 has been .provided this year for two new vessels for tending lighthouses. One of these will work on the Western Australian coast. I was glad to hear the reference to automatic lights. Already £250,000 has been spent in providing these lights, and. a saving of £11,000 a year has been made by removing the old type of light and replacing it with the new automatic light. I suggest that the honourable member state his case to the Department of Trade and Customs, which, I am sure, will give it the fullest consideration.",112

489,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Unknown," The time at which the vote on this Department must be taken has arrived. Proposed vote (Works, and Railways £834,849) agreed to. POSTMASTER-GENERAL'S DEPARTMENT. Proposed Vote, £7,997,131.",113
490,Mr GIBSON,Unknown,"Postmaster-GeneralCorangamite) [6.30 a.m.] - I intended to say something on the Budget in regard to the Post Office Department generally, but I am confined now to the matters dealt with in the Estimates before the Committee. I shall not take up much time, as I know that honourable members desire to speak about post office' and telephone construction. I am very glad that the criticism levelled against the Department I have the As honour to administer - has been very friendly. With regard to telephones, honourable members know that last year we spent something like £2,000,000 on constructional work. I want to pay a  office of Postmaster-General prior to my taking over the administration of the Department. He set out to catch up with some of the arrears of construction, and he went so far as to widen ' the concessions to country districts generally. The present Government propose to further extend the facilities for communication in the country districts. Honourable members will recognise that this is a work of very great magnitude when they remember that we are spending this year some £4,000,000. If we had before us a proposal for the construction of a railway at a cost of £4,000,000 we would hardly expect to spend the money in one year. It is, however, proposed to spend the £4,000,000 on the Post and Telegraph Department's operations during the coming year. That is almost double the amount expended last year. I hope honourable members . will recognise that this is a very big work, and will give a great deal of employment. The expenditure will cover only works that are absolutely necessary, and that represent only a part of the for expenditure of £10,000,000, which will be completed in a future programme of construction for 1924-25. The public seem to think that . it is quite an easy matter to make connexions with the telephone service, but when it is explained that it costs as much per mile to lay down conduits and cables in the capital cities as to lay down a line of railway, it will be seen that it is not an easy matter to make some of the connexions for which people are clamouring today. The arrears are very great. Something 'like 14,000 people are still waiting for connection with the telephone service. Since the present Government came into office we have connected some 3,000 per month, which, I think, is a very great feat. It exceeds anything done by the Post and Telegraph Department before, and is an absolute record. I feel sure that we will shortly be making 4,000 telephone connexions per month, and we must do so if we are to give in a reason' able time the service which people are looking for. Some honourable members opposite have said that most of the money is being expended in city areas, and others have said that most of it is being spent in country areas, so the Department would appear to have struck the happy medium. I propose to explain what is being done in both city and country areas. The references made by the honourable members for Hume  Gabb), and, I think, Kalgoorlie (Mr A. Green) were particularly to the expenditure on buildings, and not so much to the amount of £2,980,000 which appeared in the Loan Estimates for telephones and telegraph works. What we are proposing to spend is £3,200,000 on telephones and telegraphs; £729,366 on buildings, and £82,400 on sites. In 1922-23 we spent £2,000,000 on telephone and telegraph works, and £182,818 on buildings. The allocation of the £3,200,000 proposed to be expended this year is as follows:New South Wales £645,300 in metropolitan areas, and £701,200 in country areas, or a total of £1,346,500. In Victoria, £444,400 in metropolitan areas, and £326,900 in,country areas, or a total of £771,300. In Queensland, £159,500 in metropolitan areas, and 322,600 in country areas, total £482,100. In South Australia, £185,700 in metropolitan areas and £202,500 in country areas, total £338,200. In Western Australia, £56,100 in metropolitan areas and £132,600 in country areas, total £188,700. In Tasmania, £31,000 in metropolitan areas and £42,200 in country areas, total £73,200. These figures give a grand total of £1,472,000 for metropolitan areas, and £1,728,000 for country areas; 46 per cent, of the total expenditure will be in the metropolitan areas, and 54 per cent, in the country districts. I should say that this does not represent the whole of the money being expended in country districts for the reason that it is necessary to dismantle a good deal of work in city areas, and many switch boards, conduits and cables are transferred from city to country areas. The country districts get the benefit of this dismantled material with little cost to them. Taking that into consideration the actual amount Mr Oibsun, which is to be expended in the country districts will be much more than the figures I have just given.",113
491,Mr MANN,Unknown,Is the capital value of the dismantled material still debited to city works?',114
492,Mr GIBSON,Unknown,"Yes , mostly. The material is simply removed to country districts. Honourable members will understand that the capacity of conduits and cables in the capital cities is in some cases soon outgrown by the. increased traffic and the dismantled' material is quite useful for the country districts. With regard to cable material there has been a great deal of difficulty in the past in getting this material. In city areas, very many applications for telephones have been outstanding for a very long time. It is a very difficult matter indeed because of the lack of cables to make the connexions required. I have explained that the cost of laying down conduits and cables of 1,000 pairs of wires amounts to over £5,000 per mile, and many would be subscribers must remain without connexions until such time as conduits are laid down, and the cable arrives from overseas. When we are in a position to do so, we shall, instead of connecting one subscriber, connect hundreds, or even a thousand, by a single cable. I must confess that the telephone system in the capital cities is very bad indeed, and the position in Sydney is probably worse tban in any of the other capital cities of Australia. There the junction lines between the exchanges are not sufficient for the number of persons who want connexions between them. There"" are only fifty junction lines for 500 people,- and if more than fifty wish to be connected at one time, the whole automatic exchange is thrown out of order. As a result we are today really spoiling the valuable machinery contained in the exchanges. We are making an effort to have additional junction lines placed in position at the earliest date. We are trying to give the community as soon as possible the service which should be given in the capital cities ' as well as in the country districts.

The conditions in Melbourne are very similar to those in Sydney. There are thousands of applicants for telephone services, and I believe that if the Department were prepared to announce to the people of tliose two cities tomorrow that they could all get telephone communication, it would be snowed under with applications. As soon as the exchanges are built the bulk of the work will have been done, and the further expenditure will be only in the laying of cables and wires to connect many thousands of people to the exchanges. Upon country telephone trunk lines are spending in New South Wales I -£426,000, independent of 'the expenditure upon - subscribers' lines. The condition of affairs today is such that the subpose scriber often has to wait for an hour or two to get telephone connection with country districts. The traffic that is deserves. offering over these trunk lines is imAustralia mense. The proposed expenditure £426,000 represents only the present year's programme, and is for urgent .works. I appeal to honourable members who are particularly anxious to get trunk lines and subscribers' lines in their own districts to have a little patience,, because we shall experience difficulty in spending .£4,000,000 on constructional work m year. On Victorian trunk lines we are proposing to spend £199,989. In this State the conditions are much the as in New South Wales. Tn some cases Mr Gibson. BRISBANE. Approximate Total Amount to Remarks.

We are also cutting out of the trunk lines many country towns. Where small towns are in close proximity to bigger towns we are putting in a direct line, so that the small' town may have communication with the bigger townwith which it does most of its business, without holding up traffic on the main trunk. On Queensland country trunk lines the expenditure will be £263,719, and I hope that will satisfy the Queensland representatives. Where the distances are so great as they are in Queensland, it is essential to give the people conveniences even if they cost a little more. A telephone is even more necessary in outback districts than in the capital cities, and I may be forgiven if my sympathies lean a little towards the we country rather than the city'. However, do not wish to raise the cry of country versus city, because I realise that one cannot live without the other. I proto give to the city the conditions essential to an up-to-date service, and to ' the country the sympathetic treatment it The expenditure in South upon telephone trunk lines will of be £105,579; in .Western Australia, £105,790; and in Tasmania, £26,252. I ask honourable members to.think of what these trunk lines mean.

In the past we have had a great difficulty in getting a supply of switchboards and cables, but at the present time orders are coming forward very well. The whole of the cable has been coming from England, but the Department has given a contract to an Australian f i r m to manufacture cable in the coming year. The whole of the orders for copper wire, totalling 50,000 or 60,000 miles, have been placed with an Australian firm. As indicating the progress that is being made and the revenue that is flowing into the telephone service, I may in for m the Committee that the revenue from calls in July, 1922, was £278,794, and in July, 1923, £302,283, representing an increase of £23,489. Similar figures could be quoted for every other month, and I 'feel sure that, if the Department were able to give prompter connection on the telephones, the business would be increased very largely. The new work to be put in hand will mean the employment of very many temporary hands. At the present time, 2,655 returned soldiers are employed on telephone and telegraph works, and we propose to engage another 700 to help in carrying out the 1923-24 programme. Some of the concessions made to the public in regard to telephone services were stated in the Budget speech. In future, we propose to base trunk-line charges on direct mileage instead of route mileage. Very many country districts have lines running parallel, with in 10 or 1.5 miles, but the route mileage travelled by the telephone message may be 60 miles. B y adopting the direct mileage instead of the route mileage, we are placing country districts on exactly the same footing as the cities. Every country district subscriber will be able, without paying a trunk-line fee, to communicate within a 5-mile radius of the exchange to which he is connected. Country subscribers will thus be in the same position as if they were connected with a city exchange. t be rental for the use of Government poles has been reduced from 10s. per mile to 5s. per mile for metallic circuit, or 2s. 6d. per mile per wire, and for lines constructed wholly by the Department from £ 2 to 30s. per mile; Formerly subscribers in country districts were asked to pay two years' rental in advance, while the city subscriber was asked for only one year's rental. I have directed that the city and country subscribers shall be placed on the same basis. If it is safe to accept one year's rental from a city subscriber, it should be equally safe to accept it from a man in the country. In the city, up to £65 per subscriber can be expended in providing a subscriber's line, but only £21 could be expended in the country. Henceforth, up to £65 may be spent on a country subscriber's line. A furthe r disability imposed on the country subscriber was that, even though there, were two or three applicants in a certain district, the Department would not erect .a line for more than 2 miles from the exchange. In future, if four or five people in ' a district make application to become subscribers, the limitation of £65 per subscriber will apply instead of the distance limitation.",121
494,Mr HILL,Unknown,Does not the country man have to give a seven-years' guarantee? I do not think that prevails in the cities.,121
495,Mr GIBSON,Unknown,The guarantee is over and above the £65 per subscriber.,121
496,Mr CUNNINGHAM,Unknown,"Does the Minister mean that if five subscribers to a country exchange make application, the line may be extended a distance of 10 miles?",121
497,Mr GIBSON,Unknown,"No . The proposal is to spend £ 6 5 per subscriber, and in this respect the country subscriber will be placed oh exactly the same footing as the subscriber in city areas. The honourable member for Bass (Mr Jackson) referred just now to the length of the poles. The Act does not permit wires being less than 12 feet in height being erected along fences, and less than 18 feet over roads. I intend to introduce an amendment of the Act to enable us to place wires on poles 8 feet high, instead of 12 feet along certain routes. It is not proposed to use these shorter poles in cities or towns, or in places where there are a number of wires, but in the more sparsely populated districts in Western Australia, QueensThe land, and the Northern Territory. In some areas it is absolutely essential that we should erect iron poles. I had an estimate for a line from Camooweal to the present overland telegraph line. The 'cartage of the posts for the line would have cost £20,000., I propose to cut that cost in half by reducing the height of the pole's-.",121
498,Mr OKEEFE,Unknown,"Denison) [7.2 a . m . ] In the Postmaster-General's Department there is an item £30,000 for the conveyance of mails between the mainland and Tasmania by certain steamship companies, under contracts with the Department. I should like the Minister to give some information as to when these contracts will expire.' If they have only a short term to run, I suggest the advisability of not renewing them for a lengthy period, because this expenditure of £30,000 would .be an important factor in the profitable working of the Common-, wealth Line of steamers between the mainland and Tasmania. I know that I would not be in order if I referred at length to the necessity for the Commonwealth employing Government steamers in this trade, but, unfortunately, owing to the declaration of urgency in respect of the Estimates, I was deprived of my opportunity to refer to this matter when the Department which controls shipping was under discussion. Once again I enter my protest against this method of doing business. The action of the Government is preventing fair and . reasonable debate on the Estimates. Recently we passed a Bill which contains a provision for the appointment of a Board to take over and control the Commonwealth Line. The Board will have authority to purchase suitable vessels, and if it considered that course desirable, to put Commonwealth vessels on the run between the mainland and Tasmania, in competition with privately-owned ships. This sum of £30,000 now being paid under contract to the various. shipping companies for' the conveyance of mails to and from Tasmania, wil l be a very important factor in the successful running of any Commonwealth steamers that may be put into commission in that trade. Unfortunately, owing to the tactics of the Government, I have been deprived of the chance to have a vote recorded in connection with a. motion for : the appointment of a commission to in quire into and' report upon the advisability of Commonwealth steamers engaging in the trade between the mainland and Hobart. I hope, however, that we may yet have an opportunity of getting a vote, because I am satisfied that a majority of the members were sympathetically interested in the motion. The Commission could do its work within a week, and submit a report to Parliament. I - believe that the Board to be appointed tocontrol Commonwealth shipping will give early attention to this question, and I am satisfied that it will not be long beforeCommonwealth vessels are put on the run between the mainland and Tasmania. In that event, the amount paid under themail contract with privately-owned vessels could be paid as a subsidy to the Commonwealth ships, and be an important factor in their success.",122
499,Mr LISTER,Unknown,Corio) '[7.15 a.m.] - Mr Cook,122
500,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,I call attention to the state of the Committee. [Quorum formed.'],122
501,Mr LISTER,Unknown,"E v e r since I have been a member of the House complaints have been raised during the discussion on the Estimates about the insufficiency of thetime allowed to debate the .items of proposed expenditure; but even if the time were extended four-fold, I believe that similar complaints would be made. I - wish to compliment the Postmaster General (Mr Gibson) and the competent staff under his control for the servicesthey are rendering. I have had a good deal to do with the Post and Telegraph Department, which is a governmental activity which comes into, closer touch with the general community than any - other. D u r in g the time. I have been a. member of this House, I have always received the greatest courtesy from postal officials, even down to the messenger boys, and I think it is only right to pay them some small tribute for the efficient service they render. The position held by the Minister has always been regarded as a political grave, but I - am satisfied that if the present Postmaster-General continues his good work it will be a long time before it can again be so regarded. A good deal has been.said concerning thenecessity for providing country districts with the facilities enjoyed by the people in the metropolitan areas, and it is gratifying that the Government have submitted a policy which will materially tend to increase development in the outback country. The Minister will be justified in making inquiries into the n manner in which city telephone cabinets are working, in an endeavour to ascertain why they constantly get out of order. The honourable member for Bass (| Mr Jackson) mentioned this matter a few days ago, and I have lately had a similar experience. The telephones, at railway stations particularly, are frequently out of order, and consequently a good deal of revenue is lost. There is also an insufficient number of telephone cabinets in the metropolitan areas, and revenue is lost for this cause, because people cannot waste time in waiting an opportunity to call subscribers - I was interested to hear the Minister's statement that it is proposed to manufacture cable in Australia. If this work is undertaken, employment will be provided for a large number of our own people. I trust that some of the cable coming forward will be ear-marked for Geelong, where there have been numerous complaints owing to persons being unable to get connected with the exchange. The installation of an additional switchboard at. the Geelong, Post Office is also a pressing need. The existing boards are full, and even if a permanent board is not available, perhaps the Minister will authorize the installation of a temporary board to accommodate 100 subscribers to overcome the present difficulty. Improvement should be made in the accommodation provided for the Geelong telephone attendants. The constant clicking of the apparatus must be very irritating to operators. I also understand that the temperature of the room in which they work has to be regulated, and that moist air, which would interfere with the delicate mechanism, must not be admitted. It is intended, I believe, to provide additional facilities for the telephone attendants in a room adjoining that which they now occupy, and I trust that provision will be made in this direction at an early date. The traffic on the trunk line between Geelong and Ballarat is frequently congested, and at times there is difficulty in establishing communication between the two pl'aces. The difficulty could be overcome by the construction of a line 8 miles in length from Fyansford to Murgheboluc, and I am glad to learn that this work which is now contemplated may soon be authorized. As the revenue of the Department has been buoyant, those,in charge of allowance post-offices might well be granted an additional allowance, as the amounts received in some cases are too small. I am sorry that a ""Werribee mail delivery service on the northern side of the railway line has not been arranged, and that the Department has not complied with the request of the Albion Ratepayers Association to place a letter-box on the Albion railway station. Naturally, all the work requiring attention in my electorate has not been done, but it is pleasing to know that attention has been given to many of the requests I have submitted.",122
502,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Hunter) [7.30 a.m.] - I wish to refer briefly to the development of the wireless broad-casting system, which is a matter that should be given careful consideration by honourable members on account of its importance to our country districts. An agitation has been going on for some time for the provision of wireless broadcasting facilities. A deputation met the Postmaster-General recently, and in consequence a number of regulations have been framed which are on the. table of the House at present. Unless objection is taken to them by 15th August, they will become law and will have all the force of'an Act of Parliament. I have 'nothing to say i agains.t the action of the Postmaster General in endeavouring to establish this system.' If it is successful it will be a great boon to people who live in the more remote parts of the country. It will increase the pleasure of life to them, and will enable them to obtain information of important matters which occur in the capital cities or in other parts of Australia. Buf I have received several letters which seem to indicate that the regulations are not altogether satisfactory.",123
503,Mr GIBSON,Unknown,Can the honourable member tell me from whom he received the letters ?,123
504,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"On e came from the Wireless DevelopmentAssociation of Victoria, 323 Flinders-street, Melbourne;. another from Mr John Payne, editor of the Australasian Wireless Review, 143 Avoca-street, Randwick, Sydney; and another from Mr C. W. Norris, 346 Post Office-place, Melbourne. In the .opinion offchewriters the regulations are framed differently from those which operate in New Zealand, Great Britain, and America. They have requested me to take action to prevent the regulations from becoming law. I told them that I could not do that, as the time for which Parliament would be sitting would not permit it. But I promised that I would take the first opportunity to bring the matter under the notice of the Postmaster-General. I understand that the Minister framed these regulations after a conference was held, and I - suppose, therefore, that he has some justification for them. We should make these facilities available as far as possible to all the people in the out-back settlements, and not only to the wealthier classes. If we can use this means to bring a little sunshine into the lives of the folk out-back we should do it. Our people should not be in a position any less advantageous than that of the people of Great Britain or other parts of the British Dominions. The letter from the Wireless Development Association of Victoria reads323 Flinders-street, Melbourne. Dear Sir, We received your letter this morning, and have much pleasure in forwarding another copy of the cuttings. We believe that today is the last day. on which a protest can be lodged in , the House on the Wireless Bill this session. While the Postmaster-General states that there was no opposition at the time of the conference, we would like to point out that at the conference the public was not represented, and it is the public's interest that we wish to protect. The only interests that have been protected by the present regulations are any broadcasting station which might start, and there is no .limit in the fees that they may demand from the public for their service. event of more tlian one broadcasting station starting and charging for services, the public will have ""to pay for both 'broadcasting stations if they desire to listen to both, and so the ordinary working man will be debarred from listening in . This is not so in New Zealand, America, England, South America, and Europe, and' why should Australia be placed in this position ? You will also notice that Tjroadcasting stations have the monopoly for five . years, which means that we are held up by them for five years. If the regulations are amended, they uu-doubtedly will claim compensation against the Government - '„ interested We would be pleased to give you any other help in this matter. Yours faithfully, Mr Charlton. According to that letter certain companies are to be given a monopoly for five years. 1 ° Mr GiBSON.^That is not so.",123
505,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I am pleased to hear that. The writer of that letter points out that if such a monopoly were given, and subsequently it was found necessary to alter the agreement in the public interests, the companies which had been granted a monopoly would claim compensation. This association forwarded a copy of a letter from C. W. Norris, of Norris & Skelly, 346 Post Office-place, Melbourne, July 1923. It reads: "" BROADCASTING OR THE SEALED BOX? "" To the Editor, Electrical Times. Sir, Now that the recent Conference called by ihe Minister (Mr Gibson, P.M.G.) is over and the discussion has been published, the majority (which have just discovered that there has been a conference affecting their business as electrical traders) on hearing the result stand aghast! While we all agree that broadcasting must be governed, and, possibly, subsidized-in small c populated areas such as Australia - wha t we cannot understand is that the Australian Government has agreed to demand that, be9th August, 1923. fore the public can even purchase a receiving set, they must pay a - fee to one broadcasting station-that is, after paying 10s. for a licencethen they are allowed to purchase a sealed box. If they do not like the particular station for which they have already paid their money, then back they go with their sealed box to their dealer and pay a small fee to have same altered to another wave length; then it will be necessary to pay a fee to this broadcasting station, and they are allowed to take home their sealed box again, and so on and so on. Do you honestly think the public will do this ? Mr Gibson stated to myself and others, while on a deputation of protest, that it will 'be just like ui book-lending library-if you don't like In the one you just go to another. Yes, but remember that you pay and you can choose at random what book you want, but not so with the sealed box. I would suggest that, as the Government is so good as to sponsor the broadcasting companies which will have every possibility of becoming monopolies, as in England, that they do the job properly here, as suggested below:(1) Raise the licence fee to £ 3 3s. per annum. (2) Genuine experimenters be protected as at present,- and charged 10s. per annum. (3) Appoint a Board, consisting of representatives of the Radio Department, broadcasting companies, traders, press and others directly in broadcasting (these to be paid a small fee, if any at all), to control-broadcasting. (4) Moneys received in fees to be allotted as follows :-Fiv e shillings of each to go to the Radio Department for the control and superC. W . CHUM , Treasurer. vision of wireless, which will include strict supervision by their officers (heavy penalties for breaches), the balance to be paid into a fund to subsidize broadcasting. (5) The Board to accept programmes, which will include entertainments, public notices, weather reports, & c , also times for services. Then call tenders for thU service, successful tenders to be under bond to maintain the programmes. (6) One subsidized broadcasting station to be allotted to each capital city. More as funds from fees permit for other centres. (7) That the licences be issued to companies or firms desirous of broadcasting on payment of a fee, say £20, and placing a bond to maintain small service for one year, advertisements to be strictly limited, no charge whatever to public for the service, but would be on any wave length available, and under strict Radio Department's regulations. (8) That all receiving sets bought complete or made up of parts can be capable of receiving on any. wave lengths. (9) All dealers in wireless apparatus to be licensed and under penalties for supplying - apparatus to others than holders of Government licences. (10) Licences to be obtained at post-offices or licensed dealers. Then broadcasting will have a chance to be on the proper lines, the public having six subsidized high-power stations at their service and a number of other stations supplied by firms, &c. (as in USA. at present}, but properly supervised here, all for the sum of £ 3 3s. per annum. Just you calculate the money available by subscribers in each capital city, which would be at least £10,000 per State. Then the Minister, Mr Gibson, could see his' dream come true-Australi a the only country in the world running broadcasting on proper lines.",124
506,Mr GIBSON,Unknown,Mr Norris is quite satisfied now.,125
507,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"'-It is strange, then, that he should have written me a second letter, dated 9th August.",125
508,Mr GIBSON,Unknown,"I had a deputation on Wednesday, 8th August, and Mr Norris saw me the next day and said that everything was all right.",125
509,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"The letter I received from Mr John Payne, editor of the Australasian Wireless Review, of Sydney, under date 6th August, is the following:Wireless is one of the most revolutionary things that has happened in the century from the educational point of view, and from our point of view as Labour men we should do all in our power to further the coming of the benefits'of this science into the homes to add brightness and happiness. In the Old Country the wharfie has his little set, and listens in at night with his family. It keeps him at home, and the home is the brighter and happier for it . There any one can have a radio receiving set to cover any wave length, and this means that he can listen into all kinds of concerts from all over the place. In New Zealand splendid regulations have been gazetted, and any one there can have a receiver which will receive any wave length, and concerts are heard in different places from the North Cape to the Bluff, the annual licence fee being only 5s. In England the listener-into radio concerts, as they are called, pays £1 per year, 10s. of which goes to the Broadcasting Company, a company formed to rendei; radio service tlu'oughout Great Britain. In addition, amateurs send music. So far, a fee of only £ 1 . An English radio man can listen to' any concert for that inclusive sum. In America there is absolutefreedom, as only an annual licence fee is charged by the Government of a nominal amount, and the big firms broadcast free for the purpose of advertisement mainly. Our regulations have just been gazetted, as you will be aware, and they contain some of the most damnable and restrictive provisions on the radio concert listener it is possible to conceive. 1I have quoted sufficient to show that there is some dissatisfaction. The people which have corresponded with me understand the business. I do not know anything about radio-wireless, and am bringing the matter up because I have been requested to do so, and because the regulation,, I understand, will come into force on the 15th of this month. I hope that the Postmaster-General will see his way to suspend its operation until he has made further inquiries. I have personally no doubt that he has taken every care in the matter, but in the initiation of these things some little mistakes are likely to occur. I agree with the honourable gentleman that it would be unwise to hold up the matter for any great length of time. The system should be introduced as quickly as possible. We should encourage companies to start radio services to give the people the benefit of them. I believe that advantage will be taken of the system by big business companies in the different cities to communicate information concerning their business to their customers. I believe it will he beneficial in many ways.' It is one of the great scientific developments of the last few years, and we should see that it is installed here. I realise that it would be futile to table an objection to the regulation at this stage, because it would be too late. This concerns people in the country districts.proa little bably more than people in the city. In the cities people can go to places of amusement every night, but the residents of country districts scarcely ever hear a concert, and cannot get in touch with the news of the outside world. The installation of theradio services should assist to make the lives of country residents happier than they are today, and 'help them to spend their winter evenings more pleasantly than they can do now. I have been supplied with the regulations which it is desired to have.amended, but it is unnecessary torefer to them here. Those who have communicated with me assure me that their one object in the matter is to make the radio service a cess. I leave the subject at that. I am sure the Postmaster-General will give consideration to the representation I made.  I want - to compliment the Postmaster General upon the very concise way in which he presented his Department's programme. It is gratifying to honourable members who receive so many communications concerning postal .matters to know that every year the Post and Telegraph Department is modernizing as well as liberalizing its ideas. The fact becoming prevalent - that the Department is a public utility, and not merely a money-making concern. The expenditure upon it in the different States should not be on a per capita basis. When the Government recently proposed the appropriation of £500,000 for main roads development, they decided that it would be wrong to allocate the vote to - the different States on a per capita basis, because it was obvious that the States in most need of the grant were those with the greater areas. The Government allocated a portion of the £500,000 on the per capita basis, and the balance on an area basis. I was pleased to learn the distribution which the Postmaster-General proposes for this year's expenditure in metropolitan and country areas. His advisers in Western Australia may not have properly - estimated the amount which should be spent in that State. They failed to do so last year under Mr state Poynton's regime, and, if that is the case this year, they will have to apply later on for increased expenditure. The Minister has admitted that he scarcely knows how to get through his programme and spend £4,000,000 in the year effectively. The honourable gentleman will find useful and proper ways of expending the money in Western Australia. I wish to say in the kindliest manner that Western Australia-and I dare say the same thing applies to Tasmania and Queensland-suffer s greatly because of distance from the centre of things in Melbourne. The honourable member for Corio (Mr Lister) was able to refer* the Minister to post-boxes in this street and that street in Geelong, but we cannot do that kind of thing in Western Australia. I hope that the Postmaster-General will , take advantage of the earliest opportunity sucto visit the various States, and that he will especially visit Western Australia. He will find that development is going on have in that State. The State Government is trying to effect the settlement of immigrants on the land. The Commonwealth Government is paying part of the interest on the expenditure of a lot of money in that State for the purpose, and settlement is spreading rapidly into large new areas. We have been told many times in this chamber that if a block of land is put to the ballot in some of the States there will be 500 or 600 applicants for it . That is is not the case in Western Australia. Although it may cost £5,000 per mile to lay cables in the cities, 100 miles might be laid for that money in Western Australia. I hope that during the recess the Postmaster-General will devote as much time as possible to visiting the various States in order to make himself acquainted with local conditions. The Postmaster-General, no matter who he is, must work largely through Deputies. Some Postmasters-General in the past have imposed very restrictive conditions. Officials' of the - Department have been brought up under them, and have got into a groove. They want to be on the safe side, bust the Postmaster-General should let them know that regulations must be liberally interpreted. I hope the Postmaster-General, when he visits Western Australia, will not stay there for only a day or two.",125

511,Mr GIBSON,Unknown,"I propose to do so.  its Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) mentioned the question of broadcasting. - I do not know whether any errors haye been made in connection with the regulations issued recently by the Postmaster General, but when I showed him one communication from ""Western Australia he said that the complaint it contained was without foundation. However, wireless has come to stay, and it should be placed upon a sure and permanent basis. To ' avoid the risk of damages being claimed for loss sustained through plants having been purchased in accordance with departmental regulations and then being found unsuitable had to be varied, the regulations should be closely overhauled to insure that the Department is proceeding on absolute safe and sound lines. I conclude by' expressing my gratification that the Postmaster-General intends to visit the £>tate of Western Australia, the people of which sometimes feel that, because of their remoteness from Melbourne, they are almost outside the Federation and are overlooked.",126
512,Mr CUNNING,Unknown,"HAM (Gwydir) [8.3 a.m.] - I , in common with other honourable members on this side, protest against the inadequate opportunity afforded us to discuss these most important expenditure proposals. ' The postal services are the most important rendered to the people by any Government Department. Yet not more than ten members in a House of seventy-five will have an opportunity to express their opinions concerning the administration of the Department. That is a scandalous state of affairs, particuwhich larly as during the next fortnight the House will be dealing with comparatively unimportant legislation. The expenditure indicated by the Postmaster-General will give a certain amount of relief during next twelve months, but the last Government and the one preceding it had so neglected to keep pace with current requirements, and so starved some of the services, that even the new works and additions now promised will not be adequate if population increases as has been foreshadowed. Mr LiSTEE - r-The war affected those services.",127
513,Mr CUNNINGHAM,Unknown,"It was not so much the war as the foolish cry for false economy that induced the Government to cut out many services. For instance, mail services in country districts were cut down from three to two a week, and in order to get back the old service the people are asked to dip their hands into their pockets to pay a subsidy. One town in a grazing district used to get three mail deliveries a week; the service was cut down to two mails a week, and the residents were informed that if they wished to restore the three-days-a-week service they must pay £70 per annum towards the additional cost. This Parlia; ment should make the Postmaster-General understand that such services should be paid for out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund. The people living in these outback districts are pioneers; ""they are making the country habitable, and helping to support the people living in the cities. Yet, in addition to the taxation they pay, an additional impost is put upon them when they ask for a service to which they are entitled. People who settle in the country should not be penalized by being asked to put their hands into their pockets in order to pay for necessary conveniences. The people who go outback and open up the country are asked to pay more for postal and telegraphic services than are the men who stay in the big centres of population. In regard to the expenditure upon works and buildings, I draw the attention of the Postmaster-General to the fact that there are many small but well-established villages, the population of will' never be great enough to, justify the establishment of an official post office. These places are served by allowance officers, who are required to provide their own quarters. Is it right the to ask these officers, who receive not more than from £2 to £3 per week, - to pay for accommodation for themselves? There is in the town of Cobbadah an old tumble-down stone building, in which the postmistress has accommodation. She cannot be expected to provide better accommodation for herself when she is not secure in her position. She is told by ' the Department that it will not erect a building for her, although a timber room could be built for about £50. The policy of the Department should be to build offices andquarters, and' charge small rents for them. The postmistress at Cobbadah pays 5s. per week for the rent of a room in a tumble-down building. - That would be a handsome return on the capital cost of a small wooden building. Many employees of the Postal Department are inadequately remunerated for their services. There are some men who have been in the .Department for twenty-five and thirty years, are in control of as many as ten officers, and are responsible for a twenty-four-hours-a-day service. They have to handle large amounts of money, and to be in attendance at all hours of the day or night, and yet are receiving only £25 0 per annum, plus a living allowance.",127
514,Mr GIBSON,Unknown,And child ment !,128
515,Mr CUNNINGHAM,Unknown,"Some of the men are up in years, and their families are already grown up ; therefore they do not get the endowment. Unless the Department will pay better salaries it cannot expect to attract the best men to its service. Another injustice is in respect of the allowance to junior oflicers transferred to stations away from their homes. A boy of poor parents may be required by the Department to transfer to another office. father cannot afford to ' assist him , that boy, after having spent a couple of years in the Department, has to resign his position for no other reason than his father's poverty. That is not just. The total allowance in this regard this year for New South Wales is £4,010. I know of many boys who have been forced to leave their positions in the Department because they could not afford - to be transferred. That is not the sort of treatment that should be given to young men who enter the Commonwealth service. The Postmaster-General has spoken of the large amount of money to be expended in connection with telephone services. Until wireless has been simplified and cheapened, the telephone will continue to be the chief means of communication between people in the outback districts, and I appeal to the Postmaster General to liberalize and broaden his policy with regard to telephones'. The M in ister may say that Cabinet will not give him more money, but his duty is to come to Parliament and ask for the money. People in the country districts appreciate the value of the telephone, and as a result are often prepared to pay more than they can really afford to secure the convenience. Unfortunately, many are unable to provide the funds, and in case of sickness are at.a serious disadvantage as compared with their wealthier neighbours, though their people are just as near and dear to them. The 'Government, we have been informed, have placed £2,500,000 to a contingency f u n d for defence. Probably this' money will be poured into the Singapore Naval Base. The Government, with the surplus funds at their disposal, should liberalize the postal and telegraphic and telephonicservices of our people in the back country districts. The Postmaster-General will . endow- not be able to carry out his public works policy during the next twelve months, unless he enlarges his staff. I suggest that steps be taken in this direction at once - to insure that the much-needed facilities in country ""districts shall be provided promptly, and at the same time relieve much of the unemployment iri our midst. The mail contractors are a class of - persons who should be protected from themselves. In the past it has been customary to grant allowances to them during periods If his of drought,' and as a result some genius in the post office evolved the brilliant idea - of placing in the contract the provision that in future no. drought allowances were to be claimed. Of course, it was a ridiculous provision. If it were enforced the contractors would have to safeguard themselves by advancing their charges. They would have to provide for feed for at least eighteen months out of the three years. No man can possibly foreshadow the weather conditions in Australia over a series of years. I wish to be perfectly fair to the Minister. He states that his instructions have been misinterpreted, but I have received letters to the effect that a man whose contracts were not in existence prior to 1st July, 1922, would not be entitled to drought allowance.",128
516,Mr GIBSON,Unknown,My instruction applies to them all.,128
517,Mr CUNNINGHAM,Unknown,"I am glad to have the assurance of the Minister, and I hope he will get to work at once and see that these men receive the relief as' promptly as possible. I have in mind one man who has been carrying out a contract ' for fifteen years, and is suffering more severely from drought now than ever before.",128
518,Mr GIBSON,Unknown,Every district must be dealt with on its merits.,129
519,Mr CUNNINGHAM,Unknown,"I hope the Minister will, see that this ridiculous provision is eliminated from forms of tender, otherwise most mail tenders will have to be based on a much higher cost, because the contractor will have to safeguard himself against a period of possible drought, and thereby increase the cost of mail contracts. On the question of accommodation for the public and for employees in country districts, I think that there should be a thorough inspection, and re-organization of all our postal buildings with a view to bringing them up to date. Many are very inconvenient and badly lighted, and in several places where there is electric light the Department insists on retaining the old gas lighting system. In this matter we should follow the example of the States. As a rule, State public buildings are an ornament to a town or district, whereas a Commonwealth building is usually the most ramshackle structure in the town.",129
520,Mr GIBSON,Unknown,We are dealing with 274 of them this year.,129
521,Mr CUNNINGHAM,Unknown,"Many hundreds more throughout Australia need attention. Many of them are dilapidated, unpainted, and, generally speaking, are no credit to the Commonwealth. electoral office, post-office, and branches of the Commonwealth Bank could, in many instances, be housed in one substantial and presentable building. I have in mind most unsuitable quarters at Narrabri, housing the electoral, officer for the division of Gwydir. I propose to test the feeling of the Committee in regard to increasing the mail and telephone facilities in country districts. It has been urged that if these facilities are granted to one country centre, thousands of other districts will want the same treatment, and we may not have the money to provide them.",129
522,Mr GIBSON,Unknown,"We cannot spend the £8,000,000 in"" one year.",129
523,Mr CUNNINGHAM,Unknown,"I was not referring to works and. buildings, but to mail and postal services in country districts. We should not withhold these facilities from the people. On the contrary, it should be our duty to provide them wherever possible. Parliament is in control of the finances, and honourable members should give the Postmaster-General an intimation to re-draft his policy with a view to liberalizing the provisions in regard to mail contracts, and provide for mail contractors to call in at homesteads. As a case in point, I may state that many men have to ride from l i to 2 miles and even 5 miles every day from the homestead to the ^ mail road on the off-chance that there may be an important letter for him. Where a person is within a reasonable distance of a mail route, or even if he is inconveniently situated, the Postmaster-General, should include terms in mail contracts requiring the contractors to run their services so as to suit the people. We should provide money so that country people shall not be obliged to travel long distances each mail day from week to week and month ,to month to get their mails.",129
524,Mr LISTER,Unknown,Many of those people would object to the mailman carrying their letters loose. ',129
525,Mr CUNNINGHAM,Unknown,"The mails are carried in bags which are dropped into the letter boxes and the addressee has to ride, very often several miles, on the chance that the mail may contain a letter for him.

If he had a definite intimation from honourable members upon this important subject, his hand would be strengthened with his colleagues in Cabinet. I believe many honourable members are in sympathy with my views. This amendment will give them an opportunity of registering their opinion. The amendment is not a censure motion. I submit it merely to give honourable members an opportunity of demonstrating where their sympathies lie in this matter. I have no doubt that I shall be met with the objection that it will entail certain expenditure that was not contemplated, but I submit that we should have a departmenwhich tal contingency fund to meet the addiphone tional charges.

There are other tricts in my constituency which require further facilities. At Hartwell and South Camberwell there are no post-offices, are badly needed, as are also telecabinets. Population in these districts has greatly increased and postal have not kept pace. I call attennot tion to these facts to show that a great deal still remains to be done in order to the city and suburban services really The telephone service in Melbourne is still far from satisfactory, particularly after 6 o'clock at night, when it would appear'that the staff is considerably reduced, and it is difficult to obtain connection. There is also a necessity for a parcels van to call for parcels' of any The only other matter to which I desire to refer is one that has already been mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition I desire to support what that honourable gentleman ought^ said in regard to wireless, and to call particular attention to the fact that under the new regulations it is proposed to continue the issue, as in the the past, of what are called experimenter's Ordinary receiving licences, as experimenter's licences, which of give so much joy and pleasure, and afford so many opportunities for the aca quisition of scientific knowledge to the of the younger portion of the community, and to many adults, are also to be issued as in the past. If that is done, there will not any subscribers, from a practical point posiof view, to broadcasting companies that in may be formed. The experimentep's. licence entitles the licensee to have a receiving instrument which is adjustable to any wave length within its capacity. Th'e idea of the new regulations is that broadcasting companies should be licensed to operate on a certain wave length, and the that receiving instruments' should be Any it is person with an adjustable receiver Some will, however, be able to "" listen to broadcasting. Accordingly, the if the licences are to be . issued in as in the past, it will be impossible is for broadcasting companies to make a Decommercial success of their ventures. The In Postmaster-General should hesitate before deissuing any broadcasting transmitting licences under the regulations, which pro:; vide that the licensee shall deposit disor give security for £1,000 in return for a licence for five years. At this early stage of broadcasting"" it - would be dangerous to issue licences for so long a period. I urge on the Postmaster-General, as I did on another occasion, that these regulations be reconsidered in the interests of the public, and particularly in the interests of the development of broadcasting. licences, I understand, are intended to assist that development, but there is grave reason to fear that they may have the opposite effect. The fee to be charged by the broadcasting licensee is not specified in the regulations, and the Minister has no power under the regulations to fix, limit , or restrict the fee in any way. It may be that the Minister may endeavour to 'do so as a matter of administration, but the regulations do not entitle him to take that course. The result is that, if a broadcasting licence were issued, a company, having made the deposit of £1,000, or lodged security to that amount, would be entitled to operate for five years, subject to conditions which are to be approved, but which relate only to the efficiency of the service. present state of knowledge in Australia, it is dangerous to accept a deposit and issue in return there for a licence for that length of time. I hope that, in the in terests of amateurs or experimenters, and in the. interests of the development of broadcasting, the regulations will be reconsidered.",130

535,Mr GIBSON,Unknown,"Yes . Mr A . GREEN (Kalgoorlie) [9.41 a.m.] - Severa l grievances concerning the Postal Department have been submitted to me. In Perth at present there is no Saturday half-holiday, although this These privilege exists in Melbourne. It is becoming generally recognized' throughout the Commonwealth and other civilized countries that shops and business places -'the opening of which on Saturday afternoons was formerly considered necessary-shoul d now be closed every Saturday afternoon. As an example, I refer to the chemists' shops in the metropolitan area of Melbourne. As the Saturday half-holiday has not caused disorganization of postal arrangements in Melbourne and other capital cities of the Commonwealth where it applies, the same privilege should be given to Perth. There are few residents in the central portions of the city, and private persons wishing to transact business on Saturday afternoons could do so at suburbanoffices. In the I ask'the Minister (Mr Gibson) to consider' this suggestion from a broad and democratic stand-point. Under the Superannuation Act single men in the Postal Department are penalized, because no provision is made for dependants in case of the death, of those officers.",131
536,Mr GIBSON,Unknown,"The Superannuation Board is working under the Act , and the postal administration has no control over it . Mr A . GREEN - The Ac t should be amended. I urge the Minister to bring this matter under the notice of the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce). In Western Australia the travelling allowance for linesmen has been reduced from 14s. 6d. to 13s. per day, and the Minister might well look into that matter. Another grievance concerns an old [Quorum comrade of mine, named W . R . Seery, „ with whom I worked nearly thirty years ago> in the Perth Post Office. He has been in that. Department for thirty-four years. I can obtain later the full data for the Minister,, but, speaking from memory, a charge was laid against this man for an offence of which my knowledge of him leads me to believe he is incapable. A lady alleged that late one evening she walked into the Perth Post Office and handed to Mr Seery a gold watch for parcel postage. According to the lady's version the parcel did not arrive at its destination in Adelaide, and it was alleged that the watch was disposed of by Mr Seery's wife .in a second hand shop. Although that a gold watch was so disposed of by his wife, Mr Seery claims that it was not the article in question. I that on the face of it the looks bad, but the case was tried by the Court, aud Seery was I have worked in the post-office mail room, and I know that in the community thousands who enclose £5 notes tered letters and expect reach their destination. A number of postal officials have been arrested because, they have not been able to resist the temptation to appropriate taining money. This officer had passed through such a fiery ordeal for four years, and had never had a charge laid against him. It would, be a most peculiar thing if he succumbed to temptation in this instance. course, we know of cases rnen who have gone straight all their lives have suddenly given temptation. The Court, however, missed the charge that was laid against Seery. The Postal Department that Seery's case should first be dealt with at a departmental inquiry. rightly adopted the attitude that Seery's interests would be .prejudiced course were followed and the mental board condemned him. I know of men who have been adjudged guilty by departmental inquiries oh evidence would not stand investigation by a Court of law.

I hope therefore, that the Postmaster-General (Mr Gibson) will review the decision. Of Mr GIBSON (Corangamite - Postwhere master-General) [9.56 a.m.] - Unti l recently there were noregulations governway to ing the broadcasting of wireless. Ausdis- tralia has, perhaps, done less than any other country in this direction. I hold desired the opinion that in the near future wireless will play a big part in the transHis lawyer mission of news. It would be a very great mistake to allow it to be made if that the plaything of children, and to predepart- vent its having its' full commercial value. The .action which I took in regard to broadcasting was exactly similar t'o that that which was taken by New Zealand, Great Britain, and some other countries. A' conference was held of those interested of in the broadcasting of wireless. Very across many requests were made to me to convene such a Conference, and I did so. and men Sufficient time was given to those in terested in the matter to attend the Conand ferencef It was a most representative gathering, practically every State and that they every interest being represented. Those together. very people who are now complaining cannot be to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr . concern. Charlton) and to the honourable member despite for Kooyong (Mr Latham) were amongst Correspond- the delegates to the Conference, and and it is took their part in the framing of the regulations. Because .they believe there is some little difference between the regulations as issued and tliose that were agreed to, they are now for their amendment. The ference sat for two days, and a committee was appointed on which these dissatisfied persons had a representative. That committee adopted the very regulations that we now have before us. In receiving the regulations from the Conference I asked, "" Is the Conference unanimous in regard to these regulations ?"" Not a solitary objection was voiced. I then said, "" You absolutely surprise me. I expected some of you, at all events, to object to some portions of these regulations. I have adopted the attitude which was adopted by the British Government, and if these regulations are a failure the responsibility will rest on your shoulders and not on mine."" This subject has given me more thought than any that I have tackled since ' I have been administering the Postal Department. Misleading statements have been made in regard to the application of these regulations to broadcasters who propose to erect stations for the purpose of broadcasting. It is quite true that under the regulations a person will be required to have a sealed set. It might just as well be urged that any boy in the street should be given the privilege of making a connection with a telephone wire and listening to the messages that pass over the telephone, as that he should be allowed to listen in when messages or entertainments are being broadcasted at very great expense. We have arranged to regulate in the direction of having broadcasting stations licensed. As the honourable member for Kooyong said, a guarantee of good f a it h has to be given to the extent of £1,000. If this were not done there would be a number of "" w i ld cat"" schemes organized. Subscriptions would be charged, instruments would be sold to the people, and thousands of pounds would be collected. Then the whole scheme might 'be closed down, and no broadcasting done. A guarantee is now given to_ the people who subscribe that a service will be given, but there is in no sense a monopoly. We have received several applications for licences to broadcast, and no subscription whatever is to be charged. I ask honourable members not to condemn the regulations until they have been tried. They are not like the laws of the Medes asking and the Persians; they can be altered Con-, until we obtain regulations that will satisfactorily govern the broadcasting of wireless I hope that the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Cunningham) will withdraw his amendmenb, seeing that the policy of the Government is sympathetic towards the mail-carriers to whom . - the honourable member has referred. The amount for the mail contracts in New South Wales has been increased by £19,000, and the vote for the whole of the Stat.es, independent of the carting of mails by railways, has been augmented by £33,568. Mr G. RILEY (Cook) [10.4 a.m.] - I call attention to the sum of £41,000 provided for meal allowances, and I emphatically protest against the regulations that have been drawn up by the Public Service Board. Regulation 68 statesWhere an officer whose ordinary hours of duty are between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. is required to attend for duty before 6.30 a.m., or to remain on duty after 6.30 p.m., and where an officer is required to commence duty at least two hours before the usual time, or to remain on duty at least two hours beyond the usual time, and such attendance necessitates his obtaining a meal away from home, he shall be granted a meal allowance according to salary on the following scale :Salary. Allowance. s. d. £750 and over ... ... ... 4 0 £500, and under £750 ... ... 3 0 £400. and under £500 ... ... 2 6 Under £400 2 0 It a k e ' it that the men in the lower grades should receive the same meal allowance as the Deputy Postmaster General, or any other highly-paid official. Probably, if justice were done, the lowsalaried man would receive more than those above him. Is it thought that an officer-receiving £750 a year requires more sustenance than an officer beneath him, who probably has to do heavier work, or does the Board consider that the higher the salary received by an officer the more he should receive by way of meal allowance to enable him to have a more expensive meal ? The allowance should at least be uniform.",131
537,Mr GIBSON,Unknown,"I shall put the matter before the Prime Minister. Mr C. RILEY - I hope the Government will not shelve their responsibility by saying that it is a matter for the Public Service Board. Honourable members should protest against such glaring anomalies as one officer receiving twice the allowance granted to another. The amount on the Estimates for the Postal Institute in New South Wales is £1,064. I understand that an officer has - been appointed to attend to the accounts of the Institute, and if my information is correct he receives an allowance for that work. Seeing that there are great numbers of returned soldiers and others out of employment, would it not be better to create a new position rather than allow an officer already in receipt of a good salary to have an extra allowance for additional work i Another matter to which I desire briefly to refer can be quickly indicated by the following extract from a letter I have received from the secretary of the New South Wales Branch of the Australian Postal Electricians UnionThe costly and cumbersome costing system, and the staffing of the professional division in our branch, are making the overhead charges so heavy that equipment that should be manufactured locally is in a number of instances imported. These heavy charges result in increasing the cost of manufacture in Australia. It is most unfair to the workmen employed in the Department that their labour costs should be over-burdened to such an extents-thu s causing much material to be imported which could otherwise be manufactured in Australia.",133
538,Mr MARR,Unknown,"Parkes) [10.10 a.m] - I ask the Postmaster-General to consider, in connection with the new Postal Rates Bill, which will be introduced this session, the question of reducing the telegraphic rate. The present charge for Inter-State messages is I d . per word, with a minimum charge of Is. 4d. Much time would be saved to officers of the Department if the minimum charge was reduced to Is. Some consideration might also be given to a proosal to charge varying rates for Intertate messages. At the present time it 'costs as much to send a telegram from Wodonga to Albury as from Port Darwin to Townsville, vid Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney, and Rockhampton. I suggest that the charges should be based on a zoning system.",134
539,Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON,Unknown,Migh t not the adoption of that suggestion involve increases in certain instances?,134
540,Mr MARR,Unknown,"I do not think it would be necessary to make any increases. On the contrary, the suburban rate might be reduced to 6d., at which it previously stood. The facilities for lodging lettergrams should also be extended. These are now accepted only at the head office. Why should they not be accepted at every suburban office, so that residents of the suburbs might enjoy the same facilities in this respect as people in the cities? They are handed in as deferred telegrams, and despatched whenever a clear line is available. In some offices the slack period is in the middle of the day; in others, it is in-' the afternoon. As suburban offices close at 6 p.m., this facility could very easily be granted. 1 also desire to urge the establishment of an exchange at Lakemba. I do not wish to encroach upon the electorate of the honourable member for Reid (Mr Coleman), but the people on the Belmore . railway line are united in their desire for this exchange. In the Canterbury municipality alone there are nearly 50,000 ratepayers, and they are unable to get a telephone exchange, and along the Belmore line there are approximately 1,000 subscribers, and there would be more if the exchange were provided. An extra rate is charged to these people because they live more than a certain distance from the Ashfield, Burwood, and Homebush Exchanges. Such treatment of people in a thickly populated area is not fair, and, moreover, the absence of an exchange is not economical for the Department. If an exchange were provided money could be saved, and subscribers given much more efficient service. I hope, also, that the Minister will give further consideration to the request for the establishment of a post-office at Hurlstone Park. This office is very much needed in the interests of a thickly populated area.*  [10.15 a.m.] - I wish to bring under the notice 'of the Postmaster-General the miserable remuneration given to those people who run allowance post-offices in the country. Those in control of semi official offices complain bitterly of what happens to them when they build up an office to official status. They suddenly find themselves - without a job. kind of treatment is unfair to people who are in charge of semi-official offices, and discourages them from putting forward their best efforts in the interests of. the Department and the public. I bring the matter under the notice of the Postmaster-General in the hope that he will do something to see that men who give their time and energy to the building up of these offices will not be thrown out of employment because of their success. I have received several complaints of this character. Then there are the allowance offices. I know the stereotyped answer of the Department to requests for increased allowances to the persons in charge of these offices. It is pointed out that allowance post-offices are given only to persons who have another business. There are many places, particularly small places out-back, where it is not possible to run any other' business in conjunction with an allowance office. They have to be at the beck and call of the public, not only during ordinary office hours, but at all times. A huge institution like the Post Office, which is showing a large profit, should do something to improve the conditions of these people. While I am thankful for small mercies, and admit that the Postmaster-General is doing something to meet the position, there is still a grievance in country districts that the greater proportion of the money voted for new works is spent in city areas. Last year £58,462 was spent in the country in New South Wales as against £244,429 in the-city areas. A sum of £1,400 was to have been expended on a new building at Wagga. The existing post-office building is a disgrace to such a place, which is one of the best towns between Sydney and Melbourne. In the Estimates this year a sum of only £500 is provided. The postmaster is compelled to live in. a hotel, where he cannot afford to keep his wife and family, and because of the want of quarters they have to live in Sydney. I give that instance to show that fair treatment is not being given to the country districts. As I desire to test the Committee on this question, I give notice of my intention to move That the proposed vote be reduced by 10s. . I shall move that amendment to indicate to the Government that provision should be made for more liberal payments That officers in charge of semi-official and allowance offices.",134
541,Mr MACKAY,Unknown,"Lilley) [10.20 a.m.] On behalf of the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr D. Cameron), who is absent by leave of the House, I wish to bring under the notice of the Postmaster General the urgent necessity for remodelling the post-office at Brisbane. There are also important suburbs of the city in which allowance offices inadequately cater for the needs of the people. In my own electorate, Lilley, application for official offices to take the place of allowance offices have been made from places like Nundah and Hamilton. The suburb of Windsor, which contains something like 15,000 inhabitants, has special claims for immediate consideration.' I hope these matters will be attended to in the near future. I ""congratulate the Minister on having effected some reforms that have been urged for long years past, particularly on the decision to allow State engineers to expend larger sums than hitherto on their own responsibility. This will result in a greSjt saving of time and increased convenience to the public.",135
542,Mr COLEMAN,Unknown,"Eeid) [10.21 a.m.] - ' I direct attention to the urgency of providing the full amount required for the construction of a post-office and telephone exchange in Lakemba, New South Wales. This is a matter of mutual interest to the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Marr) and myself. We are inundated with complaints of the inconvenience caused by the congestion of the lines in that district. The paltry sum of £500 is placed on the Estimates towards the cost of con-' struction of the exchange, the total estimated cost of which is £3,660. It is also' important that the'full amount necessary to complete the construction of the Belmore and Guildford post-offices should .be provided. I regret that greater opportunity is not given to discuss the hundreds of complaints I have received. Mr F. FRANCIS (Henty) [10.24 a.m.].. - I ask the Postmaster-General (Mr Gibson) to hurry on with the building of the long-promised and overdue post-offices in my electorate. I cannot say I am pleased at the small amount set down on account to of the post-office in Bay-street, North . Brighton. The site is a most valuable one, and ought to be utilized ; an'd the people are extremely anxious to have ' the office completed. At Carnegie, and particularly at Oakleigh, there are excellent sites available, and I trust the work of building will be expedited.",135
543,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"Capricornia) [10.26 a.m.] - I regret very much that we have not considerably more time in which to discuss these Estimates, because, no doubt, valuable suggestions could be made that would assist the Postmaster-General (Mr . . Gibson) in removing some of the anomalies of administration. I impress on the honourable gentleman the .necessity for extended postal and telephonic facilities in country districts. I am in accord with the amendment moved - by the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr . Cunningham). I give the Postmaster-General credit for an earnest desire to help honourable in their efforts to see that the needs of the people are not neglected. more generous consideration is required - in the case of mai l contractors^ and those in charge of allowance offices. , The mail contractors are given an in sufficient forage allowance, and allowance postmasters and postmistresses are much underpaid. I have no time to deal with these matters in detail, but I strongly protest against the action of the Department in compelling people who live on the outskirts of towns 'to subscribe something like £ 2 0 towards the expense of a daily mail delivery. I know several instances of the kind, and I am certain honourable members agree that the public should not be penalized in this way while postal 'rates are being reduced to benefit the big commercial houses in the cities. I urge the importance of cheaply-constructed telephone lines in country centres. I believe the Postmaster General himself favours them. Eor , country districts we do not require extensions costing £60 per mile, but merely cheap lines sufficient for the needs of isolated districts. I have received a complaint from Brisbane, regarding mails for No r t h Queensland. class mail matter, which is carried by sea from Brisbane, is often detained in the metropolis awaiting a contract boat north because the Department objects to paying the charges of a non-contract boat. This is very unfair to North Queensland. Perhaps the Minister will be good enough to peruse the speeches which have been made, and look"" into the matter. Another complaint is of the great congestion at the Brisbane Post Office. I understand that the honourable member for Lilley (Mr .

I am informed that the mails for Rockhampton have missed the train at times because of. the congestion. It is said that the office is understaffed, and that the employees labour under all kinds of disabilities, rendering the service by no means efficient. Mails are sometimes delayed for a fortnight or members three weeks, according to definite inside information, which I shall hand over to the Postmaster-General. There is another Much little matter I should like to mention. Under the old Public Service Act,, f females employed in the Postmaster General's Department were given a special allowance on their retirement in case of marriage. When the Bill to amend the Act was before this House I think provision for a continuance of this practice was inadvertently omitted. As 'a result, the Department has sent out a circular to the female employees, stating that no such payment will be made on and after the date of the proclamation of the Act. I ask the Minister to look into this matter and have it rectified.",136

549,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Hunter) [10.51 surely a.m.] - I do not find faul t with the. duction in the amount proposed to expended by the Department of Health this year if it ' is not to be at the of the health of the community. The population is growing. We know that various diseases and malignant growths * have increased. We are bringing large numbers of immigrants to Australia every month, some of whom it is alleged require medical attention. If money can be saved without an injurious effect on public health it will be all right. The estimated expenditure in connection with war pensions this year is £7,000,000. The expenditure last year was £7,134,967. There is thus a very substantial decrease. It is a good thing if men have reable-bodied covered and are no lpnger entitled to pension; but if the reduction is due the fact that the pension is being taken from men who are unable to follow their usual'employment and are not able to earn the same amount of money that they earned prior to enlistment, it is a the wrong direction. We should - not at adopt a cheeseparing policy. Returned . soldiers are endeavouring to have the Pensions Act liberalized. I think they They want attention to be given to the widows and orphans of the soldiers who . have fallen. That will hot mean a very Surely Parliament the can - make provision for medical attention to be available to women who have been left with little ones, in order that they may not be called upon to deplete their to a scanty income. There is a section of the allotted men whom the doctors have certified to the be permanently incapacitated and not the likely to be again in a condition to do of any work. They are receiving the full on pension. Another section-thos e who are totally incapacitated and unable to work - d o not receive the full pension. That distinction should not exist. If men are which totally incapacitated and are unable to among > follow their employment, surely they be entitled to receive the full penbefore sion. A couple of years ago I expressed with the Boards which had be probeen appointed to deal with these cases. I do not think any honourable member will contend that a distinction should be drawn between men who are totally in . capacitated and those who are certified to be permanently incapacitated. If a man cannot work for twelve months he should be given the full pension refor that period. Parliament never in be tended to make any difference between these men. Representatives of the reexpense turned soldiers waited on me this week and assured me that this distinction exists, and that men who are totally in capacitated are not receiving the full pension. The sooner the Minister sees that this anomaly is rectified the better. There is another section of men whose in capacity is estimated at about 65 per cent. Those poor unfortunate men cannot get work. The employers who will give work to a man who is 65 per cent, incapacitated are few and far between. They want to get as much work as possible for jthe money they pay, and the y ' look for men. These poor fellows are a given a reduced pension, which they are to unable to supplement. The pensioner in many cases has a wife and children. There is no doubt that the Government of the day made a. mistake in not paying war gratuities in cash. At that time Australia was step in borrowing money at 5 per cent. Had the amount of the gratuity been borrowed the cost to the Commonwealth would have been as great as it has been, because time. it would not have been necessary to lish ' additional Departments. < soldiers who were given cash put it into a business or a home.",138

In connection the payment of war gratuities, it is pected that the expenditure this year be £12,000. Last year £23,744 was paid out on that account. I suppose the total expenditure under that head £50,000 to £60,000. This amount could have been sav.ed had cash been given stead of bonds. I hope that the Treaditure surer will pay the gratuities at the been paid off long ago. earliest posible moment. - Dr EARLE PAGE - They are all due next May.",139
552,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I know that. The orable expenditure this year on loan conversion, it is' estimated, ' will be £50,000. year £183,635 was expended. That is very heavy expenditure on a loan of £17,000,000. If a similar expenditure occurs whenever loans are converted, cost of those loans will be added to siderably. I take it the only loan be converted this year will be that is now on the market. The conversion with the gratuities. may cost, a good deal more than the £50,000 estimated. The strange thing is that the flotation of loans today considerably more than it did during the war. That should not be the case. It is about time that something was done to minimize this expenditure. The interest this year on loans for war purposes w i ll amount to £12,227,872. Last £12,187,604 was expended in that direction. The increase this year therefore, £40,268. That plainly shows that the cost is becoming greater with maturing of every fresh loan. In the Repatriation past it was argued that the rate of i terest would drop a couple of years the cessation of hostilities. show, however, that the cost is ing.

554,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,I do not look upon the on any administration of the pensions system by ' the Repatriation Department as particularly good at present.,139
555,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"A considerable saving in money would result, from its 'abolition. Such departments were rendered necessary by the war, but as the expenditure is now decreasing, it would be economical to transfer the work to another department, especially in view of the fact that a more satisfactory deal would then be received by the soldiers. If we paid off the war gratuities we could save £50,000 or £60,000 per annum by abolishing the Repatriation Department.",140
556,Mr SEABROOK,Unknown,Would that not swell the ranks of the unemployed ? ,140
557,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"We ought to be able to absorb most of the officers now engaged in the Repatriation Department. If we could not employ them they should be compensated. It will be necessary to put off a number of men as a result of the policy of curtailing the operations of the Federal taxation offices, but no doubt many of the employees in that Department will-be engaged by the State Taxation Departments. ' I am quite satisfied that very little money will be saved to the taxpayers under the new-scheme. Under the new arrangement the States will have to collect more money, and a larger number of men than they now employ will be required. It would be a good plan for the Treasurer to get into touch with the, various State Governments, and ascertain how many additional men will be needed.",140
558,Mr SEABROOK,Unknown,"The abolition of a - Federal Department would naturally throw men out of employment; and work, according to honourable members opposite, cannot be found for the present unemployed - six months after the date of the pub",140

No potential wealth producer should be permitted to remain idle, but expenditure should be cut down where that can legitimately be done. We should conduct the affairs of the country just as we would our private businesses. Personally, I do not think the work of collecting Federal taxes should be given to the State authorities. The Federal Parliament should be supreme in these matters.",140

566,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"Swan) [11.18 a.m.] I desire to draw attention to the administration of the Repatriation' Commission. F u l l power to. interpret the various sections of the War Pensions Act was given to the Commissioners, and the Treasurer under whose department the matter falls has, I understand, no power to alter a - decision of the Commissioners without an amending Act or a strong intimation from Parliament. Every honourable member is desirous that the promises made by Parliament to the returned soldiers shall be carried out to the letter. The definition section of the War Pensions Act states that "" dependants"" includes "" the parents of any such person who are, at any time after the occurrence of the event resulting in his death, without adequate means of support."" Section 2 makes a pension payable on the death of a soldier provided that(a) A claim for payment of a pension in accordance with this Act is made(i) in case of the death of a member of the Forces-by a dependant not more than lic notification by-the Minister in theGazette of the death of the member, except in the case of parents whothough not dependent upon the earnings of the member at the time of his death are at any time without adequate means of support. Let me .bring under the notice of honourable members one t>f many instances. The only' son in a family, went to the'war and was killed. At that time the parents were' in a sound position. They were supposed to be wealthy, and no application whatever was made for a. pension. Later on the father died and. his estate was found to be insolvent. The mother was lef t with a little over garding what Parliament - desires. £1,000, which today has diminished £900. I advised her . to apply for a war pension, and she did so, but was told that one could . not be granted to her; but that had her husband died within three years of liament, her boy, she could have obtained one, even though she had an income of £1,000 a year. He r income is £40 a year. She was formerly in good and reasonable conditions of livingcircumstances, and is about fifty-seven or fifty-eight years of age. The Departadoption ment said to her, "" We cannot give a pension while you have the money. additional Spend the money, and then come to us, when we shall be able to give you a sion."" According to the Commissioner she has to become a pauper before she eligible for a pension. I - have asked Department to define what it means by "" adequate means of support.""- The Act is quite clear in its intention that person who is without adequate means of support at any time after the death of his son while on active service, may, although perhaps not dependent upon him at the time of his death, apply for a pension. how carelessly the question has been thought out, I may instance a statement by a Commissioner, who said to me, ' "" Have you ever heard of a person being arrested for not having adequate of support, although he had £100 in his pocket?"" People are arrested, not for not having "" adequate means of supa.m.] port,"", but for not having "" visible means of support."" The Department contends that a person who possesses £100 is closed. or over does not come within the definiportant tion of the section. I would go so far to say that no person should receive - pension if be was in receipt of more a certain sum. If a person was in receipt of, say, £150 a year, the Commissioners would be justified in saying that he' adequate means of support, but the, the greatest importance. woman to whom I have referred, who has an income of only £ 4 0 a year, not adequate means of support. I have advised her not to follow the advice the Commissioners and spend her money. The Treasurer (D r Page) is full y aware of. the position. In other circumstances I would have proposed a reduction of the item, not with a view to embarrassing the Gothat vernment, but to get Parliament press to the Commissioners an opinion reI to content myself, however, with bringing the matter under the notice of honourable members, so that pressure may be brought to bear upon the Commissioners to induce them to carry out the intention of Parwhich was that if , in the opinion of the Commissioners, a person had not adequate means of support-that is, a about yearly income which would provide fair : a pension should be granted. The of the suggestion would, I "" you admit, involve the Government in expenditure. There are other instances similar to those I have pencited. I know of an engineer who went to the front with his son. The son was is killed, and the engineer died' and lef t the' only £800 worth of life assurance policies to his wife. She applied for a pen-, sion and was told that she had adequate any means of support. Parliament, when it passed the Act,. did not intend that the possession of that small amount of ready money should be regarded as "" adequate means of support."" I am not asking for anything new, but merely for what ParTo show liament deliberately placed' in an Act . The action of the Commissioners is con-, trary to the intentions of Parliament, and is wholly unjust. I leave the matter there, hoping that the Government and means, Parliament will take action later.",140
567,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"Batman) [11.26 - I wish, with due consideration for the claims of other honourable members, to say only a few words before the debate A very large number of im-questions arise in connection with as this vote.

569,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"I cannot forget that the Treasurer told me something similar in connection with other matters in the Estimates, and I am not overimpressed with his promises, because I do not think he is quite clear as to the measure of time that will be allowed to the House.",142
570,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,There will also be a War Service Homes Amending Bill.,142
571,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"I appreciate the fact that an amending Act is promised; but it may or may not be discussed. The question might very advantageously, and very properly, have been opened up on the discussion of the Estimates. I say no more than that for the present, but I wish to lose no opportunity to deal with the subject. In the electorate which I have the honour to represent there is a very large number of occupants of War Service Homes, and they have many just complaints. I have been asked to introduce a deputation next week in connection with the matter, which, as every one knows, is a ,most complicated one. There is scarcely a member of Parliament who does not desire to bring individual cases under notice. A very informative address on the question of national health was given in this Committee by the honourable member for Darling (Mr Blakeley), and I venture to express regret that no representative of the Ministry has made any statement upon a subject of such importance. Although we labour under many disadvantages in having this Government,"" we have an advantage in the fact that it includes as Treasurer an eminent medical man. I am quite prepared to concede that much. He is a ' man who, in the pursuit of his profession, has rendered very distinguished services to the community. I make that declaration apart from political considerations. I suggest that it would have been appropriate if Parliament had had the advantage of his advice and assistance in connection with the question of health. One phase of health is the much-debated Spahlinger treatment for tuberculosis. I am very much interested in that, and in the meagre newspaper reports regarding the extent to which it is being tested. At times I have felt deep disappointment by reason of the fact that the Government was apparently regarding this alleged cure lukewarmly, if not indifferently. Such an attitude, is not fair to the people of the Commonwealth. Tuberculosis is a dread disease, and if, by the expenditure of a few thousand pounds-nay , I would say millions of pounds-w e could introduce a reliable corrective to the dread bacillus, we would be spending money wisely, and in a direction that would have the support of every member of Parliament. I can merely ""mention those twoor three matters, and there are a host of others which might Avell have been discussed under the same heading had timepermitted. I want to allow other honourable members a few minutes for discussion before the time limit is reached. I conclude, as I began, with a public protest against the way in which the Estimates .have been handled and Parliament has been treated by the Government.",142
572,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"Cowper-Trea surer) [11.31] - I wish to state very plainly. the Government's attitude on the question of health. I listened very attentively to the able speech delivered the other day by the honourable member for Darling (Mr Blakeley). The subject on which he spoke should be ventilated much more than it is. His speech was a distinct contribution to the discussion of national health, and that discussion might easily be added to from many other sources. The Government is anxious, and has shown itself very desirous, of proceeding with a national health policy, but its activities are very much hampered by the fact that it cannot bring the States into line. At the Premiers' Conference the Government put forward proposals, and pressed the States very hard, to assist us with expert advice in forming a Royal Commission to investigate the whole question, and define definitely the spheres of the Commonwealth Government, the State Governments, and the municipal authorities. The most we could do was to obtain'the consent of the States to their public health officers discussing the matter with the ' Commonwealth health officer, after which the States would consider the representations made by those oflicers. The Government has endeavoured to arrange that conference. I have repeatedly urged that it should be held, but we have not been able to arrange it up to the present. As soon as that conference takes place I am hopeful that we shall be able to have a Royal Commission, so that by this time next year we shall be able to adopt a definite line of action, and go straight ahead with a national health policy. This should lead not only to a discussion of the health of the community, but also to the adoption of measures to prevent the spread of disease, which, as was shown by the late war, can be done on a big scale. The difficulty we have had with the States explains why the proposed vote is almost the same as that for last year. Regarding tuberculosis and the possibility of discovering a cure, the Govern- merit's position is quite plain. could see with any certainty a definite cure for that disease, or any process that would markedly alleviate and lessen the effects of it in the community, it would pay almost any price, and think that price cheap, to secure such a benefit. The Government is quite in the dark regarding the merits of the Spahlinger cure. We have sent representatives abroad, but they have not been able to obtain the information we desire. is nob the Government's duty to ""buy a pig in"" a poke.""",142
573,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,Some private practitioners have given some useful information.,143
574,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"The Government has tried to get official and definite statements to enable it to determine whether the process is worth purchasing by the Government. During a previous - debate, honourable members mentioned some undoubtedly hard cases amongst - soldiers Avho are suffering from ill-health. Of course, the medical histories of these men are confidential, and it would be unf a i r to the patients to have the facts recorded in Hansard simply on the ground that they are in receipt of pensions. However, I have gone personally into - each of the cases, and I have made the 'suggestion that a sub-committee consisting of soldier members of the House, one from each of the three parties, be appointed to make the necessary inquiries. If the suggestion is adopted we shall feel assured that the men .will receive just .and sympathetic treatment.",143
575,Mr COLEMAN,Unknown,Will full effect given to the recommendations of such a - committee?,143
576,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"That is a matmately ter which could' be discussed w committee; as I have said I do not think we are justified in discussing such cases on the floor of the House, and thus placing on record facts which might be read by the descendants of these men. No attempt whatever has been made to diminish the war pensions, nor has there been any falling-away in the sympathy which 0 is extended to the recipients. Many of these men areextremely ill , and some of them, unfortunately, die. That is one"" way, of course, in which the total expen- "" diture tends to diminish. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) referred If it to the necessity for medical treatment for embarrassed widows and children. The Government is going into that matter very carefully, and I hope to be able during the next week to suggest to the House any amendment of the Act that may be considered necessary. However, we may be able to accomplish what we desire by means of regulation. The cases of incapacity may be divided into two classes. There is, It in the first instance, the disability which is set down by the Medical Board as 65 per cent, or 70 per cent. It is found that men with 70 per cent, dis- ability who have been a'ccustomed to clerical or other light occupations have not much difficulty in supplementing their pensions. On the other hand, there are those who have been accustomed to msnual labour requiring full health and strength, and they suffer considerable hardship. I hope during next week to present to honourable members some definite proposal to meet these latter cases. The control of the Repatriation Department, mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition, is receiving the careful attention of the Government. It will have been noticed that the appointment of the Repatriation Commission has been renewed - for only jme year, during which, it is hoped, the Government will be able to co-ordinate the Old-age and Invalid Pensions Department and the Pensions Branch of the Repatriation Department. The object is, at first, to enable these to run on parallel lines, with a view to their be complete association. Both staffs are to be housed in the building of the Repatriation Department, and it is hoped ultito effect a considerable saving in it h the the administrative charges. The matter referred to by the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) is one of interpretation of the Act . The patriation Commission take ""adequate means of support"" to mean some amount of ready money sufficient to prevent absolute necessity. However, the manner in which this Act shall be interpreted and administered must be in accordance with the views and wishes of honourable members. In the short time still available, 1 should be glad to have an expression of opinion from honourable members on the point. My own idea is that a more liberal interpretation should be applied than in the past. The mothers of soldiers should at the very least be placed on the level of old-age and invalid pensioners in this regard. I am now referring to the amount of property and money that an old-age or invalid pensioner may possess without in any way jeopardizing the right to a pension. It is difficultto say what should be the l i m it , and cretionary power must be given to the Commission. At present an old-age pensioner may occupy his own house, or may possess £310 worth of property. amount will be increased in the amending Bill to be introduced.",143
577,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,"Hindmarsh) [11.43 a.m.] - We have now been sitting not some twenty-five hours, during which date. we have, without discussion or explanathat tion of any moment, voted £18,690,645. During the whole of this long night deserters' wives. Miss I have been endeavouring to catch the eye of the Chairman in order to for air the grievances and desires of those whom I represent. I deprecate strongly the manner in which I have been since deprived of. the opportunity to do so, even in the matter of postal and telestances, who stated "" I believe Mrs. phonic communication which so vitally interests every member of the community. Thus I have been unable to emphasize Soldiers' Fund. the importance of items which were in cluded in last year's Estimates, but find no place in the Estimates before us. refer particularly to the provision f o telephone exchange in the western suburbs of Adelaide. It is really shockance in g the way in which these Estimates in are being bludgeoned through without tinuous any opportunity, as I say, for criticism or explanation. ' I observe that the vote feel for the Department of Health has been the decreased instead of increased. After the important speech on this subject by Rethe honourable member for Darling (Mr . Blakeley) the other night, it is astounding to observe the apathy of the Government. I have had an opportunity to visit 'the serum depot, and I know how its operations are cramped by reason of the limited monetary support that it receives. The attention of the country should be directed to the anomalous and extraordinary methods of this Government in voting millions of money for in discriminate immigration and reducing the amount to the important Department of Health. I hope that, when the time comes, the people, in their righteous in dignation, will sweep the present Government from power, and return one prepared to restore and maintain responsible government.",144
578,Mr YATES,Unknown,"Adelaide) [11.48 a.m.]. - I wish to revert to a case with which I some dis- dealt in an earlier debate. : This is not an isolated case, but one of many. 'The lady concerned has sent me the follow-ing letter which discloses all the facts:This I am the wife of A.I.F. who embarked on the 11th April, 1916. I have two children, aged nine and ten years. My military allowance ceased on 18th October, 1917, my husband being reported as a deserter. I have heard anything of my 'husband from that I applied to the Soldiers' Fund for assistance,' but was refused on the grounds my husband was classed as a deserter. I was informed that the Fund was not for and Miss accompanied me on that occasion. I was forced to apply to the destitute authorities assistance which was granted until Missadvanced me the sum of £55 to start a small grocery business in which I failed, but I have repaid the loan. When my business failed an official from the Military Department visited me .and inquired as to my circumthat you are in a very bad position"", and he informed me that I would be assisted from the - She was .assisted from the South Australian Soldiers' Fund for a certain' time, 1 L and then the following letter was sent r a to her by the secretary of that f u n d : Your verbal application for continued assist from a fund has been placed before the committee, and I am now directed to say that view of the fact that you have received conassistance for over two years and eight months, totalling a sum of £177, the committee the time has arrived when payment to you snould cease: Your husband being classed by military authorities as a deserter, places you iipon a different footing to a soldier's widow, and, further, the committee understand that you are able to obtain ample remunerative employment. That woman worked for the secretary of the South Australian f u n d for a month during the illness of his wife, and because she refused to remain longer, owing to the ill-health of her sister-in-law, who was caring for her children, she was dismissed. She now works at the wash' tub to support herself and children. She lives with the widow of her brother, who paid the supreme sacrifice at the Avar. She Avas not responsible for her husband's"" desertion. Other cases such as this are neglected by the Government, and unless they are remedied we shall not be doing our duty to those who fought in the war. This woman told me that she was living on charity, because she could not obtain work. What do the Government intend to do, not only in this case, but in others? We are not seriously facing the legacy of the war. I enter my emphatic protest against the Government's neglect to accept full responsibility for the aftermath of war. Mr C. RILEY (Cook) [11.53 a.m.]. - I protest against the action of the Government in the vote for health purposes. A miserable sum of £15,000 has been provided for the treatment and control of venereal diseases throughout the Commonwealth'. This disease is agrave and serious menace, as it vitally'concerns the national health of Australia. £121,000 set aside for health, £70,000 is devoted to the clerical staff, miscellaneous services, and so on. Fifty thousand pounds is < ear-marked for medical services, laboratory Avork, research, and investigation. That is quite insufficient for this vast continent. In the Estimates for this year the Health Department's, figures for Queensland and the Northern Territory are coupled together, but they are of sufficient importance to be kept separate. I cannot understand the reason for this, although it is perhaps necessary that, from an administrative stand-point,' Queensland be in close touch with the Northern Territory. I have here . an Ordinance concerning the Northern Territory which was issued in March of last year. It deals with the question of venereal disease, and I commend it to honourable members for consideration. contains far-reaching provisions, such as the compulsory notification of venereal disease, and a penalty of £500 or imprisonment for five years for any person Avho marries knowing that he is suffering from venereal disease, yet to some extent Ave are left in the dark. We have not yet had .a statement from the Minister concerning the successful operation of that Ordi nance. There is no amount on the Estimates for cancer research, and no mention of the Spahlinger treatment. If the population were menaced by an invading army, the Government would' act promptly. But they exhibit no haste to combat the ravages of f e l l diseases. It does not concern the Government, evidently, if through its failure to attend to national health, a high percentage of our manhood, in time of war, is certified to be medically unfit. A cure for tuberculosis .would cast a ray of sunshine into the lives of thousands of our returned men. The Government are too busily concerned with the Imperial and Economic Conferences and the matter of Imperia l defence to consider questions relating to the national health; but I trust that next session they will submit concrete proposals to this House. The Treasurer stated that certain things could not be done u n t i l an agreement was reached with the States. What has that to do with national health? It is no reason why the Government should shirk their responsibilities. I cannot understand why the Government, having at their disOut of posal the advice of such medical men as the honourable members for Cowper and Calare, should submit this miserable proposal. I enter my protest against it .",144
579,Mr OKEEFE,Unknown,"Denison) [11.56 a.m.] - Recently I asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health Avhy a supply of insulin had not been received by the Hobart Public Hospital. The Minister promised that supplies would be sent when available. The reply was not altogether satisfactory to the chairman of that hospital, and he wanted to know why supplies had been sent to country should hospitals in Victoria in preference to large public hospitals, such as that at Hobart. I ask the Treasurer to investigate the matter.",145
580,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"Werriwa) [11.57 a.m.] - A few moments ago the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) made the ridiculous While it statement that he wished, with in the short period of fifteen minutes, to have the opinions of honourable members on matters concerning the allowance to be. granted to mothers of soldiers. For ten minutes of that time he has been out of the chamber. If the Treasurer intends to do business in that way he cannot expect to receive any opinions from this side of the Committee.",145

ESTABLISHMEN T OF LABORATORY or HEALTH AT KALGOORLIE-PROCEEDING S IN COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY. Motion (by Mr Bruce) proposed - That the House do now adjourn. PAIRS. ' M i . A. GREEN (Kalgoorlie) [12.12]. - Arrangement s were made, by the Commonwealth Government to establish a ' laboratory of health at Kalgoorlie, but the, work has not been, put in hand. The miners at Kalgoorlie are subject to the - industrial disease known as miners' phthisis. Last year a sum of £ 5 0 0 ' was placed on the Estimates for the purpose of this laboratory, but only £ 1 0 was spent. An amount of £500 appears on the current year's Estimates, and I desire to know whether the expenditure will exceed £ 1 0 , and .whether an effectivelaboratory can be established with an expenditure of £ 5 0 0 . I find that £ 6 38 was provided on last year's Estimates for "" Medical Officer (Laboratories),"" and that there was no expenditure. This year £588 is being provided. Will any part of that sum be spent? The item "" Technical Assistant (Laboratories), £ 2 0 9 , "" was placed on last year's Estimates, and hot a penny was spent. This year £ 2 1 0 is being provided. Will anything be spentf I trust that this work will be proceeded with. Dr Cumpston, Director of Health, when in Kalgoorlie, pointed out that one man in every three, working at the face in the big mines, was suffering from miner's phthisis. I trust that the Governtreat this as an urgent matter. m . BRENNAN - (Batman) [12.13] I desire to bring before you, sir, a mat:ter of some importance. Discussion on the Estimates had to close at 12 o'clock - today. At one minute to twelve three honourable members rose to speak. Had each of those honourable members been called upon in turn each would have had 20 seconds to develop his theme. naturally hoped that the Standing Orders would be complied with, and that this meagre measure of. time would bo allowed them. 1 regret to say that, while these three honourable members were endeavouring to catch the eye of the Tern-, porary Chairman of Committees (Mr. Bayley), that gentleman rose in anticipa1 tion, - before the expiration of the time fixed, and stated the question.
