When in Brisbane recently, I informed that the Commonwealth fleet of matter. motor cars uses power alcohol as fuel. I ask the Minister, where is this fuel produced, what does it cost per gallon, are the results from its use regarded as satisfactory f",13
2,Mr GIBSON,Unknown,"The power alcohol is being manufactured in Brisbane. It is being used by the Postal Department and Defence Departmeut in both Melbourne and Brisbane. Arrangements are being made to have it used in Sydney. The comparative costs are Is. I d . per gallon for power alcohol, and 2s. per gallon for benzine. Power alcohol gives a little Jess mileage per gallon, and is therefore a little more costly than benzine, but it has been found very satisfactory to use. TUBERCULOSIS. SPAHLINGEB TREATMENT.",13
3,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I ask the Prime Minister whether he has seen the following report of a visit made by British medical experts to Geneva for the purpose of investigating the Spahlinger cure for tuberculosis: An important meeting at Crewe with reference to the Spahlinger treatment of bovine tuberculosis considered the report of exports, including Doctors Thomas Watts and J. H. Williams, who are members of the medical committee of the House of Commons. They are just back from their visit to Geneva to study Spahlinger's methods. Both reported that they want with open minds, and returned absolutely converted to tba belief that the Spahlinger treatment - was the one oure that was destined to eradicate tuberculosis from humans and cattle. In view of this report, will the Prime Minister enter into negotiations with Mr . Spahlinger with a view to the establishment of a laboratory here, and also make provision for several Australians, inindigent circumstances, who are now being treated by Mr Spahlinger at Geneva?",13
4,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"I saw the press report to which the honourable gentleman has referred. I sincerely trust that the conclusions which have been arrived at the gentlemen referred to are well founded. The Commonwealth Government, as the honourable' gentleman knows, is in touch with the Ministry of Health in Great Britain in connection with this matter. If , after further investigation, it is found t-hat the facts as the report would suggest, the ComGovernment will, unquestionwas ably, be prepared to take steps in the and AMERICANINDEPENDENCEDAY .",13
5,Mr BAYLEY,Unknown,"In viiw of the near approach of the fourth of J u ly will the Prime Minister, if he has not already done so, cause felicitous greetings to be seat to the English-speaking nation, the people of the United States Will he embody in the message an assurance that the Australian people are looking forward with a great deal of pleasure the. approaching visit of the American fleet? Will the right honourable gentlein man also send a message in a similar strain to the admiral of that fleet, which is now nearing our shores?",13
6,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,I think the honourable member raised this matter last year on about the same date. I can assure him that the fullest consideration will be given to the question whether action should taken in the direction he suggests. CONSTRUCTIO N OF CRUISERS.,14
7,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"On the 10th June I asked the Prime Minister - whether he would make available the whole of the correspondence, and also full particulars of the tenders received for the construction of the proposed two new cruisers. In reply to my question, the right honourable gentleman said that the correspondence and facts concerning the tenders which had .been received would be disclosed, as far as they could be, but it was necessary to go through the files to ascertain how much information could be made public. He promised to do that and to let me know the result. Will the Prime Minister advise me when I may expect to have that information ?",14
8,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"The files are being very closely examined. At the moment I am not in a position to tell the honourable gentleman what information, if any, will be available to him. The inspection of the files has shown that nearly all the communications there are so closely connected with secret information supplied by the British Government that it is doubtful whether very; much of the in formation can be made available. I hope that the investigation will be finished within a few days' time. VISIT OF AMERICANFLEET . Oodnadatta. SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT.",14
9,Sir AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"I ask the Commonwealth Minister in charge of the arrangements for the reception of the American fleet if he is aware that the Government of New South Wales has arranged an Alice important reunion of Commonwealth, state, and American omcers and members of Parliament for the 23rd of July ? Is true, as rumoured, that this House is not' of America? to meet on that date?",14
10,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"I proposed to make an announcement to the House at a later to hour today for the convenience of honourable members, but I shall make it now answer to the honourable member's question.

The House will adjourn on the Friday preceding the arrival of the fleet, the 17th of July, and willreassemble in the week after the fleet leaves Australia.

11,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,So m e time ago I asked the Minister representing the M in ister for Home and Territories for the names and addresses of the gentlemen who held an inquiry into th© tile and brick works at Canberra. The answer I received was not a reply to the whole of my question. I ask the Minister now whether he is prepared to supply the names and addresses of the gentlemen who held an inquiry into those works at Canberra ?,14
12,Mr MARR,Unknown,"I shall bring the honourable member's question under the notice of the Minister for Home and Territories, and shall endeavour to get the information asked for. NORTH - SOU TH RAILWAY .",14
13,Mr JACKSON,Unknown,"I wish to ask a question of the Prime Minister based on the following quotation which I make from a leading article appearing in last night's Sydney Evening News:A matter of considerable importance to the Commonwealth, although little of it is heard in New South Wales, is the completion of the north-south railway. This is a compact between the Commonwealth and South Australia in connection with the transfer to the former of the Northern Territory to bridge the gap between Oodnadatta and Alice Springs. A South Australian railway runs as far north as A Northern Territory train occasionally travels south to Alice Springs. When Alice Springs is joined with either the or state railway system, the overland route to Fort Darwin will be open. As that is one of the most glaring in accuracies ever published in a newspaper, Springs being no less than 700 miles from the rail head, will the right honourable gentleman cause such information to it be sent to the Evening News and other journals as will prevent similar misstatebeen ments about this great heritage of ours being published in future .",14
14,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"I am afraid I cannot under accept the responsibility of correcting all the inaccuracies published in the papers, but I shall see that the fullest rence of honourable members. possible information is available to the press and public of this country. NA PROTOCOL.",15

Can he now in form me when the correspondence will be made available?",15
16,Mr BRUCE,LEAGUE OF NATIONS,"The Government has oommunic'ated with all the governments of the self-governing dominions which sent cables on this subject, and replies have beeu received from most of them. I hope that I shall be able to make correspondence available during the next few days. DISTRIBUTION OF BILLS .",15
17,Mr GEEGORY,LEAGUE OF NATIONS,"The practice has grown up in this House of not making printed copies of bills available to honourable members until the second-reading stage. Bills which the Government regards as formal may not be formal in the opinion of many honourable members. In some instances, bill3 have been read second time before honourable members have had an opportunity of seeing Would it be possible, Mr Speaker, to make arrangements for copies of all bills to be handed to honourable members at the first-reading stage?",15
18,Mr SPEAKER,LEAGUE OF NATIONS,"Rt. Hon. W. A. W at t - It is not normally the practice of House to await the second-reading stage for the circulation of printed copies bills. Usually the Clerk authorizes the distribution of a bill immediately read a first time, and, as honourable members are aware, copies cannot be properly issued before then. Furthermore, the Standing Orders a bill cannot be read a first ,and a second time on the same newsday unless with the unanimous concurRecently such leave has been granted in more than one instance, and that is why the extraordinary procedure referred to by the honourable member has been followed. IMMIGRATION BILL.",15

21,Mr MAHONY,LEAGUE OF NATIONS,"In view of the widespread unemployment in Australia, and with the object of relieving it , will the Minister for Trade and Customs say whether he has given consideration t.o the the suggestion that the Government should take steps to encourage the cotton-spinning industry, either by imposing an import duty or by paying a bounty?  carefully considered by the Government, but a decision has not yet been reached. MEAT INDUSTRY.",15
22,Mr W HITSITT,LEAGUE OF NATIONS,Will the Government take full advantage of Mr J . B . a Cramsie's visit to Great Britain with a view to furthering Australian meat in them. terests in that country ?,15
23,Mr BRUCE,LEAGUE OF NATIONS,"The Government is aware of Mr Cramsie's visit to Great Britain , and has already made use of his services. It made a request that he ) . should be called to give evidence before this the Imperial Economic Committee. He was called, and has also been consulted of on several matters. He is in Great Britain primarily in the interests of the at has Australian Meat Council. REVISION OF CUSTOMS TARIFF . Mr E . RILEY - In view of the statethe ment in the Governor General's Speech that a new tariff would be bronght down at an early date, will the Government, view of the prevalence of unemployment, following submit its proposals to the House as soon Cairns: as possible ?  ber will see, on reference to the Tariff Board Act , that a certain procediire must be followed before tariff questions can be to brought before the House. Every one concerned is working assiduously and in dustriously, and I am hopeful that it not be long before I shall be able to place just the Government's final proposals before honourable members. EUROPEAN SECURITY PACT .",15
24,Mr COLEMAN,LEAGUE OF NATIONS,"On the 19th June, the right honourable the Prime Minister stated that all the documents and infortainable mation the Government had received upon the subject of the European BUBONICPLAGUEINBRISBANE . Security Pact were being investigated with a view to determining to what extent they could be made available to orable members. Has he noticed in the cablegrams published in the newspapers this morning that the Canadian Governis ment has made all the documents and formation available to the parliament that dominion ? I should like to know whether the Prime Minister will do wise when he is tabling the papers relating to the Protocol, seeing that the two matters are somewhat inter-related.",16
25,Mr BRUCE,LEAGUE OF NATIONS,"The information tabled in the Canadian Parliament consisted of a copy of a white paper issued in Great Britain on the 24th of last month. This Government would have liked to make the same information available the same time in Australia, but the paper is of great length, and, being sent by post, takes longer to reach Australia than Canada. But we are having the fullest possible summary prepared from, cabled Hoiise ?. information for submission to the House, and I hope to be able to make it available to honourable members during the next or three days. POWE RALCOH OL BOUNTYBILL .",16
26,Mr FORDE,LEAGUE OF NATIONS,"Has the Minister for Trade and Customs received telegrams from sugar interests in Queensland testing against the restrictive clausesof Power Alcohol Bounty Bill , and urging that the bounty should be paid on power alcohol manufactured from molasses in and sugar-cane. Also, has he seen the telegraphed report from Consternation is expressed in the sugar industry at the restrictive clauses of the Federal Government's Power Alcohol Bill. Numerous wires of protest were sent during the weekend by the Northern Power Alcohol Committee the Prime Minister, also to the Minister of Customs and other members of the Federal Cabinet. More than half the sugar-growers consider that the terms of the proposed bounty ' will on Australian-made power alcohol should apply to spirit made from molasses and cane, as much as to the product of cassava.  paragraph quoted by my honourable friend, but I have received no communications from the parties he has named. During the debate on the Power Alcohol Bill I shall make all the information obavailable to honourable members.",16
27,Mr MACKAY,LEAGUE OF NATIONS,"H as the Minister honfor Health received any information concerning the suspected case of bubonic plague in suburbs of Brisbane? If so, he satisfied that all necessary precauintions are being taken to prevent the of spread of the disease?",16
28,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,LEAGUE OF NATIONS,"The Delikepartment of Health is in daily touch with the health authorities in Brisbane, and all necessary precautions are being taken. CRUISER BRISBANE.",16
29,Mr BRENNAN,LEAGUE OF NATIONS,"Is the Prime M in ister yet informed of the position of the at cruisor Brisbane in Chinese waters, and is he able or willin g to give an assurance to the House that the vessel will not be engaged in belligerent operations in China, or elsewhere without the consent of this",16
30,Mr BRUCE,LEAGUE OF NATIONS,"The Brisbane arrived at Hong Kong on the 30th June. It is two attached to the China squadron, of the Royal Navy, and I can give to the House no guarantee as to what use will be made of the vessel while there. It may be necessary for the cruiser squadron to be used for the protection of the prolives and properties of Europeans. STANDARD OF LIVING .",16
31,Mr MAHONY,LEAGUE OF NATIONS,"The following report of a speech by the Prime Minister was published in the Melbourne Sun of yesterday:The first thing was to obtain a fair day's work for a fair day's pay, otherwise Australia could not hope to compete in the world's markets against countries wliere the standard of living was low or where black labour or woman and child labour was used. Will the right honourable gentleman say whether that report is substantially correct, and if so, whether we are to infer from his remarks that Australia must lower its standard of living to that prevailing in black-labour countries? If he did not mean that, wil l he explain to the House what he did mean?",17
32,Mr BRUCE,LEAGUE OF NATIONS,I cannot be expected to repeat or explain all the speeches I make throughout the country. Even if I desired to do so the House might consider the repetition tedious. I assure the honourable member that I was not suggesting that the standard of living in Australia should be reduced to that obtaining in coloured countries or any other countries having economic systems that are lower than ours. I was advocating a policy which would enable the standard of living in .Australia to be raised. UNEMPLOYMENT.,17
33,Mr FENTON,LEAGUE OF NATIONS,Will the Prime Minister confer with his colleagues with a view to instructing Commonwealth departments to proceed with approved works at the earliest possible date in order to relieve the unemployed?,17
34,Mr BRUCE,LEAGUE OF NATIONS,"A consultation of that nature took place some time ago. Government gave the fullest consideration to the problem of unemployment during the winter months, and the departments are doing everything in their power to expedite new works, and prevent the aggravation of the unemployment difficulty by the discontinuance of works that are in hand. . DEFENCE STORES. Mr COLEMAN' asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice I. Whether post helium stores presented to Australia iby the British Government, amounting in value to £4,000,000, are stored at Livera pool, New South Wales? 2. Is it a fact that depreciation and loss have been sustained (particularly in regard to leather equipment and harness) owing to the absence of an adequate maintenance staff?",17
35,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,LEAGUE OF NATIONS,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. Post helium stores, the original value of which was over £1,000,000, are held in New South Wales at Leichhardt and Liverpool. It is not correct to refer to the stores in question as presented by the British Government. At the termination of the late war the equipment in possession of Australian troops was the property of the Commonwealth. All such equipment was handed over in France and Egypt to the Imperial authorities, and Australia received in exchange equipment from Imperial stocks in England. 2. Although the equipment when shipped from England was classed as "" serviceable,"" certain reconditioning was found necessary upon its arrival in Australia. This work has been carried out as speedily as funds would allow, and no doubt some deterioration of this equipment has occurre'd. CATTLE TICK.",17
36,Mr CHARLTON,LEAGUE OF NATIONS,"the Treasurer, upon notice I. Is it a fact that, in giving evidence before the New South Wales Royal Commission in New South Wales in November last, the Treasurer said that the Commonwealth Government' had been prepared for several years to subsidize the efforts of Queensland and New South Wales in tick prevention? 2. Is it a fact that the New South Wale3 Government has spent very large sums in this work, and that although repeated applications have been made to the Commonwealth Government for financial assistance, no grant whatever has been made up to the present? 3. Is it the intention of the Government to carry out the undertaking given by the Treasurer in his sworn evidence, and, if so, when will the contribution be made?",17
37,Dr EARLE PAGE,LEAGUE OF NATIONS,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as The follow:1. Yes. 2. I understand the Government of New South Wales has spent large sums on tick prevention, without checking the southern progress of the pest. The Commonwealth has already contributed sums towards investigation, and has definitely expressed its willingness to give financial assistance to the Governments of Queensland and New South Wales in a national effort, ot which it approves, to combat the pest. It is not, however, willing to provide money without being satisfied that it will be used in an effective manner. 3. The methods suggested by the conference of State and Commonwealth authorities are to be the first matter investigated by the reconstituted Bureau of Science and Industry. Action will immediately be taken on receipt of report indicating that the proposal put forward is likely to bo successful. POET OF MACKAY.",17
38,Mr WATSON,LEAGUE OF NATIONS,"for Mr BAMFORD) asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice Whether, for the guidance of masters of vessels visiting the growing port of Mackay, a scale plan of the approaches to Pioneer River Bhould be provided; and, if so, will he issue the necessary instructions regarding the matter ?",18
39,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,LEAGUE OF NATIONS,"The matter has been referred to the JSTaval Board. The Naval Board, however, has not the necessary information to enable a large scale plan to be produced, but is consulting the Admiralty on the subject. NA GREA T BARRIE R REEF. Mr J. FRANCIS asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice I. Will he inform the House what progress has been made with the hydrographic survey of the Great Barrier Reef? 2. Is the new surveying sloop Moresby to be employed on this work when she arrives in Australian waters?",18
40,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,HYDROGRAPHI C SURVEY OF,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. The reef in the neighbourhood of Townsville was surveyed last season by HMAS. Geranium, assisted by a seaplane. The Geranium will shortly resume operations in the same neighbourhood. 2. Yes. WOOL AGREEMENT : IMPERIAL NA GOVERNMENTS. Mr C. RILEY asked the Prime Minister, upon notice I. What was the amount of Australia's share (under the wool agreement between the Imperial and Commonwealth Governments) of profits derived from the sale of wool for other than military purposes? 2. When was parliamentary approval obtained for the distribution of those profits to the wool-owners?",18
41,Mr BRUCE,AND OOMMONWEALTH,The information desired by the honourable member is being obtained. LEAGUE OF NATIONS. CONVENTIONS AND PROTOCOL.,18
42,Mr COLEMAN,AND OOMMONWEALTH,"the Prime Minister, upon notice I. How many conventions and recommendations have been received from the League of Nations (excepting International Labour Organization), year to year, since the inception of that body; and with what subjects have such conventions and recommendations dealt? 2. What action has been taken to ratify such conventions and recommendations ? 3. Witli particular regard to the Opium Conlarge vention agreed to at the instance of China, whereby it was sought by the League of Nations to restrict or suppress the distribution and nse of opium, what action' has been taken by the British and Australian Governments respectively to ratify this Convention. Furthermore, what action has been taken by other members of the League to ratify this Convention? 4. In view of the fact that it was agreed by the British Secretary for Foreign Affairs (Right Hon. Austen Chamberlain) at Geneva that the Protocol should be the main subject for discussion at the next meeting of the League of Nations Assembly, is it proposed by the Australian Government to give tlic Commonwealth Parliament the opportunity of adopting or amending the Protocol, as a basis for discussion?",18
43,Mr BRUCE,AND OOMMONWEALTH,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. Fourteen conventions, &c, namely:(1) Convention and Statute on Freedom of Transit - (Barcelona, 20th April, 1921.) (2) Convention and Statute on the Regime of Navigable Waterways of International Concern, and additional Protocol - (Barcelona, 20th April, 1921.) (3) Declaration recognizing the right to a flag of states having no sea coast (Barcelona, 20th April, 1921.) (4) Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Women and Children (Geneva, 30th September, 1921.) (5) Convention for the Suppression of the Circulation and Traffic in Obscene Publications - (Geneva, 12th September, 1923.) (6) Protocol on Arbitration Clauses in Commercial Matters - (Geneva, 24th September, 1923.) (7) Convention relating to the Simplification of Customs Formalities (Geneva, 3rd November, 1923.) (S) Convention and Statute on the International Regime of Railways (Geneva, 9th December, 1923.) (9) Convention and Statute on the International Regime of Maritime Ports. - (Geneva, 9th December, 1923.) (10) Convention relating to the Transmission of Electric Power - (Geneva, 9th December, 1923.) (11) Convention relating to the Development of Hydraulic Power - (Geneva, 9th December, 1923.) (12) Protocol for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes - (Geneva, 2nd October, 1924.) (13) Agreement between Great Britain (with India), China, France, Japan, Netherlands, Portugal; and Siam, relating to the gradual suppression of opium in their far-eastern possessions and territories - (Geneva, 11th February, 1025.) * (14) Convention relating to Opium and other Dangerous Drugs -(Geneva , 19th February, 1925.) The above Conventions are the only instruments which have been drawn up under the auspices of the League of Nations and submitted to member states, for their ratification. 2. The action taken .by the Commonwealth in .connection with the above Conventions is as follows:No. 3 - Accede d to 31st October, 1922. No. 4 - Ratifie d 2Sth June, 1922. No. 5 - Come s also within the jurisdiction of the states, and the Commonwealth Government is in communication with the State Governments with respect to giving eifect to this Convention. So far as the Commonwealth is concerned, the provisions of this Convention are being complied with. No. 6 - Is under consideration. No. 7 - Ratifie d 13th March, 1925. No. 9 - The Commonwealth has decided to accede-to"" this Convention, and the instrument of accession will shortly be communicated to the Secretariat of the League of Nations. No. 12 - The Government has already announced that it is unable to ratify the Protocol. No. 14 - Signe d on 19th Februry, 1925. Nos. 1, 2, 8, 10, 11, and 13 are of no direct concern to the Commonwealth, and it is not proposed to take any action in respect to them. 3. The Convention to which the honourable member presumably refers is that signed at Geneva on 19th February last, relating to the production and manufacture of, and trade in opium and other dangerous drugs. The Commonwealth Government has signed this Convention, which it has decided to ratify. The British Government has signed the Convention, but the Commonwealth Government is not in a position to say what its intentions are with respect to ratification. No advice of ratification by any of the signatories to the Convention has yet been received. As the Convention is open for signature until 30th September of this year, it is probable that ratifications will not be deposited until after that.date. 4. The Council of the League of Nations at its meeting on 1.3th March last, decided to refer to the next Assembly the statements on the Protocol communicated by Governments to the League, and to place the question upon the agenda. The Government cannot say whether the Protocol will be the main subject of discussion at the Sixth Assembly. It is probable, however, that the question of security and disarmament will form an important part of the proceedings. Parliament will shortly be afforded an opportunity of. discussing the MT. Ilruce. Geneva Protocol. The question of amending the Protocol is one which might most usefully - be left to the next Assembly of the League of Nations, as the League will then be in the best position to know what the ideas of the different member states are in this respect. TELEPHONE CONNEXION. OODNADATTA ANDALICE SPRINGS.",18
44,Mr DUNCAN,AND OOMMONWEALTH,"HUGH ES asked the Postmaster-General, upon noticeWihat arrangement is he making to have telephone communication established between Oodnadatta and Alice Springs? Mr GIBSOiN,-For some time past the department has been endeavouring to develop a means of utilizing the single iron wire between Oodnadatta and Alice Springs for simultaneous telegraph and telephone purposes. The investigations have been concluded, and special apparatus has been secured to enable the necessary installations to be made. Telephones have been installed at Bloods Creek, Charlotte Waters, Horseshoe Bend, Alice Well and Deep Well, and Alice Springs. It is now possible to transmit telegrams to and from any one of these stations, and it is also practicable to secure telephone communication within the limits of about SO miles from"" any point, which can, of course, be relayed verbally if required. The arrangemeritsrnade permit of the facilities being available during the whole day. PICTURE FILMS. TAXATION OF COMPANIES.",19
45,Mr MANNING,AND OOMMONWEALTH,"the Treasurer, upon notice I. Whether his attention has been drawn to a statement in the press wherein it was stated that not only do American films enter Australia without paying Customs duty, but by floating a subsidiary company in Australia and sending to that company their films at a fictitious price, the subsidiary company makes no profit, while the parent companies, although making a profit of more than £500,000 per year, avoid taxation? 2. Will he give this matter consideration, and see whether it is not possible to make these parent companies pay the taxation which they are justly entitled to pay?",19
46,Dr EARLE PAGE,AND OOMMONWEALTH,"Dutiabl e American films do not enter Australia without paying Customs duty. It is probable that some American f i l m producing companies which have established subsidiary companies registered in Australia, show no profit on their Australian operations if, as suggested, the subsidiary company is debited with an excessive price for the films imported. The Commissioner of Taxation is having careful inquiries made into the matter in order to ascertain how far, if at all, income tax legally payable is being evaded. On the completion of these inquiries it will be possible to see whether the matter can be rectified under the present law or whether an amendment will be necessary. NA POSTMASTERS.",19
47,Mr A GREEN,CLASSIFICATION OF,"the Postmaster General, upon notice I. Is it a fact that, under the recent postal classification,'every officer in charge of a post office was given the designation of postmaster, but men who had been postmasters, in some cases ten years before, aud were acting as relieving postmasters, have been designated postal assistants? 2. Is it a fact lhat officers who have acted as postmasters previously, and are able to travel from office to office as required, to relievo postmasters who are away on leave, must of necessity have as wide an experience of postmasters' duties as postmasters themselves? 3. Will the Postmaster-General, in the circumstances, draw the attention of the board to this apparent anomaly, with the view to having officers doing relieving postmasters' duties, designated as postmasters under the classification ?",20
48,Mr GIBSON,CLASSIFICATION OF,"The answers - to the honourable member's questions are as f o l low :1. Under - the recent classification of postmasters, officers in charge of post offices, except Roumanians at certain special telegraphic stations, have been designated postmaster. Relieving officers, at present designated postal assistant, have not yet been classified. 2. Relieving officers relieve other officers to a greater extent than they do postmasters. They are required to be capable of relieving postmasters when required. 3. The attention of the 'board will be invited to the cases of the relieving officers for consideration when classifying those officers. NA",20

Dr EARLE PAGE:-On the 11th June, the honourable member for Darling (Mr Blakeley) asked the following question :Will the Treasurer say whether or not it is a fact that instructions were issued by the Federal taxation officers in New South Wales WILD DOGS. that graziers might deduct from tlieir statements of incomes 40 per cent, of all subscriptions to the fund for fighting the shearers' strike? If such an instruction was issued, will the Treasurer place a copy of it on the table, and state the names of the officer or by officers responsible for it? Does the Treasurer consider that such a concession was fair and to enI then replied that I would make inquiries be deinto the matter. I have now received the following statement of the case from the Commissioner of Taxation:No such instruction was issued. The facts are as follow:-In August, 1022, the Commissioner of Taxation issued a general ruling on claims which had been made by many taxpayers throughout the Commonwealth for allowance as a deduction in their assessments of subscriptions paid by them to various The ruling sets out WALES. that the principal factor governing the matter is whether the money, i.e., the subscription June, for which deduction is sought, has been expended for the production of the taxpayer's income which is being assessed. If the question cannot be answered in the affirmative, there is no deduction. In this connection in there are associations which although not a indispensable to members, perform a great duty amount of work which would otherwise have to be done by the individual members, and the which was formerly done by them, and in respect of which the members individually would have been entitled to a deduction if such expenses had been paid by them in their individual capacity. Some associations members by undertaking hiring of labour would have been done indithe members but for the association, and the cost to the individual would on have been deductible by him in his assessment. When the work is done for. him by the association, usually at a much reduced cost, the individual becomes entitled to have some part of his subscription to the association attrito thb service rendered him by the assoand to have the amount so attributed treated as a deduction in his income tax assessI t would be much less in amount than sum he would have had to pay if he had done the work himself. If he had done the himself, he would, therefore, have been to a greater deduction in his assessincome tax payable by him been less than as assessed at present. The effect, therefore, of the performance by graziers' associations of work which would otherwise have to be done by their members individually, and the allowance to the latter of a deduction of the proportion of their subscriptions, &c, attributable to such work, is really to increase the total income tax payable. In the' case of the Graziers Association of New South Wales, all that the Deputy Commissioner in New South Wales did was to ascertain the proportion of tlic total subscription made by a member of the association to the association funds, which applied to services rendered by the association which the member would otherwise have had to undertake individually. It was discovered in the particular year in which the claim was made by .the taxpayers that 40 per cent, of the total payments by members to the association represented payment for work which the members individually would have been required to perform, and in respect of which they would have received a deduction of the full amount expended hy them. It is probable that the refusal by the department to allow deduction of the whole of the payments by members to such associations will form the subject of an appeal to the court in the ver}' near future: NAVA L RATINGS.",22

PUBLI C WORKS. have AIR FORCE STATION, RICHMOND, NE W SOUTH WALES - AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE EXCHANGES.",23
59,Mr HILL,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Echuca-Minister for Works and Railways) [ 3 . 4 4 ] - I moveThai, in accordance with the' provisions of the Commonwealth Public Works Committee Act 1913-21, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed works, which were referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, and on which the committee has duly reported to this House the result of its investigations :1. Establishment of Royal Australian Air Force Station (No. 2) at Richmond (New South Wales). 2. Establishment of automatic telephone exchanges at Brisbane (Central), Toowong (Queensland), Lakemba (New South Wales), and West Adelaide. When asking the House on the 1st October, of last year, to refer to the Public Works Committee the questiou of establishing an air force station at Richmond, New South Wales, I explained the proposal, which is also set out in the printed report of the committee. Briefly, it is part of a scheme of air force stations in connection with the aerial defence of the Commonwealth. The Richmond establishment will occupy the same position in regard to Sydney as the Point Cook establishment will occupy in regard to Melbourne. When the House was asked in September last to refer to the Public Works Committee the question of establishing automatic telephone exchanges at Brisbane Central and Toowong, the proposals were full y explained. They are also set out in the printed reports of the Public Works Committee. They are part of a scheme to provide better telephone facilities in the various states of the Commonwealth, which is being gradually carried out. The question of establishing an automatic exchange at West Adelaide was referred to the Public Works Committee during the recess by the Governor General in Council under the power conferred by the Aot No. 19 of 1921, and is fully set out in the printed report of the Public Works Committee. It is proposed to erect a telephone exchange building on a site which has been acquired in Wainhouse-street, Torrensville, South Australia, and to install therein an automatic telephone switching system having an initial equipment of 2,200 subscribers' lines, which shall be capable of extension to 5,000 lines.",23
60,Mr MAKIN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,A very good site.,24
61,Mr HILL,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"The new exchange is designed to serve that portion of the City of Adelaide which is at present catered for by the Central, Prospect, Woodville, and Henley Beach Exchanges. The area covers a very thickly populated district, including the suburbs of Torrensville, Thebarton, and Hindmarsh.",24
62,Sir AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,Countr y districts have difficulty in getting even one telephone.,24
63,Mr HILL,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"It is imperative that the new exchange be opened in order to afford relief to the central exchange, which has almost reached the limi t of the existing plant and building, and to enable the Postal Department to render a more efficient service to existing and prospective subscribers than is possible under prevailing conditions. been explained in evidence that the proposal is justified from the financial aspect. The proposed building is a ' single-story brick structure of simple - design,, and of a fire-resisting character. The estimated cost of the scheme is£ Site ... 521 Building ... ... ... ... 7,650 Air conditioning, heating, ventilating, vacuum cleaning, and air compressor plant ... ... 4,250 Exchange equipment, including that necessary at other exchanges ... 39,396 Sub-station' equipment ... ... 8,244 Diversion of line plant and cut over of equipment ... ... 350 £60,415 The proposal to establish an automatic telephone exchange at Lakemba, New South Wales, was also referred to the Public Works Committee during recess by the Governor General in Council under the powers conferred by the Ac t No. 19 of 1921, and is fully set out in the printed report of the Public Works Committee. The Lakemba telephone exchange area is comprised of the outlying portions of the , present Ashfield, Burwood, Homebush,, Lidcombe, and Kogarah exchanges, and most of the subscribers are outside the 2-mile limit of the exchanges mentioned. A new exchange in the area will provide a cheaper and more efficient service. It is, therefore, proposed to erect a new building on a site which has been acquired at the corner of Railway-crescent and Croydon-street, Lakemba, and to install therein an automatic telephone switching system having an initia l capacity of 900 subscribers' lines and being capable of extension to an ultimate capacity of 3,500 lines, thereby affording sufficient accommodation in the area to meet the anticipated development over a period of twenty years. Apar t from the fact that, a more: efficient service will be provided, the new proposal will ultimately .be satisfactory from the financial stand-point. The projected building is a single brick structure of one story, designed on the latest fire-resisting principles. The estimated cost of the scheme is£ Site 300 Building ' 4,600 Air conditioning, heating, ventilating, vacuum cleaning, and air compression plant ... ... 3,00-. Exchange equipment,' including that It has necessary at other exchanges ... 1.6,475 Sub-station .equipment ... ... 151. Diversion of line plant and cut over of equipment ... ... 1,280 £25.806",24
64,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Maribyrnong ) [3.50]. - On a previous occasion I asked a question respecting the provision of plant for automatic telephone exchanges. of the opinion that the Postal Department, and the Government generally, are at the mercy of a particular company, or a set of individuals, so far as automatic telephone equipment is concerned. The attitude of the honourable member for Bass (Mr Jackson) suggests that this matter was not overlooked by the Public Works Committee, of which he is a member.",25
65,Mr JACKSON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,We inquired into that aspect.,25
66,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"It is an aspect of the question which should not have been overlooked. No honourable member should allow the country to be robbed if he can do aught to prevent it . I believe that there is a monopoly controlling this equipment, but whether it is protected by patent rights or not I do not know. I am desirous of ascertaining, first, whether we are in the unhappy position of being in the hands of a monopoly; and, secondly, whether in this case there is any likelihood of our being extricated from such an undesirable position. I should also like the Minister to inform us whether the proposed air force station to be established at Richmond, in New South Wales, will be on the .same elaborate scale as that at Point Cook. I do not refer to the hangars, but I desire to know whether it is intended to establish at Richmond an extensive workshop and plant such as now exists, at Laverton. I may be wrong, but I have always understood that the Laverton workshop was to carry out the whole of the repair work in connection with the air force of the Commonwealth. I should say that the work done at Point Cook and that which is being done at Laverton is of a permanent character. I am hot critical in regard to this matter, but it is right that honourable members should be giveai full inforniiatioai when they are called upon to consent to works that must cost large sums of money. One of these telephone exchanges is estimated to cost £60,000, and I presume that the work to be carried out at Richmond, in New South Wales, will involve very heavy expenditure. I have every confidence ini the integrity and capacity of the members of the Public Works Committee, but, as custodians of the public purse, it is the duty of honourable members generally to see that public money is expended in the best possible way. I trust that the Post1 am master-General, the Minister for Works and Railways, or the Minister for Defence will give the information for which I have asked.",25
67,Mr JACKSON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Bass) [3.53] - The compliment paid by the honourable member for Maribyrnong to the Public Work3 Committee is grateiully acknowledged. The committee, in one of its. published reports, has made a lengthy statement regarding the question he has raised as to the possibility of a combination of manufacturers to keen up prices of goods required for automatic telephone exchanges. I recommend the honourable member to get a copy of the report, and peruse it . Every possible precaution has been taken by the Public Works Committee. There is no one more keen than I am to see that the manufacture of . machinery for automatic telephones and all other telephone material shall, if possible, be carried out in Australia.",25
68,Mr GIBSON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Corangamite - Postmaster-General) [3.5*4] - I should like to assure the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) that there is no danger of a combine or association for the supply of all the requirements for automatic telephone exchanges. As a matter of fact, competition is extremely keen between different manufacturers of material for automatic exchanges. The appliances of different makers interwork one with another, and it is not possible for a position, to arise when it would be necessary to place orders with only one manufacturer.",25
69,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,Do all the parts come from America?,25
70,Mr GIBSON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"No. ; quite a number come from Great Britain . As I have said, the competition in the business is very keen, and there is no danger of what the honourable member fears taking place.",25
71,Sir AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Eden Monaro) [3.55] - If everything is so nice and satisfactory, I ask the Postmaster General (Mr Gibson) why it is that people in small country places cannot secure telephone communication.",25
72,Mr JACKSON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,That would be all right if it were true.,25
73,Sir AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"The honourable member would probably not know if it were true. What is the . experience of honourable members generally ? Is mine an isolated experience in this connection? I sent some correspondence marked ""Personal "" to the Postmaster General only yesterday on this subject, and it is my intention to bring that correspondence before the House. that the people in the country districts are not supplied with telephone communication as they ought to be. There appears to be no difficulty in getting telephone exchanges established in the cities at the cost of many thousands of pounds, but the needs of country districts are not attended to, though they may want only a telephone line hung on a tree. I can prove my statements from the correspondence which is now in the hands of the Postmaster-General.",25
74,Mr FORDE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"A member of the Country, party is administering the department concerned.",26
75,Sir AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,I do notblame the Minister. He is not the person responsible.,26
76,Mr GIBSON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,The country telephone service has been doubled in the last two years.,26
77,Sir AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,That is because the Minister has had some money to spend.,26
78,Mr GIBSON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,I admit that.,26
79,Sir AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Previou s postmasters-general were not given the money required for necessary telephone pxtension It appears to be necessary for an honourable member to make a frantic appeal to the department to secure telephone connection for a settler situated a mile and a. half off the main line. find that the Eden-Monaro settlers in country places cannot get telephone communication. We talk about decentralization, but when a proposal is made to spend £50,000 on a city exchange, there is no objection, to it : I say, without fear of contradiction, that we cannot get telephone communication in country places. When the Government can spend £60,000 or £70,000 on an automatic exchange at a place in South Australia, I should certainly be able to.get telephone communication for three or four country settlers who have offered to guarantee the interest on the cost involved in supplying it.",26
80,Mr GIBSON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"I had a deputation from the honourable gentleman's constituency the other day in regard to telephones', and I gave them all they asked for.",26
81,Sir AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"That statement can scarcely be correct, because they tell me that they have not got what they want. Throughout the Commonwealth there is a great lack of telephone I say facilities in the country districts. It is galling to most country members, in the circumstances, to hear a. member of the Public Works Committee assert that every recommendation of the committee is quite right. That committee has turned down a proposal for the construction of a railway from Yass to Canberra.",26
82,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH BANK,Rt. Hon. W . A. W at t ) . - That matter cannot be discussed on the motion now before the House.,26
83,Sir AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"The time is ripe for honourable members representing country districts to insist that their districts shall be given a fair deal. I emphasize the fact that in my constituency, and in many other country constituencies, people who are prepared to pay for it are denied telephone communication. Because there is not a. vast number of people behind a proposal, a guarantee of its cost is asked for. An application is put in for my district, and the applicants are informed that the work will cost perhaps £200, and they are asked whether they will guarantee the interest on the cost for seven years; but even in cases where they are prepared to give the guarantee they get no satisfaction. I propose to set the facts of the case to which I refer before the House when I get the papers back from the Minister.",26
84,Mr GIBSON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,Then I had better keep I them for a while.,26
85,Sir AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"This may be a laughing matter in the opinion of the Postmaster-General, but it is not a laughing matter for people settled in country places that may be subject bo floods. I shall reserve further remarks on this subject u n t i l I get my papers back from the Postmaster-General. I repeat now that the way in which country people have been treated in this connection is a scandal.",26
86,Mr BAYLEY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Oxley) [4.5] - The statements made by the lionorable member for Eden-Monaro (Sir Austin Chapman) are not fair to the Minister, to the department he controls, or to honourable members. A large sum of money to provide the services he refers - to has been expended. I feel sure that honourable members generally are not in agreement with hirrtj but are of opinion that at no time in the history of the federal control of the Post Office have the needs of the country been so well looked after as under the present regime. I make bold to say that no member of this House has received more consideration than the honourable member for Eden-Monaro. We have heard of the ungrateful dog that bit the hand that fed him, but fortunately i has come to few of us to meet such an animal. I regret very much that honourable member for Eden-Monaro, u n t i l recently, was a member of the Cabinet to which the Postmaster-General belongs, has seen f it to utter statements upon which he alone places any credence. Mr E. RILET (South Sydney) [4.8]. - I protest against the expenditure of money without full details of the work beingsubmitted to Parliament. orable members are asked to pledge themselves to a scheme for an air force centre at Richmond, but we have been told nothing about the cost. present expenditure is merely to provide the law was ' amended the nucleus of a scheme, honourable bers have a right to know what the vernment has in view.",26
87,Mr HILX,COMMONWEALTH BANK,All the information been given to the House. Mr E . RILET - I have not seen I should like the Minister to state much money will be spent under the proposal.,27
88,Mr HILL,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Echuca-Ministe Works and Railways) [ 4 . 9 ] - I can assure the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) that no unnecessary works are being undertaken at the Richmond Point Cook stations. He will no admit that it is necessary to have shops in connection with the A i r Force There are extensive workshops at Point Cook, and when I inspected them regration cently I saw what Australian workmen race were doing in the building of aeroplanes. I presume that similar work, w i l undertaken at Richmond. In reply to with the honourable member for South Sydney (Mr E . R i l e y I direct his my remarkson page 4955 of Hansard, - of the 1st October, 1924, in the course which I stated thatThe total estimated cost of the scheme, including accessory engineering services, excluding the cost of acquisition of the perty, is £177,400. Question resolved in the affirmative. IMMIGRATION BILL. SECOND READING . Debate res.umed from 25th June (vide page 462) on motion by Mr Bruce That this bill be now read a second time.",27
89,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Hunter ) [4.10] The bill may be divided into two parts, one of which restricts the admission of t immigrants, and the other provides for the deportation of persons resident in the Australia. In his second-reading speech who, the Prime Minister devoted much time to explaining what the United States of America had done to restrict immigration. He pointed out that the American legislature had realized the necessity for restricting the number of immigrants into that country, providing, in the first case, for a quota of not more than 3 per Honcent, of the number of nationals of each country domiciled in the United States of America at the time of the 1910 census, and, subsequently, as it was found that too many natives of southern EuroI f the pean countries were coming in, by substimemtuting the figures shown in the 1890 Gocensus,' and reducing the percentage to 2. It was hoped that in this way more has persons of the Nordic races would be admitted. That action of the United States it . of America, said the Prime Minister, had how caused the people of certain European countries to look elsewhere than America as a place to which to emigrate, and r for many of them were now looking to Australia. That statement is quite true. Mr MCWhae, formerly Agent-Genera] for Victoria, has stated that ships were being or fitted to carry Italian emigrants to Ausdoubt tralia for £ 8 per head, the passengers to workprovide their own food, and to sleep on - deck. I wish to make it quite clear that I have nothing to say against the immiinto Australia of persons of white if they can be absorbed, and I shall discuss the bill from l be the point of view of an Australian, reference particularly to the necessity of providing for the absorption attention to of those who come here, whether from Great Britain or from other counof tries. I have always held, and still hold, that it is necessary, before embarking upon schemes intended to induce people m but come here in large numbers, to provide profor absorbing, on arrival, those whom it is desired to invite. That is not done today. Thousands of Australians are unemployed today. Efforts are being made by the Government of Victoria to provide work for the unemployed of this state; and the newly-constituted Government of New South Wales has decided to spend £140,000 to find work for the unemployed of its state. Notwithstanding these and other efforts, large numbers of men cannot obtain work. In these circumstances it is alarming to know that many more people, for whose ahsorption in our community no provision has been made, are arriving from overseas. I see very little need for the bill merely to restrict European immigration, because the Government can do, and has done under its general powers, what it now seeks power to do. The Prime Minister, in his second-reading soeech, was very careful to omit any statement of what the Government had done, but on the public platform he has explained that it has limited the number of immigrants permitted to come to Australia from different countries. That is evidence . that the necessary power already rests in the executive. It is generally admitted that immigration is a matter of domestic concern, and that ,each country has a right to deal, with the subject as it thinks best. I take no exception to immigration legislation as such, but I repeat that this bill , so far as it provides for the restriction of immigration, is unnecessary. The Prime Minister said- We might then have to take action against some individual people, which would be, internationally, most undesirable. To-day, however, there is no reason why we should not, without giving offence to any country in the world, put on our statute-book a measure which will give us the power, should the necessity arise, to stop any flow of migration into Australia of a character that is not desirable. The suggestion is that the bill must be passed to provide the power should the necessity for its use arise. I ask honourable members whether the necessity has not already arisen ? Is it not necessary to prevent Europeans from coming to Australia ? Is not the industrial position in Australia at the present moment unsatisfactory, and are not thousands of Europeans coming here month after month, notwithstanding what the Prime Minister has said to the contrary ? For example, the public was informed, only yesterday that 317 Italians had just arrived. The Prime Minister has said that certain regulations have proved satisfactory, inasmuch as the number of immigrants now coming here is not interfering with the employment .of the Australian worker. l i e told us ihat the adoption, by Australia, of a quota system similar to that of the TJnilou Slates of America would entail considerable expenditure, because, to give effect to it , the Government would be compelled to appoint consuls in the different countries. But the right honourable gentleman has, in fact, already done that although - he did not inform honourable members of the fact. Regulations were framed to restrict the immigration of Maltese to twenty per month for each State, or 1,440 per year for the whole of Australia. When the Prime Minister attended the Imperial Conference, over two years ago, he entered into an arrangement, without informing this Parliament, to increase the number of Maltese immigrants from 600 to 1,200 per year, 'and honourable members heard nothing of it u n t i l I brought the question before the House. Now we find that the number is not limited *o1,200 per year, but to about 1,450. We have been told nothing further about that, but the fact remains that provision has been made for a monthly quota of ' Maltese. The Government has also fixed by regulation a*monthly quota of 100 immigrants from each of the following countries:-Jugo-Slavia , Greece, and Albania. What the Prime Minister said could not be achieved without involving the country in considerable expense, has been achieved in respect of those countries, and can be achieved in respect of others. Why the Prime M in ister should declare that it would .be necessary to appoint officials in othes countries if quotas for them were fixed I cannot understand. Throughout almost the whole world the passport system is in operation, and no person can be admitted to a country unless he produces from the Government of the country of which he is a citizen a passport declaring, amongst other things, that he is a person of good character. Therefore, if the Commonwealth Government advises any country that not more than 50, or 60, or 100 of its citizens can be accepted in a stated time, the responsibility will be placed upon the Government of that country not. to issue pa'ssports in excess of the quota. That system is sanctioned by international law and practice. What is the use of the Prime Minister saying that it is impossible toregulate the flow of immigration from foreign countries, and that if it were possible the system would be too expensive, when, in fact, immigration is being regulated today? Indeed, Ministers when answering on the public platform the criticism of honourable members on this side have taken credit to themselves for that very achievement. The Government should be candid with the people when proposing legislation of this character. The Prime Minister statedWfi have further taken steps to ensure that no migrants shall come here who have not in their possession when they arrive at least '£40, and have not also taken steps to provide that some one here shall be responsible for them when they come. The Italian Government met us very fairly in this matter, and does not issue passports in Italy now only when a migrant is possessed of £40, but must also be satisfied that there is some one here who will be responsible for his finding employment and being aiblc to maintain himself after he has arrived. I have ascertained from Government officials that that statement is not quite correct. Any European possessing £ 4 0 , and certified to be in good health, can gain entrance to the Commonwealth. It is not necessary that i u addition somebody shall guarantee employment for him when he arrives. That guarantee .applies only in respect of persons nominated by friends or relatives already resident in the Commonwealth. In this case an immigrant need not have £ 4 0 . practically no restriction upon immigration from It a l y . The Queensland royal commissioner who inquired into the im migration of aliens arrived at certain conclusions,' which I wish to place on record in Hansard. Amongst other things he saidIn the absence of regulation or some form of selection, it is therefore reasonable to assume that the number .of aliens arriving in Australia will rapidly increase, and that the majority of these new arrivals will be those who are regarded by the United States of America Government as not easily assimilated, and therefore undesirable as citizens. In other words people whom. the - United States of America regards as undesirable and unacceptable, are acceptable in Australia, and actually are being admitted to the CommonwealthThe Commonwealth Publicity Department advises that the number of Italian and Greek migrants to Australia during the 30 years prior to 1001 averaged 150 per annum, and that at the 30th November last this rate had increased to 6.854 per annum. There has since been a still greater annual increase. The Jfr. Charlton. figures show that, during the three and a half years ended March, 1925, the migration to Australia of Italians and Greeks has been greater than at any period during the last 40 years. Yet the Prime Minister assured us that the present arrangements in regard to immigration are satisfactory- It has been pointed out that during the three and a half years ended September, 1924, the excess of arrivals over departures of foreign persons was 16,148-at the rate of 4.614 per annum. The above table shows that they are now arriving at the rate of over 11,000 per annum. . . . The Commonwealth Government advises that there is an understanding with the Italian Government that passports to Australia shall not be granted to any Italian immigrant unless he is nominated by a resident of Australia who is prepared to look after him on arrival here, or unless he will have on arrival at least £40 capital. . . . However, the evidence shows that the undertaking called an ""Atto di Chiamata,"" or ""Act of Call,"" is quite useless in its present form. The declaration may Ibe made, and has been made, by persons in Australia who are themselves not in employment and have little prospects of obtaining work. It is forwarded to the nominee in Italy, who must present it to the Italian authorities in order to obtain his passport. The document then remains in Italy. That is an astounding revelation. Unemployed Italians in Australia can nominate compatriots in It a l y and guarantee employment for them. The nomination is sent to Italy , and the persons nominated arrive in due course. How can employThere is ment for another be guaranteed by a man who cannot find work for himself? This' very loose system menaces the future welfare of the people of Australia.",27
90,Mr COOK,COMMONWEALTH BANK,Are not Labour Ministers in Queensland in favour of the immigration of Italians?,29
91,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"I cannot speak for Labour Ministers in Queensland other than to declare that they, like myself, are prepared to admit only so many immigrants as the country can absorb. When I was in that state recently, the Minister for Lands was at his wits' ends to find employment for Italians and other Europeans, and he was making land available to settle 200 persons if they could find sufficient capital to go upon it . This is the form that ihe nominator has to sign:I wish . . . to come as soon as possible to join me in Australia, and I declare that I am perfectly able to supply for his needs, &c. That is not a guarantee. It is a mere declaration, and its worthlessness is revealed by the Commissioner's' finding that persons who are unemployed have actually nominated and guaranteed ployment for others. These facts reveal the dangers into which the Oommonworkers wealth is drifting. The Commissioner tain further statesOn this question a successful Italian farmer nt Ingham in his evidence statedI think there is something wrong with the present system. Young men come here, and after they have heen here two or three months, although they do not understand the conditions, they send home for friends, although they themselves have no work to do. That should be stopped, and only men who understand exactly the conditions, and can foresee whether there will be employment or not for the new arrivals, and who are prepared to foot the bill if there is no employment, should be allowed to nominate others. How can the Prime Minister regard the present state of affairs as satisfactory when such practices are resorted to? If immigration upon the present basis is satisfactory to the Commonwealth Government it certainly will not be satisfactory to the people whose welfare is at stake. The Commissioner c o n t in During the past six montlis foreigners have been arriving in the sugar districts in North Queensland in such numbers that it is obvious that they cannbt all be employed in the sugar industry, in which there is already an overproduction, and a, consequent limitation of the area to be cultivated and a limitation of necessary labour. While possibly sufficient labour has been waiting for months in the districts in the hope of obtaining work in the crushing season, the arrival of hundreds of Southern Europeans, unable to speak the English language, with very littl e money and looking tor employment, is creating an anti-foreign feeling which may lead to serious trouble in the near future. That is a w a r n in g from a man.",29
92,Mr COLEMAN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,Alread y occurred.,30
93,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"If that is so, t P a r l i a m e n t shoul d heed that r e p o g u a r d against the eventualities w h i c h the Commissioner regards as possible. If aliens continue to flock into the sugar districts in search of employment, the practice of permitting them' to work for food is likely to increase; the standard of living will be reduced, and the effect, socially and economically, will be unfavorable to the workers already there, be they British or foreign. It is obvious that the greater the numbers arriving, the more aggravated will be the evil. That is a further warning. The Commissioner makes a comparison between emthe British workers and the aliens- It is generally admitted that the British are the most efficient, and that to obemployment a foreigner will undertake to do the same amount of work in a day that a British worker can do, and that this is equivalent to an agreement to work longer hours, which he subsequently does without complaint. If that statement is correct there is in operation a system whereby the hours of labour on the cane-fields are being lengthened in order to enable men who are not as efficient as Britishers to do the same amount of work in a day. No Parliament can tolerate that state of affairs. If ever there was an attempt to break down the standard of living and the conditions of Australian workmen, it is the practice exposed by that report. The Commissioner said of the MalteseI inspected a Maltese lodging house in In nisfail and found about twenty (20) men living in one room. Every room was crowded with bunks with just enough space between to enable the occupants to move about. The practice is to charge from Is. to 2s. per night for a bed u e d - and the men obtain their food elsewhere. A number of places are occupied in a similar way by Greeks. That is a nice state of affairs in a country which boasts of the healthy conditions under which its people are employed. Foreigners are allowed to live in circumstances which are detrimental to the health not only of themselves, but also of other people in the district. Yet the Government says that it is satisfied with these conditions, and that they must continue. The commissioner says furtherThe Greek residents of Jfqrth Queensland 01*6 responsible generally of an undesirable type, and do not make good settlers. They live in the towns, and carry on business in cafes, fish shops, boardriots have iiigliouses, and other less reputable ways. They arc not agriculturists, and add nothing to the wealth or security of the country. They h is engage in no useful work that could not be r t and better performed without their assistance. In company with an officer of the police I visited a number of their boardinghouses and clubs, which were generally in a filthy condition. On the average, their standard of living is lower than that of other foreigners. Socially and economically, this type of immigrant' is a menace to the community in which he settles, and it would be for the beneft of the state if his entrance were altogether prohibited. In spite of t h is report , the Govern men) is prepared to allow these i m m i g r a n t s to come in here at the rate of 100 a month. The commissioner also tells usThe Commonwealth Government advises that there is an understanding with the Italian Government that passports for Australia shall not be granted to any Italian immigrant unless lie is nominated by a resident of Australia who is prepared to look after him on arrival here, .or unless lie has at least £40 capital. Experience has shown that the first condition is iiiullified by misuse of the present form of nomination, and that the monetary requirement j s of little value. The declaration to be responsible for the nominee should be made before some official, whose duty it would be to satisfy himself that the declarant is in a position to carry out his undertaking. The original declaration should be filed in the Tniuiigration Office, and a certified copy handed to the applicant. The sums of £10 and £40 required as landing money for the admission of immigrants may, in few cases, add to the probability of the alien being able to support himself for a time. However, it is generally borrowed for.production to the authorities, and returned by the immigrant immediately upon his arrival""in the Commonwealth. I u other words, the necessary amount of £40 is given to these immigrants by wealthy persons of the same nationality, perhaps living in this country, or by persons desirous of breaking down the working conditions in Queensland. When the immigrants arrive here, the money is returned. The commissioner also saysConsideration should be given immediately to the racial stock of the immigrant. The number of many of those now arriving should be reduced, and in otlier cases altogether prohibited. There should be ft selection of the type grant that will assist, rather than hinder, the building up of superior social and economic conditions in this state. . . . At the present time our foreign immigration appears to be largely induced and controlled by selfish and' unscrupulous interests entirely outside Australia, and the question for consideration is whether it shall continue to be controlled by such interests or by a responsible Government in Australia. The report is sufficient in itself to damn the attitude of this Government towards the immigration of foreigners. It is a most scathing report.",30
94,Mr MACKAV,COMMONWEALTH BANK,Is there nothing in it favourable to the Italian immigrant ?,31
95,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"I have nothing to say against any white man coming here, provided he can be absorbed into this community. I believe that the northern Italian makes a good settler. Is that to what the honourable member is alluding ?",31
96,Mr MACKAY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,I thought that the honourable member might. quote the evidence - given by the witness representing the .Australian Workers Union..,31
97,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"That evidence will be quoted by other speakers. The honourable member will be perfectly justified in giving this House his views on the bill. I have nob quoted the whole of the report because of its great length, but the extracts that I have read show that the practice of permitting people to come here should be abolished in most cases and restricted in others, unless the immigrants can be absorbed. I take no exception to white people from Europe coming here if we can absorb them, but I take exception even to people of our own race coming here if we cannot find employment for them. No country is justified in bringing people to its shores unless they can be employed in it . Immigrants now swell the ranks of our unemployed, and thousands of pounds of our money have to be expended to supply them with the necessaries of Ufe. Our first duty is to formulate some workable plan for settling immigrants. This Government has' no such definite plan, and is putting the states , in a wrong position. It recently entered into an immigration agreement with Great Britain before obtaining the consent of the states to it , and that consent has not yet been obtained. One might expect that the State Governments, that are the authorities which have to find employment for the immigrants coming to Australia, would be consulted in this matter. It is the State Governments that of immi- have to find food for the thousands of immigrants who are unemployed.",31
98,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,The immigrants are entering Queensland and Western Aust r a l i a with the consent of the Labour governments of those states.,31
99,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Whether that is so or not, I ask the Treasurer now to declare in this House whether the six State Governments, or the majorit y of them, have agreed to the immigration proposals of the Commonwealth Govermnent.",31
100,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Victori a has agreed to it , and all the other states are definitely considering the agreement.",31
101,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"The Treasurer himself admits that the Commonwealth Government, made this agreement beforo consulting the states. Dr EARLE PAGE : - It is a 'triangular agreement between Great Britain, the Commonwealth, and the states.",31
102,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"The agreement has been signed by the Commonwealth before the states have given lo it their approval The proper course was, first, to consult the states, which are charged with the responsibility of finding employment for those who enter their territory.",31
103,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"The states are being consulted, and also given great concessions in interest.",32
104,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,It is useless to try to camouflage the position in that way. The states have not yet agreed to the proposal. We cannot absorb the people the present Commonwealth Government is bringing here. The honourable member knows full well that the settlement of the people that are brought here is an obligation upon the State Governments. Dr EARL E PAGE.'-The Commonwealth is making'an arrangement with the states.,32
105,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"The Government is bringing thousands of immigrants here for whom there is no employment. They are a charge on the states, and add to the number of unemployed in Australia. I am not against increasing the population of this country by proper methods, but we should first put our own house in order, so as to be able to absorb immigrants when they come here. The second part of the bill contains one of the most important proposals that has ever been brought before this Parliament. It applies to trade unionists, and I say, without the slightest fear of contradiction, that it aims a direct blow at the trade union movement in this country.",32
106,Mr MANNING,COMMONWEALTH BANK,The blow that is being struck at the trade union movement is being struck by foreign agitators.,32
107,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,I shall deal with that statement later. May I ask the honourable member how long has a man to reside in this country to be considered an Australian citizen?,32
108,Mr R GREEN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,Some of them never become such.,32
109,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,The member is quite f r a n k ; he is the only member on that side who is so. Not many of them will dare to say as much when they go before the people.,32
110,Mr FOSTER,COMMONWEALTH BANK,I shall.,32
111,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Order ! It is evident that this debate may provoke much feeling, and I intend to insist upon the strict observance of the rules of Parliament.",32
112,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Clause 7 of the bill provides that a proclamation may be issued in the case of an industrial dispute, and if the Minister is satisfied that any person not born in Australia has been concerned in Australia in acts directed towards hindering or obstructing to the prejudice of the public, the transport of goods or the conveyance of passengers in relation to trade or commerce with other countries, or among the .states, for the provision of services by any department or public authority of the Commonwealth, that person may be summoned before a board. The board is to report to the Minister, and there is to be no appeal from its finding. Any one can be deported as the result of a recommendation by the board. This is a direct blow at trade unionism. Never before has legislation of thischaractei been attempted either by a state or federal government. It goes much f u r ther than any honourable member anticipated would be proposed - If such legislation had been the law, and had been put into operation' in years past., what might have been the position of Sir Joseph Cook, the High Commissioner of Australia, a. man who has done much for this country ? He holds the same political views as honourable members opposite. B ut he might at one time have been deported for his connection with trade unionism. Where would the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr . W. M . Hughes) have been if legislation of this kind had been in force when he was connected with industrial unions ? He might have been sent out of this country. Before I was elected to this House I was associated, as an industrial leader, with the late James Curley, who came to Australia from England. No man did more than he to preserve peace among industrial organizations. Then there was the late John MCFadgen, another stalwart of the Labour movement, Tom Dick, Dan. Reece, and a number of others honourable whom I could mention. These men all rendered good service to this country, and did their utmost to prevent industrial stoppages. But they were not Australian-born, and, if this legislation had been in force, they oould have been deported simply because they were connected with a trade union at the time of some industrial dispute. We are told today that there should not be such disputes, that we are bound absolutely by the Arbitration Court and its awards. I ask honourable members to refresh their memories. There is no public man, either state or federal, who has claimed that industrial troubles can be prevented entirely by arbitration. It was never try? made obligatory for a union to register under the arbitration law. Unions certainly bound to observe awards of the the law. Arbitration Courts under pains and ties for disobedience. I have nothing say against the punishment of those who; break the laws of the country; we must have a well-ordered society. another thing to send men out of this country because of something that has arisen in connection with trade unions with which they are identified.",32
113,Mr MANNING,COMMONWEALTH BANK,It is not suggested they should be deported.,33
114,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"I ask the honorfore able member to read the bill. The posed new section 8AA, if agreed to, relate to any person not born in Australia who has been concerned in Australia i acts directed towards hindering or obdustrial structing, to the prejudice of the public, the transport of goods, or the conveyance of passengers in relation to trade or commerce with other countries or among the states, or the provision of services any department or public authority the Commonwealth. If trouble arises the coal-mining industry, the men at the head of the coal miners' unions are i m mediately seized upon as being respondetermine sible. It is much the same as in matters affecting the government of the country. The Prime Minister, as head of the Government, is held responsible for the actions of the Ministry.",33
115,Mr MANN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,The honourable member or has not read the whole statement.,33
116,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"It is evident that honourable members opposite do not like ployees, the bill. The only government in Australia which ever before attempted to introduce coercive legislation-and legislation did not go as far as this goes-wa s the Wade Government of New South Wales, and when it went bemake fore the people it was relegated to political obscurity. That is what happen to every government that enthe deavours to interfere with the freedom of the people. The board to be appointed under the bill is to consist of a judge, one who has had experience as a judgewho is to be its chairman-and two other persons. Do honourable members think tered conditions a "" strike "" occurs. it fair that, when an industrial trouble occurs, any person should be called to appear before a board which may recommend his deportation from the counWe have already sufficient powers under existing legislation to are deal with any person who breaks It is all very well for penalour newspapers to say what should be to done with certain people; when the public generally becomes acquainted with the facts they will see the real intention But it is behind this bill. The people of Australia believe, above everything else, in giving to its citizens the fullest rights of citizenship. Those who break the laws of the country must be punished, but hot that deported without trial. I was present at the conferences which took place be the original bill was introduced into prothe New South Wales Parliament, and will it was freely, recognized by all who attended, including Mr Wise himself, n that arbitration would only minimize in disputes. It is impossible to absolutely prevent such disputes. It is in teresting to note that in the history of arbitration in Australia there has never yet been a lockout, that every stoppage by of work is termed a strike.' During the of last ten or fifteen years stoppages of in work have been numerous, but every one of them has been referred to as a strike. - That is because it is most difficult to what constitutes a lockout. The responsibilities bf an employer are very easily evaded. ' Let me read the definition of ""lockout."" ""Lockout"" includes the closing of a place part of a place of employment, or the total or partial suspension of work by an employer, with a view to compel his employees, or to aid another employer in compelling his emto accept any term or condition of employment. That definition makes it almost imposthat sible to prove that an employer has bill caused a lockout. All that an employer has to do to avoid such a charge is to certain changes in the conditions governing employment in his establishw ill ment, if the workers refuse to accept altered conditions, the employer can say that he has not closed the doors of his workshop against them, but that they or are at liberty to enter, and continue in his employment. Consequently, when the employees refuse to work under the alI could mention numbers of stoppages in upon connection with the mining industry which, in reality, were lock-outs, but which could not be proved to be such. If trouble occurred in the coal-mining industry, and other industries were affected thereby, those at the head of the miners' unions would, under this bill , be dealt with. They might be men who arrived in Australia at the age of one year, and had been residents of this country for 40 or 50 year's, but not being Australian-born, they would be under the bill regarded as aliens. Many of us who are Australian-born have sprung from British stock, but our parents, though long resident in this country, if not born in Australia are aliens under this bill, and union leaders who were not born in Australia may be deported. Is this House to pass legislation of this nature ?",33
117,Mr MAHONY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,It is disloyalty to Empire.,34
118,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"This legislation is purely of a class nature, as it is intended to deal with industrialists only. tains no provision for dealing with the exploiter. There is no talk of penalizing him by compelling him to appear before a board which may deport him. The man who charges unduly high rates of in terest, or exploits the people by charging excessive prices for the necessities of life, does not come within the provisions of the bill. He is in a privileged class. It did not enter the minds of the members of the Ministry to legislate for individuals like that. Their whole thought was concentrated on the problem how to deal with the working man.",34
119,Mr GBEGOEY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,Not the workers.,34
120,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"The honourable member cannot get away from the fact that this legislation has been introduced to enable industrialists to be deported. Fortunately for me, I was born in Australia, otherwise I should be in danger of deportation because of my association with trade unions. But what about those who were not born in Australia, but who are as good men as I am ?",34
121,Mr WHITSITT,COMMONWEALTH BANK,Not one of them could be as good as the honourable member.,34
122,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Many of these men who were not born in Australia are as good as I am, or even as the honourable member who has interjected. many of them a3 men who, throughout their lives, have endeavoured to do their best in the interests of Australia and their fellow men. It is a mistake to introduce legislation which has as its object the suppression of trade unionism, as we already have sufficient power to deal with those who break the law. In 1920 Parliament passed a bill, which was introduced by  inmates of insane asylums, and anarchists could be deported, but only if their residence in Australia had been less than three years. At that time anxiety existed because it was supposed that communists were arriving in this country with the object of destroying settled government. But , even then, the Government of the day decided on a three-years' limit. This bill contains no such limitation. Why should there be this difference between the treatment meted out to anarchists, whose desire is the overthrow of responsible government, and the trade union leader the who has resided in the country for, perhaps, 30 years and assisted in its development ?",34
123,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"It makes me shiver. It con- Mr Charlton - It would make any man shiver who had a grain of common sense. There is no escaping from the position, which I am setting out as clearly as I can for the informatiou of the publio. The Government should be satisfied with its present power to deal with people whose residence in Australia is less than three years.",34
124,Mr WHITSITT,COMMONWEALTH BANK,That period is altogether too short.,34
125,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Late r the honourable member will realise his mistake. I repeat that the real reason for the introductionof this legislation is to enable the Government to deal as it desires with trade unionists. Before allowing class legislation of this nature to become law, honourable members should study the bill.",34
126,Mr MANN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,Does the honourable member suggest that all the communists are included in the ranks of the industrial unions'!,34
127,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"No , I do not. I desire now to refer to the latter portion of proposed new section 8AA, which readsWhere any person who was not born in Aus- . tralia has, at any time, been convicted in Australia of an offence against the laws of the Commonwealth relating to trade and commerce I know or conciliation and arbitration for the prevention or settlement of industrial disputes, and the Minister is satisfied that any of the acts constituting the offence were directed towards hindering or obstructing, to the prejudice of the public, the production or transport of goods. or the conveyance of passengers or the provision of necessary services, and that the presence of that person in Australia will be injurious to the peace, order or good government of the Commonwealth, the Minister may moke on order for his deportation. There is au additional power. does it meau ? It means that any man who has at any time been convicted of an offence, and is an officer of an industrial union at the time of any industrial trouble, may be sent out of the country without first having to appear before the board. His conviction may have taken place 25 years ago, since which time he may have resided as a law-abiding citizen in Australia, and reared a family. Yet, because of his past conviction, and his present connection with an industrial union, he may be deported without trial. That is the power that the Government is asking this House to place in its hands. No honourable member who listens to my remarks can say later that he was not warned. The people of Australia will not stand for legislation of this kind. What does the Government intend to do with these people who are to bo deported? To-day a passport must be issued to any person before he can leave this country for another. The passport system is in force in almost every country in the world;. during my recent travels I saw much in connection with it which disgusted me.",34
128,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,They all come in on passports.,35
129,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,Does the Government intend to give jjassports to men who are not fit to be citizens of this country ?,35
130,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,We shall send them back to their own country.,35
131,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Eve n have resided here for 40 years? Where does their Australian citizenship come in ? Although a person may have been born on the voyage to Australia, or was, say, twelve months old on arrival, and has lived here for 40 years, the Government says he does not belong to Australia, and is not an Australian. What becomes of the right honourable gentleman's frequent remarks about our being of British stock ? He says that these men shallbe sent back to the country whence they came. Will he give them a certificate of character, so that they may be permitted to land in that country? no - country in the world today can. a man gain admittance without a passport. I ask the right honourable gentleman if the Government contemplates giving to criminals, and men who have broken the law to the extent that their deportation is decided on, a passport enabling them to enter another country. What Mr MANN - Undesirable s have been deported from Great Britai n in hundreds.",35
132,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"That remark applies to all countries. I do not want to be misunderstood. I do not say that we should not have the power to deport, but I say that today a person cannot be deported unless he is provided with a passport. To obtain a passport, he must possess a certificate of good character. In those circumstances, a passport cannot be given to a person who is not fit to live in the Commonwealth, and, therefore, he cannot gain admittance to another country. Does the honourable member for Perth (Mr Mann) say that the British Government would allow a man to land in Great Britai n if not provided with a passport ? If a man could not be admitted to Great B r it a in , what chance would he have of gaining admission to other countries? We shall have the case of Paul Freeman over again. Honourable members wil l remember that he was kept on a steamer, travelling from port to port, as no country would allow him to land. The captain of the vessel ' could not get rid of him, as there was no country on which he was allowed to set foot. In that respect Freeman was in the position of the dove which Noah liberated from the ark, and which found no rest for the sole of her foot. The early history of Australia provides instances of men who were found guilty of various offences. if they Take the case of Peter Lalor in Victoria. There was a time when he was execrated, but what do we see today? Monuments have been erected to his memory because of the good work he did for the state and this country. Mr E . RILEY - He was regarded as a rebel.",35
133,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"At one time he was considered to be one, and he would have been deported had a measure like this bill been the law at the time. This is a. responsible Parliament, whose duty it is to look after the interests of the people of the Commonwealth; and yet To we are being asked to pass this panic legislation. The Government has been driven to the adoption of this course by press criticism, and the influence of the employing interests, ancl of people in high and privileged places who can exploit the rest of the community without coming within the law. The Government in a moment of weakness has yielded to the pressure brought to bear upon it by these people. It has never done anything of its own initiation since it has held office. Everything it has done it has been forced to do by people outside who have criticized and driven it. It has foolishly introduced this legislation in the hope thai it may appear to the people generally that it is necessary. This is the most drastic legislation ever introduced since we have had responsible government, and it will certainly not meet with the approval of the people when they are given an opportunity to express their views upon it. If this measure is passed, the Government must take responsibility for its action. We, on this side, are not afraid to meet the position. As a party we believe in the passing of laws to control the affairs of the Commonwealth, to which the people should be subject. But we do not believe in deporting citizens of this country merely because they are trade unionists.",35
134,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,No r does anybody - else.,36
135,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"The action of honourable members opposite proves otherwise. Nothing else can be read into the provisions of the bill. Why has it been introduced? If that is not the purpose, why bave such provisions been put into the measure, which goes beyond what was provided for in 1920 to deal with anarchists who might come here? Under this bill men who are good citizens and good unionists could be sent out of the country at any time. No appeal is provided for. I do hot say that the members of the proposed board will be biased, but I know that in times of panic most men are unconsciously biased, and the members of the board, 'because of unconscious bias, may give a decision against a particular individual. Assuming such a decision to be given, the Government will put the machinery of this measure into operation, and the individual whose deportation is recommended will be put on board some vessel, the owners of which will have some trouble in getting rid of .him. They will probably only be able to land him on some cannibal island where there is no civilized form of government. That is the kind of treatment which it is proposed to mete out to citizens of this country! Many of our industrial leaders have reared families, and have led useful lives in this country.",36
136,Mr MACKAY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,They will be quite safe.,36
137,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"The honourable member will not be the administrator of this bill. If he were, they might be quite safe; but I venture to say that this Government has decided to deport people if they do not comply with the Arbitration Court's decisions. But there are other ways of punishing people for that. It was never intended by our arbitration legislation to do 'away entirely with strikes and lockouts. Every one knows that all we can expect to do is to lessen their number and to minimize their effects. There has not been a lockout, so called, since the institution of arbitration ! It is always contended that it is the working man who is at fault, and now the Government proposes to pass legislation to inflict a further burden upon the working men by taking power to deport their leaders in the event of any industrial trouble being forced upon them.",36
138,Mr GREGOKY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,What does the honourable gentleman suggest should be done to enable the industries of the country to be carried on?,36
139,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,I suggest that we should go on as we are. The Government - has sufficient power to punish any one who offends against the law. ,36
140,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"I know nothing about Walsh. I tell honourable members opposite that they are not warranted in introducing drastic legislation of this kind. It will be general in its application, and will not apply merely to certain individuals. Honourable members opposite cannot shelter themselves behind the interjection that has just been made. They will have to stand up to the legislation that they place on the statute-book, because when the act becomes law it will have to be administered. If this legislation is passed, it must be put into operation by those charged with the administration of the affairs of the country, irrespective of the individual to whom it may apply. It may even be applied to officials of the Miners Federation, who are a credit to Australia. The bill is directed - entirely against the working classes of this community, and is being passed in the interests of the privileged class. Honourable members opposite know that, and they cannot shirk their responsibilities. The position is so clear that any one who reads the bill can come to no other conclusion than that it is directed against the industrial organizations of this country in general, and not against .any one in particular. As my time has almost expired, I move That after the word "" now"" the following words be inserted:-""withdraw n and redrafted to provide more adequate provisions regarding alien immigration, and for the reconsideration of the drastic proposals Australian citizens.""",36

155,Mr GIBSON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"I have made the statement that not one of the Labour Governments in Australia has taken any steps to avail itself of the immigration agreeentered into by the Commonwealth made Government, under which cheap, money the can be made available to the State Governments for the absorption of immigrants. I should have thought that the all State Governments would have embraced open arms the opportunity to take advantage of that agreement. I can hardly understand how any Government fail to avail itself of the opportunity to secure money at 1 per cent, under the immigration agreement for a purpose of this kind. Had the State Governments been sincere in this matter, they could availed themselves of this cheap in order to absorb the immigrants ever which honourable members opposite say they object to unless provision is mado to absorb them. I say that immigration is absolutely essential to the country. Provision is made under the agreement for the introduction of 400,000 people in I say that we can absorb the that number in the time without increasbeen ing unemployment. They need not all be placed on the land, though many, no doubt, will be so dealt with. immigrants on the land requires the construction of railways, bridges, roads, and works of that kind, and the volume of unemployment which exists today would, in my opinion, be reduced by bringing more people into this country to develop it. The Leader of the Opposition made a great deal out of Mr ""Ferry's report. I must confess that I have not read it , but it is a report by a man who was appointed, according to the statements of honourable members opposite, by a Government that is opposed to immigration.",37
156,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Accordin g honourable member on the other side, the Queensland Government has favoured immigration. The honourable gentleman cannot have it both ways.",38

Theodore and Mr Fihelly, are in favour of Italian immigration, but here we have men who are opposed to It a l i a n or other immigrants coming into this country. Every dominion of the Empire controls and regulates the immigration into it. The Prime Minister pointed out most definitely that a quota was arranged by agreement with a country from which immigrants are coming to Australia. This measure goes further, in preventing undesirable persons from coming into Australia. I take it that every member of this House stands for good government and against the admission of undesirable people.",38

It seems to me that honourable members to an opposite are supporting such men. The annual report of the Labour Council of New South Wales statedI t can be said of them-the Lang Labour party-""They are busy ploughing the land for communism, and the communist party is busy sowing the seed."" . . .

165,Mr GIBSON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Almos t all the industrial unrest in this country is due to certain agitators who are leading the trade unionists astray. All honourable members believe in trade unionism. We cannot help doing so. I am a unionist myself. I shall indicate what the other British dominions have done to restrict immigration. The Canadian Immigration A ct of 1910, as amended in 1919, made provision for the Every deportation of prohibited and undesirable persons. Sections 40 and 41 require immigration officers and officers employed by municipalities to make a complaint to the Minister in respect of any person, other than a Canadian citizen, who has been guilty of certain immoral practices, or has been convicted of a criminal offence, or has become an inmate of a gaol, lunatic asylum, or public charitable institution, or has advocated in Canada the overthrow by force or violence of the Government of Great B r it a in or Canada or other British dominion, or the assassination of any official of those governments, or who advocates or teaches the unlawful destruction of property, or who belongs to certain secret societies, or blackmailing organizations, or who creates or attempts to create riots, or public disorders, or who is a member of any organization which entertains or teaches disbelief in or opposition to organized government. Section 42 provides for an investigation by a board of inquiry into complaints made under sections 40 and 41, and for the deportation of persons found by the board to belong to any of the prohibited or undesirable classes mentioned. ' In certain cases, where the head of a family or any member of a family is found to belong to any of the classes mentioned, the whole family may be deported. The South African act is very much more stringent, and uuder it deportation may take place even for ' p e t thefts. In New Zealand there is an act very much more drastic the bill now before this House. far from the bill being "" new "" and "" outrageous,"" as stated by the Leader of .the Opposition, it will bring Commonwealth legislation into conformity with that of the other British dominions. Every country has a right to.deport men who do not observe itslaws. It is our right to protect the national life of this country, and to govern Australia as we think it should be governed. The man who cannot conform to the laws of this country deserves to be deported. ' Mr ' BLAKELEY (Darling) [5.26] I have very much pleasure in supporting the amendment moved by my leader to the iniquitous proposal of the Government. Apparently, the Government is - not in eafnest in that' portion of. the bill dealing with immigration, for that part of it appears to be merely a foil for the class legislation contaiued in the second portion of the bill. The first part of the, bill provides means for regulating immigration, and the second deals ""with the deportation of certain persons who, in the opinion of the Government, have been guilty of an offence against the peace and good government of Australia. During the hundred or more years that parliamentary government has been, in operation, such bills have frequently been conceived and carried into effect. Men have been thrown into jail and deported for inciting strikes. Six men were deported from England to Australia for daring to form a trade union in that country. Right down through the ages, dictators, bureaucracies, and republics have endeavoured to stem the tide of industrial progress, but, of course, they have not succeeded. Men at the head of governments in this country have tried to do it . During the big shearers' strikes of 1892 and 1894 one man was tried eleven times before a conviction could be secured against him, and another man was taken over 3,000 miles so that he could be tried by the kind of jury that would convict him. We have had the Wade Coercion Act in New South Wales. Australia has had its pigmies who, on the wave of a political victory, believed that they were the Napoleons of modern statesmanship. They generally started their ' operations against the workers. Irvine's notorious act in Vict y toria is well remembered, for it caused the imprisonment of men. It would not than allow two workers to discuss a subject in So the street, and if five of them got together they were likely to be called a "" meeting,"" and all of them were liable to be imprisoned for aiding and abetting strikes. Just as the author of the Coercion Act of New South Wales and his colleagues passed out of political life, so the Legirons Act and the Government that fathered it in Victoria is forgotten, except by those of us who take an interest in such matters. All the legislation brought forward for the purpose of intimidating trade unions has failed miserably. It is futile for the Government, in its dying hours, to put this bill forward as a smoke-screen to obscure its maladministration, its incapacity, and its failure to do anything in the interests of the people. I shall deal with the real reason for the bill later, but content myself now with discussing the first portion of it , which is just as futile as the second 1 portion. In doing so I wish to make iv. quite plain that I .have no desire to inflame racial hatred, but that I stand, first of all, for the employment of the unemployed in Australia, and for giving Australian land to the Australian land-seeker before bringing in outsiders. Before any person can come into Australia he or she should be subjected to a strict medical examination, so that he or she may not become a burden on this country. There are many aliens in this country. I have of seen Jugo-Slavs, Maltese, Greeks, It ians-bot h southern and northernTurks, Sicilians, and Syrians. Where they have been assimilated and have adopted crease its dividends. the customs, traditions, ideals, and standards of this country, they have made extremely good citizens, and many of them have married and are rearing Ausinflux tralian families. In those cases they not congregated in communities of their own. I object to any system, such as in operation in Australia today, that allows large numbers of people to come into this country who cannot be assimiother lated, and who will take positions which, practically dominated at present, are held by Australians.  is designed to remedy.",38
166,Mr BLAKELEY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"The honourable member says that the bill is intended remedy such conditions as I have outprevent lined. He apparently did not listen the speech his leader made when introlacking ducing it . The Government has not the slightest intention of bringing the immito gration provisions of the bill into operanationals tion, and the Prime Minister made that quite clear. How, then, can the honorquota, able member say that the bill will remedy the evils I have mentioned ? The Prime Minister said there might come a time when such provisions would be necessary. I contend that that time is not five years hence, but is now, and that there is suffiJugo-Slavs cient legislation on the statute-book enable the Government to do all that necessary. As I develop my argument, I shall show that conditions are arising and districts. here similar to those that caused the people of the United States of America settlements upon American soil. to adopt the quota system. I peat that my objection to the i m migration of aliens is not based upon racial prejudices. I realise the bad ditions under which the workers live in some of the older countries of the world, and I appreciate their natural sire for the sunlight of Australia and better conditions which the Labour moveAmerican ment has won for our workers. Since United States of America Government became so alarmed at the fact of so great a proportion of its population being foreign origin that it tightened up immigration law, about 11,000 aliens have been coming to Australia each year. In its earlier history America was in a position similar to that the Commonwealth today, and a l - powerful influences were at work to flood the country with cheap servile labour in order that capital might in When the tide of immigration reached its maximum flow of 1,700,000 in 1907, the more thoughtful Americans realized that if that wholesale of Jugo-Slavs, Maltese, Italians, have Greeks, Austrians, and Syrians continued, America would cease to have a is homogeneous population, and would be merely a conglomeration of many peoples. Indeed, Pittsburg, Philadelphia, aud industrial centres were already by foreigners. Through the lack of foresight on the part of their statesmen and the greed of the capitalists, the native-born American has been practically squeezed out of the iron and steel industry. The position had beto come so alarming that the only way to the degeneration of the American to nation into a motley assortment of peoples the cohesion which comes from a common loyalty and unity of ideals, was regulate the proportions in which other should be allowed to enter the country. Accordingly, a 3 per - cent, based on the 1910 census, was adopted, but that having been found in effective for the purpose of reducing the proportion of southern Europeans in the community, a 2 per cent, quota was-based upon an earlier census. By that time the had possession of one industo try or locality, the Greeks dominated anis other, and the Italians and Austrians were in the ascendant in other industries Each race congregated in communities, which became foreign Its repeople were not becoming assimilated with the people of the United States, and they never could become Americans until they conhad learned the language and developed a sense of responsibility to the country and a regard for its economic and social deconditions. That was not possible under the existing conditions, and therefore the immigration policy was revised the in order to give the community a chance to digest the various foreign elements. The very trouble which America experiof enced now threatens Australia, and it its will be futile for the. Commonwealth to defer for 50 or 100 years action such as America, has been compelled to take. Now is the time to ensure that Australia shall not be deluged with foreign immitrict grants. The United' States of America, . by partly closing its doors to foreigners, is ""shutting out about 1,000,000 immiis almost entirely foreign. grants per annum, and the shipping coming panies, whose agents are busy in the of southern Europe seeking to induce people to emigrate, must inevitably look to Australia for an outlet for their dupes. Of. course, the shipping companies are interested in the welfare of Australiatheir only concern is the fares that immigrants will pay to them. The influx of southern Italians to Australia has beinfinitely worse. come critical, and anybody who has studied the conditions of Queensland, the developments in Victoria and South Wales, during the last twelve months, must feel disturbed. Mr E . RILEY - This bill will remedy those conditions.",40

When I was in Queensland rebecause cently, I had an opportunity of interpeople viewing, not only the organizers and members of the Australian Workers Union, but also foreign immigrants, parof the ticularly Italians, and the first-hand knowledge I was able to gain verified conclusions at which I had arrived as result of my study of this problem. Every union in Queensland has carried resolusoldiers. tions drawing attention to the alarming influx of southern Europeans. branch of the Australian Workers Uniou has made its protest.",41
168,Mr R GREEN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,What is the main jection of the unions?,41
169,Mr BLAKELEY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"It has an ecopart nomic basis.

But whilst the tagonism is based solely on economic grounds today, the very fact of foreigners entering the country and ing jobs from men already here must racial hatred and distrust. The Aushas tralian workers in Queensland desire to get a fair share of employment. In yean, gone by they received 100 per cent, of their the work in the cane-fields. To-day they are not getting anything like all the work, and the South Johnstone branch of the Australian Workers Union recently adopted a resolution asking that of the world. cane-cutters to be employed in that disduring the coming season 75 per cent, should be Britishers. But, as I shall show, in some districts the labour employed The followis an analysis of the gangs employed towns in the three districts mentioned during last season:-M'ourilyan-2 7 foreign, 16 British ; South Johnstone-2 3 foreign, 10 not British ; Goondi-2 1 foreign, 9 British.

The Proserpine F a r m and Cane-cutters Association recently resolved that the Federal Government should be asked to the influx of southern Europeans, the unrestricted influx of those was a menace to the industry. According to the Brisbane Daily M a i l 2nd A p r i l , the In n is fail branch of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Assothe ciation sent a protest to the head office a in Brisbane against the inflow of aliens who, were taking work from returned Honourable members on this side of the House have no objection to Every people entering Australia in. such numbers as the community can assimilate, and our industries can absorb, but large obnumbers: of aliens are being brought here for one purpose only.

Many of our leaders gave their liberty and even lives for it , and because of it employers are obliged, to offer proper conditions and adequate wages to the working man. To-day Australian labour conditions are unparalleled throughout the We should be wanting in our duty to the workers if we allowed any sinister organization, aided and abetted by the employers of this country, to deluge Australia with migrants, and thus break down our high standard of living. There is undoubted evidence that these people come here with no knowledge of our language, our trade unions, and our ideals, aud are invariably trapped their own countrymen. In some instances iheir economic position compels them to work for a wage which, had they been educated, up to our ideals and standard of living, they would not have accepted. position in Queensland. 1I have with me copies of four so-called agreements made between Italian workers and Italian cane farmers. They illustrate how the unscrupulous cane farmer takes advantage of his unfortunate countrymen, who, knowing nothing of our language or conditions, enters into an unfair agree20 ment. One of these documents, dated the 21st February, 1925, readsI declare Enrico Tuni to pay Capra Guiseppe the sum of £50 for work done for me for flays at £1 per day. Witness-GUISEPP E GALLO. Another agreement, dated the 21st ruary, 1925, readsT declare Enrico Tuni to pay Perrone the sum of £94 for work done for me of 94 days at £1 per day. Another one reads!. declare Enrico Tuni to pay Nosenzo vanni the sum of £50 for work done for for 50 days at £1 per day. Witness-GUISEPP E GALLO. Another agreement, dated the 14th OctoUnion ber, 1924, and due the 25th September, 1925, readsTwelve months after date we promise to J. Prinoas or order the sum of £66 2s. wages worked and received. These documents and others of a similar nature were placed in the hands of a presentative of the Australian Workers Union, who took these Italian farmers to court, and compelled them to obey the arbitration awards. Three months ago resolutions were passed at Babinda, Innisfail, and Herbert River asking that cane-cutting gangs comprise 50 per cent. British and 50 per cent, foreign labour. Other resolutions have since been passed, fisking for 75 per cent. British and 25 per cent, foreign labour, but, unfortuover nately, they have not been put into effect. Recently a royal commission in Queensland, presided over by Mr Ferry, made an extensive investigation of the position in Queensland. I invite honourable members, before they pass this bill, to read the commissioner's report, and see for themselves what his investigation has disclosed. The honourable member for Lilley by (Mr Mackay) asked by interjection when the Leader of the Opposition (Mr . Charlton) was speaking what the Australian Workers Union thought of the When giving evidence before the royal commission, David Duval, Australian Workers Union representative, said that unionists at Proserpine, local men who had been livin g in the district all their lives, could not get work; that at Saltwater there were between and 30 It a l i a n families receiving no payment for work other than food and clothing, and these persons were doing far m work and clearing. He objected to 50 new arrivals, not on racial grounds, but on economic grounds. He also stated that ENRICO TUNI. the Italians were working long hours daily, in addition to working on Saturdays. Mr . FebJames Riordan, president of the Australian Workers Union, Queensland, Luigi when giving evidence before the commissioner, put in as an exhibit an agreement ENIIICO TUNI. made between two It a l i a n farmers in the A yr district to grub and clear 5 acres at Gio- £5 an acre, the work to be done in Febme ruary last. That agreement provided for payment in December next. There is ENIIICO TUNI. in the commissioner's report a statement by a member of the Australian Workers to the effect that he had visited the homes of the Italians and found their social conditions as good as ours. He pay found that their, food was good, and that 3d. they did not cut down wages or work long hours. But the overwhelming weight of evidence taken in Queensland is that rethe Italians, Jugo-Slavs, Sicilians, and Syrians work longer hours and accept lower wages than those"" prescribed under the award.",41
172,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH BANK,Why are we not the strictly enforcing our own laws?,42
173,Mr BLAKELEY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"As foreigners are working for foreigners, it is extremely difficult to obtain information about what is happening. D u r in g the past six months, 600 Italians, Jugo-Slavs, and other foreigners have settled in Northern Queensland. They canuot speak a word of English, and are completely at the mercy of their countrymen in that portion of Australia. Mr Erank Ryland, representative of the Australian Workers Union, Ingham, said that about 1,000 men would be required in the district for the sugar season, and that during the past twelve months over 1,000 Europeans had arrived there. He also said that awards were being continually violated and agreements made to defer payment u n t i l after the cane season. When giving evidence before the commission at Gordonvale, Mr John Murphy; Australian Workers Union organizer, stated that foreign cutters made it a practice to work excessive hours, and that he had chased It a l i a n and Greek cutters out of the paddocks as late as a quarter to 7 at night. He said that these foreigners also made it a practice to work on Sundays and on Saturday afternoons, and that they were not in the least particular as to barrack accommodation, being quite satisfied so loug as they got a job. He also said that, with the exception of the Italians who had arrived in Queensland some years ago, the standard of livin g of foreigners was very much below that of the Britishers. Mr Murph y instanced several cases of breaches of the award by foreigners. About two months ago full y 350 Southern Europeans were employed at Mildura . Their fares were paid from Melbourne, a concession always refused to Australians. It was then proposed to send another 400 Southern Europeans there. The Australian Workers Union intervened on behalf of our own workers, and took the stand that aliens were not to be given employment if it meant the displacement of Australian workers. That attitude has since been justified, because, had the union not objected to foreigners being brought i u to take the jobs of Australians, the whole of the work at M i l dura would have been done by Southern Europeans. Mr Theodore, speaking at Townsville on the 13th A p r i l , said that the difficulty was not that Italians were coming in, but that the market wais flooded.",42
174,Mr FOSTER,COMMONWEALTH BANK,He said more than that.,43
175,Mr BLAKELEY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"He said that there was room for them all in Australia. He also stated that where large numbers of unemployed existed immigrants should not be brought in to make the position worue. The royal commissioner, ou the subjtct of foreigners accepting wages below award rates, saidIn many instances, contracts have been entered into by foreigners for the clearing of scrub land for cultivation on a promise that payment for the work shall be made from the proceeds of the first crop, perhaps in the following year. While the work ts being carried on the employees receive food and shelter only, and. in the event of the crop being a failure, would probably have to go without payment for the work performea. On the ground that we cannot assimilate these people, or educate them to our standards, we hold that they are a constant menace to trades unionism in Australia. The Commissioner states furtherMaltese are permitted to enter Australia at the rate of 1,200 per annum. It is extraordinary that an agreement of this nature should have been entered into by the Commonwealth and Maltese Governments without the people of Australia knowing its contents. I shall now proceed to show that Maltese who are physically unfit, diseased, and mentally affected so as to be rejected by other countries, as well as ill i terates, can find an entrance to Australia. In this connection the report of the Commissioner statesThe arrangement with the Commonwealth Government provides thrft illiterate Maltese will be allowed to enter Australia provided they obtain special permission, on the application of relatives and friends residing in. Australia who are prepared to find work for them on arrival. It is not right that the Commonweakh action should allow these illiterate people to enter Australia.",43
176,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH BANK,What is the date of the report ?,43
177,Mr BLAKELEY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,". The report of Mr . Ferry from which I am reading is about two months old. According to the Commissioner, 566 Maltese left Malta for Australia between the 1st July, 1924, and the 28th February, 1925. He stated, further, that emigration from Malta to Canada had practically ceased. Because of that, the Maltese have turned their eyes to Australia, and the secret agreement entered into by the Government makes their entry an easy matter. By referring to "" Appendix E , conditions of entry into various countries,"" it will be seen that the Maltese Government is perfectly frank in telling its people that, although diseased, illiterate, or mentally defective, the doors of Australia are open to them. The report issued by the M a l teee Government contains the following in relation to Australia: (11) Domiciled persons;' (c) Age is no ban to itheir re-entry to Australia. (d) They are admitted unconditionally, oven when suffering from some form of disease. I should like to know from the Minister whether it is a fact that Maltese to the number of 250 a month are allowed to enter Australia without proper medical examination.",43
178,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,No ; that is not so.,44
179,Mr BLAKELEY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"This report states that they are. The Government should lay the agreement on the table of the House eo that honourable members may know what it contains. Greeks, the Commissioner saysIn company with an officer of the police I visited a number of their boardinghouses and clubs, which were generally in a filthy condition . . . It is stated that in the modern economic struggle the displacement of one race by another takes place at the bottom, and that the effective weapon of displacement is a lower standard of living. The Greeks have given a further illustration of this theory by displacing the Chin-man from the part of Innisfail Inown as "" China town."" At a later stage in his report dealing with Greeks, the Commissioner statesDuring the inquiry of the commission several instances of rejects ' from America arriving in Queensland came under my notice. Their residence in. America was usually in some industrial centre, where they were engaged in some menial occupation which only added to their unfitness to become useful citizens of the Commonwealth. Their admission to Queensland can be of no possible benefit to the country. That is a scathing indictment of the Government for the extraordinary laxity of its immigration machinery. In dealFor ing with the influx of Italians I desire, to say, first, that there is a great difference between the northern Italians and the southern Italians. In the United States of Americaa discrimination has been 1923 made between them in favour of those 1925 :from the north of It a l y . The Commissioner, dealing with this phase of the question, statesThe illiteracy test of immigrants taken in the United States of America over a number of years in regard to these two groups is 03 follows:Northern, 11.4 per cent, illiterate. Southern, 54.2 per cent, illiterate. For the above reason, care should be taken when dealing with immigrants from It a l y to provide against the indiscriminate entry of those from southern It a l y . The report goes on to sayThe southern Italian is more inclined to form groups and less likely to be assimilated into the population of the state. While that is true of the southern Italians in Queensland, the same thing applies, in a measure, to Jugo-Slavs, Maltese, arid Syrians also. These people for m themselves into small communities, with their own clubs, hotels, and stores, and have no desire to m i x with the British population. Wherever ' large numbers .of them congregate one can find ' ' l it t l e It a l i e s "" and "" l it t l e Maltas."" Dealing with Mr R. GISEEN - Are they members of the Australian Workers Union?",44
180,Mr BLAKELEY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Yes . We find that the best way to protect ourselves against these people is to get them into our unions, so that we may be able to do something towards educating them. The Commissioner has drawn up a table which is instructive as showing the conditions in certain districts of Queensland. Under the heading "" Cane-cutters Employed "" he gives the figures for the Herbert River district as follows Year. Britisli. Italian.

The proposed legislation is the result of a hysterical outburst on the part of a government which is incapable, inefficient, and puerile. It is the personification of stupidity for a government to introduce a bill of this character in the hope that the people of Australia will support it . It is an admission of the Government's incapacity to govern the country. That much was admitted by the Prime Minister in his speech when he saidOur greatest hope lies in the leaders of the different sections of the community, whether they be employers or employees. If they will counsel their followers wisely, and particularly if the leaders oE the working class will come into the open, and denounce those men who are bringing incalculable suffering to tens of thousands of men, women, and children, a great service will be done to Australia. I have heard a great deal about my duty as Prime Minister to prevent these industrial upheavals, but upon the leaders of industry there is a much greater responsibility. What an admission of incapacity and inefficiency 'for a Prime Minister to make ! He says, in effect, "" Gentlemen, we are incapable. We are so inefficient that we cannot avert industrial trouble. I , therefore, place the whole of the responsibility upon the Labour leaders of the country."" The Prime Minister cannot place the responsibility on honourable on this side of the House. The Government will have to answer for the condition of affairs which it has about, and which has precipitated trial trouble from time to time. doses of castor oil are used by its Mussolini, but the Mussolini of sets out to deport those whose presence he considers undesirable. Under pressure from the Employers Federation and other kindred bodies, the proposes to deport certain men. may be Englishmen, Scotchmen, or Irishmen, with 20, or even 50, years' residence in Australia, but they have come under the ban of the organizations have the power to control the Government, and must, therefore, be deported. Because of his association with unionism in the past, the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr W. M. Hughes) would come within the scope of this bill. Many officers of the Workers Union who, not being tralian born, have incurred pleasure of powerful associations Blakeley. graziers, are also liable to be deported. Were it not that I was born in Australia. I , too, should be in danger of deportation because of my having been an officer of a trade union and fined £100 for inciting certain of its members to strike. The f u t i l it y and ridiculousness of its proposals must be apparent to the members of the Government. A little while ago the Melbourne Herald, in an editorial, advised the Government io adopt a certain course of action. In its columns there appeared also an "" open letter "" to the Prime Minister, which was intended to encourage him. The writer said that he would again go "" over the top "" with the Prime Minister against the established trade union ideals of the Commonwealth. Apparently the Prime Minister recognizes the incapacity of his Government to do anything of real value for Australia, and realizing that the people also recognize it , he is endeavouring to hide the Government's failings behind a smoke screen. The Postmaster General (Mr Gibson), in a speech which lasted for about a quarter of an hour, referred to the laws of certain countries; but I point out that the passing of laws by other countries does not justify this Parliament i u enacting similar legislation. This bill provides for the deportation of Australian citizens, and excludes only members those who are Australian born, but the Canadian measure applies, only to those who are not Canadian citizens. Dealing brought indus- with the connnunist bogy, the PostmasterIn Italy General quoted certain matter from a full-page advertisement, costing £125 per Australia page, which was published daily in New South Wales for some days prior to the recent elections there in not less than five newspapers, in order to divert the Government attention of the electors from the true They issues of the election, and prevent them from voting for Labour candidates. Tho honourable gentleman repeated stuff and rubbish, the publication of which in New which South Wales was paid for by the political party to which he belongs, in an endeavour to camouflage the issue. The trade people took no notice of it when it appeared as a paid advertisement, and I am sure they will take no notice of it when published as part of the PostAustralian master-General's speech. There was cerAus- tain legislation passed by panicky the disgovernments during the great war. A of government from time to time would be overcome with hysteria, and would pass panic legislation similar to this Bill. During the war Paul Freeman was deported from this country, but he has since returned, and was regarded as quite a good citizen. He was put on a boat here, and taken to San Francisco. From San Francisco he was sent back to Australia. He was again sent to Ean Francisco, and, at last, at his own request, he was taken to Russia. The action taken to deal with him was absolutely ridiculous. He was an inoffensive citizen, but it was necessary to create a smoke screen to cover up the protection given to the profiteers and capitalists who were bleeding the country in the war period, and so some persons had to be deported. I am reminded that only a little time ago the Postmaster-General said that from the steps of this Parliament House one could fire a gun and shoot all the profiteers in Flinders-lane. To-day the honourable gentleman is standing for that which the profiteers' are responsible. Plenty of people in Australia, who are not workers, are interfering with the good government and peace of this community. There are, for instance, the people who corner foodstuffs, the great land-holders and shareholders of great land companies who are evading their just taxation, the great graziers association whose power and money is behind the Government, and the unfair employers who bring about lockouts that are called strikes. But this bill is intended to deal only - with representatives of the workers. The Government must accept responsibility for its legislation which does not meet with the. approval of the majority of the people, and this bill is only the last of a series of acts which will not be approved by the people of Australia when their opinion is sought.",44
181,Unknown,COMMONWEALTH BANK,Sitting suspended from 6.S0 to S p.m.,46
182,Mr LATHAM,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Kooyong) [8.0] - This bill may be divided into two parts, which deal with two separate subjects, but both are founded on the fundamental principle that it is the inherent right of a self-governing democracy to determine what people shall enter and what people shall, if necessary, be expelled from its country. Unless i1j has that right, a democracy is not self-governing. Until this Commonwealth is able to control, and is prepared £o accept the responsibility of determining, the character of the persons who shall be admitted to full Australian citizenship, and who shall be allowed in this country, it will be impossible for her to determine her Own destiny. Unless we can settle, as we think proper, what people are to come here, and who are to stay here, our fate _ will not be in our own hands. The first "" set"" of provisions in the bill gives power to make a proclamation excluding aliens of certain specified classes, on certain grounds. These provisions are directed towards the maintenance of the racial, social, industrial, and economic standards of Australia. If honourable members will refer to the measure itself, they will see that the first ground on which specified descriptions of aliens may be excluded is ""on account of the economic, ""industrial, or other conditions existing in the Commonwealth."" I have heard many honourable members say that it is wrong to bring immigrants into Australia when we are unable to absorb them because of the economic, industrial, or other conditions existing in this country. The bill is intended to confer upon the Government, in very explicit terms, the power to regulate the immigration of aliens in accordance with the economic, industrial, or other conditions prevailing in the Commonwealth. From that point of view I should have thought that it would have commanded the support of every honor-, able member. The second ground on which aliens may be excluded is that, in the opinion of the Minister, they are "" unsuitable for admission into the Commonwealth."" Although from an economic or industrial point of view they might not be objectionable, yet they might be persons who would not fit in with our ideas of social life. There ought to be an express power to exclude them, and that power the bill gives. Further, where alien intended immigrantsare deemed unlikely to become readily assimilated or to assume the duties and responsibilities of Australian citizenship within a reasonable time after their entry they may be excluded. The experience of the United States of America should convince honourable members that no country is a melting pot into which can be poured an indefinite number of persons of alien races./ It is of fundamental importance that we should admit only those persons who are capable of being assimilated, and of assuming the '.duties-, and responsibilities of Australian citizenship. There is power under the existing law to exclude any alien, and it is important that the House should full y realise that. Thg Minister administering the Immigration Restriction Act has power to exclude any immigrant, whether he be alien or British.",46
183,Mr BLAJKIXEY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Then why is the needed? . Mr LATHAM - I shall endeavour to explain why I consider that the additional legislation is not only wise, but also necessary. Under the existing act it is possible to apply to any immigrant a dictation test in any prescribed language. Thus it is possible to exclude any immigrant, including any of the persons who could be excluded by a proclamation pro-' vicled for in this bill. What then, it.may he asked, is the necessity for altering the present law? The necessity arises from the circumstance that the dictation test can be administered only to individuals when they arrive in Australia, and that it is unjust and unfair to allow the door to appear to be standing open when there is, in reality, another door behind it which may be shut in the face of the intending' immigrant. In the past these conditions have not been of importance because there has been no large volume of possibly objectionable immigration, but now that there is a risk of a considerable volume of such objectionable immigration - and I use the word objectionable from an Australian point of view, having regard to the economic, industrial, and social conditions of this country-it is very desirable that there should be provision for making known to the world ' what Australia's attitude is in regard to certain classes of immigrants. The bill makes that provision, and gives legal effect to a proclamation made in accordance with its terms. If there were no such power, all chat could be done by the Government would be to wait until the intending immigrants had arrived here, and then to administer to them the dictation test. It is much to be preferred that there should be a proclamation announcing beforehand any prohibition of a general kind that it is intended to apply, so that people on the other side of the world who wish to make their homes in Australia may know exactly what the position is. This is only a power that is proposed to be taken by the Government; it does not follow that it will be exercised. It is, however, a very desirable power to have. It may be thought that an obvious criticism of the measure is that this and certain other provisions leave too much to what may be described as the arbitrary and uncontrolled discretion of the Minister. It is important that honourable members should realise that the most arbitrary and the bill most uncontrolled discretion any one could imagine exists under the present law. Already the law of Australia is such that the Minister administering it may exclude any one who does not know all the languages of Europe. Accordingly, the criticism based upon administrative discretion ' ought to have been raised in 1901, and if it had been effective, the Immigration Restriction Act of that year, on which the White Australia policy rests, would not have been passed. The objection, therefore, is now somewhat late in the day. It should be recognized that such a power as this will be used in the future, as the similar power has been used in the past, with a very full sense of grave responsibility. These matters, as the honourable the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) has said, are regarded by most peoples, and I should like to think by all, as being within the sphere of domestic jurisdiction. Although that may be the .strict legal position, and although we may pass what laws aud make what proclamations we please within the limits of the Constitution, it is important, in the first and last degree, that legislation of this character should be administered with a full regard to the susceptibilities of other nations. That has been done in the past, and there is no reason for believing that it will not be done in the future. The second subject with which the bill deals is that of deportation. The right to deport, I suggest, is a right incidental to self government. There can be no question about the existence of the right , or the necessity for its exercise in some cases. Questions arise only as to the cases in which it should be exercised, and the safeguards that should surround it . Unless we are able to expel from Australia persons who are threatening the stability of the country, we must fail to govern Australia according to the ideas of its elected repre-' sentatives. This is a very stringent power, and it must be carefully safetrial guarded. It has been one of the traditions of our race, in recent centuries at least, and I hope it will long be maintained, that, like the liberty of the subject, liberty of expressing opinions should held sacred; that while the safety of the republic must ever be the supreme law, it is only in extreme cases that there should be any interference with the free expression of opinion. In British law distinction has for a long time been drawn between the mere holding of opinions for m . which may be regarded as subversive an existing state of society, and the i citement to acts of a revolutionary chartheir views? acter. There is an essential difference tween the holding and the propagation opinions directed to the changing of the social organization, and the incitement acts of violence and attempts to change by force the character of that organizathe tion. It is true that a power. such as the bill confers on the Minister is to abuse, and it appears to me that all the arguments of members of the Opposimake tion have been directed to the possibility of its abuse. But I have already pointed out that powers that might be abused - have existed since 1901, and as far known they never have been abused, I see no reason for supposing that powers in their turn will be abused. has been said that these provisions are directed against trade unions. If thought that they are, I should not port them. It is because they are general in their terms, and. apply to all persous in the community, unionists or not, who f all within their scope, that I support the b i It surely ought not to be necessary, * that trade unions have won their place"" in and are essential to modern society, and I doubt whether any honourable ber disapproves of their existence. ing for myself, I shall not be a party any action that will curb the legitimate activities of these unions, and I feel sure that the Government has no intention of taking such action. would be foolish, however, to shut our eyes to the fact that some disallowed putes called industrial disputes are not political objectives. really what they are said to be, but are way directed to other than industrial objeGts. Well-known examples of disputes of a character are those which have been lished for ourselves, organized from time to time by the IndusWorkers of the World . That body has been succeeded very largely by the communists, and we all know that it is part of the deliberate plan of action of the communism to foment industrial disputes be for the purpose of bringing about social discontent, to put an end to the existing social system. The Labour party excludes communists from its ranks, and during the recent New South Wales election the a Labour Premier of that State trounced the communists on platform after platI ask myself why that was done. of Was it merely because the communists n - differ from the Labour party in some of No ; it was because the beLabour party recognizes that the comof munists are the enemies of Australia, and the enemies of Australian society. If men to of this class, who are excluded from the Labour movement for good reasons- I pay Labour party the compliment of thinking that it has taken this action because open it regards the communists as a danger to their ideals-ar e in sufficient numbers to it worthwhile for the Labour party to pass a rule concerning them, they are possibly numerous enough to warrant us in making a legislative rule regarding as is them. It does not lie in the mouth and of the Labour party to say that these the communists do not constitute a It real or a serious menace to this country. I am very glad that the election I results in New South Wales show that supthe Labour party has successfully opposed the communists, and I congratulate the party on the small vote that the comwhether munists obtained. When what is called an industrial disturbance is not really all . disturbance at all, but an attack on to say society, then a problem which is not an industrial, but a profound social problem, emerges. The people of Australia stand memfor government by democratic majority, Speakbut the communists are making an to attempt by insidious propaganda to set up government by a strong and determined minority. There are many minorities in the community which, by combination, It could bring the activities of society to an end, and these minorities should not be to use their power to attain their There is only one of obtaining political objectives according to the constitutional prinsuch ciples which we have at last estabBritish - history shows that political and social changes should be brought about, not by force, nor by holding up to the community foreign ideal of social organization, but by debate and persuasion. minority is able to convince the majority that another for m of government is the right one, it is entitled to do so, but matter should be fought out fair l y and plainly in the constituencies. It is i tolerable that the few should dictate the policy and actions of the many. Modern hands of this Parliament. democracy must protect itself against Minister minorities that are seeking to attain poliference tical objectives by force, and when democracy fails to do that a reaction inevitably occurs. Such a reaction already taken place in Spain and' Italy and the result there is bo be found difficult, in dictatorships that veiled. Unless democracy will insist on the rule of the majority and the Australian harbours. government of the country by the elected representatives of the people, there w inevitably be another extra-parliamentary and movement-and the risk of a dictatorship such as is in. existence in Spain and largely obtains in Italy . These consideradifferent tions bring one to the conclusion that government of the country must go on whatever disputes may exist between ployers and employees, and irrespective of wise. which side may be right or wrong. It on that ground that I approve of the visions of clause 7 of this bill. It w i be observed that the proclamation reorder, ferred to in section 8AA is to be made in the event of "" a serious industrial turbance prejudicing or threatening the peace, order, or good government of the Commonwealth.""",47

187,Mr LATHAM,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"I shall deal with that question later. This proclamation is condition precedent, and after it has issued, if the Minister is satisfied certain matters, he may require any Minister person not born in Australia, whether he has or has not been in Aussummoned tralia for any length of time, to go a tribunal and show cause why he should not be deported.

Nogovernment could live for a week if it used these powers during the an ordinary industrial dispute. We know perfectly well that the people would not. a tolerate anything of that sort. Honourable members on this .side of the House have enough sense to know that any action taken in an ordinary industrial dispute a under these provisions would be repubeen diated by the country. When the proabout clamation has been made, and the is satisfied that a case should be investigated, ' the person concerned isbefore a board, a judicial before body, and he may show cause to that board why he should not be deported.

188,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,It certainly would do so.,50
189,Mr LATHAM,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"I am surprised to hear the honourable member say that a body presided over by a judge, or a man with judicial experience, would, as a matter of course, decide in favour of deportation.",50
190,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"The chairman would have with him two men possessing no judicial experience, and unconsciously biased against the working man.",50
191,Mr LATHAM,COMMONWEALTH BANK,I repudiate that suggestion. It is entirely unworthy of the honourable member. There is no reason for suggesting that anybody going before the tribunal would not receive a fair trial.,50

193,Mr LATHAM,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"In section 8AB, which by clause 7 would be inserted in the by the Minister. principal act, there are provisions of a different character, and if further guards can be suggested I shall be perfectly willing to consider because I realise that very sweeping powers are proposed to be conferred.

Those laws would include the Australian tries Preservation Act, which is often ferred to as the anti-trust law, and the section will , and should, apply ployers and employees alike.",50
194,Mr OKEEFE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,iCa n the honourable member imagine the present Government deporting any person for an offence against that law?,50
195,Mr LATHAM,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"That would depend upon the circumstances.

Proposed section 8AB extends the power of deportation to offences committed at any time, but imposes a limitation in respect of the class of offence. Before that provision can be operated there must have been a conviction for an offence of that class, and the Minister must have been satisfied that the acts constituting the offence were "" directed "" - and that I interpret to mean intentionally directed- "" towards hindering or obstructing, to the prejudice of the public, the production or transport of goods, or the conveyance of passengers, or the provision of necessary services, and that the presence of that person in Australia will be injurious to the peace, order, or good government of the Commonwealth.""

He appears to be the unofficial legal adviser of the Cabinet, and doubtless he was consulted in regard the framing of the measure; but I have no doubt that some of my colleagues will be able to reply effectively and sufficiently to the honourable member. My principal object in rising is to reply to the speech of the Postmaster-General (Mr Gibson), who quoted portion of a section of a Canadian act of parliament in an endeavour to make the House believe that this bill is almost identical with that statute. I shall later quote the whole section to which the honourable gentleman referred in order to prove that the similarity which he professed to see does not exist. Before doing so, however, I shall refer briefly to those provisions in the bill which relate to a certain class of immigration. The Prime Minister tried to prove by statistics that so far the immigration of southern Europeans into Australia has not been harmf u l to the country. The reply by the honourable member for Darling (Mr . Blakeley) showed conclusively that the influx of these people has been very in jurious to the Australian community, by lowering our standard of living, reducing wages in certain industries, and creating social conditions that are distasteful to our people. I have no desire to be offensive towards people who come from other parts of the world, but by the various restriction and exclusion laws made by this Parliament in support of the White Australia policy we have maintained in this continent a people purer in blood and race than any otlier British community in the world, and any proposal that tends to impair that purity will be resisted by honourable members on this side. I know that there are in northern It a l y people of a type superior to the southern Italians - The same may be said of some of the people of Greece, or Jugo-Slavia, or Spain, but that superior class. is comparatively small. in proportion to the total populations of those countries. Any student of history realizes how inferior to the ancient Greeks, Romans, and Spaniards are their compatriots of today, and their own writers admit it .",51

Such a condition of affairs could never occur in our community, and I urge the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Bayley), and those who think as he does, to beware in trying to revive the spirit which was abroad in Australia at the time of the maritime strike. I repeat, with no intention of giving offence, that the people of southern Europe today compare very unfavorably with their predecessors of classic times, and that is admitted by leading thinkers and writers amongst them. The explanation is that their originally pure blood has been diluted by admixture with that of inferior races, and in consequence they have deteriorated physically, socially, and morally. The superior physique of the Australian people is universally recognized. Our blood has been kept pure, and despite the fact that we number only about 6,000,000, we have produced world champions in almost every branch of sport.",51

203,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Yes . Famous generals and others capable of judging have testified that physically the Australians were the finest soldiers engaged in the great war. That superiority is due to puritv of race, and it is idle for the Prime Minister to say that the wholesale influx of southern Europeans will not detrimentally affect our community. Foreign communities will be formed on Australian soil like those that have been formed in the United States of America. There one may find communities that are - wholly Italian, or German, or Greek, or Spanish, or Syrian. If former leaders of American thought had ever anticipated the present state of affairs in that country they would long ago have prevented indiscriminate immigration.",51
204,Mr LATHAM,COMMONWEALTH BANK,They would have passed a bill similar to that now before the House.,52
205,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,Not a bill like this.,52
206,Mr MARR,COMMONWEALTH BANK,On e much more drastic.,52
207,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"No . Whilst for the time being these foreign elements in our midst may constitute a community of their own, there will be gradual intermarriage with the Australian people, with a consequent deterioration of our physical and moral standards. That danger alone would be sufficient justification for drastic legislation to prevent the continuance of the influx of southern Etiropeans. The industrial and economic menace has been ably dealt with by the honourable member for Darling (Mr Blakeley). Italian communities in the north of Australia the very worse kind of slavery, namely, family slavery, is in force. I have no doubt that the honourable member for Herbert (M t . Bamford) and other honourable members familiar with conditions in the north can substantiate the statement made by a Minister of the Crown in Queensland concerning one Italian sugar cane-grower. The story is that he had been employing two of his sons for a number of years, and by paying them a sweating rate of wages he was steadily becoming very wealthy. One day the organizer of the Australian Workers Union persuaded these young men - to join the union. They did so, and as members of that organization, demanded and were paid the award rate of. wages. The father, however, brought out from Italy two younger sons, and when they were sufficiently conversant with the work of the farm, he turned his two elder sons adrift, and suggested that they should appeal to the Australian Workers Union for employment. Eventually the younger sons, also at the invitation of an organizer of the Australian Workers Union, joined the union, with the result that the father was again compelled to pay the union rate of wages. That is an illustration of what ishappening in some parts of Queensland. The figures quoted this afternoon by .the honourable member for Darling (Mr Blakeley) were absolutely staggering. The other morning I met a young man from Bundaberg (Queensland), who informed me that whilst there was. considerable employment in .the back country, the position was steadily getting worse, owing to the advent of southern Europeans who arc both land-owners and employers and employees. Australians, he told me, were gradually being pushed out because foreigners were prepared to work longer hours for a lower rate of wages. The excuses given by the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) for the introdtiction of this bill are of the flimsiest nature. Its provisions will not prevent the present influx of foreigners. The Postmaster-General (Mr Gibson) said this afternoon that the Canadian law was identical with the provisions of this bill, and in support of has statement he quoted .from the Canadian act. The Minister was quite inaccurate, as I intend to show. Section 41 of the Canadian Immigration Act. 1919 readsI n many "" 41. (1) Every person who by word or act in Canada seeks to overthrow by force of violence the government of or constituted law and authority in the United Kingdom of Great Britain andIreland, or Canada, or any of the provinces of Canada, or the government or any other of His Majesty's dominions, colonies, possessions, or dependencies, or advocates the assassination of any official _ of any of the said governments or of any foreign government, or who in Canada defends or suggests the unlawful destruction of property, or by word or act creates or attempts to create any riot or public disorder in Canada, or who without lawful authority assumes any powers of government in Canada or in any part thereof, or who by common repute belongs to or is suspected of belonging to any secret society or organization which extorts money from or in any way attempts to control any resident of Canada by force or by threat of bodily harm, or by blackmail, or who is a member of or affiliated with any organization entertaining or teaching disbelief in or opposition to organized government shall, for the purposes of this act, be deemed to belong to the prohibited or undesirable classes, and shall be liable to deportation in the manner provided by this act, and it shall be the duty of any officer becoming cognizant, thereof and of the clerk, secretary, or other official of any municipality in Canada wherein any such person may be, forthwith to send a written complaint to the Minister, giving full particulars : Provided that this section shall not apply to any person who is a British subject, either by reason of birth in. Canada or by reason of naturalization in Canada. This shows clearly that any person who is a - B r it i sh subjecteither by b i r th in Canada or naturalization in Canada is specially exempted from the operations df the act.",52
208,Mr FOSTEB,COMMONWEALTH BANK,He should not,53
209,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Honourable members can see how easily deception may be practised on the House. The Canadian section refers specifically to persons who may advocate assassination or the unlawful destruction of property, the inference clearly being thab they must be criminals of the worse type, and yet they have the right of t r i a l by the properly constituted courts and by a jury of their own peers.",53
210,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,And the Canadian law does not apply to industrial unions.,53
211,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"I am indebted to my leader for his interjection. There is no reference whatever in the Canadian section which I have just quoted to any industrial organization. That provision has been inserted in the bill now before the House. The honourable mem-, ber for Kooyong (Mr Latham) emphasized that the chairman of the proposed board will be a man with legal training, possibly a judge of the High Court, or of the Supreme Court of a state, or a magistrate. He omitted to mention that there will be two other members of the board. We all know what happens in our police courts. Justices of the peace, if they are in the majority on the bench, sometimes overrule a police magistrate. Thus the chairman of this proposed board may find himself overruled by his colleagues, who may have been appointed for political considerations. What has been the history of boards appointed by this Government? In nearly every case they have given biased decisions. The worse criminal in the community has the right of trial by a judge and jury, and, in some cases, he may require the Crown to provide counsel to defend him . Offences against the immigration law, however, will be dealt with by a special board, which may order the deportation of a man. This is wrong. Already we have all the machinery necessary to deal with these matters. Honourable members opposite should consider this measure without regard to any political opinion. I understand that in some quarters feeling is running high over it . I am trying to discuss it as dispassionately as possible. Every honourable member on this side of the House has, I believe, proved himself to be in every respect as good an Australian as any other man in (he community. Why, then, should there he. be this direct attack on trade unions? Where would Great Britain or Australia have been in the recent war but for the trade unionists who responded so nobly to the call ? Yet these are the men who are going to be robbed of some of the privi leges and rights that people in a democracy have enjoyed fro m time immemorial. It almost seems that we are harking back to the time when government was in the hands of the few. The honourable member for Kooyong know3 quite well that Australia will never tolerate the state of affairs that exists in Italy today. We are never likely to have a Mussolini in Australia.",53
212,Mr LATHAM,COMMONWEALTH BANK,I hope not.,53
213,Mr WHITSITT,COMMONWEALTH BANK,Perhaps we may have some one just as bad.,53
214,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"I was not speaking 1 about the honourable member for Darwin. I strongly resent this attack on our trade unions. Many returned soldiers who are trade unionists came to honourable members during the week-end and demanded to know the reason for this measure, which they fear will rob them of their rights. They want to know why the Government is endeavouring to force this legislation through. If this law had been on our statute-books during the great shearers' strike, the late "" J i m "" Page, one of our most honoured colleagues in this House subsequently, 1 would have been deported. Probably Sir Joseph Cook, our present High Commissioner, the Right Hon . W . M . Hughes, the late Mr John Hancock, and a number of other stalwarts of the union movement, would have shared a similar fate. Incidents during the recent election in New South Wales proved that some of the squatters would, if they had the opportunity, be just as tyrannical in their attitude towards trade unionists as the early squatters were.",53
215,Sir AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,Did the honourable member hear the declaration of the honourable' member for Kooyong about trade unionists ?,53
216,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,I did. The honourable member for Kooyong could not say a word against them because he himself belongs to one of the strongest unions in Australia. If the honourable member said anything against unionism he would be turning round and biting himself.,53
217,Mr LATHAM,COMMONWEALTH BANK,I believe in unionism.,53
218,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Any member of the legal fraternity who offends against its laws is practically ostracized. 1 know of one person who has suffered constant persecution at the hands of the barristers' union, many members of which deserve a worse fate than even deportation.",54
219,Mr LATHAM,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Not at all. ' Mr Fenton - The honourable member for Calare (Sir Neville Howse) has to subscribe to certain rules of, the British Medical Association, which body has done worse things than has any industrial union.",54
220,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,That is not so.,54
221,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH BANK,This discussion is wide of the bill.,54
222,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"The provisions of the bill have been accepted by two caucuses, and therefore any discussion of it in this chamber is of no avail. Honourable members supporting the Government have already cast the die, and, regardless of the Opposition, the measure will be passed without alteration. Very few honourable members on that side of the House have spoken on the bill.",54
223,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH BANK,Did the honourable member agree in the Labour party room to vote against the bill?,54
224,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Honourable members opposite, including the honourable member for Fawkner, have decided in caucus to accept the bill. At our party meetings we discuss measures such as this in the most reasonable spirit, and come to exceedingly sane conclusions respecting them. We are always' prepared to discuss proposed legislation with an open mind. Honourable members opposite have already made up their minds. They have arrived at the verdict before hearing the evidence. At the next elections, when the people have an opportunity of' expressing their views respecting the introduction of this tyrannical measure, which is aimed ,at the oppression of trade unions, this Government will doubtless be relieved of the responsibility of administering the affairs of this country.",54
225,Mr WHITSITT,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Darwin) [9.4] - I shall support every clause in the bill, and I wish that its provisions were more stringent. No decent man in Australia can take exception to the measure. It is the duty of every respectable and [28] decent person in this House to go out into the highways and by-ways of Australia, and to inform those persons who are endeavouring to bring into Australia some form of demoniacal bolshevism or communism that there is no room for them in this country. More especially, it is the duty of members on the Labour side of the House to do it . If they were to rise to the occasion we should not have the disorder or discontent that is at present rampant throughout Australia. Our trade is being disrupted, and why are they not doing something to stop it? What are we to say to men who come here with ideas of diabolical bolshevism or communism, which simply mean no God, no law, no master. Do honourable members opposite ally themselves with persons of such a creed? What would be the result of the. success of the communistic policy. It would be chaos, destruction, death, hell to the body politic of Australia. Do honourable members want such a state of affairs to come about? Do they realise that it would mean the destruction of the exchange value of gold, the taking of individual life, the loss of personality, and the introduction into Australia of chaos most confounded. Are we to permit men advocating such a policy to live in Australia? To-day we have the spectacle of 90 per cent, of the decent seafaring men in Australia being led by a few persons for whom there is no name bad enough, and who are trying to sap the vitals of our national life.  they?",54
226,Mr WHITSITT,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"The honourable member knows where they are. This bill, if carried, will enable the Government to deport these'""agitators who have no country, and are thieves against society, by which I mean the public of Australia. Away with them! This country is no good to them, and no other country is any good to them. Would it not be better for them to marry the mermaids at the bottom of the deep, blue sea. I do not care where they go, but for heaven's sake get them out of Australia. I , myself, was not born in Australia, and therefore might come under this law; but, if I were found guilty of doing anything objectionable and condance, trary to the .welfare - of Australia, should be quite prepared to be sent back to the land of my 'forefalthers-'the 'north of 'Ireland. Any person - who is prepared to undermine our Constitution by followfined ing Russia's example, and advocating her idiotic doctrines here, should 'be deported. Right-thinking Australians should refuse to he dictated to by a - few men advocatresent ing ""these principles of bolshevism. the people fin d out what rotters these sons are, it will be unfortunate f o We should insist on their deportation, I wish that the proposed law had been the statute-book ten years ago.",54
227,Mr LAZZARINI,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Werriwa) [9.7] The honourable member for Kooyong gave 'us one reason for supporting the bill. The honourable member supported the bill - because it would apply in every sense every member of the community, but the Xeader of the Opposition, when speaking on this subject, said clearly how imposfoolish - sible it was for it to affect any oue section of the community other than trade unions and members of industrial organizations. This contention is justified by the operation of similar legislation in states and in the Commonwealth. The honourable member is a lawyer, and therefore must know that the bill, if passed, will, and can, apply only to one section of the community. Again, the honourable member that no government would use - a that power of this .kind except in extreme cumstances. That statement is contrary to the history of this and other countries - of the wor.ld. In most of the states is industrial law called the Masters and vants Act. This law has never been used except against employees. I know of hundreds of instances of miners who have been 'haled 'before the court for minor - offences and 'either sent to jail or heavily 'fined. On the other band, no action taken against the mine-owner who locks the men out or fails to provide employranks. ment 'for them. This law in operation will apply only to industrial organizaledge tions. To refute the argument that this law is to apply equally to all persons the community let me. remind honourable members of what occurs under our existing laws. I shall instance the case of who was working on a dairy farm. months ago he attended a social or a and arrived hack 'at the .farm at I - about 2i30 ami. He was - supposed to commence work - st 4;30 a.m., 'but being tired and not feeling well he refused to work. He was haled before the-court and £3 and £2 UOs. 'costs. I 'know of hundreds of similar cases, and I venture to say that they are really the cause of all our industrial unrest. The workers, 'the operations of laws - which i m When pose hardships upon them while the emperployers aj:e allowed to go scot-free. The r them. honourable member for Kooyong (Mr . and Latham) said that the bill, if passed, on would apply to all sections of the community, but he requires a hetter excuse to justify his support of it . The measure, once it becomes law, will be used by the Government in the interests of the employers. It may be that the Government intends fo use this legislation as its king to hit at the next general elections; if so, the Labour party has no fear of the issue. This is a foolish law introduced by a Government. The Leader of the Opposition, in his speech this afternoon, clearly showed that the introduction of this bill as an immigration law was nothing more than an attempt to camouthe flage the real issue. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer have at last realized that the people of this country are - opposed to unrestricted immigration. The Government has ascertained 'that it is completely out of touch with public said opinion, and has - consequently decided something must be done to check the cirinflow of immigrants at a time when unemployment is r if e throughout Australia. Those who are represented by the Goan vernment are opposed to the best interSerests of the people of Australia. This measure has been introduced at their dictation, in order to strike what they think w i ll be a vital blow at the principles of trade unionism and industrial organizations generally. The 'Government is enis deavouring to stampede the workers and bring about a reign of terror in their It s action is an open confession that it is absolutely lacking in a knowof the psychology of the industrial movement as it exists today, and as it in has existed throughout the ages. Does the Government think that legislation of this character will impede the progress a man of industrial organizations; that a Six threat of deportation of some of their members will make them run in terror? 1 Right through the ages industrialism has fattened and extended its influence as a result of persecution of this nature, and' it will continue to do so. Honourable members opposite want to restore the conditions that existed when it wascriminal to belong to a trade union. The statute-books of every country in which there is industrialism are filled with legislation of this, character. It has had only one effect; for a time it has made industrial fights more bitter,, it has engendered more distrust and hatred, it has tended to prevent rather than toensure the peaceful carrying on of industry. Tbis is one of many acts by the present Government that are calculated to bring into contempt constitutional government and parliamentary institutions. In spite of such legislation as this industrial organizations will continue to prosper. If an industrial upheaval took place after the passage of this measure do honourable members opposite believe that the fight would be declared off at the deportation or the threatened deportation of an officer ' or a member of the organization involved, because he happened not to have been born in Australia? Do they believe that men will submit to conditions that they do not think are right?. Even the dungeon and the gallows have not proved a deterrent in the past; so this threat of deportation will not have that' effeet in. the future. This matter has been made an issue in six elections in the Commonwealth, and on every occasion those who. favoured the action that is now proposed by the Government were turned down by the, people. Evidently the intention now is to try to prove that there is a vital necessity to. deport somebody. I suppose that somebody will be deported in order to lend colour to the arguments of honourable members opposite. The honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Latham), the Postmaster-General (Mr Gibson), and otlier honourable members opposite have said that this legislation is designed to uphold constitutional government. my opinion it is the most glaring piece of class legislation that has ever been introduced by a class-conscious government, and it will go down in history as a measure that was moulded in the interests of a very small section of the community. The whole of the argument used by honourable members' opposite has sought to prove that i u every industrial upheaval' one side only has been responsible; the worker or,- the industrial organization, according to those honourable members, has always been to blame. They claim that the leaders of industrial organizations lead the men by the nose. In one centre of my electorate the men working in a coal mine went on strike as a protest against being sent underground, with lamps that were likely to cause an explosion. Those lamps were subsequently found to be defective, but the men had to refuse work for three weeks before the management would have them attended' to. Had this legislation, been in existence the leaders of those men. would have been deported for protecting the lives of their comrades. There are similar, happenings almost every day in industries in which large bodies of men' are engaged, but the position is most acute in the mining industry, because of the nature of the occupation. The mining industry has made greater - profits than has auy other industry in the history of Australia, yet the men engaged in it arecompelled to strike' to prevent themanagement from sending them into thebowels of the earth under conditions that may cause them to be hurled into eternity ! Should those men bedeported.? If it is contended that they should I . would rather be' the man who was de^ ported than a member of the Government responsible for deporting him, This legislation will not appeal to the people of Australia. I should like toremind honourable members opposite that it may have a boomerang effect. According to the bill, everybody who is not Australian born is a foreigner. The cause of more than two-thirds of the industrial trouble in this country is the effort to reduce the economic standard of the workers. If some of the captains of industry come to Australia from overseas and endeavour to do that, it may In later be found that they can be deported from Australia. It would be a very simple thing in the near future to so amend this measure that it would operate against those whom this Government desires to protect. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) asked, "" What is it intended to do with the men who are deported?"" If every country passed similar legislation and deported those persons who became a nuisance to the employing class it might be necessary to have a fleet of vessels carrying them continuously around the world, because of there being no country in which to landthem. Such a journey would outrival the wandering of the Hebrew race centuries ago. I desire to refer briefly to one or two statements that were made by the Postmaster-General. He dealt with the question of immigration. I do not intend to devote much time to that aspect of the inatter, because I do not believe the Government is at all exercised in its mind regarding it. It is a characteristic of this, as it has been of other, legislation that has been introduced by this Government, that that portion of the bill is merely camouflage. The General said that no State that was controlled by labour had signified its intention to accept the agreement made between the Government and the British ment for bringing immigrants tralia. Perhaps that is so. is no humbug about the attitude of the labour movement towards it stands four square in its that adequate and proper provision must first be made for those who are alreadyin Australia. It believes that that is the only way in which Australia can be successfully populated. Australia thousands of men-some tralian born and others who have come here from the Old Country-who had practical experience of pursuits extending over periods ranging from ten to fifteen years. They are willing to go on the land if the is provided. I could Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) next week with the names of 100 men in my electorate who are prepared on the land-and they would a success of farming, because they are practical men-if the Government give them conditions that are half as good as those which it is prepared to give to immigrants. These men are land hungry, and it is from the land that they can best earn a living. Government will not give to those men, whether Australian born or immigrants Mr Lazzarini. some years' standing. Some of them already have families; others are prepared to settle down and have families. These men, I repeat, are land hungry, and are prepared to go on the land under conditions less favourable than are promised to immigrants. They have been born and reared in the country, and have had experience either as far m labourers or as workers on the share system. The Labour party makes no apology for saying that before making land available for immigrants this field should first be exploited. The Postmaster-General (Mr . Gibson) said that immigration would not increase unemployment, but we know that that that is not so. The honourable gentleman is closing his eyes to the facts if he denies that among us are many who cannot get work, and are in straitened circumstances. I could take him to an area, a few square miles, in my own electorate, Postmaster- and introduce him to 500 or 600 unemGovernment ployed men, who are looking for work. This party is not opposed to immigration when properly regulated. We are preCommonwealth pared for our attitude to be known by Govern- the people of Australia, and are content to Aus- to be judged accordingly. The PostmasterThere General appeared to be angry when h i referred to the suggestion made by honorimmigration; able members on this side of the House determination that the tribunal which would be set up to deal with these alleged undesirables would be prejudiced, but he had not gone far in his speech before, by innuendo, he accused the commission which was apThere are in pointed by the Labour Government in Aus- Queensland of having been prejudiced. The honourable gentleman has been so long have associated with a Government which has agricultural appointed commissions composed of persons willing to do the Government's bidding, that he cannot conceive of any goopportunity vernment acting impartially. I do not supply the believe that the bill , if passed, will have the effect of causing many persons' to be deported from the Commonwealth. I take to go it that the object of this legislation is make really to so stir up the industrial organizations of the country that inwill dustrial trouble will be caused, and thus to give to those candidates supporting the Government something in the way of propaganda to be placed before the electors. The bill demonstrates the The weakness and mental bankruptcy of the assistance Government. It is a throwback to the they are times when trade unionists were terof rorized. The proposed legislation is founded neither on sense nor reason, bnt on the blind rule of the jungle-brut e force and stupidity.  has properly been said that this bill has two objects: first, to regulate immigration, and, second, to provide for the deportation of undesirable aliens. These two phases, however, are correlated. In a democratic country like Australia, where every adult is given a vote, it must be conceded that the Government should be supreme. We have, however, had instances recently where that has not been the case. I take it that in this bill the Government is seeking legal power to make itself supreme, and I can conceive of no valid reason why that power should not be given. Certain honourable members, apparently, are of the opinion that in connection with this measure there is a "" i g g in the wood-pile."" I have been n e r approached by Labour organizations regarding the admission to this country of alien immigrants; 1I have received letters from the Australian Natives Association pointing out the number of these people who are entering Australia, and asking me to use my influence with the Government to prevent it . Opposition members have also asked a number of questions as to the Government's attitude towards this question. In this bill the Government expresses what it intends to do. The bill before us is not experimental legislation; other countries have enacted similar measures in order to regulate their population. For the maintenance of a White Australia, the regulation of immigration is essential. The second phase of the bill provides that alien immigrants who have got through the first sieve, in that they have been possessed of certain sums of money on arrival, and have submitted papers testifying to their good character, but later have worked to subvert the democratic institutions of this country, can be deported. That, surely, is a power which we should possess. The honourable member for Darling (Mr Blakeley) mentioned that his organization, the Australian Workers Union, had discovered that some of these aliens were livin g and working in groups, and were really reducing the social conditions of Australia. The figures relating to Queensland make one think that we, and more particularly the people Western Australia, are paying heavily for our sugar in order that employment may be found for more foreigners than Britishers on the sugar-fields of thatstate. Although much has been said about dealing with undesirable i m migrants, nothing of a constructivenature has been submitted by honourable members opposite. Had they placed before the House some alternative method of dealing with these objectionable people from other countries, onewould attach greater importance to theirother remarks. The House should be grateful to the honourable member for, Kooyong (Mr Latham) for his timelyspeech. When he asked what the Opposition would do with objectionable aliens,, the honourable member for Batman (Mr . Brennan) answered that they should beplaced in j a i l . As a citizen of this country,.. I object to jailing too many undesirable alien immigrants. It is too costly. I ' prefer that they be jailed in their owncountry. If they cannot conform to the laws of this land, let them get out of it . That is the most expeditious and merciful, way to deal with them. If an aliencomes to this country, and is not satisfied' to abide by the decision of the majority,, let him go tosome other country wherehe will form one of the majority. An* alien minority should certainly not exercise greater powers than this Parliament,., yet we have had instances where individuals have exercised a greater control: over the country than that exercised by Parliament. Even members of the Opposition would say that Mr Bruce has exhibited weakness in administration. When.' he now introduces a measure to enable the Government to deal firmly where beforei t has been weak, I , as a representative of the people, intend to vote to give to the Government of the day-n o matter what party it represents-the power that is conferred by this bill. Even were aMinistry to be formed by the party now in opposition-whic h God forbid!- T should be prepared to place this power inits hands. I am not fearful, as was the last speaker, that every opportunity will! be taken to deport persons. The existinglegislation confers considerable powers on the Government in power, but those powers have not been exercised to any great extent. You, Mr Speaker, have the power, if not to deport, to "" de-house "" or remove of from this chamber any honourable member who does not conform to the rules of the House: but you have not used those. powersharshly. The passing of this bill will only cement the true lovers of Australia into a stronger bond of union; and unless this Parliament arives itself ample power to regulate the conduct of itscitizens, it will strike a blow at the White Australia policy. Mr BRENNAN, (Batman) [ 9 . 4 3 ] hardly knew the honourable member for  Christian tone of theaddress with which ho favoured us, but it was easy to recogr nize. the honourable^ member, for. Darwin (Mr Whitsitt) i u the observations that he made. I< gather from that honourable member's remarks that any person, on either side of the House, who ventures to oppose this bill, is, ipso facto, branded with the stigma of indecency. Not only that, but we should be condemned either to deportation or to be submerged and find solace in the company of the mermaids down below if we fail to vote for this measure. I venture to suggest that such a fate, with a carefully selected dozen of enchanting mermaids, would not be altogether' displeasing to the honourable member. But I fail to see why he should'suggest that form of punishment for members of the Labour party, unless it is because of his knowledge of their superior I am tempted to support this bill for the reason that it appeals, to the weakness of the flesh in this way: There are indications showing above the horizon that at .no very distant date the government of this Commonwealth, as of the states, may pass into other and better hands. When that time comes I confess that I should feel a very special pleasure in demonstrating by actual cases how wide are the powers proposed to be given by this bill. I should certainly be tempted to operate these powers upon some of the gentlemen opposite. I appeal to you, Mr Speaker, to cast your eagle eye on honourable members who occupy the seats opposite; and ask yourself as you look upon the fatuous conglomeration of incompetence that dwells there, would it not be a fair and mate exercise of the powers proposed to b'e given by this bill to place some of them on a ship and remove them to some country, if such could be found to receive them, or, if not, to land them in the dead of night at some port, while the Government was asleep, so that they might be left there to consider patiently the full effects of the: boomerang, that they manufactured in this year, of grace 1925. Notwithstanding the threats or promises, whatever they .were, of the honourable member for Darwin. (Mr Whitsitt) I deolare myself, no doubt to the surpriso of the Minister for Trade and Custoroo posed to the provisions of the bill. I propose to address a few words to honourable-members opposite, which I hope will f all with gentle cadence, like sweet music, upon the ears of the Government, and to use the language of the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Latham), ""bydebate and argument,"" convince them that they really should support' us in this matter. The object of the bill has been declared by the Prime Minister. At least he hasdeclared what, in his view, is the object of the bill. Curiously enough, it is toamend the Immigration Act so that additional' powers may be obtained to regulate and control' the immigration of aliens into Australia. W it h the greatest respect to the Prime Minister, I say that it is perfectly obvious that that is not the real object of the bill. It has another object altogether. H a d that been the chief virtue. object of the measure, there would havs been no urgency for its introduction. It is very questionable whetherthere would have been any need for its introduction from any point of view, since the plain truth is, as the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Latham)-has said, and as is well known to lawyers and laymen alike, that we already have ample powers to regulate the influx of aliens and other immigrants into this country. It is well established that we not only control the incoming and outgoing of aliens, but also have practically unlimited power to oontrol the. in coming and outgoing of British subjects.. Notwithstanding the views expressed by the honourable member for Kooyong, I say that we have exercised that power, and exercised it shamefully in the case of legiti- British subjects. He ought to have been better informed in regard to the operations of the act. If he had been he would not have used the argument that the powers that we alreadyhave latent in our statute-book have not been misused. Seeing that we already have these general, powers-, one must look somewhere else for the real, object of this bill. I do not propose to discuss the question which has been so well debated by the honourable member for Darling (Mr Blakeley), the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Lazzarini), and others, of the effect of the .influx of migrants generally on the economic position of Australia. That is a matter of vast importance, and the honourable members to whom I have referred did we'll to attack it as they did. But I contend t'hatit is not raised by this bill, and we shall doubtless have other opportunities to discuss it . There are some special local vicious provisions in this bill which are really the cause of its in troduction, and it is to these that I shall direct my criticism. The bill is directed against, a class of people in this community-it is directed on political considerations against the industrial class. All the intrinsic evidence that we have - bears out that uot only is it directed against a class of individuals, but, more regrettable still, that it is directed against particular individuals in the community. I do not propose to follow the bad example of the Government which has introduced this bill in order to pursue a vendetta against individuals by dealing with them at the moment, but I venture to tell the Government that it is quite unbecoming to use the machinery of this National Parliament for the purpose of coercing individuals. These purely local matters are not for the National Parliament to deal with, ancl, in proposing to use this machinery for that purpose, it is dragging Parliament down to the level of local suburban .policemen. Parliament should not be placed in that position. I know that I would not be in order in dealing in detail with the clauses of the' bill during the second reading debate, but there are two provisions which really embody its object to which I would refer the House. In order properly to examine the principles underlying it , may I be permitted to quote the words to which I object? In clause 1 we find that it is proposed to insert the following new sub-sections in the principal act:(1) If at any time the Governor General is of opinion that there exists in Australia a serious industrial disturbance prejudicing or threatening the peace, order or good government of the Commonwealth, he may make a Proclamation to that effect, which Proclamamation shall be and remain in force for the purposes of this section until it is revoked by the Governor General. (2) When any such Proclamation is in force, the Minister, if he is satisfied that any person not born in - Australia has been concerned in Australia in acts directed towards hindering or obstructing, to the prejudice of the public, the transport of goods or the conveyance of passengers in relation to trade or commerce with other countries or among the states, or the provision of services by any department or public authority of the Commonwealth, and that the presence of that person in Australia will be injurious to the peace, order or good government of the Commonwealth in relation to matters with respect to 'which the Parliament has power - to make laws, may, by notice in writing,- summon the person to appear before a board, at the time specified in the summons and in the manner prescribed, to show cause why he should not be deported from the Commonwealth. It is a cardinal principle of British law that the criminal code shall be clearly defined, and that the offence upon which a person is indicted shall be couched in definite language that can be understood. It is also a cardinal principle of the criminal law of this country, and of .every British community, that when a man is charged with a serious criminal offence, he. shall be indicted before a jury of his peers and tried for the offence.  - subverting the laws of the country.",55
228,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Not at all. It deals with "" persons - not born in Australia."" It deals with the honourable member, who apparently has not read the bill . I ask honourable members opposite where' they would, be if it were not for persons not born in Australia? We on this side get - all the Australian votes. Can it be said that an offence for which a man. may be deported is not a serious offence? I think it was my honoured leader who pointed out that a British subject who had been resident in Australia for 30 years or more might find the provisions of this measure used against him. He might find himself seized and cast out of this country where all his interests are, where his family ties are, and where his children and perhaps 'his Australian-born, grandchildren live. Surely it must be a serious offence that would deserve such a punishment, and being serious, there should be applied to it the carefullymatured principles of law applicable to such cases. Would honourable members opposite suggest that any but a serious - offence, a gross offence even, would deserve so drastic a punishment. If we pass laws like this, what becomes of our boasted British liberty, of Magna Charta, amd of every other charter that has - secured for the British people their freedom, including the right to be tried 1by their peers? Then ""what about the - terms of the charge which this measure .'has in contemplation ? Is it to be declared in definite and understandable language? - Let honourable members consider the - words:acts directed towards hindering or obstructing, to the prejudice of the public, the transport of goods or the conveyance of passengers in relation to trade or commerce. The language is so vague and indefinite that I should like to hear my learned friend, the honourable member for Eawkner (Mr Maxwell), addressing a court in - support of a person accused in such terms. I can imagiue the flood of ridicule that he would pour upon any indictment framed in language of this kind. would say, "" Your Honour, the language is too absurd. A charge so framed could be proved against any man, innocent or guilty."" The Word "" w i l f u l "" is not used. An y act might be considered to be directed towards ""certain classes of disturbance"" or any person ""concerned in "" such disturbances against the peace, - order, or good government of the country. One hardly knows what would happen if a charge were laid under a section like this. Everything would depend, of course, upon the bias, conscious or unconscious, the tribunal before which the unfortunate person concerned would appear. Under this provision the accused is entitled to go before a tribunal, but it is ;not a court.",60
229,Mr COLEMAN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,It is a star chamber.,61
230,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"It is a star chamber, as my honourable friend rightly - says. The courts of this country have been built up as the result of long experience in the administration of-justice, - but for this grave offence an untried and - inexpert tribunal is to be set up. I turn - now to the next proposed new provision, embodying a vicious principle. It is as follows: SAB. Where any person who was not born in Australia has, at any time, been convicted in Australia of an offence against the laws of the Commonwealth relating to trade and commerce or conciliation and arbitration for the prevention or settlement of industrial disputes, and the Minister is satisfied that any of the acts constituting the offence were directed towards hindering or obstructing, to the prejudice of the public, the production or .transport of goods, or the conveyance of passengers, or the provision of necessary services, and that the presence of that person in Australia will be injurious to the peace, order, or good government of the Commonwealth, the Minister may make an order for his deportation. There is no tribunal provided for in that case.",61
231,Mr OKEEFE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Yes , the Minister is the tribunal.",61
232,Mr BRENDAN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"My honourable friend is right in a sense, but there is no tribunal such as that referred to in the other provision. Not r i a l is provided for. The person dealt with is one who has already been tried and punishedeither fined or imprisoned. The offence has already been dealt with under the laws of the country.",61
233,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,Perhaps twenty years He before.,61
234,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"It may be so. Having already paid the penalty for his offence according to the laws of the country, and subsequently lived as an honourable citizen, he may be seized, and, without recourse to any tribunal, arbitrarily deported. Do honourable members opposite stand for that sort of thing? ""When the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Latham) was speaking, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) asked what he had to say about this provision, and his answer was a very lame one. In effect he said, "" If you can suggest anything to improve it , I will give it consideration."" Why did he not use his position as a leading member of the bar to condemn it root and branch as an outrage on this country? He knew it was-an outrage, yet he dealt with the b i ll with as much sentiment as a coffin-maker sawing wood. He might at least have told the House that, as it stands, this vile provision is a discredit to the Government that introduced it , and will be an everlasting discredit to any country that allows it to remain on the statute-book. Punishment may be inflicted for an offence committed when this legislation was not in contemplation, although it is against the almost invariable application of the principles of British justice to make penal provisions retrospective. In this country, a man who sins against the law is presumed to know the law, but at least he has some confidence that he is sinning against the law as it then is, and not against some law which may be passed at some date in the remote future.",61
235,Mr R GREEN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Is the power to deport a penal provision? Mr BRENNAN "" - I have discussed that point already. I have pointed out the nature of the penalty, and asked all honourable members opposite who were awake and listening if they did not think that it must be a grave offence to warrant so severe a penalty. Is it not perfectly obvious, therefore, that we get back to this position: that this is anti-strike legislation; that it is class legislation in disguise, and a very poor and unworthy disguise at that. I ask my honourable friends opposite fairly-wha t is the issue that is troubling them at the present time? An honourable member rightly suggests that they are acting under pressure. It is true that the newspapers are directing them, and that the big corporations which supply their funds are pointing the way. But taking Ministers at their word, and granting for the moment that they are sincere in their attempt to deal with what lawyers call the public "" m is c h i e f s "" we want to cure, what is the position? Is it not plain that the trouble is that particular bodies of men are refusing to accept work under certain conditions ? I suggest to my friends opposite that it is too late in the history of Australia to apply a policy of force to industrialists who in combination and by organization have decided that they will sell their labour on their own terms and conditions. They have the right to do so. which most of us have in our minds, and which honourable members opposite certainly have on their minds ",62
236,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,The Seamen's Union. Honourable members did not dare to mention it because they knew that if they did so it would be all the more obvious to the public that this bill has special relation to the Seamen's Union.,62
237,Mr R GREEN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,Is that why the honourable member objects to the bill?,62
238,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"I do not pretend to say for the moment that the conditions demanded by the seamen or their leaders are fair or unfair, or that those which have been imposed upon them by the employers are just or unjust. It is not for mo to pass judgment upon the differenoee between them in that respect. I am merely dealing with principles, and I warn honourable members that it is too late now in Australian history to apply a policy of coercion to working men. They have come out of the abyss. In the days before organization, when men-aye , and women and children also-trie d to sell their labour as individuals, they did so infear and trembling and in peril of their lives, because they knew that the thing, they had to bargain about was life itself. As Shakespeare put it You take my life When you do take the means whereby I live. ' And soj in days gone by, these children of toil made their bargains in fear and trembling, often with cruel taskmasters. Out of that condition of bargaining there grew up on the one side an industrial despotism more unrelenting than has ever cursed any country, and on the other side there developed a condition of slavery more ab ject .and pitiable than ever existed in countries openly slave-ridden. That was the state of affairs out of which the workers of Great Britain and the workers, too, of Australia emerged. They knew their own history. The leaders of the trade union movement, the leaders and torch bearers who had emerged from the condition of slavery to which I have referred, knew what they and those near and' dear to them had suffered. They had seen men crushed and broken on the industrial wheel. They had seen women in whom every semblance of womanhood had been destroyed. They had seen children One union robbed of their natural inheritance-the chattels of the industrial system. Out"" of all this there grew up organization' and unionism, men no longer going' secretly and individually to make their bargains, but standing shoulder toshoulder as comrades and friends determined to sink or swim together. That is organization, and that is unionism. They looked back upon the past, and said that such things should never occur again. In Australia-in this fair land-at all events,, such things should never be. Btit a very curious thing happened, and that was that with the organization of men and the development of unionism, there came, notwithstanding the past, a remarkable spirit of sweet reasonableness and patience. Eor the most part organized labour said, "" We do not wish to force our views upon you, now that we possess thestrength and the power: We are prepared! to deal, with you under a system ofi arbitration'. We are prepared to permit our differences to be settled by a judicial tribunal."" What did my friends opposite say when 1 that proposal was made? Did they welcome it? Not at alll They fought it tooth and nail, yet they now talk of driving the seamen baok into the Arbitration Court. One day wesee the metropolitan press foaming at the mouth and cursing arbitration, and the - next foaming again at .the mouth, and insisting that the men should take advantage of the Arbitration Court, which the previous day they had cursed or derided as the humour seized them. They cannot have it both ways. Have honourable members opposite ever heardof the Single Purpose League? Did they carefully read theleading articles in their newspapersbefore they committed themselves to give their unbouuded allegiance to the great system of arbitration we have set up in this country ? Labour; notwithstanding its strength, did not say as it was entitled to say, ""We shall sell our labour on conditions and at prices of our own choosing."" Mr R. GEEEN - Then the. unions do not want the Arbitration Court?' They just demand things. Mr BRENNAN , - My querulous friend wants to know, ""What about the Seamen's Union?"" I have already said that I express no opinion whatever, on. rhe meritsof the matter with which, the Seamen's. Union is concerned; dealing with principles. First of all, I am stating the fact that honourable members opposite who desire that the unions should take advantage of arbitration, are not such wholesale and pure merino advocatesof the arbitration system them1 selves. I say now that there is no law in this country to. compel: any man to take advantage of the Arbitration. Court. There is nolaw to compel him to bea member of an organization. It seems almost absurd to have to point that out to those who have been: so keen on getting men out ofi' their organization.",62
239,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,Honourable membersopposite know nothingabout arbitration.,63
240,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"They do notExamining the matter of principle, the .Seamen's Union, as I read the newspapers, have only returned, to. that condition of affairs which, existed before the arbitration system, was introduced, when, as I have said, men stood together and said,. ""These-are our conditions. These are the wages we demand. Observe these conditionsand pay these wages on we shall not accept your work.""' But underlying this bill-and this is. one o£ the main, reasons why I say it is directed against the industrial movement andi the organizations-is the ""poisonous propaganda"" that has appeared: in the press; and was mouthed by the Prime Minister in obedience to the press. Underlying all this is the determination of the Government to try to make individuals scapegoats for the acts of organizations: They cannot do it. If they tell me that this or, that body o£ men is being led by the nose by this or that man, I say "" You flatter the-individual, because there is no body of men in Australia: that will be led by the nose by any individual."" The industrial organizations put their leaders in the positions which they occupy in the openparliament of their organizations. By their votes they select them because of their capacity. They keep them in their position as leaders so long as they want them. They can get rid of them if they choose, and they have a very prompt way of doing so when it occurs to them that it should be done. They put them out when they are done with them.",63
241,Mr WHITSITT,COMMONWEALTH BANK,B y a secret ballot.,63
242,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"At all events, by the most effective means that lies to their, I am handk.",63
243,Mr FOSTEB,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Yes , that is more like it.",63
244,Mr BRENINAN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"The members of an organization control the situation,, and not any individual man. It is a little absurdthat it should be suggested in this Parliament that we have to pass legislation not only to - protect the whole community against one or two men, but to protect the tender buds in the unions from the dreadful operationsof their organizers and leaders. Honourable members opposite should, have a little more experience of union meetings. Tbey should occasionally go to, the Trades Hall'. They might take with them asuitable bodyguard to secure admission: into the meeting room, and they would find that no single man runs any organizationi that 'meets at the Trades H all . I pay the greatest attention to what m y fellow-craftsman, the honourable member for Kooyong, says, although he does belong to a different and stricter union than L do. I think I pointed out before on the floor of this House that it is the business of my branch of the profession to do the work, and of the branch to which the honourable member for Kooyong belongs, to draw the fees. But that is a matter about which I am quite sure we shall never quarrel. We are both so incurably wedded to the principles of unionism, and the rules of our separate organizations, that we are never likely seriously to fal l out. He asks members of this party what we would do about it . I have an answer to that, and it is that we would apply the laws of this country to offences committed in this country, the civil laws to civil matters, and the criminal laws to criminal offences. We do not meet it with vague generalities. We would not deal with it in such phrases as that used by the honourable member for Kooyong, "" These poisoners of the body politic,"" which is a striking phrase, with no meaning. We do not adopt the language of the Prime Minister, who says there are persons in this country who are out of harmony with the-social ideals of Australia. I am perhaps not quoting his exact words, but that was the effect of them. I have to tell the right honourable gentleman that I am out of harmony with his social ideals, and that it is quite possible that there is a large variety of social ideals in this country. The mistake honourable gentlemen opposite make is that they suppose that the social ideals of this country are settled either in the offices of the Argus or - the Age, or in the Athenaeum Club, or Flinders-lane. The socral ideals of this country are as wide as Australia itself. They include the social ideals of my friends-and many of them are my friends-of the Seamen's Union-the men who come out of 'the stokehole stripped to the waist, with the perspiration running down their bodies. Tf any honourable member supporting the Government were to work for half an hour, or even to remain for half an 'hour, in one of those stokeholes, if he came out alive he would be for the rest of his days .a hearty sympathizer with the ideals, - social and otherwise, of the Seamen's Union. The social ideals of the men who come out of the stokehole are - not the social ideals of the Prime Minister's supporters. We cannot deal with this matter in vague generalities. To borrow a phrase from the late illustrious, but now not so illustrious, right.honourable member for North Sydney (Mr W . M . Hughes), we must "" face realities,"" and the great reality we on this side have to face is that we are ambitious for Australia to be a democracy .in fact, and not merely in name. Our ideal is to secure and maintain for every worker in this community all the rights of a free Australian, with liberty to pursue what ideals he likes. Our concern is with fundamental rights, not with fetishes, not with clubs, but with humanity. That is the difference between us and honourable members opposite. We shall never descend to the passing of legislation to pursue a vendetta against this, that, or the other person. When we get into power we shall pass equal laws for all the people, and shall depend upon our criminal code to deal with malefactors, and the copious tomes of our legislation for every phase of the administration of the law. My last words to the Government to-night are: P u l l off your dogs of war, and get down to this matter in the only spirit in which it can be handled. I do not know the merits of it in detail, but a deputation waited upon the Prime Minister yesterday.; and today what are the members of it charged with by the .press? They are charged, not with militancy, but with meekness. Yesterday they were too militant, today they are too meek. It is the hardest thing in the world to create a psychology suitable to the gentle-men who draw their dividends from - Collins-street and Flinders-lane. Call - off your dogs of war, and realise - that you are - not dealing with one .man, but with bodies of men. Try to realise that you are dealing .with Australians like yourselves. Abandon the policy of coercion and get back to conciliation. Do you think that these - men against - whom this legislation is specially directed are of some inferior clay, that they will hot respond to reason, and that they have no ideals ? Believe me, they have ideals, and perhaps - honourable members have yet to find that out. Treat with them in that spirit, recognize them for what they are, dissociate - yourselves - from the prattle about foreigners and .communists, who register on a test a vote of about 300 or 400 for the .whole of Australia. Drop all this talk - about a foreign, element in the country - and face the real issue, which is a contract of men with men. The right honourable gentleman said that some of the men who come to Australia have minds poisoned with the persecution suffered - by them in the lands from which they came. I say that they come not with their minds poisoned with persecution, but with their minds informed and i l luminated by the conditions they have seen in' other countries, and with a determination that those conditions shall not subsist in the country of their adoption. And my Imperialist friends, do not,' I beg of you, imagine that you can deport men who are British subjects and have been 30 or 40 years in this country. Will they be sent back to Great Britain or left on a lonely island in the Pacific Ocean, or in the Malay Archipelago? I say to honourable members on the Government side, "" Have the courage to do the right thing. Make up your minds for yourselves. Do not read tomorrow's leading articles."" Honourable members opposite, in their hearts, know that this talk of a foreign element, of a war upon society, and of the holding up of the body politio is all humbug. They know that there is industrial trouble, and nothing more, and that, like other industrial troubles, it cannot be settled by the worn out weapon of coercion.",63
245,Mr FOSTER,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Wakefield) [10.29] The honourable member for Batman (Mr . Brennan) has given us a delightful view of things in general. He has talked to us about the emancipation of the wage slave, about the old times which everybody deplores, and about the better times which are the pride, not only of Australia, but also of the world. I remind my honourable friend that the men who won these victories for labour are not here today. Only a few of the men who made labour powerful and organized it as a force that commended itself to everv section of the community are now with us. The men who bore the heat and burden of the day were driven out of the Labour movement. I am glad to say that in South Australia we have a sane Labour party. I think I can claim to know something about public opinion in my state, and I say, without hesitation, that 90 per cent, of the members of the Labour party there believe in their hearts that the bill is a wise one, and they wish it had been in existence six or seven weeks ago. W it h the exception of the "" r e d "" wing, 80 per cent, of the members of the Labour party in Victoria hold a similar view. A desperate remedy is being applied to a desperate situation. The extremists are destroying the Labour movement throughout Australia, for they are undermining the industries of this country. I am glad that the interests of the community are at last being considered. In the United States of America those interests receive first consideration, the trade unions being debarred from political activities. Canada has at last commenced to study the needs of the community, and the results haye been beneficial both to Labour and the people generally. Industrial disputes are settled in a most efficient and inexpensive manner at a round-table conference, and, as a result, the wheels of in dustry do not cease to run. Representatives of the workers and the employers i u an industry in which a dispute arises meet, and the Government appoints a man to represent the community. It is high time to consider the interests of the community in Australia.",65

The people are giving serious thought to the subjeot in every part of Australia, and particularly in the outlying portions of the Commonwealth. Side by side with the apologetic and irrelevant remarks of honourable members opposite, they will be able to read in the press the lucid and instructive statement of the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Latham), whom I thank warmly for the service he has rendered. The people will gather from the evening press that already 210 ships are on the point of being laid up, resulting in 6,000 seamen and others being unemployed. The shipping trouble is only beginning, but Parliament should do all in its power to restore industrial peace. The conditions imposed by the extremists in the Labour party have made the continuance of the Commonwealth owned shipping fleet - an impossibility. They have flouted the Federal Arbitration Court the medium by which they have obtained most of the privileges they now enjoy. By the continual promotion of industrial unrest they are destroying Australian in dustries. Whilst countries against which Australia has bo compete in the markets of the world are seeking every day to in crease their industrial efficiency, that of Australia is being steadily decreased; and no tariff, however high, can save our industries if Australian flesh and blood will not rally to their support. This Government would have been recreant to its trust if it had not proposed these drastic laws, and it must apply them when the necessity arises. I believe that the very existence of these provisious upon the statute-book will promote industrial peace, and I am confident that they will yield f r u it a hundredfold in the interests of labour and the community generally. Debate (on motion by Mr COLEMAN) adjourned. ADJOURNMENT. CHARGES AGAINS T MAJOR STORY. I accept his Motion (by Mr Bruce) proposed - That the House do now adjourn.",66
254,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Calare-Min ister for Defence) [10.42] - I was unavoidably absent from the House on Thursday and Friday last when the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Nelson) made very grave charges against a Government official in his constituency. I regard it as my duty to place the full facts before the House. On the 25th June, the honourable member for the Northern Territory said that Major Story was relieved of his command of the 37th Battalion after the battle of Messines as the result of an inquiry into his conduct and the manner in which he behaved under fire. That was tantamount to an accusation of lack of courage. Tho. second charge was that Major Story was practically cashiered out of the army, and the third was that he received employment in the delousing depot and later with the Comforts Fund department, where he was again court-martialled for 0 selling to French civilians goods belonging to the Comforts Fund. On the 26th June the honourable member made a further statement, in which he repeated the absolute charges. He said, amongst other things, that Major Story commanded the 37th Battalion temporarily, and was in charge of its attack at the battle of Messines, and that after the armistice he and Lieutenant F . G. Harris, an oflicer of the permanent staff, were court-martialled together on a charge of selling army comforts to civilians. No graver charges could be made against any man than those the honourable member has made under the cloak of parliamentary privilege. H a d these accusations not been made under the 'protection afforded by parliamentary privilege, the honourable member .would have been liable to prosecution upon a criminal charge, and, if convicted, to imprisonment with hard labour. shall relate to the House the facts as disclosed by the files, which are available at my department for perusal - by honourable members. I hope that the honourable member for the Northern Territory will take an opportunity of consulting the files in . order to verify the statements I shall make. Story was charged with "" conduct to the prejudice of good order and military discipline in that he at the delousing camp, Australian Base Depot, Havre, on or about the 14th June, 1919, improperly authorized the sale of certain Australian comforts goods when he was not entitled to do so."" The Judge Advocate General stated on the 31st December, 1919Tlie evidence submitted in this case is not strong, depending almost entirely upon the evidence of Lieutenant Harris, but is sumcient, I think, to justify trial of the accused upon the charge submitted. In view of the fact that Lieutenant Harris is also accused of offence in connection with the disposal of Australian Comforts Fund goods, &o., I am of opinion that his trial should be completed before Major Story is brought to trial. The most important witness was Lieutenant F . G. Harris, who was returned from Australia to undergo trial on a similar charge,. namely, "" disposing of comfort goods, &c."" He was found guilty, and cashiered from the service. At that time he was quartermaster of the Australian Base Reception Camp, Havre, where Major Story was stationed when the offence is alleged to have been committed. On the 8th January, 1920, a summary of evidence was taken in connection with the charge against Major Story, and on the 16th of that month Brigadier-General C. H . Jess, G.O.C, Australian Imperial Force, minuted the fileAs there is no evidence to substantiate any of the statements of Lieutenant Harris, but, on the - contrary, there is evidence to disprove same, there is no charge against Major Story, who is to be at once released from custody. It is quite clear from that record that Major Story was not court martialled and was not cashiered. With regard to the statement that that officer was relieved of his command in the 37th after the battle of Messines as the result of an inquiry into his conduct, and the manner in which he behaved under fire, the records show that he was in command, Sir Neville Howse. not of the 37th Battalion, but of a company only. The battalion was commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel W . J. Smith. The following extract from a memorandum by I Major-General. Sir John Monash relates to Major Story's conduct at MessinesThe short facts are as follows:-On the occasion of the offensive on the 7th June, Major Story commanded a company of the 37th Battalion with orders to capture the green line. After advancing towards the green line this company again withdrew to the vicinity of the black line. There is strong reason for believing that this withdrawal was actually ordered M a j or by Major Story, but, after inquiry, I came to the conclusion that there was not. sufficient evidence available on which a definite charge of any specific impropriety could be laid against this officer. I found, however, on the report of his brigadier, and upon his own statement in writing, that he bad displayed such shortcomings uncier the stress of battle, that I ought to convey to him a mark of my displeasure. I , therefore, instructed his brigadier to inform Major Story that I viewed his actions on the date in question so unfavorably, that I would not be prepared hereafter to recommend Major Story for a higher command than that of a company until he had satisfied me that he was able to command a company in action creditably and efficiently. Major Story did - temporarily command the 37th Battalion from the 11th of August, 1918, to the 13th September, 1918. That, honourable members will see, was more than a year af ter the battle of Messines. On the 13th of September, 1918, Major Story wrote a letter regarding the proposed disbandment of the battalion, and I ask honourable members to pay attention to this. At that time sufficient reinforcements were not available to bring all the battalions up to strength, and lots were - drawn to determine which battalions should be disbanded in order to strengthen the others. Amongst ""the unfortunate battalions was the 37th. The 37th Battalion was the one to be disbanded. I was ""in the field at the time, and I remember what occurred. There was a considerable amount of feeling over the matter, and Major Story wrote what was undoubtedly an injudicious letter protesting in no measured language against the breaking up of his battalion. The letter was a bit "" over the odds,"" and he was really suspended for that reason. I emphasize that this happened nearly a year and a half after 'the battle of Messines, so that his suspension had Battalion, nothing whatever to do with what occurred at Messines. In his - efforts to protect the battalion which he loved he acted unwisely, and was sent to England. Subsequently, realizing what he had done, he wrote, apologizing for his stater merits, and pointing out the conditions under which'he was induced, tp make them. This is the true history of the case aa shown by the files in connection with the charges. inconceivable that any honourable member of this House should under cover of privilege bringsuch charges against an officer whether he be in thecivil service or one of the dregs of the streets. The honourable member charged M a j o r Story with dishonesty, with theft, with want of courage, and with everything that is valued by andsacred toany human being; ""What opportunity had M a j or Story to reply'i None whatever. I admit that the honourable, member, in j u s t if y in g the charge, declared that, he wished to protect his constituency. Does he really ask the House to believe that he is protecting his constituency, by so defiling a member of the staff?' It is the most unwarrantable charge that I ever heard made in or out of the House, under cover of privilege. It is most disgraceful. In my opinion the charge is absolutely unwarranted. I - say this with considerable feeling. The file and everything; in connection with the matter shows that all the charges brought by the honourable member for the No r t hern Territory are absolutely untrue, and on behalf of one of my comrades at the war I can only say that the files give him the lie direct. T f the honourable member is not satisfied with my statement let him ' do the only thing that is possible in the circumstances. Let him spend some time with an unbiased mind in an examination of the file in . order to get the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth . Or if he is not then satisfied, let him furnish the House with informatio n that may be in his possession.",66
255,Mr BRENNAJST,COMMONWEALTH BANK,I do not think will depend on the file.,68
256,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,That may be the honourable member's opinion. Mr BitEKNAir - It is.,68
257,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"I say with extremereluctance that, these scurrilous attacks on Major, Story savour of the sower, and my only regret is that they cannot be expunged from the records of this House. Mr NELSON' (Northern Territory ) [10.55] - I am pleased that the honourable the Minister (S ir Neville Howse) proposes to place the file in connection with the charges which I have made on the table of the House, so that they may. be available to honourable members. I It is Lhi nk, however, that he should also produce the files inconnexion with my charges against Lieutenant-Colonel W . J l Smith and Lieutenant F . G. Harris. Mr E . EJLKY - As k for them.",68
258,Mr NELSON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"I am doing so, and have done so previously. I should like to repeat that I have as much honour, as the honourable gentleman who has just resumed his seat, and that if , after a. perusal of the file, I am satisfied, that I was. wrong., I will, publicly apologize.. TJp. to the present I . am. not. in a* position to do that, for the simple reason that the information upon, which I made the charges was given to me on what I regarded as good' authority, and it has not yet been disproved. It would' be only fair to. put on record the reasons that have led up to my making these charges. May I explain that - I was driven to make the charges because I had previously charged M a j or Story with maladministration, with illegal, action in connection with the ballot, and with lying to the achnihi'strator of the Northern Territory when asked'for information that was required for the guidance of this House, 'and on every occasion no action was taken ? I was. reluctant to make the charges, but I felt that there was nootherway of securing redress for my constituents. Honourable members will , , perhaps, recall that I also, made changes against other officials. TheMinister to-night; was silent in regard to - them. Wo have-been told that the authorities were satisfied with personal explanations from the inr dividuals concerned'. I have no. wish to detain the House, because I shall have an opportunity of perusing the filesand he arriving at.a decision in conjunction with other evidence with which I have been furnished. I can assure honourable members that I will approach the consideration of this* matter with an unbiased mind, and, if I find that I have made a wTODg statement. I will be the first to apologize. I shall, reserve any f u r the r remarkswhich I may. have to, make; un t i l I have examinedthe files;. Question resolved' in the affirmative. House adjourned' at 10.58 p.m.",68
