The efficiency with which this gas energy whether that is for electricity generation, transportation-is a very important measure from this both in terms of the cost and in terms has to be measured in particular ways to greenhouse gas emissions. Given the importance greenhouse gas-it is very much a critical consumers, to come to understand better These days we need to take into account efficiency approach, whether we are looking at greenhouse it is very important to measure drawn from the ground, whether that is a natural to assess the transportation costs and the CO2 CO2 generated when that fuel is in some way at the CO2 emitted when that fuel is finally transportation energy. That whole of lifecycle CO2 emission is process you get a very misleading answer as very important from a greenhouse policy perspective emissions for the whole of the lifecycle The same is true of energy efficiency. If water heater in a home, that can actually be quite at the home. But if you look at the total conversion is generated to the actual conversion into heat the energy of the gas into hot water at the energy efficiency is very much higher for efficiency, not, as some would do, only at critically, with the generation of electricity generating electricity, and when it is in the efficiency rises dramatically.

Even itself may well be targeted for the CO2 cost of contribution to the reduction in global available as a substitute fuel for other fuels is converted into energy for final consumptionhome water heating, home space heating or of just how much benefit the community derives of the CO2 generated.

If you just take one part of that to the CO2 efficiency of a particular fuel. It is that we look totally at the greenhouse of that greenhouse generating energy source. you look at the energy efficiency of a simple hothigh as an electrical device if you measure it of energy from the moment the electricity and compare that with, say, gas, which converts very point of domestic consumption, then the gas.

But I note that, as desk of the minister for transport, Mr Anderson, it A pretty important report on shipping industry chamber I responded to the minister's response to unfortunately, sat on his desk for many months sitting there since 1997. Perhaps the minister this report on the shipping industry in the near important that the Australian community gets an government, and specifically from the minister April 1999 report on shipping reform. I suppose the minister does not have a good record on to his requirement to resign his portfolio minister, Mr Sharp, deceived the Australian on it for many purposes on a range of fronts. Mr Anderson, has done worse than deceive cast adrift and failed to face up to his Commodities Group annual dinner on 1 December our shipping industry is a sacrificial lamb. was the message to the dinner.

The number of single-voyage permits the minister's statement at the dinner of provisions are being misused deliberately undermine the intent of this parliament by the again, the arrogance and contempt that parliament and the bills and legislation of protect, promote and strengthen Australian industry.

That is because, deep down, they know very far reaching for Australia as a nation. about the removal of cabotage based on facts questions that are too difficult for this government that deliver answers that do not match the reform.

Let us go to some of those and reasonable pay and conditions for crew. dramatically in recent years as a result of successive Labor governments from 1983 to government in 1996, when it initially responded in our performance on the shipping front. But, its way to bomb shipping opportunities in Australia opportunities for Australians. Secondly, it is at the expense and risk underline that very important issue. I would have in the Australian community would have thought in Sydney Harbour would have rung the alarm parliament-but apparently not.

I suggest to the goes way beyond the intent of the act and and of our defence requirements, such as industry, a need we recently experienced act. They are, firstly, that no licensed ship is the service as carried out by the licensed ship or port or ports. Further, the minister is satisfied the unlicensed ships be allowed to engage in that and continuing voyage permits, combined with December last year, clearly indicate that these to pursue a different government agenda and to Navigation Act 1912. It clearly reflects, yet the Howard government has for the national this parliament and our desire as a parliament to is a predisposition to the use of licensed ships; policy of cabotage. The problem is that this policy, very clearly, to wind it back, but they legislative process. Subterfuge, deception to the Navigation Act in Australia in the year that the implications of removing cabotage are It is because they know that any proper debate and international comparisons will ask too many to answer; it will raise too many questions rhetoric of the Howard government about shipping reform but deform. It is a strategy of blindly trade at the expense of a range of important priorities. Firstly, it is at the expense of fair Those crew have actually improved productivity the shipping industry reform agenda pursued by 1996. There was an opportunity for the Howard positively, to further achieve improvements alternatively, this government has gone out of and, in doing so, to destroy employment of Australian marine and harbour environments. I thought when I raise that issue that all of us that scares like that which occurred last year bells in the ministerial wing of the national to risk our coastal environment through this the intent and the importance of the Navigation jobs.

But we have got a of the Howard government, runs second best to employment opportunities to overseas nations NA 17322 and to workers from overseas. I simply say our for Australians.

However, I am interested in the alleged rate increases by the Parramatta City NA 17348 Council, on the basis of a supposed connection at no stage has the Parramatta City Council has any connection whatsoever with the GST. That has not stopped the member for Parramatta capital by this reference. It started off with Professor Fels and Dr Cousins about a purported reality is that the council has never in The Parramatta City Council has said that it has road requirements that need activity by increase. That is not to deny the reality that sense on that council's financial position. In back in March of this year, there was detail of GST: a $315,000 impact in regard to parking $9,000 in regard to inspection and testing fees, $74,500 for the golf course, with a total of relevant officer of the council was that: In some cases the GST cost will need to be absorbed contained within the GST legislation ...

There was a statement made by noted that swimming pools, school holiday impacted upon. He talked about the cost of registering anyone in the Parramatta City Council in any the GST and the proposed rate increase. Yet, just politics in the region, the member for Parramatta to try to slag off about the Parramatta If this member had any credibility, he would City Council. He would note that, when this unanimous vote by the council. The three-there Independents straight after the last election-sitting increase. Is that to say that they voted for an GST? Not at all. They voted for this increase They moved one minor amendment to a two-page on that. Two of the three Liberal aldermen actually At least one of them, you could say, voted for Liberal aldermen on that council voted for this are, as council officers are, that it is fundamentally out of the GST but to deal with real, fundamental problems. As the member for Parramatta was so effective Independent aldermen before the last council it would be very disturbing if these people from the council because they were not thorough, found that they were replaced by people increase and who were then attacked by the member the conspiracy to make political capital out of the GST. This kind of contrived horror by the member the face of the commitment of his own political MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 7 June 2000 with the GST, to the ACCC.

I have not, in the past, made his own bed-his statements in regard family history to say he did not really mean it, of context. He said he was quoted out of context Day, but it is interesting to notice, as one of actual statement in the article starts off with statement about which he has now been misunderstood. On the budget, the reality is that there have about those in the defence area. In regard to reality is that the only thing that the minister industry structural adjustment package. He failed left over from Labor's allocation of funds in of the minister's suspension of funding to with the final RFAs in Victoria-and he has delays-and his refusal to negotiate The minister seems unwilling or unable going to each state's RFA region; the time-frame suggestions that all the money will not be with the suspended FISAP money in New South that all the money will go to Eden or that fund industry projects without matching state officers continue to insist that a joint program New South Wales as soon as the southern RFA is signed. So, as I say, there is a degree of confusion today-or in the last day or so-we have had another Minister of the country seems interested in Queensland agreement, the contribution by the say that he is going to destroy or put in the from the Queensland government. That is just had in the portfolio. It is the reason why we of states.

I note the member for Gilmore claimed in government's position regarding the southern $40 million of infrastructure funding to assist She must be aware-I would assume that issued a media release headed ‘Commonwealth said: Commonwealth industry development assistance available. I am not sure what motivated the member for yesterday, given the commitments by the minister her; he is a bit unpredictable.

This is the been very few funding initiatives. I have talked forestry, in which I am also involved, the sad can come up with is $80 million in the forest to mention that that was, in reality, money 1995. The money is only still available because New South Wales and Western Australia, delays made a significant contribution towards those an RFA with south-east Queensland. to clearly explain just how much FISAP money is for completion of the program, given spent until 2003; and just what he intends doing Wales. At various times, he has promised the Commonwealth will go it alone and directly funding, or joint approvals. The department will be resumed across all three RFA regions in as to exactly what the minister intends. Even outburst. Despite the fact that the Prime trying to make some progress in respect of the Minister for Forestry and Conservation is to garbage bin-or some such expression-all letters typical of the non-constructive approach he has have had so many delayed agreements in a variety a lot of histrionics about how dreadful New few months later you find that he has signed They are essentially the same agreements that the House yesterday that the New South Wales New South Wales RFA meant that ‘our share of with industry changes has gone with the wind'. she is aware-that on 26 May Minister Tuckey RFA money will flow in NSW' in which he to the NSW timber industry will still be made Gilmore to make those comments in the House or these latest statements. I do not blame he is moving all the money from the North Coast he is going to share it around the state. One in the world and he is never going to sign you find that he has signed them. Regardless RFA-and he made that comment-I can only NA 17350 MAIN COMMITTEE conclude that the member for Gilmore either playing politics. Quite clearly, her statement her region is totally contradictory I do not recall the member for Gilmore FISAP funding to New South Wales in November complaining about that decision by the federal government remains willing to negotiate an behaviour of the minister. The final point in regard to forestry is the has been typified by constant inaction. That delayed even further than the reserves activity, ago I have to wait for. I have been waiting activity on this front really has not been any action plan has been delayed until July this year. 1999 and then in March of this year. It is thus for the action agenda or for the minister's the relevant research and development corporation. One could summarise the picture on the forestry was obtained by the minister. One could summarise behaviour by the minister-trying to run around happened there with the agreement the state People can argue that it was not representative-we organisations-but a fact of life is that the Queensland state government and conservationists but they did.
