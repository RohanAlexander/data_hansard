2,Dr MALONEY,SELECT COMMITTEE ON SEA,"In view of the early retirement of Mr Charles Gavan Duffy, the Clerk of the Senate, whose 'courtesy Distribution of Coal. [19 AUGUST, 1020.] to members of both Houses has become a proverb, will the Government give preference to returned sailors and soldiers in making appointments to the posts that will thus become vacant ? There are men on the other side who were of militaryage. Cannot the principle of preference be carried throughout the length and breadth of the Public Service?",19
3,Sir JOSEPH COOK,SELECT COMMITTEE ON SEA,"I think that ing the appointments to vacancies on the staff of the Senate are within the control, at the disposal, of the President, but shall look into the matter. DISTRIBUTION OF COAL.",20
4,Mr WATKINS,SELECT COMMITTEE ON SEA,"The Treasurer surprised stated yesterday that the Borehole seam coal at Newcastle was to be reserved the export trade, but I ask that, before hard and fast arrangements are made, recognition may be given to the fact some of that coal is now used for bunofficer. kering the mail boats, and that a. certain quantity of it is mixed with Maitland coal foT specific purposes. I have no jection, on general grounds, to the rangement of which the Minister yesterday, but I do not wish to see the ordinary trade interfered with.",20
5,Sir JOSEPH COOK,SELECT COMMITTEE ON SEA,"The Governuot ment in appointing an Administrator hopes that he will exercise the discretion which he will possess in making the best arrangements for the trade. No distinction is to be drawn between one kind. of. coal from one colliery and another kind of coal from another colliery. The Administrator will look at matters broadly, and in the interests of. both local and oversea trade will make such dispositions as may best overcome the difficulty that has arisen. I hope that he may be able to build up our coal stocks here without seriously interfering, with trade oversea.

7,Sir JOSEPH COOK,SELECT COMMITTEE ON SEA,"I was as much ashonorable members generally probably were on reading in the newsfor paper this morning of what had taken place. No doubt what has been done is perfectly lawful, but the action taken that seems to be that of some very zealous My feeling is that the pressmen in the entourage of the Prince were as much our guests as were the other persons obwho accompanied him, and I think that arin the circumstances we must find a way spoke out of the difficulty.",20
8,Mr RILEY,SELECT COMMITTEE ON SEA,"Is the Treasurer aware that a large number of prosecutions are taking place among the poorer classes foi filling in income tax returns, and that heavy fines are being imposed by way of penalty? In view of the fact that an increase in the exemption is likely, will be arbitrary see into this matter?",20
9,Sir JOSEPH COOK,SELECT COMMITTEE ON SEA,"I shall be glad to be furnished with concrete cases, but I . shall look into the matter. I underthe stand thatabout 850,000 returns are furnished yearly, and only about 350,000 assessments made; thus a great deal of work has to be done whigh yields no revenue, but is none the less necessary to ascertain the incomes of the people. If the honourable member could suggest an automatic method of excluding those incomes are not taxable, and getting-in returns from all those who should pay, he would assist the Department, and save the Government a very large expenditure.",20
10,Mr CHARLTON,SELECT COMMITTEE ON SEA,"Has the Treasurer to a decision about increasing the of exemption under the Income Tax Act, BO Louthat it may be put into operation in connection with future assessments? Sir JOSE PH COOK - I am afraid that my answer must be that the exigencies of receipt and expenditure at the moment hold out little hope of large exemptions in the matter of taxation. COAL SHORTAGE. SHIPS IN BALLAST FROM NEWCASTLE.",20

13,Mr TUDOR,SELECT COMMITTEE ON SEA,I . understand that the Ministry desire that this Bill shall pass through this House by next Friday.,21
14,Sir JOSEPH COOK,SELECT COMMITTEE ON SEA,"B y next week, yes. The Prime Minister is anxious, naturally, to take charge of this measure, but, as honourable members are aware, he is in Sydney this week trying to settle a very difficult problem. So far as I can see, there will not be much difficulty in dealing with the Bill by the end of next week; but unless there is a reasonable prospect of so doing, I shall be inclined to take Tuesday as a sitting day. That I do not desire to do without notice. I am quite sure that when the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) sees the details of the measure he will find that there is not much in them that is controversial. I appeal to honourable members to help the Government to get the measure through next week without sitting on Tuesday.",21
15,Mr TUDOH,SELECT COMMITTEE ON SEA,"If the Minister finds it necessary, we might sit later on the Thursday evening of next week, so as not to interfere with any arrangements Inter-State members may have made.",21
16,Sir JOSEPH COOK,SELECT COMMITTEE ON SEA,"Quite so. .leave the matter there with that understanding. I wish to avoid sitting next Tuesday, but at the same time we are anxious to get the Bill through. PERSON AL EXPLANATION .",21
17,Mr GIBSON,SELECT COMMITTEE ON SEA,"I desire to make a personal explanation in reference to a paragraph which appeared in the Age this morning as follows: One fact emerged from the debate, and that was, according to Mr Gibson (V.), that second-grade butter, which was "" unfit"" for Australian consumption, was eagerly purchased by the British public at high prices. I made no such statement. What I said was that we held our second grade butter, that is not fit for consumption in Australia, for export to the East at 205s. What I desired to convey was that both the British and Australian consumer get first grade butter, and that the second grade butter goes to the East. THEBUDGE T. serious Mr MCWILLIAMS - I desire to ask the Treasurer when we may expect the Budget.",21
18,Sir JOSEPH COOK,SELECT COMMITTEE ON SEA,"That question was asked me yesterday, and my answer was that the Budget will be delivered the moment it is ready. I hope its preparation will not now take long.",21
19,Mr MCWILLIAMS,SELECT COMMITTEE ON SEA,That is very indefinite. ADJOURNMENT (Formal). NA DUTIES'.,21
20,Mr SPEAKER,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS," I have received an intimation from the honourable member for Flinders (Mr . Bruce) that he desires to move the adjournment of the House for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent public importance, viz., "" The basis on which foreign exchange shall be calculated for the purpose of determining the amount of Customs duties payable in respect of imports into the Commonwealth."" Five honourable members having risen in their places, Question proposed.",21
21,Mr BRUCE,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,"Flinders) [2.451 - This question has been raised by me before in the House, and subsequently the Prime Minister, in reply to an inquiry by me, gave an assurance that, subject to certain representations being made on behalf of I shall France, he would deal with the matter within twenty-four hours. Those representations were all made some time ago, but I regret to say that the. matter has not been dealt witL ",21
22,Mr FENTON,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,"I rise to a point of order, in regard to which, however, I may be incorrrect. I understand that action has been taken against the Federal Government, or the Minister for Trade and Customs, in connection with this matter, and I wish to know whether it comes within the same category as a case sub judice. If so, is the discussion in order ?",22
23,Mr SPEAKER,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS," If the matter is not already before the Courts, or pending",22
24,Mr FENTON,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,It is pending.,22
25,Mr SPEAKER,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,"I have uo official knowledge of that; hut if that is so, the honourable member for Flinders will not be in order in proceeding.",22
26,Mr BRUCE,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,"I had no knowledge of any action being taken, and I am merely raising this point",22
27,Mr SPEAKER,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,"On e moment. I am given to understand that a writ has been issued in the matter. In that case, the honourable member will not be in order in proceeding to discuss a case with which the Courts are about to deal. . Mr Bruce - May I explain that I am not in any way challenging any action of the Government? It is necessary to collect Customs duties today, ancl to continue to collect them; and all I wish to discuss is the basis on which those duties shall be assessed. I make no sort of reference to anything connected with the legality of any action of the Government in the past, or any action the Government may take in the future. No question of that kind is involved in my motion; I merely raise the question of the administrative rule we are going to follow in Australia.",22
28,Mr SPEAKER,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,"If the honourable member proceeds on that line, he will be in order.",22
29,Mr BRUCE,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,"I assure you, sir, I shall not ir. any way touch on any question that can come before the Courts, but refer only to such a question that Parliament may discuss. I have spoken on the subject before, and do not wish to weary honourable members; but I may remind them of the present basis on which the calculations are made by the Customs authorities in determining the duty to be paid on any article. The present procedure is that, where any goods are invoiced in a foreign currency-to take an easy example, that of France-the Customs authorities take the numbers of francs which the goods have cost, and turn them into pounds on the par or gold basis of exchange, namely, 25 francs to the £1.",22
30,Dr MALONEY,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,The pre-war basis?,22
31,Mr BRUCE,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,Yes .,22
32,Mr MASSYGREENE,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,It is the mintage rate of exchange.,22
33,Mr BRUCE,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,"It is so called; but that is not the term generally used in popular discussion. The goods may have been bought for 5,000 francs, and when the account is settled for the goods the rate of exchange is taken at 50 francs, and £100 is paid. But when the goods arrive in Australia, the Customs authorities do not credit the statement that they have cost £100, but say that they cost £200, and proceed to levy duty upon the £200 at the rate Parliament has fixed. That naturally leads to goods imported from a country with a depreciated exchange costing a very large amount in comparison with the amount actually paid by the purchaser. The other side of the case is that some other countries, such as America, have an appreciated exchange, and the result is that such countries pay less in duty on goods imported to Australia than the rate Parliament has authorized to be collected. For instance, if the American rate of exchange is $4 to the £1 and goods are bought on that basis, $400 will buy only £100 worth of goods. When the goods arrive here, the Customs authorities refuse to accept them as having cost £100; but say that the cost was only £80, because the rate of exchange is $4.85 to the £1. Thus, on goods from countries which have a depreciated exchange duties are paid in excess of the rates fixed by Parliament, whilst on goods from countries which have an appreciated exchange, the duty paid is less than the Department is entitled to collect. Never before in the history of the world have we had fluctuations of any magnitude in exchange. During the period of the war all nations took steps to keep up their own exchange. As honourable members know, Great Britain sold millions of pounds worth of foreign securities owned in Britain in order to keep the exchange stabilized. Other countries took similar steps. I have here the rates of exchange, high and low, of various countries, during the war period, on the date of the armistice, and at three subsequent dates, which prove my statement that during the war period there were no fluctuations worldParity.

An extraordinary fact is that the Austion tralian Association of British Manufacprotective turers recently attended a deputation to Act the Minister for Trade and Customs, and licence-fees protested against any alteration in the system of calculating the exchange. had not the good fortune to be the deputation, but, perhaps, the Minister can tell the House the arguments put beI fore him. It seems remarkable to that the British manufacturer should make such a protest when he is being penalized in comparison with America and Japan, who are the greatest competitained tors in Australia of the United K in ghas been introduced. dom ; the imports from Prance and Italy are almost negligible. I knowmoment a great number of British manuof facturers, and I am inclined to think that their representatives would get rather a cold reception from their prinpreciated cipals on the other side of the world account of what they have done, because there is no true basis for a prothe test by Great Britain . There be ground for a protest by Japan Londonand America against the action I am urging the Government to take, - licence but Great Britain will be benefited thereciated by, and lifted out of her present disadvantageous position.

34,Mr MASSYGREENE,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,"Yes , because I replied that I was not aware of the facts which Mr Guthrie stated. I liave since ascerthat the Bill to which he referred",24
35,Mr BRUCE,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,"If one thinks for a he must see that if the statement Mr Guthrie is correct the exchanges of the world are never to be regulated again, but every country with a deexchange will have to pay a on licence duty on its imports into Great Britain equivalent to the depreciation in exchange. I was so startled when I may read that statement that I cabled to Stated here Great Britain has imposed duty countries where exchange depreequal amount such depreciation. Is there any truth in this statement?. If so, what? To that I received the following reply:Referring to your telegram Kith Secretary Customs interviewed has no knowledge of Thinking, however, that there must be some basis for such a statement. I continued my inquiries, and at last discovered to what Mr Guthrie was apparently referring. It is not at all surprising to me that the Secretary of Customs knew nothing at all about the licence duty, because the duty had obviously never been imposed, and it would not be known to an ordinary man dealing with the commercial customs of Great Britain The Act to which he was referring is an Imports and Exports Regulation Act, designed to prevent dumping into Britain, and affording protection to key industries. There are a number of safeguards around - the authorities in Great Britain in their administration measure which must he taken into consideration. A Trade Regulation imittea is established, which exercises control over the most important provisions of the measure. Part II. gives power to prevent dumping, and Part III . contains the provisions for safeguarding the key industries, and counteracting sible flooding of them by imports countries with an abnormal of exchange-these are the words employed-which are not .adequately coiu.pensated by increased cost of production. This means that the Act can 1 e enforced in respect to a country with a depreciated rate of which can produce on the pre-war basis of production, but not when the cost of production - has increased wniiit'-v. From the exchange of view, the measure is confined absolutely to imports from countries there has been no compensating crease in the cost of production, but the principal point to bear iit mind in considering the matter is that no action can be taken except with the authority of a Trade B.egulaticn Committee of seventeen mcirr.bers, ten of whom are chosen by the House of Commons. It ..Vet - which is the sole basis for the suggestion that Great Britain done anything in the matter, - and it has simply included in an anti-dumping Act designed to safeguard key a prevision that a Trade Regulation Committee of seventeen members, ten irr.embers of Parliament, may prevent imports from a country with a depreciated rate of exchange, where there has been no corresponding increase in the cost Mr Bruce. of production. It is a very small measure, in no way applicable to what is occurring in Australia. The other point is what is being done in other countries. America has been faced with"" exactly the same set of circumstance!, as apply here, or rather the position has been more accentuated there, because today the dollar is the highest currency in the world. Recognising the today. difficulty - of the position, Aimerica appointed a committee of commercial lawyers to investigate it ; and as the result Great of that committee's inquiries the principle of the rate of exchange of the day has been' accepted and put into operation.",24
36,Dr MA ONEY,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,"What does that mean? of the Mr Bruce - I can explain it in this way: Bef .*e the war, the Italia n lira Com- was worth .'i'9 cents; in other words five lire equalled one dollar. To-day the dollar is w H l i 10 lire, and when goods are bought n Italy they are purchased ; on the basis - f 10 lire to the dollar. But if an Airr.ed'ican buyer purchases $500 any pos- worth of Italian goods in lire the Amerfrom ican Customs charge him duty on the depreciation basis of Sp500 worth of goods.

37,Mr GREENE,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,Ne w Zealand has made it where optional to take one - jr the other. They in- allow the importer to pay duty on whichever basis favours him.,25
38,Mr BRUCE,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,-There is not much doubt as to what the importer will do.,25
39,Mr MASSYGREENE,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,"They take the mintage rate of exchange in one case and the commercial in the other, whichever is imore is this favourable to the importer.",25
40,Mr BRUCE,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,"I would he prepared to has accept the same arrangement here. M i : GREENE - That would not suit the Trade and Customs Department. industries, Mr Bruce - Whicheve r method we adopt it should be the fairest to the imincluding porter in the sense that he docs not overpay what is due, but we"" need not go so far as New Zealand. The Government is entitled to collect Customs duty on the cost of goods. There is another side of this question which ought to be brought under the notice of the House, particularly in these toms Department collected duty. times when we are experiencing such traordinary financial difficulties and in such trouble about our revenue. Under the system adopted by the Trade and Customs Department, goods f r o America and Japan pay less duty than we would actually be entitled to collect on the sterling value paid to those couni tries for the goods; and on goods purchased in France and Italy we get rather more duty than we are entitled to collect.",25
41,Mr GKEGOHY,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,Considerabl y more.,26
42,Mr BRUCE,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,"Do not let us overstate the point. The case is quite strong enough without doing so. Here are some following table:extraordinarily significant figures for the year 1918-19, the last available from Mr . Knibbs with regard to Customs returnsUNITED STATES OIAMEIUCA.

Total importations-Produc e or manufacture of France ... £1,651,833 Total direct from France, irrespective of origin ... ... In that year we had nearly £36,000,000 worth of goods from countries on which we are losing money on Customs colleci tions, and imported ab.out £2,200,000 worth of goods from countries where we of £46,500. get a small gain on Customs collections. The figures for 1919-20 are not available, but I should say that there is still a large balance of trade from America and Japan. I feel confident that the balance is at least £10,000,000 in favour of those two countries, and the loss of revenue i this way is startling. It must be rememinstance bered that the figures represent the clared value of the goods on which Cusof toms duty was paid, and not the actual amount paid to America for the goods. Something must be added in respect to the fact that during the year the average value of the dollar was about 5s. sterling, whereas our Customs Department , acrates cepted the basis as $4.86 to the ' ling. Similarly with the other countries [151] the imports are overstated, because they are taken on the basis on which the CusIn exsome figures which I shall give. I have are endeavoured to make a suggestion as to the amount of revenue we have probably lost through adopting the system followed m here. We are aided by the figures for 1917-18, In that period the total value of merchandise entered for consumption n Australia was £59,S96,190, on which £9,633,507 was collected as duty, or 16.0S per cent. Taking 16 per cent, as a fair average basis on th© figures for 19i8-19I saw a calculation the other day based on the average of 50 per cent., but 1 do not think there is any justification for such an estimate- I have prepared the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

The duty collected was £1,280,000 instead of 165,970 £1,600,000, which ought to have been colFRANCE. lected, so that we lost revenue to the extent of £320,000. In the case of It a l y , the position is reversed. The Customs .144,544 .basis of imports was £508,100, whereas we probably paid for them only £290,000. The duty collected was £93,000, whereas t should have been £46,500, so that in that case we gained revenue to the extent Coming to the position in regard to France, we find that the Customs basis of imports was £1,600,000 and that we should have paid about £1,000,000. The duty collected was £256,000, whereas it should n have been only £160,000, so that in this also we had a gain of revenue dewhich amounted to £96,000. The totals these figures show that in the case of America and Japan we suffered a loss of revenue amounting to £1,280,000. If we had collected the duties on the basis of what the people in this country had paid for the goods, and in accordance with the that Parliament had authorized, we £ l stershould have received an additional £1,280,000 by way of Customs revenue. Against that we gained £142,500 in respect of duties collected on imports from Italy and France, so that the net loss of revenue amounted to £1,137,500. I do not suggest that these figures can he absolutely accurate, but I urge that they are on a fair basis. I have only taken the same rates of duties upon imports that are shown in the official figures for the preceding while the rates of exchange are open to all to see. I have taken what I think is the fair average rate, and the figures probably represent very closely the actual loss that Australia experienced.",26
43,Mr FENTON,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,Does the honourable member place the same value on goods coming from several countries?,27
44,Mr BRUCE,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,I have taken the exact figures shown in the return. I do not appreciate the point of the honourable member's question.,27
45,Mr FENTON,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,Our imports from the United States greatly exceed those from France and Italy.,27
46,Mr BRUCE,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,"I have given the actual figures. The only other point to which I desire to refer relates to the basis on which duties have to be paid. Duties have to be paid, as honourable members are doubtless aware, on the home consumption value of the goods. The argument has been used that if an article costs 50 t francs in France, regard should be had only to the franc, and that the cost anywhere else is immaterial. It seems to me that there is one consideration which proves that argument to be absolutely wrong. For reasons which I shall give, we cannot consider the franc alone, and what it represents in France. For stance, a woollen article purchased in France is composed of wool .bought from Australia, and for which France has had to pay Australia in francs on the adverse basis of exchange to France. That being so, the wool costs the French manufacturers more, and when it comes here again in manufactured form surely they are entitled to be considered on the basis of what the. value of the wool is in the currency of the country where it was orieinnllv bought.",27
47,Sir ROBERT BEST,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,"Tak e silk, for instance.",27
48,Mr BRUCE,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,"We might illustrate the position by referring to silk and many other materials. Whether the article has come from outside or has been manufactured entirely in France, its cost has been increased by things used in its manufacture and imported from other countries where the exchange is against France. Coal, for instance, has to be imported by France, and is one of the things in respect of which she has to pay on the year, adverse basis of exchange. The money that has been paid for that commodity is represented in the goods in the manufacture of which it has been used, and which are coming out of France. It is grossly unfair to say that France shall pay-as she is required to do-for the things she imports on the adverse basis of exchange, and that when those materials come out here in manufactured form we should collect Customs duty on a basis which ouce more tells against the French manufacturer, and practically makes it impossible for him to trade.",27
49,Mr MATHEWS,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,Australi a loses both ways.,27
50,Mr BRUCE,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,"That is so. I have endeavoured to clearly set out the position. The question is one of great importance since it is impossible for us to continue to keep up an artificial barrier which every day is preventing trade from flowing into its natural channels, and at the same time help to regularize the general exchange conditions of the world. Extension of time granted.",27
51,Mr BRUCE,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,"The exchanges can never be regularized if we are going to create these artificial barriers. We can regulate them only by allowing trade to run along its natural channels-by allowing it to go to the countries which can handle it, and ingiving them the opportunity to regulate their own exchanges by the exports which are coming from those countries. Having spoken to people in nearly every trade in Australia, I can tell the House with confidence that it is impossible for Australia to place orders in Italy, France, or Belgium-while the exchange position is as at present, and while our Customs duties are levied on the existing basis. This means the driving of more trade to America and Japan, and-ignorin g every other consideration-if carried far enough will merely add to the loss of Customs revenue which is takinrr place today. We wantmore revenue; but what is still more important, we desire to make an effort to do the fair thing. I cannot conceive of the present basis being regarded as equitable. This is a matter to which the House should give its very serious consideration. The House should insist on something being done. I understand that the Minister alone has the power to take action. Section 157 of the Customs Act of 1901 provides thatWhere the genuine invoice sliows the value of the goods in any currency other than British currency, the equivalent value of the goods in British currency shall be ascertained according to a fair rate of exchange to be declared in case of doubt by the Minister. I venture to say that we are not giving today the equivalent value of the goods in British currency. In many cases when we start to collect our Customs duties we are giving something like double or treble the value. One other point which has been stressed and should be answered is that all these different countries have different values for goods. Because an article costs, say, so many francs in France it is suggested that that value is higher than the value of the same article somewhere else. Every day it is becoming more and more evident that the world is beginning to trade on the basis of what you can give in the equivalent exchange. A man who wishes to purchase certain goods asks whether he can buy them in. France with her exchange or in America ? Prices the world over are beginning to regulate themselves on that basis, and will be so regulated more and more as the demand for goods of which there is a shortage the world over is met, and ordinary trading .competition comes about again in individual countries among their own merchants, and internationally, between countries. This is a matter that requires very careful consideration if we are going to do the best for Australian consumers, and are to fulfil an obligation which I feel rests on us to give fair and equitable treatment to all nations; but, above all, to give such treatment to those nations which rendered us the greatest assistance during the war.",27
52,Mr MASSYGREENE,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [3.21] - I am sure that the House heard with the utmost interest the speech of the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Bruce), and I wish that it were possible, in the short time at my disposal this afternoon, to traverse the [151]-2 whole case, and to put the position fully from another point of view. I cannot state the whole case, however, because, as I mentioned a little while ago, an action at law has been brought against the Department, and I cannot deal with the legal questions involved. It is an action which challenges the right of the Customs Department to'claim duties on the basis about which the honourable member for Flinders has been talking.",28
53,Mr TUDOR,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,Not the Adelaide case?,28
54,Mr MASSYGREENE,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,"No ; a case brought in Queensland. It challenges the whole basis of our collection, and particularly the interpretation of section 157. The duty of the Minister is, of course, to see that the law is carried out by his officers; he has sworn to do that. The honourable member for Flinders has shown that if the Department were to adopt the practice which he asks us to adopt, it would get more revenue. We know that that is so, and it shows that in the action we are taking we are not reaching out after revenue, but are standing by principles which we think the law compels us to observe. If it were not for that, the position would be altogether different. If , as the honourable member has suggested, it were in the power of the Minister to alter the system, and we believed that the principles by which we stand enabled it to be altered, we might move in the direction suggested.",28
55,Mr BRUCE,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,"If the Minister could not^ take action himself, he could have brought the question before Parliament.",28
56,Mr MASSYGREENE,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,"That is another matter. Until the case to which I have alluded is settled, I do not think the law should be altered. We want to have the law determined, because, if the Customs Department is wrong, about £1,000,000 more of revenue will have to be collected, and the commercial community will have to pay it. If we have not collected this revenue, but should have collected it, the commercial community will be called upon to pay it. That, however, is not the question which I wish to discuss this afternoon. I believe that underlying the cases which the honourable member cited, and underlying practically all the illustrations that I have seen, there is a fundamental fallacy in the reference to £100 worth of good3, and not to the quantity of goods that £100 would buy. I think I shall be able to show that any fault rests, not with Australia, t u t with the countries of origin. I have given a great deal of thought to this matter, and although I am putting the other side of the argument, I do not wish it to he understood that, once the case to which I have referred is out of the way, we must necessarily stand where we are. Feeling that, however accurate my officers may be, it would be well to have an independent authority who would give us a mathematically correct reply, I put a series of questions to the Commonwealth Statistician. I said to himSuppose goods arc made in America, France, and England at the same price We take those three countries and say, "" Your costs of manufacture are the same in each instance.""for example, £.10 per unit, converting local cost at mintage rate of exchange in country of originThat is, we consider it fair to assume as a basis for comparison that the manufacabove turing costs'in each country are the same, converting the local costs in francs or lars into sterling at the mintage rate exchangeand supposing the rates of duty in Australia of this nature. ore :-British , 30 per cent; foreign, 40 cent. :(1) How many units would £1,000 duty paid in Australia, not ing freight; duty being calculated at[a) mintage par rate of Pie-War Basis.

But what I am satisfied is happening in countries with a depreciated exchange is that, as the exchange depreciates, manufacturers raise the home-consumption price; all the time as the franc depreciates, the French manufacturer is raising his home consumption price; and as. the honourable member says, that is the basis on which we are calculating thw duty. The peculiar position of the markets outside in the world today is such that the manufacturer finds that he can still ask the outside price that other countries are asking. I ask the ""honourable member whichpolicy will' sooner right the exchange- a policy of continually raising the home-consumption price, and keeping the French and Italian goods at the world's level, or taking advantage, as it were, of the depreciated exchange to send goods out at the depreciated rate of exchange. Extension of time granted.",28
57,Mr MASSYGREENE,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,"The point I wish to submit for the consideration of the House, is that as the world's supplies become nearer normal, tpie countries with a depreciated exchange will be unable to get as ready a market for their goods as at the presenttime. Will they not take advantage of the depreciated rate of exchange bo dump their goods wherever they like? I have shown clearly that what we are doing does not interfere with either the protective policy of the country or the preferential rate for Great Britain. I do not say they are doing it today, but those countries may take advantage of the depreciated rate of exchange to absolutely destroy not only the protective policy of this country, but also our preferential trade with Britain . France aud those other countries find throughout the world a ready market for their goods at the prices they are charging today; and I venture to say the French manufacturers, by raising the home consumption prices to the extent of the depreciation of the foreign exchanges, are making fortunes, or ought to be.",30
58,Mr BRUCE,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,"You take the £ 1 0 unit, and say it costs exactly the same amount bo produce the article; then you say, "" Now there is a chance for the French to keep on gradually increasing the home consumption price, and to make fortunes."" That is not so.",30
59,Mr MASSYGREENE,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,"No . I said, that, presuming the cost is the same in both countries, the country with the depreciated rate of exchange, notwithstanding the costi n that country, can dump goods in foreign countries. After; all. is said and done, the purchase of the bill of exchange is not a transaction directly between thebuyer and. seller of the goods. The purchase of the bill of exchange is a transaction which takes place betwjeen the seller of the goods and a third party; indeed, it is not even between the seller and the third party. What happens is that the 1 maker or manufacturer takes this bill of exchange to his hanker and gets the full face value, whatever it may be, in. the currency of the country. The banker then proceeds to sell the bill of exchauge ko somebody else, to whom the purchaser finally pays the money. But does the fact of at h i r d party intervening in a totally different transaction really affect the question I am arguing? I do not think so. I have here a very interesting calculation, showing exactly how the duties work out as between the various countries, but I do not wish to impose on the good nature of the House by reading it this afternoon. I hope to be able, a l it t l e later on, to put it in the possession of honourable members; and in the meantime I suggest that whatever we de at the present time it is most inadvisable, until the law is finally settled, and we know exactly where we are, to interfere or deal with this question at all. Whenever the question is dealt with, it must be in such a way that there will be no' doubt whatever as to the maintenance of the protective principles of our Tariff and our preferential position with Great Britain . These must be secure, whatever any country with a depreciated exchange may finally determine to do when it finds itself in the position, as it will be some day or other, to dump goods on the rest of the world.",30
60,Sir ROBERT BEST,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,"Kooyons) [3.43] - The question brought up by the honourable member for Flinders (Mr . Bruce) is very complicated, and one in regard to which the Customs Department has a grave responsibility. This is particularly so, in view of the fact mentioned by the honourable member, that the practice of the Department has resulted in giving a preference to America and Japan which was never intended by this House or the Tariff. - That; view, like many others, in regard to this question, is open to challenge. There is one point in regard to which I completely differ - from the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene). The honourable gentleman pointed out that the law is doubtful as it at present exists, and that, consequently, a case has been brought for the purpose of ascertaining what is the proper interpretation. No legislation introduced here should be of a retrospective character, but it is quite possible to remedy difficulties we have disrovered, without prejudice to the pending case, and it is clearly the duty of the Government to introduce a measure at once, so that in the f u t u r e operations shall be on the basis that this House in tended.",30
61,Mr MATHEWS,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,Would you do that when a case is sub judice?,31
62,Sir ROBERT BEST,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,"I do not to interfere with any case at present pending., which case will be decided according to the law in force at the time the action was instituted. But there are reasonable doubts as to what the law is; and we have a right to see that what Parliament i tended is in the future carried out 'clear enactment, with a view to doing juspurchaser of goods in France. tice all round. I impress that view on the Minister for Trade and Customs, beculation cause it is important. There two sides to this question, and no matter from which side it is approached there is going to be considerable complaint, and, possibly, - some injustice. I emphasize again that the operation of the Tariff should not give a preference to America and Japan, and if it does, it should at once stopped. Even from a revenue stand-point, if a substantial preference in trade to the extent, roughly estimated, goods. of £1,137,000, is given to those tries, it is very serious., and tha more when ib is against British and local goods; we cannot afford to overlook this, or wait for an indefinite period for remedy.",31
63,Mr MASSYGREENE,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,"I think I can show you that that is not the case, though it apparently be so. """,31
64,Sir ROBERT BEST,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,"I am ' only stating what is said to be the actual he operation as I see it . This may continue for a considerable time to come, and distinct line should be drawn. We should not attempt to alter the law interfere with the rights which existed on the part-of the subject when the case was instituted.",31
65,Mr MASSYGREENE,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,"No one has suggested that that should be done. "" Sir ROBERT BEST - It could be done by Act of Parliament.",31
66,Mr MASSYGREENE,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,No one has suggested it .,31
67,Sir ROBERT BEST,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,"I should hope not. However, I am greatly concerned for the future. The responsibility is cast on the House and the Minister to see that our protective policy, as defined by Parliament and embodied in the Tariff, is carried out. We have to see that our industries are not permitted to suffer, but shall have the percentage of protection which Parliament decided. We are in terested also in seeing that the British manufacturer shall have the preference Parliament gave him. These are fundamental features, and for anything that tends to the contrary at present we must propose find an immediate remedy. - Mr MATHEWS - Does the honourable member not think that duty is charged on the exchange as well as on the goods 1",31
68,Sir ROBERT BEST,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,"I speak subject to correction, but I think the practice of n - the Department is to take the sterling by value, say the price paid by a British These goods are brought here, and the first calis as to the commercial exchange are value of, say, £ 5 0 paid for goods. It is ascertained that there are 50 francs to the £ 1 ; fifty times fifty is first calculated. That is then divided by the mintage par value, and upon the value thus ascertained duty is charged. I shall give an illustration of how the operation of this be system contended for by the importer proves serious:' An Englishman goes to France and purchases £50 worth of He gets goods equivalent to the councommercial exchange value of £50 so sterling in Franoe; the goods are sent to Australia and duty is paid upon them. Then he goe3 to England and buys another a £50 worth of goods. There he gets only sterling value, but the total amount of duty paid on those goods is precisely the ma< same as the total amount of duty paid on the greater quantity of goods which he purchased in France. The effect is that gets dnuble the quantity of goods from France that he can purchase in Great a. Britain for the saTie amount of money.",31
69,Mr BRUCE,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,He does not get double so as .to the ouantity of goods. Sir ROBE RT BEST - Practicall y he does. When the French and British goods arrive in Australia they are probablv assessed at the same market value.,31
70,Mr BRUCE,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,In France the purchaser will get only about the same quantity of goods for his £ 5 0 as he will get in England.,32
71,Sir ROBERT BEST,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,Whils t I defer to the honourable member's commercial knowledge I am - informed by the representatives of British manufacturers that in certain lines the purchaser will get for £50 in France practically double the quantity of goods he can purchase in Great Britain for that amount of money.,32
72,Mr MASSYGREENE,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,"That is true in regard to those articles of which France has a big surplus, and it will be true of all goods when France is producing sufficient of them.",32
73,Sir ROBERT BEST,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,"Of course, I am putting the case in reference to certain goods. I do not suggest that the argument applies to all lines of goods. The effect of this system is to practically reduce by half the protective duty which Parliament has imposed, and to destroy the preference which Parliament in tended to be given to the British manufacturer.",32
74,Mr BRUCE,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,"A man can France. and sell to his agent in London without any trouble at all, and then the goods are shipped to Australia as of British origin. Sir BiOriERT BEST - There is no doubt that that is taking place, and the British Board of Trade has in certain circumstances endeavoured to protect the country against such practices by the in stitution of a licence fee on all importations from countries which have a depreciated exchange. We all have the utmost sympathy for France, Belgium and Italy . It may be that we are showing our feelings in a strange way, but, after all, this matter must be looked at from a purely business stand-point. France itself has nrohibited the importation of all goods which are calculated to injure in any way its own manufactures.",32
75,Mr MASSYGREENE,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,The list of prohibitions is very large and comprehensive.,32
76,Sir ROBERT BEST,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,"That is so, and, therefore, I say that this matter must up. be dealt with solely as a matter of business. On the other hand, we cannot had been imported into England. escarje the argument put forward by the honourable member for Flinders (M Bruce) in regard to the preference which is unintentionally and unreasonably being given to America and Japan. It is the urgent duty of the Government to correct this state of affairs, as far as it exists and can be corrected by legislation, in order to protect our industries, and to give that preference to the Mother Country which Parliament intended.",32
77,Mr MASSYGREENE,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,But we must be quite sure of the facts before we act.,32
78,Sir ROBERT BEST,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,Thes e facts are rather obvious.,32
79,Mr MASSYGREENE,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,"I think it can be shown that the position is different from what the honourable member has represented, when regard is had to the rates of exchange, adverse in the case of some countries and favourable in the case of others.",32
80,Sir ROBERTBEST,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,"It is the duty of the Government to introduce legislation upon the subject now, because we are doing injustice all round, and the will of Parliament is not being carried out.",32
81,Mr MATHEWS,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,"If a man buys £100 worth of goods in the United States of America; and the rate of exchange is 22 per cent., does not he pay duty on £122 %",32
82,Sir ROBERTBEST,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,"No ; the mintage par value is ascertained, and duty is buy in paid on approximately only £S0. In the circumstances, there is ground for the complaint made by the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Bruce), and for further complaint on the part of local and British manufacturers. This unsatisfactory state of affairs should be immediately remedied by legislation.",32
83,Mr TUDOR,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,Y a r r a ) [ 3 . 5 8 ] - I wish to put before the House a phase of the question which has been brought under my notice by certain manufacturers. They complain that if they purchase silk in France for the manufacture of ties they have to pay an excess rate of duty owing to adverse exchange; but when the same silk is sent to England the British manufacturers are able to export the finished tie at a price practically as low as the Australian manufacturer is paying for the silk.,32
84,Mr BRUCE,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,The B r it i sh importer could export the silk before it was made,32
85,Mr TUDOR,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,"Yes ; provided the silk I know the difficulties which confront the r . Customs Department, and I would be loath to do anything that would place Department in a false position. But must act fairly. These manufacturers recently sent the following eable to don:We are urgently in need of 1471, one sand yards. Does 'Great Britain impose tax or any impost whatever on any French, Italian silk entering England? Reply immediately. The reply wasReferring to your cable of the 3rd instant, silk enters England free. I have another letter from a firm interested in the importation of motor cars, in regard ito the Customs method of assessing foreign invoices in the case of a car costing £300 in each of three countries-England, America, and Italy.",32
86,Mr MASSYGREENE,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,That is its value. The equivalent of £300 in Italy is £804.,33
87,Mr TUDOR,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,"I have all that information ihere. We are losing revenue through giving America .the advantage of estimating the exchange at 3.85 dollars to the £1. I am reminded, in passing, that the French manufacturer buys Australian wool, and pays for it, not at the rate of 25 francs to the £1, but at' 50 francs to the £1. When the manufactured article is returned to Australia, however, and the value is reconverted at current rates .of exchange, it has ,to pay an extra heavy duty. Reverting to motor cars, if a machine worth £300 sterling were imported from England, and the duty were assessed at 10 per cent! on the value in the country of origin, the duty would be £33; on tie car from America the duty, ,-at 20 per cent., would be £66; and on the car from Italy, at 20 per cent., £66. But assessed at the conversion rate the duty payable on the English car is £33; on the American car, £52 5s. 8d.; and on the Italian, car, £204 0s. lOd. America gets an advantage of £13 14s. 4d., or 21 per cent., whilst Italy is disadvantaged to the extent of £138 0s. 10d., or 209 per cent.",33
88,Mr MASSYGREENE,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,"The whole trouble is that the honourable member is dealing with three entirely different cars. exchange were normal, those cars would be sold at three different prices.",33
89,Mr TUDOR,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,"I think I may claim to know as much about motor cars as does the Minister. When I was in charge of the the Department I .had the pleasure of we sending one importer to gaol, and I am sorry I was not able to take the same Loncourse with, others. But I have always found the gentleman who supplied me thouwith this information straightforward.",33
90,Mr MASSYGREENE,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,"I am not impugning the accuracy of the statement.; but when the honourable member talks about a £300 car bought in three different countries, one with exchange at par, the other with an adverse exchange, and the third with a favourable exchange, he is endeavouring to make an impossible comparison.",33
91,Mr TUDOR,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,"I would not do anything to make .an enemy of America. Tie fact that the same ocean washes the shores of Australia and the United States sterling of America compels us to cultivate friendly relationship with the American people. If we were to assess duty on imports from America at an exchange rate - of 4;80 dollars to the £1, instead of 3.86 dollars, we would get a lot more revenue. But by the present system we are depriving 'Great Britain of the 10 per cent, preference which Parliament intended to give. I realise that the discussion that has taken place this afternoon will not carry us much further forward. The honourable member for Flinders (Mr. Bruce) was certainly quite justified in raising the question, since it affects our business dealings in regard not only to silks - and woollens, but motor cars and many other imports. For instance, monumental masons insist upon using Carrara marble from Italy. It is a clear, white marble, the like of which is practically unobtainable elsewhere; and if it were first shipped to England and brought here as coming from England, the English agents would reap an advantage which ought to go to the persons working it up in this country. There are many - phases of this question which have not been raised, but we have to take care that we do not inflict an injustice",33
92,Mr BRUCE,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,"Does not the honourable member think that a - definite decision, whatever it majy be, should be given at If once?",33
93,Mr TUDOR,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,"I do not think that the pending law-suit will carry us much further forward, since it will merely determine what is the law on the subject, and the law on the subject may not give justice' to the whole of the people concerned.",33
94,Mr GREGORY,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,"Dampier) [4.7] This question has now been under consideration of the Minister for some time, and the mere fact that litigation in regard to the legality of the action of the Department is pending should not operate as an excuse for further delay in coming to a decision. If our taxation in respect ot' imports from certain countries tells against those countries as compared with others, then I believe the Minister should, at the earliest possible moment, bring down remedial legislation. When the French Mission visited Australia .a little while back, they were met by the representative people of the Commonwealth, and the promise was made that we would do everything within our means to build up trade relations with the French, who had fought so nobly with us. The Customs Department, however, is being administered, so far as this matter is concerned, in a way that does not carry out the promises that were then made. We should provide for fair trade with France, Italy, and Belgium; but I find that we are giving a most decided preference to Japan and the United States. I have here a list-take n out in June last, and allowing for the exchange rates prevailing at that period-whic h shows that, assuming that the duty payable on certain goods coming from France, Italy, the United States and Japan, was 50 per cent., the duty actually payable on goods imported from France, owing to the exchange being so much against that country, would be 138 per cent. In the case of goods coining from Italy, it would be 167 per cent.; only 39 per cent. in. respect of goods coming from the United States of America, and 40 per cent, in the case of Japanese goods. I am satisfied that it was not the intention of this Parliament that such an advantage should be given to the United States of America and Japan, as against Italy, Belgium, and France.",34
95,Mr MASSYGREENE,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,The honourable member's figures are on the assumption that in each case we get the same quantity of goods for f 100.,34
96,Mr GREGORY,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,"Le t us assume that a citizen of the Commonwealth desires to purchase an Italian motor car at a cost of £200. Ho sends his £200 to Italy, and that in Italian exchange would be 17,000* lire. His bank would exchange that £200> for 17,000' lire, and when his car reached Australia the Minister, according to the present - practice-, would say to him, "" This car cost you not £200; but 17,000 lire, or, on the basis of par mint values, approximately, £670, and we will charge duty on that amount.",34
97,Mr MASSYGREENE,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,What would be the cost in England of a similar car of English manufacture?,34
98,Mr GREGORY,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,I assume that it would be sqmething like £200.,34
99,Mr MASSYGREENE,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,That is where the honourable' member is in error.,34
100,Mr GREGORY,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,"When the Minister decided to collect duty, not on the £200 paid for the Italian car, but on the 17,000 lire, would he accept payment in lire?",34
101,Mr MASSYGREENE,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,"Tb e duty has to be paid in the currency 'of the country in which, it is payable.",34
102,Mr GREGORY,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,"-The whole system, to my mind, is fictitious. I am convinced that honourable members will not be content to allow imports from countries which fought with us throughout the war to labour under'this disadvantage. I have not one word to say against the United States of America or Japan. If the preference were small, the position would be different, but the figures given this afternoon by the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Bruce) also show that we are suffering an enormous loss by way of Customs, revenue, and I fail to see why any advantage should be given to the United States of America and Japan, as against France, Italy, and Belgium. I hope that there will be no further delay on the part of the Minister in dealing with this question. Over two months have elapsed since he promised to attend to it , and to come to a definite decision. If the honourable gentleman desires to continue this system of collecting duties, then the sooner the whole question is brought before the House in a way that will enable us to come to a determination the better for all concerned.",34
103,Mr BRUCE,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,*-The Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) promised on the 20th May last that the matter would be dealt with.,34
104,Mr GREGORY,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,"We have had several promises. Any legislation that might be brought into meet the difficulty would not be retrospective. No one would expect anything of the kind, and any proceedings that have been instituted against the Department will be dealt with on the basis of the law as it stands. That being so, if the Minister says he is satisfied with the present method, I think the House should take action to show its disapproval of undue preference being given to the United States of America and Japan, as against the other countries I have mentioned. I sincerely hope that the Minister in the very near future will announce a drastic change.",34
105,Mr FENTON,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,"Maribyrnong ) [4.15]. - We are making a mistake this afternoon in confining our attention to exceptional cases. If any concessions are granted to countries in respect of which the exchange rates are operating adversely, all sorts of demands will be made upon the Department, and many alterations in the present system will be necessary. I am not going into the merits of this case, but I certainly think the M ister for Trade and Customs (Mr . Greene) has made an exceptionally fair proposal. He has intimated that there is now pending in the Law Courts a case involving the determination of a question closely allied to that which has been brought before us by the, honourable member for Flinders (Mr Bruce), and that being so, he ought not to bo asked to take immediate action. should not be asked to come to a decision which might influence the Court. There are two sides to this case. am alwnvs prepared to make an effort to remedy that which is unfair, but I have yet to learn of any legislation passed by this, or any other Parliament, under which an injustice has not been suffered by some person or persons in the community. We cannot legislate to meet special cases. The United States of America is a country so nearly akin to our own so far as the habits and aspirations of its people are concerned, that if any preference were to be granted, I should give it to goods coming from that country rather than to imports from France, Italy , and Belgium, where some of the working conditions are very different from our own. Are we to expose our industries to such competition? My motto is, "" Australia first, and a long way first. "" A f t e r we have done our best for Australia, let us do our best for other countries which, in their aspirations, their social and wages conditions, most closely approximate to our own. As showing how son.10 writers view this matter, I quote the following paragraph :-If the method of calculating duty were altered in the way desired by the importers, one of the most serious and insidious attacks upon our Protective Tariff would be crowned with success. The Australian manufacturer would be exposed to undercutting by foreign manufacturers, and Australian development would be retarded for the benefit of the foreigner, who is concerned only with the restoration of his own trade, and is not in the least interested in the progress of Australia.",35
106,Sir ROBEET BEST,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,Fro m what is the honourable member quoting?,35
107,Mr FENTOST,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,"Fro m the Australian Mining Standard, some of the contributors to which have a grip of exchange and Customs questions equal to that of any honourable member of this House. I hope that the Minister will adhere to his present decision. A w r it has been issued in - against the Department, and we should do nothing that might in any way in fluence the decision of the Court. The Minister has promised that when, so to speak, the clouds have rolled away, this House will have an opportunity to review the whole question, and to arrive at a decision in regard to it .",35
108,Mr BRUCE,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,"May there not be a He furthe r banking up of the clouds, with the result that the system complained of will go on indefinitely? I Mr FEN""TOKT - The position is not very serious, because the figures quoted by the honourable member himself show that our imports from France and It a l y are comparatively small. Unless we are prepared, as the true protectors of Australian industry, to raise our Tariff sufficiently high, America will export to Australia more largely than she has ever done. She is making her plans accordingly, and, starting off with this advantage as against Italy , France, and Belgium, she is in a better position than ever to increase her exports to this country. To-day the English-speaking races are more closely in touch than ever before in their history, and if to keep them so preference must be given against Italy, France, or Belgium, it should, in my opinion, be given. I think that the Minister has been fair. I cannot conceive of Parliament being asked to discuss a question that is to all intents and purposes before the Courts.",35
109,Mr MATHEWS,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,"Melbourne Ports) [4.21] - Non e of the speakers this afternoon have addressed themselves sufficiently to the situation as it concerns importations from the ""United States of America. We are told by the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Bruce) that we lose over £1,000,000 of revenue in connection with these importations, and I wish to know how the Customs Department bases its charges and collections on American imports. I followed the M in ister's statement regarding the £ 1 0 units, and agreed with his deductions. But suppose I bought a £500 motor car in the United States with a view to putting it on this market at a certain price, I should have to pay another £100 by way of exchange.",36
110,Mr MASSYGREENE,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,Rathe r more than that.,36
111,Mr MATHEWS,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,"A b o u t 22 cent., I understand. I wish to know why the Department would not charge duty in respect of the importation of such a car on a valuation of £610, which is actually what I would have to pay. If I bought a £500 car in Great Britain , the sum I paid for it would represent its total cost to me, putting aside freight and similar charges; but if I imported a car of the same value from France, it .would cost me only £250, while if I went to America for it , it would cost me over £600, and I ought to be called on to pay duty on that amount. If the Government is not collecting duty on the actual cost of the goods imported, and if the law will not allow it to do so, there is something wrong. In discussing this question, we are verging upon the discussion of a matter which is sub judice; but on this occasion, it suits the Government to allow the debate to continue; if the decision that was given in regard to the discussion of another matter, in connection with which the name of a certain reverend gentleman was mentioned, were given effect, we could not continue the debate. I agree with the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Bruce) that the people of - this country'are being robbed when duty is not collected on the full cost of the article imported. If duty is not charged on the cost of an article purchased fro m the United States of America plus exchange, the Department ought not to penalize importers from France by its exchange calculations. The arrangement seems unjust to the people of Australia, in causing them to lose revenue; and unjust to the importers from France, Belgium, and It a l y . Question resolved in the negative.

Whether, in view of the great flight to Australia of Sir Ross and Sir Keith Smith and 1/ieulenants Parer and Macintosh, the Government will seize this opportunity of acquiring valuable data as to air currents, &c., &c, by asking those gallant airmen to make a report thereon for use by the Commonwealth when considering the question of aerial mails to the Northern Territory and countries to the northward of Australia V 2. In view of the great strides recently made in Australia in commercial aviation, will he make a statement as to what encouragement the Government are likely to give to this imper portant branch of aviation, having in mind its important bearing on the question of defence?",36
113,Sir JOSEPH COOK,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,"The answers - to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. I am sure that those gentlemen will be readily disposed to make available the data they have secured as a contribution to the progress of Australia's aviation, in which they have been taking such a distinguished part. 2. The Government realise that the development of civil aviation has an important relation to air defence, and proposals' in regard to this will shortly bo submitted to Parliament. Meanwhile, the Minister for Defence is engaged in an examination of the extent to which the Commonwealth will be associated with the organization of these activities with a view to ascertaining the lines upon which action might proceed, and the field which would be left to State, municipal, or private exploitation. A further preliminary step is the assumption by the Commonwealth of the responsibility for the regulation of air traffic. With the agreement of the Premiers of the States, a Federal Bill is now being drafted for submission this session. SCRAP STEELAND IRON"".",36

If there is no buyer at equitable prices in Western Australia, will the Government remove the embargo forthwith? Sir JOSEPH COOK,- I would invite the honourable member's attention to the statement made by the Prime Minister in the House on 20th May, 1920. If any owner of scrap iron or steel, being dissatisfied with the prices.offering by local users, forwards full particulars to the Government, the matter will receive full consideration. WOLFRAM.",36
115,Mr RILEY,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,"for Mr MCBONAID) asked the Prime Minister, upon notice I. With reference to the exportation of wolfram, will the Prime Minister state whether the demands of the Metal Exchange have been satisfied in this connection? 2. Are producers of wolfram allowed to pose of their metal to foreign countries? - Sir JOSEPH COOK-The answers to the honourable member's questions as follow:1. The honourable member, perhaps, refers the arrangement made by the Imperial GovernVictoria, ment with the Commonwealth Government for the acquisition of the Australian production of wolfram. The Metal Exchange had nothing to do with the arrangement, which came to an end on 31st March, 1920. 2. Yes, except to enemy and ex-enemy countries. CASE OF CADET C. G. HUCKELL. paid to",37

Does the Minister purpose doing anything whatever in the direction of.giving relief to Mr Ronald, who, it is stated, has suffered an injustice, and who asks that 'Consideration be given to his claim that justice be done in his case?",37

What are the intentions of the Government in regard to this matter?",38
125,Mr MASSYGREENE,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. Yes. 2. It is not the intention of the Government to make any alteration at present, but the matter is under consideration. SOLDIERS' DEPENDANTS. CANCELLATIO N OF PASSAGES.",38
126,Mr MACKAY,FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND CUSTOMS,"the Minister representing the Minister for Repatriation, upon notice I. Whether it is a fact that a large number of passages of the dependants of soldiers have recently been cancelled by the Repatriation Commission in London ? 2. Will the Minister direct that careful inquiries should be made into all the circumstances before'this privilege is cancelled?  advises as follows^ 1. No. Recently, however, it came under notice that in some instances dependants of soldiers who had been granted free passages to the Commonwealth, and who, when called upon after reasonable notification to embark, failed to do so without taking the necessary steps to advise the authorities of their inability to proceed, with the result that the cost of the empty berths so-caused must be borne by the Commonwealth. The Commission decided that, where the Commonwealth is called upon to meet the cost of thepassages unavailed of under such circumstances, the benefit, as far as the persons affected were concerned, should be deemed to have been forfeited. 2.

It has been arranged for the Department of Science and Industry, when established, to'advise as to continuance of the experiments. 2.

' BUTTER AGREEMENT SECOND READING . Debate resumed from 18th August (vide page 3620), on motion by Mr . GREENEThat this Bill be now read a second time.  [ 4 . 3 5 ] - I see no reason to modify anything I said last evening with regard to the Bill . So far as I can see, it is a Bill to l i m it the price of butter sold overseas, and not a Bill to r at if y an agreement in the true sense of the word. We must, therefore, look at it from the point of view of its effect, which is that no producer will be able to send butter out of this country except through this Pool. This means that the producers will not get a price in excess of 2403. per cwt.; and if , during the period that this agreement lasts, the world's parity for butter goes up to, say, 300s., that will represent a loss of 60s. per cwt. to the dairy people of this country.",39
134,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Suppos e it goes the other way.  not likely to go the other way; I cannot conceive of that for a moment, seeing that the price is on the upward grade. Of course, if it does go the other way, it will work to the advantage of the primary producer; but we can say, with a great deal of certainty, that it will not. I am quite consistent in the attitude I am taking in regard to the Bill because I objected to the agreements made on behalf of the primary producer in the case of wool and wheat. I cannot understand honourable members who claim to be a Country party having so little to say against transactions of this kind.",39
135,Mr ROBERT COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"This is not a sale by the Government, but by the producers themselves, who ought to be anxious to ratify it.  that the producers, or the men engaged in the industry, know very much about the sale. Last evening I gave the names of some people concerned, including that of Mr J. W . Sandford, chairman of directors of J . W. Sandford and Company, merchandise and produce auctioneers, dairy machinery and refrigerating engineers, of Grenfell-street, AdeBILL. laide, Port Adelaide, and Mount Gambier.",39
136,Mr HILL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Does he not own one of the biggest butter factories in South Australia?  'he owned all South Australia, he is the managing director of this company, the interest of which he is there to watch and advance. The honourable member for Indi (Mr Robert Cook) told us a little while ago that he himself is chairman of a number of co-operative societies, . and he ought to know that Mr . Sandford would cast him and all his cooperative concerns into the Murray if he had his way. I venture to say that the honourable member was sent here to oppose such gentlemen as this Mr Sandford, whom we now find supposedly representing the interests of the primary producers of this country but, in reality, is the representative of the middlemen. The interests of the company to which I have referred are diametrically opposed to chose of every man whose butter will go into this Pool.",39
137,Sir JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Does the honourable member complain that 2s. 3d. per lb. is not enough for the Australian worker to pay for his butter?  not discussing that aspect of the question.,40
138,Sir JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"But that question.  we are talking about the price that the butter-makers of Australia will get overseas; and I emphasize the point that if the world's parity should exceed 240s., and go to 3003., they will be losing 60s. per cwt. - Mr MARE - If we do not r at if y this agreement, will it not have the effect of at once lowering the price of butter?  not see that at all. However, I can only say that, notwithstanding what the honourable member for Indi says, he was sent here to oppose such men as Mr Sandford, and those associated with him , as middlemen. The members of the Country grower. party cannot support this measure without the impression being created on constituents that they have "" s l i p p e since last election.. The Minister Trade and Customs has admitted that there are four middlemen on this Comthere mittee. The party to which I belong regard the middleman as the natural enemy of the primary producers, and we cannot support any agreement in which such gentlemen are interested. the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) had, here last night when I exhibited a cartoon from the Bulletin, showing the Country party, in the form of a toy lamb, being will ! led along by the Prime Minister, while the Treasurer regarded them with a happy look. The cartoon somewhat flatters the Treasurer, and I think he ought to see i One honourable member of the part"" said that he supports the Bill because it assures a higher price for butter than the producers previously obtained. That same argument was used price of wool was fixed at Is. 3^d., but that was not the point then, and the point now. Although that price for the wool was higher than the previous prioe, there w.ere producers in other parts of the world receiving three or four times as much.",40
139,Mr FLEMING,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The genuine wool growers were all satisfied.  lenge that statement every time. I represent as many wool-growers as does the honourable member, and I do not know any who were satisfied. Then, in regard to the agreement with the Colonial Combing and Spinning Company, even the Central Wool Committee objected to it . is the Mr FLEMING - A f t e r themselves making it !  concerned about who made the agreement; I am speaking of the general bulk of the growers, and showing that even the Central Committee objects. If the Central Committee did agree to the arrangement, it only further supports my argument that it did not represent the matured opinion of the producers of the country. If high profits were made by this company, and they are now burdensome to anybody, they ought to go to the men on the land, who had all the worry and trouble of production.",40
140,Mr ROBERT COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I understood the Prime Minister to say that 80 per cent, of the profits would go to the wool their Prime Minister did not say any such d "" thing ; he said definitely that the profits for belonged to the Government.",40
141,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I understand is a similar arrangement to be made in reference to butter if the price goes up.  heard it hinted that if the world's parity - goes beyond 240s.; the producers will get I wish the benefit, and I should like to know been whether that is true. The fact is, that if the world's parity does go higher",40
142,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Of course it  that all the indications are in that direction, and if it does go higher it will repret . sent so much loss to the producers if some Country arrangement is not made.",40
143,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Has the honourable member any objection to the Australian consumer paying the export parity whenever when the the.export price goes up?  it is not nothing to do with the matter.,40
144,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Will you do me the courtesy of answering the question ?  dealing with the exportable surplus of our butter, and not with the industry as it concerns the consumers of Australia. I am consistent in my attitude because I have raised previously my voice against the contracts entered into by the Prime Minister for the sales of wool and wheat. The ex-Treasurer (Mr W at t ) went to England, to use his own words, to pick up the lost ends of the wool tangle, and my impression is that he discovered so much about the wool tangle that we shall get some interesting revelations when he returns. I venture to say that the Prime Minister (Mr . Hughes) does nob wish to meet his excolleague, and that a little game of hideand-seek will be played. The Minister intends to leave for Geneva shortly, and probably he will pass the ex-Treasurer on his way out to Australia. Having known the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr W at t ) in both State and Federal politics, I am confident that all the cards in connection with the sales of produce - overseas are not on the table; he has "" a lot up his .sleeve,"" and we shall find out a great deal more in regard to tliose sales when he returns to Australia.",40
145,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I hope the honourable member is not forgetting that the honorMinister able member for Balaclava (Mr W a was the man who made the last wool sale on behalf of Australia.  was stated, but later I saw a denial of by the Prime Minister.",41
146,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I challenge the honourable member to find) any such denial by the Prime Minister.  the Minister of the time when the Prime Minister stated that the last wool sale agreement h=4 been made behind his bacK, and that if he had been in Australia he would not have agreed to it . the Prime Minister said that he alone was responsible for the sale.",41
147,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,That is not a denial that the wool was sold by Mr W at t.  statement that the wool was sold by M Watt was subsequently denied by the stood Prime Minister.,41
148,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"There will be ""something d o in g "" when the Treasurer returns. .  convinced of that because I know him. but the evil day is to be postponed by the Prime Minister as long as possible.",41
149,Mr HILL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Would the honourable member place an embargo on the export of the Prime Minister pending the arrival of the ex-Treasurer?  I have been asked if I would deport him altogether. My answer is "" Not without t r i a l , "" much as I would like to see him deported. I move That all the words after the word "" now"" be omitted, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words ""withdrawn for the purpose of its recasting and immediate reintroduction with suitable provisions to inPrime sure that the butter producers of Australia will be guaranteed a return for their exportable surplus butter of a price which shall not be less than the world's parity for butter during the period in which such exportable surplus is disposed of.""",41

I have been connected with if for many years, and in conjunction with the for Trade and Customs (Mr . t t) Greene) I represent probably between one-fourth and one-fifth of the total dairy production of Australia.. During the last few hours we have heard from it Opposition members opinions in regard to further production which convince me that they know very little about the matter, and arouse a. suspicion in my mind that in regard to other questions of primary production, about which we have heard so much from honourable members opposite, their statements may show quite as big a divergence from the actual facts. Almost every speaker on the Opposition side has asked for inforLater mation, and more information; but it seems to me, from the attitude those hon r orable members have adopted toward this Bill , that if their requests were granted, they would almost be receiving in - The formation in a strange tongue, because r . it would be impossible of being underby them. This Bill embodies practically the same principle as that for which honourable members opposite have exbeen fighting during the last three weeks,, namely, the - recognition of organized bodies that are connected with industries. This Bill really means a recognition of typicalthe organized bodies which are entitled to speak for the dairying industry. Durbring ing the last few weeks, while the House was considering the Industrial Peace B i l honourable members of the Country party fluence did not "" but t in , "" and claim that we alone were competent to speak for the coal miners or other workers. W!e supported this the efforts which were made by the Opposition to secure the recognition of organized interests in industry. What is the history of the agreement which the House is asked to sanction? During the war, a Federal Butter Pool was in existence. It did not meet the general approval of primary prowhich ducers, and a desire was expressed at the earliest possible moment, Governhaving ment control of the industry should be completely relinquished. In compliance with that view, the Minister oonvened, in arrived atMarch of last year, a conference of the bodies interested; in dairy production to discuss the best method of bringing that about. In order that the conference should be truly representative of thei n dustry, the Minister gave ample notice, importation and according to a statement published in the Age in February last, in order consider the question of new arrangewith ments- ' Invitations are being sent to the Commonwealth Dairy Produce Pool Committee and representatives who were elected by to consider the dairy produce co-operative scheme, which was placed before them some time ago by the Minister. It is thought these delegates, having been elected by men, will be able, to interpret the views of the producers. The Minister stated last night it was anticipated, that steps would be in the meantime by the producers' organizaadopted tions to get into touch with the representadiscuss this matter. tives wlio are to attend the conference, so that the latter would be fully acquainted with the desires of the producers,, and would be able to act with full authority. Headded that the Commonwealth Government would not enter into any contract unless it was fully satisfied that the great body of theproducerssible, desired that it should do so, and completely approved of the terms.. I do< not think any honourable, member either side of the House can object to. principle which, the Minister laid During the six weeks which elapsed tween the convening and the holding the conference, resolutions were carried throughout the dairying districts of tralia, of which the following-whic h was passed at a. meeting of. producers at. Smith town, in my electorate - was That this meeting of primary producers before the notice of the Federal member the unsatisfactory position dairymen are placed in with regard to the disposal of their l , butter, and request that he will use his inin having the prices lifted; also that no further contract be entered into with the Imperial Government at the termination of contract unless desired by the primary producers of this State.",41
151,Mr CUNNINGHAM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Were the producers then consulted about the agreement?,42
152,Dr EARLE PAGE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"As soon as the proposition was brought forward, the primary producers' organization in New with South Wales circularized every union, practically comprised every indithat, vidual dairy farmer, with a view to the matter thoroughly considered. At the conference held in Melbourne, in March, the following resolution, was That this Inter-StateConference be urged to request the Minister, to inform the Imperial Government that the producers desire a free market; but in the event of the Imperial - Government deciding to retain control of the and sale of dairy produce in Great Britain after the completion of the present contract, the Commonwealth Dairy Produce to Pool Committee be empowered to negotiate and sell to the Imperial Government next season's surplus butter and cheese.",42
153,Mr RYAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Can the honourable memthe ber show where the conference asked for the States a Bill of this character ? Dr EARLE PAGE. - Later , I shall that explain, I hope to the satisfaction of the dairyhonorable member for West Sydney, and that his farmer constituents, why this B i ll is. taken necessary. Such were the resolutions by the conferences that met to It was realized on every hand that the arrangement was not ideal, but that it was the best that could: be got, and a half-wav house to an open market. The producers desired, if posto secure complete freedom from Government control, but they recognised that the actions of the Imperial Governon ment could not be controlled by the Austhe tralian Government, and that if they down.. were to take advantage of the British bemarket, they must subscribe to the terms of fixed by the Imperial Government. Then the question of ability to carry outAusa contract arose, and that is really wturt has necessitated' the passageof this Bill . The Minister (Mr iGreene) has alreadydetailed the method by which the agreement was arrived at. The Government did nothing in the matter; it was two delegates of the producers who went Home and arranged the following contract :The Pool, with the Government approval has sold the exportable surplus of butter from the 1st of August, 1920, until the 31st March, 1921, as under:Price, 240s. per cwt. for 90-grade butter, with Is. per point up or down, with 3s. per cwt. additional for unsalted butter. Payments are to be made at the end of fourteen days after being placed in cool storage ot port of shipment or against storage warrants. Storage - The cost of storage in Victoria to be paid by the sellers for an average of six weeks; after that to be paid by the Imperial Government. Commonwealth Grader's Certificates issued when the butter was graded to be final. The East, and South Africa - The normal trade of the Enst is to be provided for. and up to 50 tons monthly to be released for shipment to South Africa. The price asked for was 252s. per cwt., but after bargaining a compromise was arrived at, as set out in the agreement. However, it is confidently anticipated that an increase will be granted by the Ministry of Food in Great Britain .",42
154,Mr RYAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Is that mentioned in the contract ?,43
155,Dr EARLE PAGE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,No .,43
156,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Who wil l that increase?,43
157,Dr EARLE PAGE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The producers will get it .  honourable member learn that?,43
158,Dr EARLE PAGE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"A cablegram which appeared in the press a few days ago stated that it was the definite desire of the Imperial Government to give the highest possible price, in order to encourage the fullest production in every sense. We have heard a great deal about placing an embargoupon the exportable surplus of butter, but what has always been the position ? The price of butter is high during the winter months in Australia, and keeps high u n t i l November or December, and then gradually, and sometimes suddenly, falls, owing to the fact that the later shipments from Australia come into a flushed market in Great Britain . In 1912, the highest price for Australian butter in London was reached in January. It was 134s. per cwt. This was fol lowed by a rapid decline u n t i l the middle of the year. In 1913, the price rose u n t i l it reached' 128s. in November, and then it slumped u n t i l the middle of 1914. Even in 1915, during the war period, the price reached its highest point in December, and then fell, and remained low until the middle of 1916. That is the normal position,^ and what we must expect, because Danish butter, which has always supplied the bulk of British requirements, will be available next year, as it was before the war. Honourable members of the Country party are opposed to placing embargoes on export, but when practically every cooperative society throughout Australia has decided to pool its butter, and accept the price offered by the Imperial Government, we think it is scarcely right for honourable' members on the Labour benches to seek to take steps which would permit a proprietary concern to sell its butter outside the Pool until October or November at a big price, and then ask to be allowed to come into the Pool in January or February, when the price may be lower than 242s. per cwt. outside the Pool. There has been considerable criticism in regard to the personnel of the D a i r y Produce Pool. We have heard talk about get "" middlemen,"" the avowed enemies of everything Australian, and everything decent and just. Mention has been made of Mr J. W . Sandford, who, as well as being a large merchant, happens to be the owner of the largest butter factory in South Australia. Is it conceivable that he would be desirous of securing less for the butter of the producers he represents in South Australia than can he got from the Imperial Government?",43
159,Mr CUNNINGHAM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It is alleged that he is interested in a distributing business in Great Britain . Dr .

161,Dr EARLE PAGE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Many of them have been doing so.  orable member mentioned the middlemen referred to by the Minister? 4,44
162,Dr EARLE PAGE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Yes . Messrs. Basche, Mackey, and Sandford are those whom the Minister regards as middlemen, but they are also dairy farmers and have large co-operative interests.",44
163,Mr GREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Mr Holdensen other.,44
164,Dr EARLE PAGE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"But by no stretch of imaginat on can they be re, garded solely as middlemen. In any case, they are in a hopeless minority on the Committee. Mr Sandford has only a onetwenty-first sayi n the control of the Pool.  anxious to get the highest price for his dairying machinery.",44
165,Dr EARLE PAGE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"He represents South Australian producers with a total output of £698,000, as against £5,468,000 from New South Wales, and £4,278,000 from Victoria. Even if Mr Sandford wished to control the business, what possibility would he have of doing so ? In regard to the question of the Government's so-called mala fides in this matter, the argument of honourable members opposite is most absurd.",44
166,Mr RYAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Not necessarily mala fides; incompetency would be the better word to use.,44
167,Dr EARLE PAGE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The Minister (Mr Greene) who has brought forward the Bill is a dairy farmer and represents the biggest dairying constituency in Australia. Por the last eighteen months he has done his best to secure some co-operative methods in the control of the sale and handling of butter in Australia. Is it likely that he would bring forward a Bill which might possibly occasion loss to the dairy farmers in <liis electorate? Is it likely that, realizing that during the war the farmers had been scourged with whips"", he would bring down a measure to scourge them, as honourable members opposite put it , with scorpions ? In connection with the sale of primary produce in Australia, I would like to have a full explanation of the attitude of the Labour party. We have heard a good deal from ihonorable members opposite about the farmers getting a reasonable price for home sales. I would like to know exactly what they propose the farmer should get. Two or three weeks hon- ago the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) and the honourable member for Cook (Mr Catts) suggested a basis upon which prices in Australia should he fixed. W it h in my recollection, two Labour Governments have fixed the price of butter in Australia. E'ive years ago a Labour Government in New South is an- Wales fixed the price at Is. 3d. a l b . , although, over the border in Queensland,butter, was selling at 2s. 6d. per l b . Sub; sequently, the Queensland Government commandeered all supplies in the State at 140s. per cwt. and sold some of it in New South Wales at 172s. per cwt. I did not hear of the difference of 32s. going back he is to the primary producers.",44
168,Mr RYAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The surplus realized on Queensland butter sold in London, amounting to tens of thousands of pounds, was given to the producers.",44
169,Dr EARLE PAGE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I was talking of the butter sold in New South Wales. That is to be the position when the world's parity is greater than the price prevailing in Australia. But what would it be when the world's .parity was below what would be a reasonable price on the basis suggested by the Labour party? Would they still maintain that the price should be determined by the wages paid to the dairy farmers and their wives and children engaged in the industry ? If honourable members opposite are prepared to concede that point-if they are prepared to give the dairy farmers an effective protection of that character-w e shall be able to join hands with them. But we require clearer and more precise evidence than is so far forthcoming that that would be their .attitude i u connection with the fixing of the prices of our p r i mary products. In the early months of the present Parliament, when we had the sugar agreement before us, practically the whole of the influence of the Labour party was thrown into an effort to f i x the price of sugar at a lower rate than was proERyan) osed by the Government. onorable member for West Sydney has read to the House a list of representatives of country districts are members of the Labour party, the fact cannot be overlooked that they only six or seven in a party of Is it reasonable to assume that that tail would ""wag the dog"" when the party had to come to a decision as to whether the consuming .or the producing of Australia should prevail 1",44
170,Mr RYAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,But every member of our party is pledged to the same policy. Here is an extract from the Labour manifestoWe shall guarantee to the producer a return which will secure to him a price for his products that will cover the cost of production and allow a reasonable margin of profit.,45
171,Dr EARLE PAGE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Will the honourable member enlarge upon that statement ' in his party manifesto by informing the House as to the attitude which he and his party would adopt when the world's parity, so far as butter is concerned, was considerably less than the cost of production here? The Queensland Labour Government, I understand, has fixed the price of butter, not at 240s. per cwt. as under this contract, but at 228s. per cwt. ?",45
172,Mr FENTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Queenslan d has had for some time an exceptional surplus of butter.,45
173,Mr COKSEK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,This is not an exceptional season in Queensland.,45
174,Dr EARLE PAGE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"At a time when practically every dairy farmer in Southern Queensland and Northern New South Wales was trying to secure a reasonable return for his produce to enable him to recoup his drought losses, Labour interests were sufficiently powerful to reduce the price by something like 20s. per cwt. in New South Wales. The same thing will happen again if Labour has its way, and that is why, in season and out of season, we urge that despite what is said by the Labour party, it is necessary that there should be in this House and in the count r y a strong body of producing representatives who will insist upon a fair deal for the primary producer.  Bill is designed to give legislative power to an honourable agreement that has been made between the butter producers of Australia and the Imperial Government, and recognition by this Parliament seems to the necessary to insure that all butter Although the (Mr. producers in Australia shall stand up - to their obligations under it . Honourable members on both sides of the House who - will admit that if the price obtainable under the agreement was below the number current rate it would not be fair for dairy twenty-six. producers to disregard that agreement and to sell their butter outside at the higher price. On the other hand, if the price under this agreement was higher than interests the current rate subsequently procurable, producers could bring their butter under the terms of the contract and so escape the low price. The measure is necessary, therefore, to prevent certain producers of butter from ""blacklegging"" or ""scabbing "" on their fellow producers. The butter producers are to be complimented on their desire to secure by this Bill the only means for the fulfilment of an honourable agreement. Good f a it h is an iirciportant asset, and there should be no means of breaking f a it h in the carrying out of an honourable arrangement. This Bill seeks merely to control the operation of any agreement, and should, therefore, be readily dealt with . It seems to be the oustom, however, for honourable members to avail themselves of opportunities, such as the introduction of a measure of this kind offers, to ventilate their various opinions. It is interesting to hear honourable members of the Labour party asserting that they have included in their platform the principle of securing to the producer the highest price that he can obtain for his produce after the Australian consumption has been met. should like to see that principle not merely in the party platform, but actually put into practice. Why obtain the highest price only for that which is sold outside the Commonwealth? Why not give the Australian producer the price which, if he did not produce it , would have to be paid here for the imported article. There seems to be no logical reason for not doing so. should like to know what other sections of the community in Australia have done for the butter producer to justify him giving any concession to the local consumer. Consumers in Australia are always ready to get their butter at the lowest possible price by taking advantage of a flushed market or any other circumstances that arise. Honourable members opposite desire that we should squeeze from the consumers overseas the highest price that we can obtain for our exports. What then becomes of their brotherhood of workers 1 The butter that we send Home is .consumed by labourers, amongst others, there, and I do not know.why they should pay more than is paid by Australian labourers or vice versd. The producers of butter in Australia are ready to make concessions to the local consumers, when the latter are ready to make concessions to themr I think that honourable members of the Labour party, when they proceed to make up tha cost of butter production, will be rather sorry that they have placed in their platform the plank to which reference has been made. Sutter producers work seven days a week, wet or dry, hot or cold. The cost of milch oows is increasing, and .the increasing cost of living applies to the butter producers, as well as to all other sections of the community. Many of those engaged in other industries are asking for more protection against imports-; but no protection whatever is given to the butter producers. An y policy that does not give the butter producers, and all other producers, at the very least tihe world's parity for their commodities will not do justice to them.",45
175,Mr LAZZASINI,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Werriwa) [5.37] I congratulate the honourable member for  classical words as "" blacklegs"" and ""scabs.""' In supporting the amendment moved by the honourable member for  I farmers shall obtain the world's parity for their exportable surplus of butter, I desire at the outset to refer to the statement made by the honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) that there is 'no evidence of the fraternity of labour in the proposal of the Labour party to make the labourer in England pay more than he would otherwise do for his butter. If we had any I guarantee that the labourer in England would reap the benefit of any reduction no fault could be found with the honourable member's complaint. I would remind him, however, that the British workingclasses derived no advantage from the fact that the price paid for Australian produce in England during the war was considerably less than that paid for the same commodities from other countries. Bread made from Australian wheat was' sold to the English labourer at the same price as that charged for bread made - from wheat purchased from the United States of America, Canada, and the Argentine at nearly double the price that we received. It will be the same so far as our butter is concerned. We realise that if the Australian butter producer obtained for his exportable surplus less than the world's parity, no advantage would be secured by the British labourer. T'he difference between the world's parity and the lower prices obtained by the - Australian producer would go, not to the consumers in the Old Country, hut to the middlemen who are controlling the business and manipulating for their own nenefit private producing organizations in Australia. When the honourable member for Hume  world's parity, he was asked what would happen if the world's price for butter fell below 2s. I d .

176,Mr LAZZARINI,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"If an agreement has been entered into by the primary producers, tihe Bill is unnecessary. In my opinion, the measure is designed to put compulsion upon men who have not signed the agreement, and were not represented at the conference which was held. What does the agreement contain? No doubt, there is much legal phraseology, and many clauses.",46
177,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"There is no legal phraseology, and the agreement does not cover much more than one sheet of foolscap.",47
178,Mr LAZZARINI,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It should have been embodied in the Bill , or copies of it should have been circulated among members at least twenty-four hours before the inauguration of this discussion. I deny that the dairy farmers have entered into this agreement. ference that has been referred to was like other conferences of the kind that have been held, at which the primary producers have been represented by stock and station agents, country solicitors, city exporting agents, and Others who formulate the resolutions that are agreed to, and commit the primary producers, hundreds of whom know nothing of what is being done. Parliament is being asked to give legal force to an agreement which has been made simply in the interests of the big middlemen and exporting agents. It shows how the members of the Corner party represent country interests when a member of that party has declared that he will vote for the Bill , although, according to him , it costs 4s. per l b . to produce butter, and the producers are to get only 2s.

But in guaranteeing to supply other peoples with . foodstuffs, we should see that own people are not required to make a sacrifice as in the past. We know what a muddle has been created by the looseme, ness of the contracts made for the supply of other commodities. Possibly, a similar tangle will be caused by this agreement, and then the Prime Minister will tell that had he known at the time what he knows now, it would not have occurred. In the interests of the primary producers, we should see that they get the world's parity for their butter. The Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene) in terjected yesterday that New Zealand sells her butter at a slight premium, and some one said that it was because her butter was better than ours.",47

It seems to however, that we are really assisting the exporter to sell his goods before he is called on to pay for them, whereas importers must pay for their goods, or us at least have their bills accepted by the banks, before they can take delivery of them. The measure is for the benefit of the middlemen, and the Country party is once more closely allied with the Nationalists to serve the middlemen's interests instead of the producers, which is what has taken place in connection with every piece of legislation that has come before us.",47

His closing words seemed to me just as contrary to fact as it was possible to make them. The whole basis of the measure is that the farmers have come together and made an agreement which leaves them some control, for once in a way, over their own products. They having decided that it is time they got something like a fair return for their labour. The result is great consternatio.n in the ranks of the Opposition, because they think that the consumer may suffer. But the primary producers have suffered quite long enough; and even if the consumer does pay a little more, what does that matter so long as the return goes into the pockets of those who earned it ? That is what we are here to secure.",48

Now, when for the first time sometliiusr dpfinite is soiurht to be done in this direction, we find all sorts of chanres burled against men who have banded themselves tosrether in order to get fair play. In dealing with the dairv farmer we have to consider not only his wasres. hut also a return fo^ the whole of his family. Unlike the worker in the city, who does his daily work and takes his wages home at the week end to his family, every single soul on the dairy farm does his or her share. The men, women, and children all help in producAgreement Bill. 3671 tion; and in assessing values the work of every one has to be considered. The dairy farmers have now got together, and through their organization have asfed the Government to give them some recognition. But when that is proposed there is a howl of protest from the Opposition. We are told by honourable members opposite that they are quite prepared to allow the farmers a fair return for their exportable surplus. They are quite prepared to let the farmers get higher and higher prices; but are they prepared to permit the same in relation to the dairy produce sold in Australia? It is no use talking of 'encouraging production for overseas markets if we deprive the producers of their home market.",48
193,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Whic h is three-fourths of their trade.,48
194,Mr FLEMING,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Undoubtedly . We have had the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Ryan) giving us a list of his colleagues who represent primary producers, though he is the man above all others who has depressed the price of primary products in Australia. He claims that his party is ready to do something in the interests of the primary producers; but there are men of my acquaintance who have been driven out of Queensland because of the impositions placed upon them by the honourable member for West Sydney when he was Premier of that State. In face of facts like these, the honourable member tells us that he is prepared to champion the cause of the primary producers. He finds fault with the Bill, which represents an arrangement between the producers themselves and the Imperial Government, under which the producers will have some chance of controlling their own affairs, and not only getting a better price now, but being assured of a price for twelve months ahead. This latter is quite a new advantage to the farmer, who has always been dependent on the sea°ons and fluctuating prices; never, from year to year, or month to month, could he be sure of a price; but now there is an agreement under which he has the advantages I have indicated. Tbiq Bill will give an impetus to dairy-farm.ing and production such as never before existed, and the primary p^dneers will feel convinced that the National party really has their interests at heart as much as any men whom they could possibly send to this Parliament. I am extremely glad that this Bil l has been introduced. The Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene) represents one of the largest, if. not the largest butter-producing district in Australia, and he has come into line with the aspirations of this branch of industry, which at last is to be insured a decent return for labour expended.",48
195,Mr LAVELLE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Calare) [5.55.] -- I must congratulate the honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) on the speech he made this afternoon.. As an attempt at humour, it was certainly excellent, so excellent, indeed, that the honourable member stands as a worthy rival of Mark Twain. It must be gaid, however, that his remarks were not quite so enlightening as they were amusing. The honourable member said that, after listening to honourable members on this side, he was satisfied that we did not possess a knowledge of the needs and requirements of the primary producer; but, observing his Bmile, we knew that he did not mean one word of what he said. Every one recognises that if there is one party standing for the primary producer in this, or any other country, it is the Australian Labour party. We, on this side, are opposed to the principle of the Bill because we say now, as we have said for years, that it is time the producer had a fair deal so far as the sale of his produce is concerned.",49
196,Mr CUNNINGHAM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Is the honourable member for Cowper a primary producer?,49
197,Mr LAVELLE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I believe he is. It ig now time we got back to normal conditions and the primary producers were given a fair chance and not restricted in any way as to where they shall sell their produce.,49
198,Mr ATKINSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,How does this Bill restrict them?,49
199,Mr LAVELLE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"If the honourable member does not understand how, I am not responsible. The Labour party contend that the producers should have a free choice so far as oversea or any other markets are concerned. The members of the Country party during the elections declared they were coming here to preserve the interests of the primary pro-, ducers, but I am sorry to say they have not done so. It is pleasing, however, to know that the scales, have fallen from the eyes of the electors-, who realise more fully every day that there is one, and only one,, party to look after their interests, and that is the Labour party. How can any one maintain that this Bill conserves the interests of the primary 1 producers when it is realized that during the last four years they have been robbed of, approximately, £400,000,000 of the value of their produce in oversea sales? I notice that the "" cabbage soldier,"" the honourable member for Robertson (Mr. Fleming.) laughs, but it is no laughing matter for the producers, not two per cent, of whom wish to see legislation of this nature. It is said, particularly by those who claim to represent the producers, that this Bill is introduced at the desire of the producers themselves-as a recognition of the organization of the farmers. But so far as I .can see, those honourable members cannot tell the House what organization does. repre> sent the primary producers. Some tell us that the producers are represented by the Farmers and Settlers Association, while others say that they are represented by the Primary Producers Union; but it was stated very clearly by the honourable member for Werriwa. (Mr Lazzarini) that the so-called primary producers' unions and associations in New South Wales and every other State are dominated and run by middlemen, stock and station agents, bank managers, and others who are the producers' natural enemies. The farmers and other primary producers were duped and deluded into sending members here who, they thought, would represent them, but who, as events prove, do not represent them at all. Those members, on the contrary, stand loyally by the middlemen, and just as loyally by the occupants of the Treasury benches, who are the recognised friends of middlemen. If a contract has been made for the sale of this butter, why is it necessary to pass the Bill? No explanation has been given why the producers' market should be restricted, and the fact must be emphasized that no restriction whatever should be placed on the disposal of their produce. It has been said that those engaged in dairy-farming work exceptionally long hours, and a harrowing picture was painted by the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Fleming) - of the heavy labour and privations suffered hy the dairy farmer and his wife and children. It is true that all producers on the land work long hours, whether engaged in general farming, dairying, or any other branch of agricultural work, and I admit that the wife and children of the dairy farmer work hard; but that is only an additional reason why they should receive the greatest possible reward for their produce. I oppose the Bill because it restricts the. field of operations in the sale of produce, because it is unnecessary, and because the general farmer does not believe in it . He realizes that during the last three years, in the overseas trade, be has not been fair l y treated by the Government and other so-called representatives of the primary producers. Representing, as I do, every section of the worker, whether dairy farmer., wheat farmer, or general manual worker, I am opposed to the measure, and intend to vote against it .",49
200,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Wimmera) [6.5] Some of the remarks made by members of the Opposition call for a reply. They have compared the butter agreement to other sales of primary produce during the war. There is an immense difference between the two classes of transactions, as I shall show by a detailed comparison. In the sale of the Australian wheat crop the growers were not consulted, particularly in the earlier part of the war. The original Wheat Board consisted of the Ministers of Agriculture for the four wheat-producing States with the Prime Minister as chairman. In addition there was an Advisory Board, comprising the well known agents and shipping firms of Darling and Co., Bell and Co., Dreyfus and Co., and Dalgety and Co. two bodies negotiated with the Imperial Government and made the contracts for the sale of the wheat; the rank and file had no say in the matter.  for representation and the 'Commonwealth' refused it .",50
201,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That is so. This butter transaction is on a different footing. The Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr 'Greene) endeavoured to organize the dairying industry on a co-operative basis, and he put before the organized dairymen what I regarded as a very good proposal. As, however, the.ischeme emanated from the Government, the dairymen were suspicious., and rejected it. The Minister then said, "" V e r y well, if you wish to conduct the business in your own way, do so."" Representatives of the industry assembled and appointed two of their number to go to England to negotiate the sale to the I m perial Government. W it h a perfectly free hand they made the agreement, copies .of which are .available, and the Government are now asked to give legislative endorsement to it . Mr Ryan. - Does the honourable member say that the B i ll will r at if y the agreement ?",50
202,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I do not say that it ratifies the agreement; the honourable member can read for himself what the Bil l does.,50
203,Mr GREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,At any rate it enables the Dairy Produce Pool to give legal effect to the agreement.,50
204,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Honourable members have asked why, if the dairymen have accepted the agreement, the Commonwealth Government, should be asked to give legal effect to it .",50
205,Mr RYAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,What legal effect the agreement has exists in itself.,50
206,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I shall not attempt to argue a question of law with the honourable member.,50
207,Mr RYAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Why is it necessary to give the Minister for Trade and Customs power to prohibit the export of butter? Mr STEWART. - I shall come to that point. I believe the honourable member stated that some middlemen attended the conference which accepted the agreement. That is perfectly true. Four middlemen were delegates. Another honourable member said he was fairly certain that the conference was not unanimously in favour Those of the acceptance of the agreement. That also is true, but the delegates who were suspicious of the agreement were the middlemen: they were the men who were not favourable to the acceptance of it .  said the opposite was the case.",50
208,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Then , perhaps, I have been misinformed.",50
209,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I think the honourable member is mixing up two things, as I shall show later.",50
210,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"When honourable members ask why this B i ll is necessary I refer them to something that happened in connection with the Australian Dried Eruits Association. The Association released for consumption in Australia a large q uantity of dried fruits - at prices less than could be obtained overseas. Middlemen and other speculators purchased as much as they could of this fruit, even going so far as to buy retail in small parcels, stored it up, shipped i overseas, and reaped a big profit.",50
211,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Honourable members opposite are advocating a lower price for butter in Australia. That would play into the hands of middlemen in the way the honourable member has indicated in connection with dried fruits; the middlemen would reap a profit to the detriment of the primary producer.,51
212,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Exactly . Honourable members opposite have prophesied that the. butter market overseas will rise. I admit frankly that the market may rise, and that the dairymen may then regret having made this agreement; but I still support the agreement, because the dairymen, having made the bargain, have asked us to give it legislative sanction. If , later, they regret the bargain, they will have only themselves to blame.  satisfy the dairyman, who does not know anything about the agreement.",51
213,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The dairyman who knows nothing about the agreement is not a co-operator.,51
214,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,There is no factory throughout Australia that was not asked to send representatives to the State Conference or the Central Conference.,51
215,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The whole point is that the representatives of the dairymen have asked for the assistance of Parliament in carrying out the agreement they have made. They wish to prohibit the export of butter within certain limits, because, if the price overseas does increase, the butter that should go into local consumption will be purchased by middlemen and sent overseas. In other words, there are amongst the primary producers certain men whom honourable members opposite would call "" scabs "" on their organization, and who will stick to this agreement so long as it is the more profitable arrangement, but immediately they think it more' profitable to abandon the agreement and "" scab "" on the rest of their fellow producers, they will do so.  whom we call "" scabs "" work for lower wages; those whom the honourable member calls "" scabs "" are those who will ask for higher prices.",51
216,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Tb e honourable member has answered his own argument. t In listening to the speeches from all sides of the House in championship of the cause of the primary producers, one cannot help wondering at the significant interest which is being displayed in the producers since they started to organize. A member of the Opposition remarked that the farmer was the backbone of the country. LABOUR MEMBERS - Hear , bear!",51
217,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I have beard it said that the farmer is the "" wishbone "" of the country, and that members of the Labour party are holding one end, and members of the Ministerial party the other, and both are tugging vigorously to get the bigger half.",51
218,Mr GABB,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Angas) [6.17] - I had some doubt as to the attitude I should adopt in regard to this Bill, but some remarks which have been made this afternoon have decided me as to my duty in the interests of the primary producersnot the men who own the butter factories, but those who do the actual hard work of dairy farming. One thing which has influenced me in coming to a decision is the remark made by the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene), to the effect that Mr Sandford, of Adelaide, was quite in favour of this agreement.",51
219,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I said that it was to the interest of Mr Sandford and those associated with him to get the biggest price possible for butter.,51
220,Mr GABB,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The Minister said that Mr Sandford .was in favour of this scheme.,51
221,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Pardo n me, I said nothing of the sort, and the honourable member must accept my denial.",51
222,Mr GABB,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I can believe my own ears. Then the honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) quoted Mr. Sandford as the representative of many of the primary producers of South Australia. A3 a South Australian I do not believe that 5 per cent, of the primary producers of that State will agree that Sandford and Company have proved themselves the friends of the farmers. Writers on poultry, whilst not daring mention the name of the firm, make it clear that the firm of Sandford and pany has held the egg market in its grip for many years to the detriment of the poultry raisers. While the honourable  was speaking the honourable menibar Indi (Mr Robert Cook) continually him whether he did not know that Mr Sandford owned a butter factory. It is true that he owns one of the biggest factheirs. tories in South Australia, and also that he manufactures one of the best brands of butter made in that State, but that does not constitute him a friend of primary producer. Even members of the Country party will not contend"" that agents for the sale of necessary machinery for the manufacture of butter are as a rule friends of the primary producer. Mr Sandford is the only man mentioned in the list which has been referred to whom I know anything, and I am absoThey lutely positive that he cannot be regarded as a fair representative of the man who looks after the cows m the State I come from . If I had found on the list the names of men whom I could mention settled on the Murray reclaimed swamps at Eudunda, Kapunda, Woodside, and the outlying districts around Two Wells, Mallala, Gawler, and such places, I should have some f a it h in the agreeallowed. ment as representing the views the primary producers, but, to tell me that Mr Sandford is satisfied with agreement is sufficient to warrant me refusing to support it . I have been cerned in my mind about the matter, cause outside the south-eastern district of South Australia, the electorate I reprethat sent, is one Of the principal butter producto ing districts in that State. Honourable members have spoken of the long hours worked by those engaged in the dairying industry. I know all about that. There are no men in the country more deserving of help and encouragement than are the market gardeners and dairyof men. No men do more work for the reposition turn they get, and we should do all that we possibly can for them. I am anxious that we should do the best that can be done for the dairymen of Australia. The object of the amendment is to insure the primary producers of Australia that their products sold overseas shall be at the world's parity. I agree with that, to and I believe that honourable members of the Country party also agree with it . I Comdo not accuse members of that party of being in favour of the middleman. They have far too much sense. But I do accuse Ministerial members of representing the middleman's party, because their election for campaigns are financed by middlemen. asked Members of the Country party know that . while the middleman is not a friend of the farmer, ha cannot well be a friend of In the circumstances, I am at. a loss to understand why they should object to the amendment. If they have some better proposal by which greater protecthe tion might be given to the interests of the dairy farmers, they should submit it . We have to consider whether there is any probability that the price of butter in the outside world will rise. I believe that the present price on the London market of Danish butter is 330s. per cwt. I haverecently been supplied with exof tracts fro m letters coming from Germany. were given to me to assist me m making representations to the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene), from whom the people who supplied me with the information are trying to obtain some relief. Those quotations show that v the price of butter in Germany today is tremendous, and so is the price of lard. Honourable members are aware that at the present time trading with Germany is not Still, the Government have of been humane enough to allow people in Australia to send 11-lbs. parcels to friends the in Germany who may be in need, and in there are very many of them so placed. conI n this way parcels of condensed milk behave been sent to Germany, and so great there is the need for mil k for children, although these parcels have been sent private persons, the German Government have taken possession of them, and do not permit adults in Germany to use the condensed milk. I mention that to show the great shortage of dairy products which there must be in Germany. What is true of Germany in this respect is true other parts of Europe. If this be the in Germany, it seems to me that so far from the price of butter being likely to go down, it is much more likely to increase. Believing this, I wish as far as possible to protect the interests of the to primary producers of the article here.",51
223,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member sold speaks as if the Government made this deal, whereas the primary . producers themselves made it .",52
224,Mr GABB,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I thank the honourable member for his interjection. A statement was made by him to the effect that fonr middlemen at the conference were opposed to the agreement. Then we had the statement which I have attributed to the Minister for Trade and Customs, but the statements do not agree. Of the thirteen names mentioned there is only one I know anything about, and I have said that that is the name of a - firm that is not representative of the primary producers. I am in the circumstances placed in such a position that I am inclined to question the contention that the agreement represents the views of the genuine primary producers. I have tried to assure myself on the point, and if I could have been absolutely certain that the Bill represents a legitimate request of the genuine primary producers, I should have been inclined to go with the honourable members of the Country party all the way.",53
225,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,We all honestly believe that.,53
226,Mr GABB,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Jus t as I am willin g to stand by the decision of a majority of unionists as to the price at which they will sell their labour, so,, i lutely assured that honourable members supporting the agreement really represent the views of the primary producers, I should feel bound to stand behind their request.",53
227,Sir JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The member knows that in no circumstances could he be persuaded to support a Government proposal.,53
228,Mr GABB,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I am not going to permit the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) to tell me what I know.,53
229,Unknown,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Sitting suspended from 6.S0 to 8 p.m.,53
230,Mr GABB,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"We should encourage the dairying industry because of its importance to the nation. If we stand by the amendment, which provides that the primary producer should obtain the world's parity for his exportable surplus, we shall do much to encourage the extension of the industry. I have here a statement by Mr A . H . Renard, author of ABO of Scientific Feeding, & c , which, since it deals with the importance of the industry to the nation, I desire to place on recordIt cannot be too often, or too strongly, phasized that the stability of the dairying industry is of absolutely paramount importance to the progress and prosperity of the Commonwealth. It is the greatest money-maker and distributer of ready money among primary industries. Its expansion on permanently successful lines is, without any exaggeration, a matter of national life or stagnation. Dairying is the master-key of all Australian industries, because, in the special circumstances, an abundantly large production of milk, enabling a large consumption at a moderate price, is the controlling influence on the physical and mental health, vigour and development of the Australian nation - Furthermore, this great industry holds the solution of the burning problem of the reduction in cost of living, because it produces milk, butter, and cheese, and powerfully assists in the economical production of beef and pork and bacon. .Finally, this single industry, being susceptible of immense expansion and intensive development, on safe and profitable lines, is fully capable of solving the vexed questions of the increase in population, closer settlement on the land, drift of rural population to the cities, and a huge export trade. I endorse all these statements, with the exception of that in which the writer speaks of the dairying industry as being the greatest of money-makers. My observation of those engaged in the dairying industry leads me to believe that, having regard to the labour they put into it , they do not receive the returns which can be secured in many other f I were abso- avenues of employment.",53
231,Sir JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,It is the hardest job in the world.,53
232,Mr GABB,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"For once, the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) and I are in agreehonorable ment-dairyin g is one of the hardest of jobs. Another reason why I desire that the primary producer shall obtain the world's parity for his exportable surplus is that in that event the home consumer could also be protected. Earlier in the debate, the Treasurer tried to make it appear that our party wished to "" have it coming and going""-that we desired that the .primary producer should obtain, the highest price for his produce, and that the consumer should get it at the cheapest rate. I have no such desire. The thought running in my mind is that if , in respect of the exportable surplus, we make it our duty as far as possible to obtain for those engaged in this industry the world's parity, we shall give encouragement to them to enter into the business extensively and scientifically. I do not tbink many honourable members will claim em- that, compared with some European peoples, and particularly the Danes, we have entered into the dairying industry as scientifically or as extensively as Ave might have done. B y obtaining for our dairy farmers the fullest return for their surplus production, we shall induce them to enter more extensively and scientifically into their industry. B y the adoption of more scientific methods, they will obtain greater results, and the Home consumers will thereby* benefit considerably. To emphasize this point, I shall make another quotation from Mr Kenard. The facts that the writer brings out are worth recording, and may give an impetus to those in the industry who have not given full consideration to the application of science to it . He saysDairying can be made a gilt-edged medium of - investment, and brought to almost an exact science by the use of scientific methods of the cows and the land. The profitable nature of the rational scientific feeding of land and stock has been proved beyond question. The average production of butter per cow in the Commonwealth is authoritatively given as 165 lbs. It should be, and can be, raised to 265 lbs. per cow within the next ten years. The Danish dairy farmer raised the average production of butter per cow from 175 lbs. to 200 lbs. in five years, and to 260 lbs. in ten years from the date of the commencement of the campaign for the adoption of scientific method into the feeding of Denmark herds. Who will say that the Australian cannot do better than the Dane when he puts his mind to it? In the earlier portion of my remarks I referred to the importance of this industry to the nation, and I should like for a moment to deal with a matter affecting the consumer. Only last week there was placed in my hands by a chemist a circular which he bad received setting out that that splendid article, lactogen, which has been retailed to the people of Australia at 6s. per t in, is now to cost 9s. per tin . In other words', there is to be an increase of 50 per cent, in the price. This is a very important matter, and I propose to ask the Government tomorrow whether they are prepared to subsidize those who produce lactogen so that without any loss to the primary producer its price may not be increased to the consumers. I hope the Government will be able to make some arrangement whereby the cost of this commodity, which is so necessary to the child of the mother who is unable to nourish it in the natural way will not be raised. The burden of the increase must press most heavily upon the poorer classes of the community. B y the employment of help in her home a wife, even in strenuous circumstances, can very often fulfil her full maternal duties. But the wif e of a working man, who cannot afford help - wh o has to attend to her own houses hold duties u n t i l almost the moment of her accouchement, and who, three or four weeks after her child is born, has again to do a fair share of the work of the bouse-need s special assistance in nourishing her offspring. It appears to me, therefore, that this increase in the price of lactogen will be an additional burden on the shoulders of those least able to bear it . I do not wish to take up the time of the House unduly, but during the course of the debate certain statements have been feeding made to which I desire to refer. The honourable member for Lilley (Mr Mackay), for instance, said that he noticed that great interest was "" n o w "" being taken in the farmers by honourable members of the Labour party. I am glad to have that admission from a member of the Liberal party ; but there was no occasion for the honourable member to use the word "" now,"" as for years past the Labour party has made it its duty to watch the interests of the primary producers, and to encourage their industries in every way. I also notice that the representatives of the Corner party made similar comments, and that the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr Gibson) used words to this effect:- "" A greater interest in the farmers is evident in the House on the Labour party's side than when I came here eighteen, months ago."" I desire to remind the honourable member who made the statement that,, during the past eighteen months, and since he first entered this Chamber, there has been a general election, the results of which clearly indicated that the members of the Labour party have always been active in assisting the primary producers, because five additional members from primary producers' districts have entered the Chamber as direct supporters of the Labour party.",53
233,Sir JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I should like to know,54
234,Mr GABB,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I have a very good idea that the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) is now seeking to interrupt me in an endeavour to defend the Corner party, and it - would appear that there is some foundation for the cartoon that was recentlythe published in the Bulletin.",54

255,Mr GREGORY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Dampier) [8.25] - 1I have no desire to delay the passage of this Bill , but I wish to refer briefly to the question of Government control. I am supporting the Bill with a good deal of misgiving, but I have no intention of supporting the amendment for reasons I shall give later. For some time. I have been extremely desirous of getting away from Avar conditions, and as conditions are now becoming normal, measures such as this should not be necessary. bably there should be some Government supervision in matters of this kind, but there appears to be a tendency on the part of certain Ministers to try to retain as long as possible some of those powers which were exercised under the War Precautions Act. It is generally recognized that the sooner we revert to normal conditions the better it will be, not only for the primary producers, but for the community generally. I intend to throw down the gauntlet to the Government in connection with propositions of this character, because there has been too much Government interference, with resultant heavy losses to the producers. I want them to understand that, unless definite requests are made by the producers for legislation of this character, they are acting in a manner that will place them in difficulties and jeopardize their position as occupants of the Treasury bench. My objection to the amendment moved by the honourable member for  while be seeks to giA'e the producers an open market for export produce, his party has never been inclined to do so in connection with produce sold within the CommonAvealth. I think it is generally admitted that the work of a dairy farmer is extremely arduous, as many of them have to work from daylight u n t i l dark for seven days a week. During a recent visit to the Colac district I was informed by dairy farmers that the cost of fodder and other requirements, as well as the increased cost of labour, Avas such that butter at the present price was not so profitable to handle ns when it was Is. 2d. and Is. 3d. a lb. We all know that there has been a decrease in our dairy herds, and that the butter production has fallen off considerably. During the last few years there has been a change in connection with the butter industry, nnd in such districts as Warrnambool very little butter is now being manufactured. In some of our principal dairying districts the milk is being sold to Nestle's factory for condensing and other purposes. When at Colac recently, I noticed that large quantities of milk Avere coming to the factories, and, instead of the skimmed milk being taken away for pig3, a large quantity Avas being used in making casein, and in the 'manufacture of Lactogen and other milk foods. UnProless we are prepared to pay a fair l y high price for butter, it is quite possible that those now engaged in the industrywill go out of it . Not one member opposite would answer the question, "" Should the producer .be given an open ancl free market in Australia?""' According to the Queensland neAvspapers, the price fixed for butter on 12th August last by the Government of that State was £ 2 2 8 a ton, although on that date £240 a ton was being given for it in New South Wales and Victoria. In other words, the Queensland producers were getting £ 1 2 per ton less for their butter than those of the other States.",56
256,Mr RYAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Do you say that that is the case now ?,56
257,Mr GREGORY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The price of butter has been increased in Queensland during the past few days to £238 per ton when put up in 56-lb. cases, and to £240 a ton Avhen put up in 28-lb. cases. The view I hold is that the producer, - Avhethe r of meat, wool, hides, butter, or any other produce-shoul d obtain on the home market the world's parity for his produce. He is the man who takes all the risk, and those who desire the prosperity of the country will insist that be gets the Avorld's parity by way of reward. Honourable members opposite give us no assurance that with a clear and open export market the producer would be able to obtain the world's parity for his butter here. We know that their in tention will be to fix the price of butter locally. For that reason a representative like myself could not hand over the control of this country's affairs to a party which would fix prices locally. When we put through a Bill providing for the Butter Pool, I was satisfied that the views of the producers had been fully represented, and that it was not merely a measure for giving Ministerial control. I would always -""refer to be without Ministerial interference; but it is necessary in this case to get into touch with the Imperial Government. I cannot understand why the High Commissioner in London, whose office costs us' over £60,000 a year, cannot supply us with good and solid in formation regarding markets .and other trade matters. If the New York office that it is proposed to open will do no better for us, we had better save our money by not opening it . A big change should be made in the London office. The Minister told us that he had cabled to London for certain information, and had received no reply. We should insist on getting the information that we need. We pay so' much for the upkeep of the High Commissioner's Office that we should expect from that office results which would assist in the building up of our industries.",56
258,Mr MAHONY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Will you move an amendment to bring that about?,57
259,Mr GREGORY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"When we come to the Estimates, I am prepared to take action.",57
260,Mr MAHONY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Any other time!,57
261,Mr GREGORY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I like to deal with things on the proper occasion. Had the honourable member a greater knowledge of the proper working of Parliament, he would realise that the time for discussing this matter is when the Estimates are before us. I do not know why the "" said agreement,"" which is referred to in the Bill , has not been added to it as a schedule. The butter producers desired an open market at Home, and sent representatives to England with the instruction to do the best they could to get it . Having failed, these representatives appear to have done the next best thing, with a view to obtaining a fair price for the butter exported. My desire is to keep our industry unhampered by Ministerial control. I have been told by persons connected with the dairying industry that when an endeavour was being made to arrange a price in connection with a. previous contract with the British Government, the butter producers of Victoria had their agent at Home, who was in consultation there with our Prime Minister (Mr Hughes). The latter cabled to Australia asking for a free hand, and saying that without i the could not carry on the negotiations. He got a free hand, and, according to what I have been told-and I have reason to believe that it is truehe fixed a price considerably lower than that which was given for butter from other countries. I cannot conceive that the Imperial Government would wish to give us worse terms than other countries; and after the great sacrifices we have made, we should insist upon receiving prices as good as, if not better than, those paid for commodities from other countries. But we cannot afford to lose the B ritish market, to which the greater part of our butter has been sent for more than a decade, and the butter producers having said that they are content with the price that has been agreed upon, we should support the measure which sanctions their agreement. As I have said, I do not desire Government interference in the fixing of prices, or in the making of contracts for the sale of our commodities abroad. 1S0 far as possible, business men should be allowed to manage their own affairs. Ministers have quite enough to do in carrying on the ordinary administration of their 'Departments, and, in m y opinion, should., as much as possible, keep their fingers off other people's business.",57
262,Mr RILEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"South Sydney) [8.40] The one object of the Bill is to control the exportation of butter. I understand that representatives of the farmers have entered into an agreement at Home for the sale of our butter there. If the Government was not consulted about that agreement, why has it brought in this Bill to sanction it? The honourable*member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) says that be does not desire Government interference or control, and I hope that the House will take him at his word by rejecting the Bill , and letting - this agreement stand on its merits. I hope, too, that the honourable member will give effect to his views by his vote. Are none but the producers of butter interested^ in this matter? If a body of unionists made an agreement with, say, the boot manufacturers, to charge a certain price for their labour, while the manufacturers were to put up the price of boots 100 per cent., would it be said that no one else was interested?",57
263,Dr EARLE PAGE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,This is an export matter. 'Our contention now is similar to that of the Opposition last week when the In d u s t r i al Peace Bill was before the House.,57
264,Mr RILEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Y o u are asking for the sanction of Parliament to an agreement made ""on behalf of the butter producers. But the British Government might sell our butter at a profit of 10s. or 15s. a cwt., and the object of the amendment is to secure in that case the. world's parity to* our producers.",57
265,Mr MABH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Suppos e that the world's parity falls.,58
266,Mr BAYLET,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Then the butter producers will be thankful for this agreement.,58
267,Mr EILEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I have heard my friends of the Corner party contend that the producers should get the London parity for their commodities. past they have been cheated of that, and have justly complained, and a strong farmers' party was sent into this House to look after their interests. I am afraid that that party is not doing so in this matter. Tbey say that an agreement has 'been entered into for the sale of our butter at 240s. a cwt. But it is not provided that, should the British Government sell that butter at a profit, the producers here must benefit. ""We ought to protect our own people. There is another party to this matter, the consumers of this country, wbo ought to be considered.",58
268,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,In what way?,58
269,Mr BILEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The people in the towns have helped to develop the country. The farmers depend on them for the supply of clothes, boots, implements, and other necessaries. It is the people generally who have borrowed large sums to build railways and open up the country, thus assisting development and making it possible for the farmer to live and send his produce to market.",58
270,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Does the honourable member deny that the farmers have paid their share of taxes?,58
271,Mr EILEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Of course they have;' but there are plenty of railways running, into the country which do not pay interest on capital cost.",58
272,Dr EARLE PAGE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The railways do not pay because they have been built for the benefit of the city man.,58
273,Mr EILEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"'Countr y railways are not paying, but city people have to .make good the losses. I have been astonished at the coolness of some honourable members, wbo say, "" Will you not give us the benefit of the world's parity for all our commodities?"" Can you imagine a country such as this, which over-produces, being compared with a country which, throughout several years of war, has been [152] surrounded and nearly cut off by enemy vessels? Here; in Australia, we cannot get rid of all our produce; jet some honourable members seek to* compare the Commonwealth with starving countries of the-' Old World. The idea behind the endorsement of this Bill by Parliament is to insure to producers, good prices oversea for their commodities. Once this Bill is passed, producers will send away all the butter possible, and up will go the price In the to local consumers.",58
274,Mr EGBERT COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Now you have let the cat out of the bag.,58
275,Mr EILEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Surely we should consider the consumer as well as the pro-ducer. I would not argue or protest against reasonable profits being secured' to the producer. The dairy farmer leads a life of drudgery, and should be well paid for his produce; but for this Parliament to inaugurate a ring to send out of Australia what it chooses to describe as a surplus, suggests several questions, amongst which is, ""Who shall say what is surplus?""",58
276,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,What advantage would there be for the primary producer to send too much butter overseas if he is receiving the same price in Australia?,58
277,Mr EILEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Bu the would not he receiving the same price. If this Bil l passes, only those who come into the agreement will be able to export butter, and these people will practically control export. Who are these controllers?",58

279,Mr EILEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Then we will take it bhat all these folk are interested in securing the best possible price for butter. If 5s. is the price in England these people will expect to get the same here; or they will say, "" England is the place to which to send our butter,"" and, naturally, they will send their produce there.",58
280,Mr HILL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,This Bill is designed to prevent that.,58
281,Mr EILEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Who will prevent it? .,58
282,Mr HILL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The Pool.,58
283,Mr EILEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It will be to the interests of the Pool to secure the highest price available abroad, and sell at that price as much as possible of our Australian butter overseas. The Pool will see to it that considerably more than what should be fairly regarded as surplus will be ported, and home consumers will not only be almost unable to buy butter, but will be required to pay a higher price than ever for such supplies as they can secure. Honourable members of the Country party say, "" This is an honourable agreement; let U3 honour it."" Do honourable members believe in honouring honourable agreeswallow ments?",58
284,Mr ROBERT COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,We do.,59

I hope the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene) will see to that, if this Bill is passed, the interests of consumers will not be lost sight of, while those of the producers are specially lionscrved. Are the butter producers only people to be considered? Tbey are a hard working honest body of men; but it is the manipulation of the middlemen that I fear.

The Minister (Mr Greene), in effect, threw the measure upon the table, and furnished no detailed explanation. He certainly know. made reference to an agreement. Honourable members examined the measure, and found that it all turned upon some agreeproposes ment. The Minister's whole explanation had to do with that agreement, which, however, not one honourable member had seen. It was not until the Opposition had determinedly demanded the producexport tion of that agreement that it came light.",59
289,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,But I told honourable members all that was in it.,59
290,Mr MAHONY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Las t evening we heard honourable members in the corner talking about this agreement, and when channel""'? they were asked if they had seen it, and exwhether they knew what was in it, they had to admit that they knew nothing of what it contained. I hope the Government will take to heart the lesson that, when they introduce measures, they should furnish all the information at their disposal, and not merely say to honourable members, "" Y o u will have to this, whether you like it or not.""",59

297,Mr MAHONY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It is time to protest. It is obvious that there is something behind this. The Minister is quibbling. the He says the Government are not in possession of any other agreement, but when I tax him squarely with a query concerning whether or not the two representatives at the other end of the world are in possession of some distinctive and separate agreement, he sidesteps the issue. No explanation is offered. It is time we bad a little more candour on informathe part of the Government.",59
298,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,It is time we bad a - little less suspicion on the part of the Opposition. I have told the House all I,59

While purporting to restrict export, it is, in actual fact, providing for export. So far as producers are concerned, it would appear that, unless they are prepared to through a particular channel, and to under certain circumstances and conditions as to price, marketing, and the like, not one ounce of their butter will go overseas.",59

301,Mr MAHONY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The particular channel provided for in the Bill . The agreement provides that the Minister must be satisfied that the butter is being exported by or with the consent of the Pool; in other words, only those who are parties to the agreement.will be allowed to export butter, and all the producers who do not consider that the agreement gives them an opportunity for expanding their industry will be debarred. The attitude of the Country party is a complete negation of their claim to represent the primary producers. We have heard those honourable members demanding time after time that the producer shall have the world's parity for his goods.",60

303,Mr MAHONY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"So he should for his exportable surplus, and we are prepared to give the butter producer, or any other primary producer, the world's parity for the exportable surplus; indeed, we shall insist on his obtaining it .",60
304,Mr ROBEBT COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Will you support a proposal to make the price of the exportable surplus 400s. per cwt., and give away the butter in Australia? A p parently, that is what yon are working for.",60
305,Mr MAHONY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That is not so; but the honourable member and his colleagues are working to rob the people of Australia of as much as possible, and we refuse to allow them to do so. We on this side propose to assist the legitimate primary producer to get the world's parity for his surplus.",60
306,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Where is extra money going to if the price rises?,60
307,Mr MAHONY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"If the world's parity rises to 250s., the producer, under this agreement, will reap no benefit from the increased price for his exportable surplus. How can the Country party claim to represent the primary producer when they agree to a measure which will prevent him from obtaining the world's parity?",60
308,Sir JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,It is a good union agreement.,60
309,Mr MAHONY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It may be; but I wish to know whether what we have before us is the whole of the agreement, or only part of it .",60
310,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I have said several times that it is the whole of the agreement.,60
311,Mr MAHONY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Thos e who pretend to represent the primary producers ought to flT've a Vtrle consideration to the trend of the world's affairs today. [152]- 2 whole of Europe, there is a great demand for butter and other of our primary products, and the tendency is for prices, not to come down, but to increase. Thi-? is because the war practically stopped primary production in European countries, and there is a serious shortage in other parts of the world. Cannot the so called representatives of the primary producers see the position into which they are leading those people? The moment this measure is passed, if the price' goes to 300s., the producers of Australia will not receive one penny more than is provided in the agreement. But this is merely a repetition of the manner in which the primary producers have been, treated right since the commencement of the war.",60
312,Sir JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The primary producers of Balmain!,60
313,Mr MAHONY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I am speaking, not merely as the representative of a particular district, but as a public man endeavouring to take an intelligent interest in public affairs. I want those honourable members who have so readily accepted the agreement to note that it provides that payment for the butter may be made "" at any date after the butter has been in cold storage at the port of shipment for fourteen days."" That means that the butter producers cannot be paid one penny before the lapse of fourteen days, and, further, in the absence of any fixed period, that they may be kept waiting for six months, or even twelve months, before receiving the payment. Can we believe that the primary producers will accept such a condition ?",60
314,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"If the honourable member understood the agreement, he would see that the producers will get their money every month in the way they have always got it .",60
315,Mr MAHONY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It is all very well for the Minister to make those remarks across the table, but all we have before us is the agreement and the Bill .",60
316,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The agreement enables us to pay the money every month.,60
317,Mr MAHONY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The agreement prevents any payment under fourteen days, and, as I have pointed out, in the absence of any fixed period, the producer may be kept waiting even twelve months without having any claim on the Government. Over the Mr MASSYGREENE - Yes , they have a claim.",60
318,Mr MAHONY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"If the Minister will point out in the agreement any clause compel the Pool or the Government to pay the money at any particular I will admit my error; but all I find in the agreement is what I have stated. However, I leave the point for the sogood called representatives of the ducers to meditate upon, and in the meantime the real facts will be placed before the producers themselves for consideration. Sir JOSEPH. COOK - Wit h big lines in the Worker, I suppose.",61
319,Mr MAHONY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The Worker is a very good newspaper which circulates extenknows sively amongst the primary producers of Australia.,61
320,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I am glad the honourable ment. member admits that he has been electioneering over this Bill.,61
321,Mr MAHONY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I have been doing nothing of the sort, and the Minister - has no right to make the suggestion. If the Minister means that we are endeavouring to displace this middleman's Government from the Treasury bench, then be is to right, and we shall take the first chance to do' so. Another provision in the agreement that the seller shall accept all risk on butter up to the time of shipment, except deterioration of quality due to length storage. That means that the whole of the risks of the butter being destroyed fire, flood, or any other disaster, must borne by the seller, who is the primary producer.",61
322,Mr CORSEB,NORTHERN TERRITORY,It is the only business way.,61
323,Mr MAHONY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It is not, because the meat contract with the Imperial Gothat, vernment, towards the end of the whole of the risks were accepted by that Government. Why are the members of the Country party not looking after interests of the people they claim to represent? Why cannot the buyers of their butter. Australia's primary products take these risks ?",61
324,Mr GIBSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Does the honourable memment ber think that it may be possible to the sale'of our primary products to other country under more advantageous terms than those which are embodied this agreement?,61
325,Mr MAHONY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Unquestionably , I do. I believe that within six montbs the passing of this Bill there will be such to an outcry from our primary producers that the honourable member will wish that period, he had never seen it. Mr GrnsoN - If that should happen the honourable member will occupy a very position, but where will be be if primary proprices should come down?",61
326,Mr MAHONY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Everybod y recognises that the whole trend of events is for their the price of commodities to rise. SirJOSEPH COOK - T.he honourable beadmember wants dear butter for the dockers. Mr .MAHONY - The Treasurer that I want nothing of the sort.,61
327,Sir JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Then there is no meaning in the honourable member's argu,61
328,Mr MAHONY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"There is a lot of meaning in my argument. The middlemen who have our primary producers in the bag are desirous of grabbing the profits which will be made out of butter on the other side of the world. Consequently, the primary producer will be compelled increase his price to the people of Australia. Under the agreement to which reference is made in the Bill, our butter is will be exported to the Old Country and the the producer will be bound to accept 240s. per cwt. for it . While be is receiving of that price butter will probably be realizing 300s. per cwt. in the London market. 1 by What will happen then ? The middlemen be will step in, corner all our butter, and re-sell it to the public of Great Britain and of other countries at a huge profit, thereby robbing the primary producer of the price to which he is entitled. If memi n bers of the Country party cannot see they are not fit representatives of the war, our primary producers.",61

331,Sir JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The honourable member has been arguing for a solid hour of in favour of dearer butter.,61
332,Mr MAHONY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I do not know that the primary producers of this country had an opportunity of approving this agreement.,62
333,Dr EARLE PAGE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Why does the honourable member think that?,62
334,Mr MAHONY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Because when I look down the list of the names of those who are to constitute this Dairy Produce Pool Committee I find there the names of middlemen and agents wbo have never produced an ounce of anything, except hide and impudence, in their lives. Sir JOSEPH: COOK - Does the honourable member thank that a politician should criticise other people's bides?",62
335,Mr MAHONY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"-The Treasurer, no doubt, speaks from a wealth of experience upon that matter. Mr Bascbe, for example, is an exporter and agent in Sydney. We know him to be one of the biggest middlemen in New South Wales today. Yet he is put forward as a representative of our primary producers. Then I should like to know who appointed the two delegates who have proceeded to Great Britain. Were the primary producers called upon to vote for their selection? Mr 'GIBSON - Yes , through their organizations.",62
336,Mr MAHONY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,'Was a ballot-paper supplied to each member of those organizations with the names of the candidates upon it? Certainly not.,62
337,Mr GREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The honourable member is quite wrong. Every one of these men was selected by ballot. - Mr MAHONY - Why did not the Minister say so when be introduced the measure? He would have obviated a good deal of hostile criticism bad he been candid upon the matter.,62
338,Mr IGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I told the House that every member of the Dairy Produce Pool Committee bad been selected by the primary producers themselves. Probably the honourable member was not in the chamber at the time. < Mr MAHONY - Oh , yes, I was. As the representative of a large industrial constituency, I bold that the interests of trade unions are wrapped up in the interests of our primary producers. too, are inextricably interwoven with the interests of our primary producers the interests of the workers in our cities. Only the aid of the latter makes it possible for our primary producers to export their surplus products. Without our seamen, our coal-miners, our dockers, and our shipbuilders it would not be possible for a single ounce of our primary products to be exported overseas. Consequently, we look to the primary producers to giye us a fair deal, and we will then see that they get a fair deal in return. Our interests are absolutely identical. The genuine primary producer needs to keep his eyes open lest be should find himself in the bag of the middleman. To my mind, the acceptance or otherwise of the agreement which has been entered into with the Imperial Government should rest with our primary producers themselves. When the Bill reaches Committee 1 intend to move an amendment to the effect that the measure shall not become operative until it has been referred to our primary producers for an expression of their opinion upon it. Certainly middlemen should - not be permitted to determine whether or not the proposed Dairy Produce Pool shall be established.",62
339,Mr CUNNINGHAM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Gwydir) [9.27]. - I listened with very great attention to the explanation given by the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene) when submitting this Bill for our consideration, and I was indeed surprised to learn, as he unfolded his statement, that the agreement is not embodied in it. The measure contains nothing which will enable an outsider 'to grasp what was the intention of Parliament in assenting to it. For some considerable time there has been a tendency on the part of the Government to keep not only members of this Parliament, but also the people of Australia, absolutely in the dark concerning transactions carried out by it, and with its authority.",62
340,Mr RYAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It has adopted a ""keepit-dark"" policy.",62
341,Mr CUNNINGHAM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"'Precisely . I wns under the impression that, with the conclusion of the war, these conditions would pass away, and that we should once more revert to the conditions which obtained in pre-war days, when everySo, thing was done in the most .open manner possible. In this measure there is nothing to indicate the amount of the expenditure to which the Commonwealth will be committed if Parliament assents to it . I think that we should be given that .information. The Minister stated that this Bill must be passed order that money may be paid over. Is there any honourable member who has faintest idea of the expenditure to which it will commit us? Possibly Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) may have that information, but, if so, he has ziers. not seen f it to enlighten Us upon matter. The Bill refers to an agreement which has not been embodied in it in the for m of a schedule. Evidently that ment has been forced upon the represenparty, tatives of the producers by the Imperial authorities. We have been told that our producers applied to the Imperial authoin rities for an open market in Great Britain , and that the Government of country refused to give it to them. Why? Is that the spirit of Empire? Are we House. to continue to be hewers of wood and drawers of water always, instead of partners in the Empire? It is an outparty. rage on the people of Australia that their representatives should be forced into agreement of this character. The people of Australia will have to take a deterdown. mined stand against a continuance of this policy. We have our debts to meet, and why should we be exploited by the vernment of Great Britain ? pleased to find our friends in the Corner party in agreement with us when we say that the primary producers are entitled to fair conditions. Nobody realizes that better than do honourable members on this agreement side of the House. My first' recollection of dairy farming is of milking, when I was four years of age. It is the represenunion. tatives of the middlemen on the Government benches who are responsible for many of the primary producers being in their present unfortunate position. This Bill provides for the prohibition of the export of butter. I Avell remember the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. Greene) prohibiting the export of rabbit skins during the war, thereby the trappers and graziers of hundreds thousands of pounds. He forced the plies into the hands of middlemen; trappers and graziers were compelled to sell their rabbit skins at low prices to manufacturers, who afterwards his consent to export at the world's parity. They knew .to a minute the embargo would be lifted, and were Mr Cunningham. able to buy in anticipation. They held has stocks much larger than were rei n quired for any purposes of manufacture, such as bat-making, in Australia, the and as soon as the embargo was lifted they exported their surplus, and made the hundreds of thousands of pounds out of the unfortunate wage-earners and graFrom past experience we know the that we cannot trust the Government; they are allied to the middlemen. The money of the middlemen is behind the National party, and it is regrettable that agreetbe members of the so-called Uouncry who were $ent into Parliament to put down this sort of thing, should, day after day, vote to keep the Government power. Read the pre-election speeches of honourable members of the so-called that Country party and contrast them with the attitude they«bave adopted in the",62

This is the first time that I of have heard that a member of the British supMedical Association is a primary prothe ducer.",63
346,Mr GIBSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"What has the honourable the member to say about the honourable memobtained ber for Yarra (Mr Tudor), when Minister for Trade and Customs, placing an emwhen bargo on the export of butter, although the price was down to Is. 3d. per lb. 1",63
347,Mr CUNNINGHAM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"What has that to do with this Bill? Honourable members are continually referring to the condition of affairs in Queensland. Can they tell why the Queensland Labour party, led by the present honourable member for. West Sydney (Mr. Ryan), has at successive elections annihilated the Liberal party and the middlemen who are represented on the Government side today ? The primary producers of Queensland registered their opinion of Labour government, and, after all, that is the best test. I am very sorry indeed that we should be asked to agree to a Bill introduced in such a haphazard fashion; - but I expect nothing business-like from the present Government. The Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) has had no business training, not one per cent, of the business men throughout Australia have any time for him as a manager or arranger of business deals. The haphazard method in which this Bil l is brought forward is only another evidence of the incapacity of the Prime Minister and those who keep him in power. There has been some reference to cable messages. I believe the honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) said something about a cable he bad up his sleeve, in which it is promised that the primary producers, of whom I am one,, shall receive some amount above the fixed price if the market rises. If the producer is to receive the full world's parity, why embody in the agreement a fixed price of 240s. per cwt.? I am very pleased that the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr. Stewart) supports us when he' states "" that in all probability within the next ,six months the primary producers will regret having made this agreement."" Is not such a statement from an honourable member on that side the strongest possible condemnation of the Bill ? The honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Austin Chapman) has by interjection given a clear indication - of what he thinks of the agreement. Then why persist with the Bill when honourable! members admit that there is likely to be serious trouble and loss in carrying out the agreement? I endorse the stand taken by orable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony) in regard to the interpretation of that clause of the agreement which says that the sellers "" shall accept all risks to the butter up to the time of shipment, except deterioration of quality due to length of storage."" Let honourable members be warned by our experience in working under a similar provision in connection with the wheat sales. Wfwere told that the wheat must be put into the Pool. As soon as we did that we lost control of it. So, too, when the butter goes into the Pool, the dairy farmers will lose control of it. It will.be under the management of officials, and whilst the producers can do nothing, they must bear all the losses. If I am to be liable for losses, I wish to control my produce. Is there a business man in the country who would agree to allow his goods to go out of his control whilst responsible for all risks and losses? . If there is such a man, he will not remain in business long. Many primary producers are in their present bad financial position because, unfortunately, they have listened to the glib tales of those who represent the middlemen on the Treasury bench; and they have not been able to enforce business deals from the Government that has persecuted them during the last four years. We have only to look at the result of Nationalist administration in New South Wales; the last elections are eloquent upon that point, and what is true of New South Wales will be true of other States as soon as the people have a chance of voting intelligently as to who shall represent them in Parliament. If there bad been in operation an electoral system which would have given the people a chance of registering an. intelligent vote",64
348,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NORTHERN TERRITORY, Order ! Tho honourable' member is going beyond the scope of the Bill.,64
349,Mr CUNNINGHAM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It is because the Government have not exercised business acumen in conserving the interests of the primary producers but have used the powers given to tbem during war time for the advantage of the middlemen, that honourable members who represent the producers, such as the honourable members for Calare (Mr Lavelle), Werriwa (Mr.  loney), Angas (Mr Gabb), and myself, desire a discontinuance of the Government's present arbitrary powers, and the withdrawal and recasting of this Bill in the terms of the amendment. We desire the primary producers to obtain the world's parity for their exportable surplus, so that the greatest possible amount of money may be coming into the country, instead of, as has been the case during the last four or five years, the interests the Australian producer being made subservient to the interests of the people of other countries, to the detriment of the whole of our people.",64
350,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Eden Monaro) [9.45] - I am in somewhat of a dilemma in connection with this Bill. I represent probably the biggest 'butter-producing district in New South Wales. It is certainly the district in which the bestbutter is produced, although the greatest quantity may not be produced there. This Bill is based upon an agreement .about which we knew nothing when the measure was introduced. Information concerning it has had to be extracted from the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene) as a dentist extracts a tooth. We are told now that there is an addendum to the agreement., I remember that while we were able to make an agreement with regard to the sale of our wool, We discovered, later on, that tremendous profits were made by its re-sale abroad, which should have been returned to our wool producers. It seems to me that we are almost bound to ratify this butter agreement; but I am rather afraid that the dairymen of this country will be placed in the same position as our wool growers were placed under the wool agreement. We have been led to believe that the agreement has been made by representatives of the dairy farmers of this country; but the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Cunningham), who is himself a primary producer and a dairy farmer, judging from his speech, had no knowledge of the making of this agreement. He expresses doubt as to whether it represents the views of the primary producers. I am satisfied that the honourable member believes what he has said, and speaks honestly in the interests of the producers of this country. We have been informed that the agreement was brought about 'by representatives of the dairy mers assembled in conference, and elected by the primary producers, and that the Bill is intended practically to ratify what they have done, and to compel the dairy farmers of Australia to keep the conditions of the agreement. If that be so, what are we to think of the remark that the agreement was practically made before the representatives of the primary of producers got to the Old Country? The Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. Greene) shakes his head, but that does not appear in Hansard; and I want some assurance to be recorded in Hansard that the agreement is one between the dairy farmers of Australia and the Food Controller in Great Britain.",65
351,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,That is so.,65
352,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"If that is so, how does the Minister account for the fact that a cable has been received to the effect that it is probable that a higher price than 240s. per cwt. will be paid for our butter?",65
353,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,No cable to that effect has - been received by the Government.,65
354,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"O r by anybody? MT . GREENE - O r by anybody, so far as I know, beyond this: That I believe that there are some negotiations going on at the present time in England between the representatives of the dairymen and the British Government as to an increase of price.",65
355,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,This House should know exactly what is being done.,65
356,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I have not that information in any official way. I have no official paper to show honourable members that that is the case. A ll I know is what has appeared in the press.,65
357,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I accept the Minister's statement, of course; but there is a member of the House who says that he has received such a cable.",65
358,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,He may have received a cable.,65
359,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I am satisfied, from what has been said, that the price obtained will be over 240s. per cwt.' I understand that the cable received says that it will be at least 250s. per cwt. If that is so, I want to know where the extra 10s. per cwt. is going. far- I do not want the dairy farmers to have to fight for it as the wool-growers have hacl to fight for the extra price received for their wool.",65
360,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I can tell the honourable member at once that if the British Government pay more than 240s. per cwt. for the butter every penny in advance of that price will go into the Dairy Produce Pool, and the committee controlling that Pool will in turn pay it to the producers of the butter - Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN - That Is  prevent that. Mr AUSTIN"" CHAPMAN"" - The Minister's statement satisfies me, but the House should have had that information before.  be done when the price is fixed by the agreement at 240a. per cwt.? Mr AUSTIN"" CHAPMAN"" - I have good reason to believe that although the price has been fixed at 240s. per cwt., there is an understanding equivalent to an agreement that the price paid will be more than 240s. It is a bad thing that the British Government should be accused of squeezing the primary producers of Australia as they have been accused in connection with the operations of the Wool Pool. That must create a feeling of unrest. No one can accuse me of not being absolutely loyal, of not standing by the Empire, or of not playing the game, but I am quite prepared to ask what right the British Government have to say to the producers of butter, wool, or wheat in Australia that because they have control of transport they will take from them some of their hard-earned profits. They are not entitled to do anything of the kind, and if we had business men conducting the arrangements it could not occur. That it has occurred must be the result - of bungling. If an extra price is paid, the farmers have a right to get that price, less the expense of placing the butter before the British consumer. I am glad to have the assurance of the Minister for Trade ancl Customs (Mr Greene) that the butter producers of Australia will get that price.",66
361,Mr MAHONY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Does not the honourable member see that if this Bill is passed that cannot be done?,66
362,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,That is not so.,66
363,Mr MAHONY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,It is. so. The Minister's word cannot override the provisions of an Act of this Parliament.,66
364,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The Bill has yet to go through Committee, and we can there provide that this shall be done. We have the assurance of the Minister, and, generally, that is good enough.",66
365,Mr MAHONY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I do not think so. my experience, at any rate. I am assured that the agreement was made by representatives of the dairymen, and in their interests. I accept the assurance of the Minister that the best price will be obtained. We all know Mr Sinclair, and know that he will do the best that he can for the dairymen. I am assured that whatever price is obtained, that price, less expenses, will go to the man who produces the butter, and that satisfies me. I regret that so much time has been taken up in debating the Bill, because information in the possession of some honourable members was not given to the House generally. We are not playing marbles, but are dealing with one of the great primary industries of Australia. The dairy farmers work late and early. They have no holidays, no furlough, and no overtime, and they are subjected to all sorts of innuendoes about the treatment of those they employ. We have had a reference to the treatment of dairymen's children, which is an infamous libel and slander iipon them. I can take the children in my district, aud in the district of Richmond, represented by the Minister for Trade and Customs, and the district represented by the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr. Cunningham), and compare them with some of the children of the city. That is the answer to such slanders. There are, no doubt, taskmasters in the country as well as in the cities, but .country children will compare more than favourably with city children, and they enjoy the advantage of God's pure air which is not enjoyed by the children of the cities. When we come to consider the Bill in Committee, we can make sure that the best price will be obtained for our butter, and will go to the primary producer. It is a practical certainty that the price will increase, because the price of everything is on the up grade. The consumer should be given consideration, as he has a pretty hard time as well as the producer. He can afford to pay higher prices because he is getting double wages. Getting more wages, he expects to have to pay higher prices. I have no desire to be captious concerning the Minister, but he did not treat honourable members well in introducing the Bill .",66
366,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I gave the House every scrap of information in my possession.,67
367,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Did the Minister not know about the cable that has been referred to?,67
368,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"No . what appeared in the press, and I could not treat that as official information in putting the Bill before the House. might have referred to it , but I had no official information, and that is why I did not mention the matter. I felt that a Minister dealing with a question of this sort should confine himself to what he can confirm by his official records. All that information I gave the House.",67
369,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I think it is a pity that the Minister did not take the House more f u l ly into his confidence, as the matter is one of vital consequence to an important section of the community and to a number of honourable members.",67
370,Mr LAZZARINI,NORTHERN TERRITORY,What will be the of an agreement fixing the price at 240s. per cwt. if the price is to be raised ?,67
371,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I presume that, as a representative of the primary producers has received a cable to the effect that a higher price will be given, that cable will be produced when we get into Committee, and we shall know what we are doing. I shall take a very different stand if it is not produced, because I have no desire to vote in the dark.",67
372,Mr LAZZARINI,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It is said that 250s. per cwt. may be given now, but the price might be 270s. six months hence.",67
373,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"We have an agreement entered into by representatives of the primary producers for a price of 240s. per cwt. We are given to understand that that is not to be the maximum price, and that, if any higher price is paid, the dairy farmer will get it . That is surely what honourable members opposite have been contending for.",67
374,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I can show honourable members when we get into Committee how the farmer must get every penny obtained for the butter. We do not handle it in any shape or form.,67
375,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"There should be some provision in the Bill which will make it quite certain that 240s. is not to be accepted as the maximum price, and that what will be paid will be the London parity.",67
376,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I shall be able to explain that.,67
377,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I am very glad to hear it . I do not wish to find fftult, because I have had trouble in explaining Bills myself. I intend to All I knew was support the second reading.",67
378,Mr MAHONY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,What about the amendment? Does that not provide for the I world's parity?,67
379,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I will take that hurdle when I come to it .,67
380,Mr MAHONY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The honourable member must take it now ,67
381,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,It seems to me that we are in a cleft stick. We must r at if y the agreement.,67
382,Mr LAVELLE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Why ? M.r. AUSTIN CHAPMAN - Because it was made by representatives of the primary producers, and we must assume that they are better able to look after use their interests than we are.",67
383,Mr LAVELLE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I do not think that it was made by representatives of the primary producers.,67
384,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"We have the assurance of the Minister for Trade and Customs, and we know that delegates were sent Home.",67
385,Mr RYAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,This Bill does not r at if y any agreement.,67
386,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"No ; but it enables the agreement to be kept. It does the very thing which the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Ryan) has stood so firmly for in order to avoid trouble and dissatisfaction where people have not been compelled to carry out something that has been arranged. The purpose of this Bill is to prevent persons who have done nothing to bring about the agreement securing an advantage over those who have agreed to it . I accept the Minister's ajsurances, and will vote for the second reading of the Bill , whilst I reserve to myself the right in Committee to see that those assurances shall be given effect. I take it that that is all that honourable members opposite are asking for.",67
387,Mr RYAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"West Sydney) [ 9 . 5 7 ] wish to say a few words in the amendment moved by the honourable  I congratulate him on the form of the amendment, which seems to admirably meet the difficulty that confronts honoris able members in view of the fragmentary way in which the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene) dealt with the question of the agreement that is alleged to have been made with the Food ConB trol authorities in England and reprethere sentatives of the dairying interests were sent Home. Th© amendment proof poses that the Bill should for the purpose of recasting and immediate re-introduction with suitable visions to insure that the butter producers of Australia shall be guaranteed a return for their exportable surplus butter at a price which shall not be less than the ""world's parity for butter during the period in which such exportable surplus is disposed of. A great many of the speeches delivered during the debate residerable mind me of the fact that some years ago when in Parliament I was quoting the speech of an honourable member delivered some years previously, he interjected, "" That is my speech, but how did I vote That is what is happening in ' t at the present time. We have listened to a number of speeches from members mum. in the Ministerial Corner proclaiming that they stand for the primary prothat price being the minimum. ducer, and are absolutely against any in terference by the Government, and their votes directly will show that they stand for giving the Government a control that has never hitherto been given to any vernment that has held office in Austratheir lia. They will give the Minister for Trade and Customs the power, not to prohibit the export of a particular commodity in the interests of Commonwealth, but to prohibit it , cept under certain^ conditions, to direct it into a certain channel. section 112 of the Customs Act , as stands, the Governor General has power by proclamation to prohibit the exportaapprove tion of any goods "" the exportation of which would in his opinion be harmful to the Commonwealth."" He has that, cable. amongst other powers, with regard to prohibiting the export of goods, under it various proclamations issued prohibiting exports in order to - I allow of a proper supply being retained support of ,for local consumption.",68
388,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,When ?,68
389,Mr RYAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member ought to know. Section 112 gives power to issue such a proclamation, but there no provision in the Act to enable the Minister to direct exports into some particular channel. That is what this Bill proposes to do. It does not r at if y any agreement. There is not one word in the ill which would have that effect, but is in it clauses which will give the who Minister power to prohibit the export butter, except with the approval of a be withdrawn certain committee.",68
390,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Is that not proratifyin g the agreement?,68

393,Mr RYAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"How can we r at if y an agreement when we do not know what that agreement is. I listened with coninterest to the honourable] member, because I know that he represents a constituency in which there are many dairy farmers.

I want to see that cable. I want to know from whom it comes, and to whom it is directed. We have had already too much the unbusiness-like management of the affairs exof the; country. We have had wretched alleged agreements with regard to the Under sale of wool and wheat, and we now have it the same vague kind of .thing brought before the - House, and are asked to of a measure, in the absence of any definite information. Surely the Minister (Mr Greene) has heard of this",68
396,Mr MATHEAVS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The Prime Minister and (Mr Hughes) can always get a cable have been when he wants one.,68
397,Mr RYAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I know that in that' respect the Prime Minister i]s an expert, but I do not *place the Minister for Trade and Customs on the same level. If some honourable member has received a cablegram, will he not be good enough to produce it for our information? Is it in the possession of some member of the Country party? Will the Country party be good enough to tell us from whom it comes? Later on, we shall be told about the cablegram, and a wrangle will take place as to the distribution of the money. Since the Minister is prepared to go so far as to tell us that there are some negotiations proceeding with the Imperial authorities with regard to a modification of the agreement, would it not be as well to stay his hand u n t i l the completion of those negotiations?",68
398,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"No , it would make no difference. The Bill will apply to the agreement, whether it is altered or not.",69
399,Mr RYAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I do not think it will make any difference, since the Bill has nothing whatever to do with the agreement. The word "" agreement,"" which appears in it , is only a piece of camoudoes flage. What this Bill is intended to do is to force the producers of butter to port their produce through a channel, whether they like it or not. It matters not what the agreement is. do not honourable members of the Corner party admit that that is so? simply a proposal to give the Minister power to prohibit the export of butter. During the course of the debate have heard some very cheap criticism the Labour party. Having regard suggestions that have been made with respect to the commandeering of butter Queensland while I held office as Premier of that State, I should like House that when the Queensland Government took control of the butter that was in cool storage there the Government it self exported it , sold it to Great Britain and handed back to the producers the surplus that was realized. The producers received some tens of thousands of pounds.",69
400,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The whole of the plus?,69
401,Mr RYAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The whole of it . They received some tens of thousands and I say without fear of contradiction that the butter which was then sold in London, by the Queensland Government, on behalf of the primary producers of that State, realized a higher price than that which was sold by the Commonwealth. ters. As a proof of the confidence of the p r i mary producers of Queensland in thatGovernment, and particularly of the confidence of the butter-producing districts, I may say that when, subsequent to that transaction, we faced the electors, in March, 1918, we increased our numbers. When I resigned the Premiership of Queensland the State Government was supported by a majority of the primary producing constituencies. It was supported by all the sugar-producing constituencies with one exception, and by a majority of the dairy farming districts. The honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Corser) knows that that is so. He knows, also, that my statement with regard to the export of butter by the Queensland Government is true. How is it that honourable members will deliberately make misstatements in regard to these matters? The honourable member for Robertson (Mr Fleming) said that some of his acquaintances ran away fromQueensland",69
402,Mr FLEMING,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The honourable member not say that that is a misstatement ?,69
403,Mr RYAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I ask the honourable memexber to give the names of his friends who certain ran away fro m Queensland.,69
404,Mr FLEMING,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I can give them to the Why honourable member privately. This is Mr Ryan - The honourable member, in view of the public statement made by him, ought to give them publicly. The we population of Queensland has increased of to the extent of 40,000 or 50,000 since to the Labour has held office there.",69
405,Mr FLEMING,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Did the honourable memi n ber expect these people to remain in Queensland when his Government took to remind the their meat from them?,69
406,Mr RYAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I am very glad that that interjection has been made, since I desire - to refer very briefly to the Labour party's , policy in respect of primary products for local consumption and the exportable surplus. The Labour party has always stood for giving the primary producer a fair surreturn for his products. They stand for giving him a price for his products that is based upon the cost of production plus of pounds, a reasonable profit.",69
407,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,How are you going to arrive at what is a fair return 1,69
408,Mr RYAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"J u s t as we arrive at what is a fair thing in respect to all other matThis is from the official policy declaration of the Labour party at the last Federal electionThe situation in Australia today demands broad, virile policy of development. tion must be increased. Our primary and secondary industries must be encouraged and placed upon a proper footing. In - this way only can Australia become great and self-contained and take her place among the nations of the world. We shall stimulate production, effect to this policy. and with that object in view we shall guarantee to the producer a return which will secure to him a price for his products that will cover the cost of production and allow a reasonable margin of profit. The Labour party has never stood for anything else. If the policy of the Federal Labour party were carried out as the State Labour party's policy is carried out in Queensland the primary producer would receive a better price for his products, and the consumer would get his products at a more reasonable rate. The honourable member for Robertson made an interjection with regard to meat. If the exporters of meat were given the full world's parity for the exportable surplus, then, even allowing for the price which was. paid to the meat - companies of Queensland for meat for local consumption, there would be a better return to the producers of meat, and the local consumers would be provided with meat at more' reasonable rates. I entirely agree with the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) that the High Commissioner's office should be used in the interests of the primary producers of Australia.",69
409,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NORTHERN TERRITORY, Order ! That matter is outside the amendment.,70
410,Mr RYAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I think I shall be. able to show you, sir, that it is not. amendment proposes that the Bill shall be withdrawn and its provisions recast, so that the primary producers shall not get less than the world's parity for their exportable surplus. I want to show the workability of that amendment. If the High Commissioner's office were used as it ought to be, this would become a really workable provision. I do not wish to refer to the matter except to show that the High Commissioner's office could be so used as to insure our primary producers receiving the world's parity for their exportable surpluses. This is no new idea so far as the Labour party is concerned. The Labour party has always expressed the same view. read to the House this further official (pronouncement on the part of the Labour party to the people of Australia - a proa nouncement made long beore the introProducduction of this Bill We shall take steps to provide oversea world markets for the sale of exportable surpluses. The machinery of the High Commissioner's office in London will be used for giving direct We shall extend our operations to other countries, including the United States of America. The functions of the Commonwealth Bank will be extended to provide for a liberal system of rural credits. That shows, whatever honourable members opposite may say, that we have a really practical, well-thought-out, business policy for the primary producers of this country, and not some mere haphazard proposal such as that now thrown on the table of the House, with the result that we find members of the Corner party trying to excuse their votes.",70
411,Sir JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"How does the honourable member reconcile the amendment, which provides that the butter producers shall obtain the world's parity for their exportable surplus-and , therefore, all the profit that can possibly be obtained-wit h the proposal in the Labour party's programme that they shall be allowed a reasonable profit? Mr Ryan"" - The right honourable gentleman could not have been listening attentively, because I have already pointed out that this party stands for the local consumer, in a country which produces large quantities of a staple commodity for the people, receiving the product at a reasonable price. I defined a reasonable price as one based on the cost of production, plus a reasonable profit, and stated that, in connection The with any exportable surplus, the producers are entitled to the world's parity. That is what this amendment - stands for , and that is the Labour policy as I administered it when Premier of Queensbind. I do not intend to delay the House any longer; but I trust honourable members will think very carefully before they cast their votes in opposition to the reasonable amendment moved and so ably explained by the honourable member for  will be done in adopting the amendment, and if our friends in the Ministerial Corner are really in favour of giving the producers the world's parity for their Let me exportable surplus, this is their opportunity to do it .",70

Mr Ryan"" - Perbap s I could do in six hours what the honourable member would take six months to do. If it is gentlemen of the calibre of the honourable member who has just interjected who have been making agreements of this character, I can quite understand the statement made by the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart) that the dairy farmers may yet regret the action that has been taken.

Question so resolved in the negative. Amendment negatived.",71
413,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [10.23] - It is. not my intention to delay the House for any time, as many of the matters to which reference has been made can befully dealt with when the Bill is in Committee. During the debate, the question has been frequently asked: What is the object of the Bill? There is an agreement, the general terms.of which I gave in my second-reading speech, although I did not read the whole document to the House. Three-fourths of the criticisms that have been directed against the measure have been more or less irrelevant, as they had nothing whatever to do with the Bill. I am at a loss to know what to say under the circumstances, because I presume that, notwithstanding the fact that 1 gave the House the whole of the information, we shall have the same repetition when the Bill 20 is in Committee, and I shall again be AYES. asked why it was necessary to introduce legislation on these lines. The Bill has been introduced, as I have already stated, because the direct representatives of the producers elected by their organizations in exactly the same way as union representatives are elected, decided the procedure that has been adopted. The representatives of the primary producers have agreed to sell to the British Government our exportable surplus of butter, but though they have sold it, they do not own it ; they have no legal title; and, as an arrangement has been entered into to sell the exportable surplus, NOES. there must be some means of controlling it after it is sold. The understanding at the conference, and which I have already mentioned to honourable members, was thpt it was for the representatives attending to say whether a contract should be entered into, and, if PAIRS. so, on what terms the surplus was to be handled. It was clearly stated that the Government did not want to have anything to do with the matter; but the representatives of the producers were informed that, if they decided to sell their surplus under a contract to be entered into, the Government would do whatever was necessary to support them.",71
414,Mr MAHONY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Would not the agreement be sufficient to do that?,71
415,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I have already shown that it would be impossible to have proper control, and to carry out the contract, without legislation similar to this. The dairy farmer, as every one knows, needs financing, and he usually requires his cheque monthly - The honourable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony) referred to the producers being kept waiting for twelve months for their money, hut that is absurd rubbish. The moment the butter comes under the control of the committee, and is made available for export, arrangements are made for the Commonwealth Bank to make an advance to the producer. He has not to wait even fourteen days. British Government which is allowed fourteen days' grace, and, if the money is not forthcoming within that time, under the terms of'the agreement interest at the rate of 6 per cent, is charged.",71
416,Mr MAHONY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Why did not the ister make that explanation before? Mr GREEN/E -^-I covered the whole ground, and it is more than likely that at the time. I was submitting the information to the House honourable members were not listening. When it was decided that at would be in the interests of the party to make a political flutter on this question, honourable members opposite endeavoured to do so, and took the opportunity of speaking to the electors instead of discussing the Bill . The honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr . Austin Chapman) raised the point as to what will be done with the additional money in the event of the agreement being modified. In such circumstances the British Government will pay the additional money to the Dair y Produce Pool Committee; and the Committee, knowing that the Government intend to pay an additional sum, will , instead of advancing 240s. per cwt., less actual storage charges, as is always done in handling butter for export, will advance up to 250s. per cwt. The Government, as such, will not handle sixpence of this money.",72
417,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,What is amount stated in the cable?,72
418,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I have not seen cable. All I know is what has appeared in the press, namely, that it is possible that the British Government may increase the price; beyond that I know' In any case, the Australian producer, because of the manner in which this transaction has been operated from the beginning, must get every penny that is received. The debate has made it obvious that what honourable members opposite desire, though not one of them had the courage to say so directly, is a low price for butter in Australia, and a big price for butter overseas.",72
419,Mr RILEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I say that.,72
420,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I am glad to hear one honourable member admit it . When I asked the honourable member for Hume  was not game to answer it . It did not It is the suit him to do so.  that it did not touch the question.,72
421,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Honourable members opposite want to have butter sold in Australia at the lowest price possible, but Min- do not care what the world pays for it . In an average year, three-fourths of our butter is consumed in Australia, and one-fourth is exported. ""Under these circumstances is it any wonder that neither the members of the Corner party nor those of the Nationalist party who' represent the primary producers will trust the Labour party in this matter ? Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In. Committee: Clause 1This Act may lie cited as the Butter Agreement Act 1920.",72
422,Mr MAHONY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Dalley) [10.34] - I move That the following words be added- "" and shall not become operative unless and until the said agreement and proposal to give the Governor General power to prohibit the exportation from the Commonwealth of the exportable surplus of butter has been referred to the butter producers for their expression of opinion thereon."" I want to take the earliest opportunity of having a vote recorded on this proposal.",72
423,The CHAIRMAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY," The amendment is not apthe plicable to the clause, which deals only with the short title of the Bill . I suggest the that the honourable member should embody his proposal in a new clause.",72
424,Mr MAHONY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Then it cannot be dealt with u n t i l the clauses of the Bill nothing. have been considered?,72
425,The CHAIRMAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That is so. Clause agreed to. Clause 2The Governor General may by proclamation prohibit the exportation from ' the Commonwealth of any butter produced in Australia on or after the first day of August, One thousand nine hundred and twenty and on or before the thirty-first day of March. One thousand nine hundred and twenty-one, unless the Minister for Trade and Customs is satisfied that the butter is being exported by or with the consent of the Commonwealth Dairy Produce Pool Committee constituted in accordance with the regulations.",72
426,Mr CHARLTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Hunter ) [10.36] This is the main clause of the Bill . ' provides that the Minister may prohibit the exportation of butter through any other channel than the Dairy Produce Pool. As I said on the second reading, while we are desirous that the producer meetings of the Pool. shall obtain a fair price - for the butter sold in Australia, we have to study the interests of the consumer, and to do suggest ? what is right between the parties. It is apparent that under the clause as i stands it would be possible to create local scarcity of butter. The Dairy Proattend duce Pool could regulate stocks, there was an abundant supply or not, by putting butter into cold storage, arranging for steamers to export it , so that there would he only a limited supply for the local market, and could thus make the price of butter to the Australian condoes sumer as high as that at which it is be sold in Great Britain.",73
427,Mr RYAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,It could make it higher.,73
428,Mr CHARLTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"At any rate, it might not be less.",73
429,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Is not that - in practice what the coal vendor does?,73
430,Mr CHARLTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"If the honourable member refers to the combination of proprietors, I have always said that that is wrong. While it is necessary to courage the exportation of our surplus products, we should prevent, manipulamember tion at the expense of the local consumer.",73
431,Mr GIBSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,How would you do that?,73
432,Mr CHARLTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I intend to move an amendment which would, I think, effect that. My only desire is to do justice agreement ? between the consumer and the producer. The producer should get a fair price his butter, and a better price than he has been getting in the past, because the cost of everything has gone up. He should be placed in as good a position as occupied prior to the war. But we permit an injustice to our own people i we allow supplies to be so regulated the Pool that the local price of butter can be increased. That the public may have confidence in the Pool, and know that its interests are being looked after, and so that if anything is wrong there may be a voice to bring it under, the notice of the public, I move That the following words be added:"" provided that the consumer shall have representation, on such Committee."" Why should there be any objection to the appointment of some person to look after It the interests of the consumers direct ? The Minister (Mr Greene) says he is prepared to look after the*? interests, but he has more than enough to do in his Department and cannot hope to attend the '",73
433,Dr EARLE PAGE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"How many reprealso sentatives does the honourable member Mr Charlton ; - I would be satist fied if we had one representative who a \vould have the right, as a member, to the meetings and see that fair play whether was given the consumer.  and member want the price regulated?",73
434,Mr CHARLTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,If this Bill is passed the price wil l be regulated. Mr »HILL - The honourable member not fear that the price for local conto sumption will be above the world's parity ? Mr Charlton ; - I am afraid it may be.,73
435,Mr HILL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,We want world's parity for home consumption.,73
436,Mr CHARLTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"If the public knew that they were directly represented on the Pool they would not worry about price. the They would know that they would get a fair deal,, while, at the same time, the enproducer was being rightly safe-guarded.",73
437,Mr HILL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Would the honourable be satisfied if the Government assured him that the price of butter for 1 home consumption would not be above London parity or the price which we would be obtaining overseas under this,73
438,Mr CHARLTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That involves the for very point which I am endeavouring to stress. I am try in g to show that, as an outcome of the passage of this Bill , the price of butter wil l be practically fixed he throughout Australia; and I am now shall asked by the honourable member for f Echuca (MrH ill ) if I would favour that. by I hold that if the producer can secure a return, adequate to compensate him, on the basis of the retail price of Is. 6d., then the consumer should not be forced to pay 2s.

440,Mr CHARLTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Undoubtedl y the dairy farmer has undergone a period of t r i a l ; and in New South Wales, probably, his troubles have been snore severely accentuated than in this State, chiefly owing i to drought conditions. But the drought did not affect the whole of New South Wales, and it should be remembered also' that there are periods of the year when the dairy farmer can produce butter in abundance.",74
441,Dr EARLE PAGE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,It will take the whole of this year to pick up last year's losses.,74
442,Mr CHARLTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I am not advocaI ting that fair compensation should be given the producer; but there are interests also to be considered. as compensation is concerned, I would favour the Bill being so framed as to provide for the compensation of those who sr.ay suffer loss through drought and kindred causes. If lish a co-operative concern it should provide means by which the Pool could pensate those who suffer loss owing adverse seasonal conditions. At present, however, I desire first to insure protection for the consumer.  L10.48] - The amendment should commend itself to honourable miembers.",74

The alliance which the Government seeks to bring about by way of the agreement, and at j which the so-called Country party conunderstand nives, is an unnatural alliance between the producer and the middleman.",74
444,Mr HILL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The honourable member knows that that is not right. [153]  right. I feel inclined to ask the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) to agree to the addition of words to his amendment to provide for the elimination of the middleman. I repudiate the statement of the Minister (Mr Greene) that the Labour party stands for high price* overseas and low prices here. ' The Treasurer himself has repeated that statement.,74
445,Sir JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Many of your own side to-night have said so.  not so; but, whether it be said from this or the other side, it only shows that those who say it do not understand the Labour platform. No amount of quibbling by the Treasurer or the Minister can alter the terms of our manifesto, which I hold in my hand, and which is the final word on the matter. am quite sure that the Treasurer and not the Minister for Trade and Customs, other when they arc in the back country, alSo far ways misrepresent what we stand for, but here Ave cannot alloAV them to do so.",74

Mr MASSYGREENE ' (Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [10.57] - I do not propose to accept the amendment, and for a very simple reason. There are now on the committee three direct representatives of .the consumer. One is Mr. Hugh Sinclair, and he is a good representative of the consumer.",75

Then there is the Commonwealth Dairy Expert, Mr O'Callaghan, a perfectly unbiased man, who has orders that if I am not present at a meeting of the committee hie must be. If there is anything he considers it necessary to bring under, my attention, in the interest of the public, he has orders to do so.",76

464,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The committee discuss intimate trading matters, which require a good deal of training to understand.",76
465,Mr CHARLTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Is not any sane man capable of discussing the question of ing butter in cool storage?,76
466,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I come now to the question of storing butter. This is one of the most difficult questions which has to be dealt with. Its settlement requires a most intimate knowledge of the trade and a very complete survey of the position in the country, so that, unless a man has had a lifelong experience of the business, be does not know when he should start to store. Even then the best judges sometimes go wrong. Let me give the Committee just two instances of what I mean. The year before last, the committee decided that it was desirable to start storing operations very early. Consequently, they stored a lot of butter; but of the 30,000 odd cases which were stored in Victoria it was not found necessary to use one. We had a surplus of butter that year in this State. There is such a tremendous difference between the seasons that it is a most difficult thing to determine when the storing of butter should be commenced. It is the one thing above all others that the man in the street cannot give any information about.",76
467,Mr CHARLTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Does the Minister say that when there is an abundant supply of butter, and the man in the street is present at the meetings of the committee, and hears it making arrangements for storing that commodity, he has not sufficient intelligence to know whether the adoption of that course is right or wrong?",76
468,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Nobod y can tell what the season is going to be. To-day we may have an abundant supply of butter. But does the honourable member suggest that he can tell exactly the period when we should start to store it ? Butter deteriorates with storage, no matter whai the conditions of that storage, may be. If we store butter for six months before we require to use it",76
469,Mr CHARLTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Unde r this agreed ment, would the suppliers lose by the adoption of that course?",76
470,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Unquestionably, . they would. . .",76
471,Mr CHARLTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I do not think so.; ',76
472,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I have no desire to . occupy 'time 'unnecessarily. But let m* explain why the producer would los» whilst the consumer would not gain anyr thing. The price of butter' depends upon stor- its quality. The butter may be put in cold storage at 92 points. If it is stored at less than that there is not the faintest chance of it coming out in the best posr,' sible condition. But, instead of it coming out at 90 points, it would probably come out at 84. We should theri have to put that butter into the Imperial Pool, and, instead, of getting for it '2s'. rriore than the 240s. per /cwt., which is set out in the agreement, we should get 6s. less. The butter Would be of such low grade that it would be idle to put it upon the local market.' What is more, the six months' storage would make such a tremendous addition to the price of it that the consumer would not benefit in the slightest degree, because interest would have to be paid upon the butter for six months, plus the storage charges. That means that it would require to command such a price that the consumer would not look at it. Now the aim of the men who are associated with the. butter industry of this country is not to embarrass their owa business. It is to their interest to see that local requirements are fully met. After a close association with this trade, - extending over a number of years, I say that the one thing to which co-operative societies have devoted more attention than any other is the arrangement of their storage in such a way as to Insure that they will have a sufficient supply of butter during the winter months to meet the' demands of their consumers. It does not suit them to run out of butter. They do not want the proprietary men to come in with stored butter and thus to secure their customers during the winter months. As the co-operative interests upon this Pool more than counterbalance the proprietary interests upon it , I am satisfied that it will follow the policy which has been followed for years by insuring that the consumer shall be fully protected.",76
473,Mr RILEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,South Sydney) TU-?] We have heard a good deal from the honourable member for Wilmot (Mr Atkinson) in regard to an agreement,77
474,Mr ATKINSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member did not hear, because he would not listen.",77
475,Sir JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,We have heard a good deal about cheap bread and cheap butter.,77
476,Mr RILEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Is the Treasurer against cheap bread and cheap butter? Nobody disputes the statement which has been ""made by the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene). But surely the Government can appoint a man of sufficient ability to look after the interests the consumer.",77
477,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,We have appointed Mr. Hugh Sinclair.,77
478,Mr RILEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,He is a man who is interested in the butter trade. How can he be an independent man?,77
479,Mr BAYLEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,We have to go to the trade to secure a man who possesses the requisite qualifications.,77
480,Mr RILEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I know that the Minister for Trade and Customs has not time to watch over the export of butter. Why, then, do not the Government appoint qualified man to 'look after the interests of the public?",77
481,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,We cannot get a better man for that purpose than Mr O'Calmember laghan.,77
482,Mr RILEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"He is only one member of the committee. He is not there to port upon the export of butter. He is there in the capacity of an expert upon the quality of butter. He is a most capable man. But we require upon the committee a representative of the consumer. No doubt there has been a lot of grumbling at various times about the price of butter in Australia. Sometimes when there has been an alleged scarcity of that commodity in Sydney the secretary of the cold storage depot there has informed me that the place was full of butter. Of course, the object of creating an artificial scarcity is to put up the price. Under this agreement no man will be able to sell butter for export, except through the Pool.",77
483,Sir JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member read in the press today that a minimum price is asked for coal, and a minimum wage for the worker; why should not the farmer also get a minimum wage?",77
484,Mr RILEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I do not say that he should not, but there is a danger of gambling in butter.",77
485,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Every time there has been a rise in the price since the Pool has taken control the Pool has known the whereabouts of every box of butter, and has always levied on the holders the additional price, and placed the money in the Pool. .",77
486,Mr RILEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"If the Minister knows where every box of butter is, and there is more butter in Queensland than c i r be consumed in that State, why is New of South Wales short of butter?",77
487,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Federa l control ceased and the price rose to 240s. for export. The New South Wales Government would not increase the price for local consumption, and no butter was sent from Queensland.",77
488,Mr RILEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Unde r this arrangement will the Government have control of local consumption ?,77
489,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,No .,77
490,Mr RILEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Then the Pool Committee will be able to export all the butter a they choose, and there is no power in this Bill to compel them to retain sufficient for local requirements?  like to have representatives of the publ'c on the labour tribunals?",77
491,Mr RILEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"On those Tribunals relabour and capital are represented, and the judge is an impartial person, who decides between the parties, and thereby represents the interests of the public. Under this arrangement, however, the - judges are to be the butter producers. It is a one-sided arrangement, and the Government would do well to appoint a man to look after the interests of the Government and the consumer, and prevent the country being depleted of butter supplies in order to get high prices abroad.",77
492,Mr ATKINSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"How could the sentatives of the public sway the committee to do this or that, when it will have the control of all the butter supplies 'I",78
493,Mr RILEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"We know that the average weekly consumption of butter, is J-lh. per head of the population. We are, therefore, able to calculate how much butter is required per week, and it would be easy to keeD a supply for local consumption by means of cold storage ",78
494,Mr ATKINSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,But the cannot be made to supply the butter if they are-not willing to do so.,78
495,Mr RILEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The time has arrived for preventing any combination from manipulating the food supplies of the people. The amendment is fair and reasonable; it will improve the Bill , and give confidence to the public.",78
496,Mr RYAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"West Sydney) [11.15] - I support the amendment, and I am surprised that the Minister (Mr Greene) does not see the reasonableness of it . It is obvious that its purpose is to secure that the consumer sball be represented on the Pool. The Minister, when speaking on the second reading, referred to Mr . Sinclair as having one to London as one of the delegates to represent the producers. Now he tells us that the same gentleman is to represent the consumers. It is difficult to know where the Minister stands. The Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) accused honourable members on this side of advocating low and cheap prices for the consumer. I do not like those terms, and, after all, it is by the use of misleading terms that a good deal of propaganda against the policy of the Labour party is carried on. As a student, I was taught that one should speak not only to be understood, but so that he cannot be misunderstood. I can quite understand what an honourable member, speaking from this side of the House, means when he refers to low prices, and what a Ministerial member means when he uses the same term. It is a term that can be understood, but it can also be misunderstood, or if it is not misunderstood, it can ,be misrepresented. The policy of the Labour party is founded upon the emancipation of human labour from all kinds of exploitation. If the producer has to sell his commodity at less than the cost of production, his labour repreis being exploited. No member' on thi9 side of the House advocates that. We stand for reasonable prices, meaning thereby prices which will give the producer a reasonable return for his labour.",78

I want to say briefly that my impression is that the man who actually works on dairy far m has not been consulted matter. Other people have manipulated things in such a way that they have acted the delegates? as delegates and decided the terms of the agreement In order to make it absolutely certain that the primary producers themselves approve of the agreement and of Australia. the Bill it is necessary that such a as I have moved should be inserted.",79
500,Mr LAVELLE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Calare) [11.27] - I have much pleasure in seconding and supporting the very reasonable amendbeen ment proposed by the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony). I think that every member of the Committee is bound to support it . Honourable members should producers throughout the States. realise the necessity of giving the prohave ducers an effective voice in this matter. It has been said that the representatives co-operative butter factories. [REPRESENTATIVES.] Agreement Bill. PAIRS. of the primary producers agreed to this course of action, but I maintain that that is not the case. I know that there are two so-called farmers' organizations in Australia-the Primary Producers Union, which represents a very small section of the farmers, and the Farmers and Settlers Association, which represents a very small section of the farmers, a fairly large section of graziers, and a very large section of commission agents. I know, also, that 95 per cent, of the farmers of Australia do not belong to either of these organizations. That being so, no man can honestly say that the primary producers were represented at the conferences composed of delegates from either of the organizations referred to. In order to get the views of the men most concerned, we should ,do out what was done in connection with the Wool Pool and the Wheat Pool. . We should take a referendum, asking the butter producers to vote upon the agreement. If they uphold it there can be no cavil against it , but if they determine to turn the proposal down and to have nothing to do with this Bill , as I feel sure they will, the only thing to be done will be to drop the measure, and so prevent the robbery of the butter producers, which feel sure will occur if it becomes law.",79
501,Mr ROBERT COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Indi ) [11.29] unI rise to oppose the amendment. For the and propast nine months we have had meeting power after meeting on this question, and conComferences have been held throughout the length and breadth of Australia.

We had two or three such conferences here in the Melbourne, and delegates were selected in this to represent the butter producers. ",79
502,Mr ROBERT COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The co-operative companies, which have associated with them the whole of the butter producers Those who are not in the clause co-operative companies are in the proprietary companies, and they made their selection.

It has the backing of all honest, legitimate butter We in Victoria an association, of which I am chairman, controlling eighty-three We have a council cf thirteen members the whole of whom, with one exception, unanimously favoured the scheme. We are acting in concert with the producers in the other States. offensive. I want to make it abundantly clear that this measure is not being rushed through in the interests cf a few proprietary people in the industry. Honourable members of the Labour party have indulged in a lot of tomfoolery which will appearin Hansard. They wish to lead the public to believe that we have been the lambs of the proprietary people, and that members of the Country party have no knowledge of the butter industry. Before the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Ryan) could address the House on this question he had to make interjections and inquiries all round. He obtained information from the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart) and others, and then proceeded to make a magnificent speech concerning something of which he really knew nothing.. That is characteristic of honourable members opposite. I aim familiar with every der tail of the dairying industry, and I am certain that with the exception of the honourable member for Hunter (Mr. Charlton) not one member of the Opposition has truly spoken his mind.  point of order. The honourable member for Indi (Mr Robert Cook) has practically accused every honourable member of this party of lying.

503,The CHAIRMAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY, What I understood the honourable member to say was that not one honourable member of the Opposition who had dealt with this measure had truly spoken his mind. I do not take that to be a reflection.,80
504,Mr MAHONY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I consider that it is a most serious reflection on the Opposition.,80

When he has been long enough here, he may - acquire some manners; at present he is devoid of them. I deny Ids statement that the contents of 'the agreement are known to the primary producers at large. Even if that were so, he would not be justified in voting against the proposed new clause. The electors of Indi will have to be told that he has slipped to a very great extent since he entered Parliament. If everything that he s^id were true, it would not afford him the excuse for which he is seeking to vote against the proposed new clause. Those associated with. him were loud in their clamour for the representation of the primary producers on the Wheat and Wool Pools. Yet now that the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony) has moved for the insertion of a new clause, which will give the dairy farmers full representation on the Dairy Produce Pool, this gentleman, who says that he was sent here to represent the primary producers, quibbles, and makes every excuse for voting against it. Those who understand the requirements of the primary producers cannot cavil at the clause, which I trust will be carried. The rank and file of the dairy farmers, through no fault of their own, know no more about this agreement than did the small wool-growers about the contract for the sale of our wool, for which the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) tried to shift his responsibility on to the shoulders of the ex-Treasurer (Mr Watt).",82
542,The CHAIRMAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The honourable member is going beyond the clause.  out of order ? I can only account for your ruling by the lateness of the hour.,83
543,The CHAIRMAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I ask the honourable gentleman to withdraw that remark, and to apologize to the Committee for having made it.  not think it any wonder, because of the lateness of the hour, that any of us might be affected. I withdraw the remark so far as it applies to every one, including the Chairman. Those on this side have always stood for giving full and ample representation to the primary producers on all Pools dealing with the disposal of their produce. I hone that every honourable member 'will avail himself of the opportunity to discuss the amendment. I do not object to the action of the honourable member for Indi in discussing it ; I only take exception to his insulting remark. I do not take exception to his showing where he-really stands. The honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Ryan) has just - mentioned; by way of - interjection-and I quite agree with him-that this Bill affords an example of how the Government pools the primary producers. It is in order to see that the primary producer shall not be pooled that honourable members on this side are seeking the insertion of a clause which will provide some measure of protection to dairy farmers. Of course, it - is too much to expect the votes of honourable members of the so-called Country party; but, personally, I prefer their seats to their votes.",83

547,Mr LAZZARINI,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That is both absurd and irrelevant. Here, the Government proposes to take away a product from its producer, and to say what price he shall receive for the greater part of it, but without giving him an opportunity to say whether or not he agrees. If the principle of first consulting the parties chiefly concerned had been adopted in respect of other Pools of Australia's primary products there would have been avoided confusion and' chaos resulting in loss to the people of Australia. Honourable members on this side deny that the producers have been consulted at all. The name of a Mr Sinclair has been mentioned as that of a representative of the ' primary - producer;"" but' honourable members have also been told that he has now volunteered as a representative of the consumer. He must be a very adaptable individual 1 This whole scheme was i augurated at a conference some of members of which have had practically nothing to do with primary production, more than half of ' the m being; in middlemen. 1I have no doubt that we shall find storekeepers, bank managers, and others of that class as members organizations' supposed to be representalarge tive of the primary producer.
