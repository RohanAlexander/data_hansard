3,Mr COOK,Unknown,"Has the attention of the Prime Minister been directed to the press reports of the remarks of Sir Henry Cowan on migration, also the remarks quoted in the Melbourne Age of yesterday, by Mrs Robert Lindsay, daughter of the late Sir W. J. Clarke, who has settled on an estate near Perth. She is reported as having said:' It appears that we do not want migrants. When in London last month ten Fife farmers of a community that had never recorded au insolvent, applied for passages and land in Australia, only stipulating that they should be settled together. The reply was that they must take what they could get, and a part of the best type of farmers possible was lost to the Commonwealth. I should like to know the opinion of the right honourable gentleman on the subject?",14
4,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"I cannot express opinions when replying to questions. My attention was drawn to the report of the remarks of Sir Robert Cowan, but. it was quite impossible to learn from it exactly what Sir Robert Cowan was endeavouring to say. I have not seen the report of a statement by Mrs Lindsay; but every possible step is being taken to have brought to Australia suitable m i grants whs desire to come here. It must be remembered, however, that migrants come here only under the requisition or nomination system, and consequently the Commonwealth Government can do nothing beyond f ill in g the requisitions or Littleton nominations of the States. NEW GUINEA. TAXATION OK SALES OV GOLD.",14
5,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Is it a fact that the Commissioner of Federal Taxation has ruled that the whole of the gross proceeds of gold from New Guinea gold fields, sold in Australia, is to be considered as profit and liable to taxation?",14
6,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"The ruling of the taxation commissioner is that the tax should be calculated upon the total proceeds receivable by the persons in New Guinea from sales of their gold in Australia. This means the amount payable to them after deduction of all expenses incurred in Australia in connection with the handling, refining and sale of the gold. CANBERRA.

10,Mr THEODORE,AUSTRALIAN OOMMONWEALTH,"Is it the intention of the Commonwealth Government to despatch HMAS. Melbourne overseas to be.dismantled and broken up? Could not this work be done in Australia, and' Would it not be desirable to invite tenders for the disposal of the vessel after being; dismantled ?",15
11,Mr BRUCE,AUSTRALIAN OOMMONWEALTH,"Some little time ago, a very full statement was made in connection Will the matter. It is proposed to send HMAS. Melbourne to Great Britain to be broken up. That is very much more economical than to haAe they r Avork done here, as it Avill be necessaryto send ratings to Britain to bring out our new cruisers. Those ratings will go on the HMAS. Melbourne, and will area gain useful experience 'during the voyage, PERSONAL EXPLANATION"".",15
12,Mr JACKSON,AUSTRALIAN OOMMONWEALTH,"Speakin g last evening on the second reading of the Electoral Bill, I referred to a statement that I said had been made by the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr. Hughes) Avhen he was Prime Minister, during the general election of 1917. I said that he had promised when in Laun-ceston to bring about proportional representation. I took the trouble this morning to look up one of the local newspaperreports of the time, and I shall read twoshort extracts from it. In the report of the right honourable gentleman's speech,, published in the Launceston Examiner of the 21st April, 1917, appears the f o l lowing passage:I have a statement to make. Mr Goodluckwho was the fourth Senate candidate in. the National interestasked me whether I was in favour of preferential voting. I said I was (applause).. ""Well,"" he said, "" If you are in favour of preferential voting, and will Bay so to-night,. I will withdraw my candidature. (Great applause ). FolloAving upon that, the editor of the Examiner published with respect to the matter, a sub-leader in which the f o llowing sentence appeared:The candidate had received an assurancefrom the Prime Minister that if returned he would introduce an amended Electoral Bin embodying the main features of theTasmanian system, by which the choice of the electors would be broadened, and there will be no necessity for limiting the number of candidates. Whatever may have been the riglit honourable gentleman's intention in the matter, the people of Tasmania clearly thought that they were to have proportional representation in the Senate. As I said last night, I do not wish to do him an injustice, and, therefore, have made this statement.",15
13,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIAN OOMMONWEALTH,"I am not quite clear, :'from what the honourable member for Bass has said, whether he thinks there was justification for the statement he made last evening; but on the merits of --the case as set out by the honourable ber, quire apart from the facts, there is no justification whatever for the assertion that Mr Good luck would have persisted in his candidature had I not promised to introduce proportional representation. There is no evidence of any such promise. Apparently, when asked whether I was in favour of preferential voting, I said that I was; but no relation, causal or otherwise, exists between preferential and portional voting. From what I remember of the circumstances, Mr Good luck had not one chance in 155 of being returned, and lie seized a convenient opportunity to back out. NA AUSTRALIA.",16
14,Mr LACEY,UNEMPLOYMENT IN SOUTH,"Notwithstandin g - the fact that there is already much unemand ployment in South Australia, an addiattempt tional 2,000 men are to be dismissed the Railway Department. Will the Government place as much Commonwealth work as possible in operation in South Australia without delay with a view to alleviating the unemployment problem in that State?",16
15,Mr BRUCE,UNEMPLOYMENT IN SOUTH,"Whenever , through any make? local circumstance, a period of unemployment occurs in a State, the Commonwealth endeavours to relieve it by pushing on with Commonwealth works that have been authorized in that State. The stance of the kind was, I think, furnished when certain representations were made by the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Yates) regarding Commonwealth works in that city. I can assure the honourable member for Grey that that policy will be pursued in the present case, if unemployment is acute. ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH. DR. TILYARD'S VISIT.",16
16,Mr RODGERS,UNEMPLOYMENT IN SOUTH,"In view of the investigations, interesting and valuable though necessarily cursory because of limitation of time, now being carried out by Dr Tilyard, the eminent New Zealand entomologist, will the Prime Minister ask the New Zealand Government to extend the visit to Australia of this great scientist to enable action to be taken in concert by the Commonwealth and State Governments for the establishment of mem- definite research plans?",16
17,Mr BRUCE,UNEMPLOYMENT IN SOUTH,"Step s are already being taken to utilize to the maximum, the services that Dr Tilyard is prepared to render. TROUBLE INTHE SOLOMONS.

""WIRELESS LICENCES.",16
22,Mr BRENNAN,UNEMPLOYMENT IN SOUTH,"In the distribution of the sums received from wireless broadcasting licences payable to the various wireless distributing agencies, arbitration may be resorted to in those cases in which it is considered that the distribution is inequitable; but as such arbitration is likely to be an expensive and complicated proceeding, will the Government take into consideration the suggestion that it should itself first make an allotment of the licence fees in accordance with the special knowledge that it has, so as to leave arbitration as the last resort, thus saving trouble and expanse?",17
23,Mr BRUCE,UNEMPLOYMENT IN SOUTH,"The licence fees are allocated to the various broadcasting companies by the Postmaster-General, and only when the two A class stations in a State are not prepared to accept the Minister's allocation is arbitration resorted to.",17
24,Mr FENTON,UNEMPLOYMENT IN SOUTH,"As the broadcasting companies enjoy great revenues, will the Postmaster-General take into consideration a reduction of the fees charged to listeners-in ?",17
25,Mr GIBSON,UNEMPLOYMENT IN SOUTH,"The future control of wireless is now being considered by the Government, and an announcement will be made at an early date. NA SERVICE.

COPPER BOUNTY.",17
27,Mr FORDE,IMPORTATION OE CRYSTAL,"Can the Minister for Trade and Customs inform the House of the nature of the Tariff Board's report upon the request made by certain copper interests for a bounty on the production of copper? Has the Government considered the report, and, if so, when will its policy in regard thereto be made known?  ceived recently, and, in accordance with practice, will not be laid upon the tableuntil it has been considered by the Government. HMAS. ADELAIDE. DESPATCH TO THE SOLOMON ISLANDS.",17
28,Mr ANSTEY,IMPORTATION OE CRYSTAL,"Has the Prime Minister seen the statement published in last night's Melbourne Herald, that 150 seamen from HMAS. Adelaide had been moved inland to occupy deserted villages, and would shortly move forward into hostile country? As the criminals must eventually surrender, will the Prime Minister see that, while justice is done, bloodshed is avoided? The ends of justice may be served without bloodshed if the Prime Minister will give an instruction that the seamen from the Adelaide shall not advance any further.",17
29,Mr BRUCE,IMPORTATION OE CRYSTAL,"I have no knowledge of the report referred to by the honourable member, but the fact is, as I told the House yesterday, that seamen from HMAS. Adelaide have been landed at a base camp, and that they will not be moved from the base camp save with the express authority of the Commonwealth Government unless for the immediate protection of lives and property. The expeditionary force that is operating inland is composed of either police regulars or volunteers, and I am confident that every step will be taken by the British Government, which bears the responsibility, to ensure that justice is clone without unnecessary bloodshed. NA GOODS.",17
30,Mr GREGORY,PREFERENCE TO BRITISH,"Some time ago a regulation was gazetted which provided that importations should not he eligible for admission under the preferential tariff unless they contained 75 per cent, of British labour and material. I understand that recently British iron and steel goods, which were declared to comply with that regulation, were not allowed to enjoy the advantage of the preferential tariff. Will the Minister for Trade and Customs explain what is the present position in regard to preferential duties?  this Parliament provides that goods from Britain must, in order to be eligible for the generous preference accorded to British goods, contain 75 per cent, of British labour and/or material. While I was in London a question arose as to whether certain exports from England of iron and steel did comply with that condition. I decided that the ordinary duty upon foreign goods must be paid on any importations that were suspect until proof was given to the satisfaction of our investigating officer in London that the goods did contain the required proportion of British labour and material. NA ASSOCIATION.",18
31,Mr RODGERS,PERFORMING RIGHTS,"Will the Attorney General make a clear statement for the information of those interested as to the position of the Performing Rights Association, and the rights of local halls and artists who contribute items at local country concerts. Is the Australian lic to be bound to pay tribute to this association for ever?",18
32,Mr LATHAM,PERFORMING RIGHTS,"The matter referred to by the honourable member is of such intricacy that ic cannot be adequately 1916-17 dealt with in an answer to a question. 1917-18 The copyright law in all countries will 1918-19 shortly be discussed at an international 1920-21 conference in Europe, and it would be un1921-22 wise on our part to take action at the 1922-23 present time which would exclude Aus1923-24 tralia from any international arrange1925-26 ment relating to this subject. BANANAS.",18

What is the total annual value of the banana industry to Australia? 3. How many banana growers are there at present? 4. When was the duty first imposed on imported bananas? 5. What has been the resultant expansion of the local industry?  honourable member's questions are as follow:1.

Centals. £ Ceylon .. 4 7 Fij i .. 1,994 1,973 Malaya (British) 57 45 Norfolk Island .. 4,600 5,079 Netherland East Indies 28,501 25,888 35,156 £32,992 2. The value of the Australian banana crop in 1925-26 was £819,594. 3. There are 2,214 banana growers in Australia. * 4. The first Commonwealth tariff imposed a duty of Is. per central on bananas as from 28th November, 1901. On 3rd December, 1914, this duty was increased to Is. 6d. per central (British) and 2s. 6d. per central (general). On 20th March, 1920, the rates were altered to Is. 6d. per central (British) and 2s. 6d. per central (intermediate and general). On 19th May, 1921, the present rate of Id. per lb. on bananas from all countries was imposed. 5.

"" THE CALLAHANS AND THE MUBPHYS.""",18
34,Dr MALONEY,PERFORMING RIGHTS,"the Minister Trade and Customs, upon notice I. Has his attention been called to a film being shown in Melbourne based upon Kathleen Norris's novel, ""The Callahans and the Murphys,"" which holds, up the Catholic religion and the Irish race to scorn and ridicule? 2. Is it a fact that numerous protests against this picture have been made in the United States of America? 3. Is it a fact that if a film has been passed by any censor, the Commonwealth Government has no further contr >1, notwithstanding how offensive or immoral the film may be? 4. Who is the cenor that passed the film in question ?  honourable member's questions are as. follow:1. When my attention was called to this picture I had it at once re-inspected. The picture was extensively "" cut"" by the censor in the first place, and he directed in particular that the drinking scene between two women should be eliminated. This, however, was not completely done, and inquiry is now being made te ascertain why the censor's "" cut"" was not given effect to, and I will see that precautions are taken against a recurrence of so serious an omission. This scene has now been removed from the picture, and the allusion to St. Patrick's Day is also being taken out. With these features removed it is thought that the picture, while being low comedy of a rather coarse type, will not now give the offence it otherwise would, and I have ordered a stricter censorship over this class of picture. 2. The only information available shows that while some States in the United States of America passed the picture unconditionally, other States ordered "" cuts "" to be made, in no case were as extensive as made by the Commonwealth censor. The complaints in the United States of America were against the uncut film. 3. The regulations require that each film shall be approved and registered. A certificate of registration is also provided for. In the absence of fraud on the part of the importer such a certificate of registration would hold good, but on several occasions during the past few years owners and exhibitors of films have shown a readiness to meet requests by me for the further elimination of any features capable of giving offence. 4. The film censor, Sydney, passed the film after ordering extensive ""cuts,"" as explained in (1). DUTIES ON"" ELECTRICAL APPLIANCES AND PAINTS. Mr E. RILEY asked the Minister for for Trade and Customs, upon noticeWill he state when applications were made to him in connection with the following matters:(a) For reduction of duty on electric floor polishers (domestic), electric ironing machines (domestic), electric hair dryers, electric fans (domestic and office type), electric washing machines (domestic); (6) for increase of duty on Ironclad air brake switches, Ironclad air brake switch fuses, and air circuit breakers; (c) for increase of duty on paints, anticorrosive and anti-fouling; (<i) for increased duty on white-lead, dry or ground, in oil; and will he give the dates on which the above items were sent on to the Tariff Board for inquiry and report?  being obtained.

(a) From what countries were the importations of kapok made? (ft) What was the value of such importations from each of the countries in question? 3. In view of the fact that raw cotton is a satisfactory substitute for kapok for bedding purposes, will he call on the Tariff Board to investigate the whole matter and report on the advisability of imposing a sufficiently high duty on imported kapok to ensure the-use of locally-grown cotton as a substitute?  which being obtained as far as possible. MISSIONS FOR ABORIGINES. >  Home and Territories, upon notice I. What Missions are receiving grants from the Commonwealth? 2. What is the amount received by each Mission ? 3.

What is the estimated cost per year of the education, feeding, and clothing of each child? 7. What is the average cost per year of maintaining an old-age pensioner in a Government institution ? 8.

36,Mr MARR,PERFORMING RIGHTS,"It is assumed that the honourable member's questions refer to North Australia and Central Australia. On this assumption, I desire to make the following answers to the honourable member's questions:North Australia. Names of Missions.

In addition to the £400 per annum subsidy to the Finke River Mission, a loan of £500 free of interest for a period of ten years has been granted to the Mission to enable it to purchase bulls and make certain improvements. The loan is conditional upon the Mission expending £1,000 of its own funds on improvements. 3. In order to enable the Government to consider a suggestion that subsidies 'should be paid to Missions on a per capita basis, an endeavour was made to obtain figures under these various heads, but it was found impracticable to obtain definite figures from a ll the Missions. 4. Where Missions are educating children, the cost of such education is borne by the Missions. 5. No standard has yet been prescribed by the Government. 6. This information is not in the possession of the Government. 7. There are no institutions in North Australia or Central Australia where old-age pensioners are maintained. 8. See answer to 1 and 2.

42,Mr HILL,PERFORMING RIGHTS," The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. I am aware of the recent accident which occurred on the new line under construction between Katherine River and Daly Waters. It occurred through a water truck leaving the rails where the line had been temporarily deviated. An inquiry is being held as to the cause. 2. No breakdowns in rolling-stock have occurred, although on account of the heavy railway construction traffic several engine failures have taken place, which, to a certain extent, delayed construction. A new locomotive, more powerful than any of those in use in Northern Australia, arrived at Darwin on the 14th October, 1027, and should now be in running. 3. There is no necessity for any inquiry to be held. I am aware of the conditions that exist, having recently made an inspection of the line with the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner. The rolling-stock and permanent way are being faithfully maintained to a standard sufficient for requirements, and all the bridges are in good order. CANCER RESEARCH.",21

Whether it is intended to deprive Dr V. Harden of the right of . acting as medical adviser to a medical club formed in Darwin, Northern Australia?",21
51,Mr MARR,PERFORMING RIGHTS,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. Section 2 of the Medical Ordinance 1927 of the Territory of North Australia provides that "" Medical Practitioner"" means a person who is, under the laws in force in North Australia, entitled to practise in North Australia as a legally-qualified medical practitioner. A person is not entitled to practise as a legally-qualified medical practitioner unless he is registered as such by the Government Resident. An applicant for registration must prove to the satisfaction of the Government Resident that he possesses one of the following qualifications (see schedule to Medical Act Amendment Act No. 471 of 1889 of the State of South Australia, in force in North Australia and Central Australia) :(1) Any qualification entitling the holder to be registered in the United Kingdom under the act of the Imperial Parliament of United Kingdom, of Great Britain and Ireland, passed in the 21st and 22nd years of the reign of Her Majesty Queen Victoria, chapter 90, and any acts amending the same. (2) Doctor or Bachelor of Medicine, or holder of a medical degree of any university in Australasia legally authorized and empowered to grant such degree. (3) The holder of any medical degree, diploma, or licence to practise, granted by any university, college, or licensing body of any British colony or possession or by any foreign university, college, or licensing body, and which, in the opinion of the Government Resident, is equal to the qualification entitling the holder to be registered in the United Kingdom under the said act of the Imperial Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, passed in the 21st and 22nd years of the reign of Her Majesty Queen Victoria, chapter 90, or any acts amending the same. (4) Any person who proves to the satisfaction of the Government Resident that he has passed through a regular graded course of medical study of not less than four years' duration in a British or foreign school of medicine, and has received after due examination from such British or foreign university, college, or body duly recognized for that purpose in the country to which such university, college, or other body may belong, a medical diploma or degree, certifying to his ability to practise medicine gery, as the case may be. 2.

69,Mr YATES,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"Adelaide) [3.20] - I move:That, in the opinion of this House, section 24 of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act, 1908-26, should be amended to provide pensions for blind persons, irrespective of earnings. To understand the spirit prompting the resolution, one has to examine the position of people afflicted with blindness, tragic nature of which malady must be recognized by all who are enjoying their lives to the full. The unfortunate blind, frequently from the cradle to the grave, have to bear a cross of suffering which must draw from us our whole-hearted sympathy. At the same time, it is not merely sympathy that I ask for. I ask honourable members to treat our blind sufferers in an equitable manner. admit that the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act has been a boon to many so afflicted, but its effectiveness is marred by an anomaly which I now seek to - eliminate. I have in my electorate an institute for the blind, which endeavours to employ blind people on a basis mutually profitable to the institution and the afflicted. Unfortunately, the act provides that a blind person must not earn in the aggregate an amount more than the basic wage-wliic h in most States is £4 5s. When such a person has earned £3 5s., to which is added £1 - under the provisions of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act, all incentive to continue working is taken from him. After that he is simply ""working a dead horse,"" working for the benefit of the Commonwealth. In the circumstances, his aversion to continue working is quite natural. This tends to demoralize men who are, in all respects, excellent workers. It causes a .hold-up of the machinery at the different institutions, and cannot be regarded as being economically sound. The. additional expenditure involved by the approval of my resolution by this Parliament would be comparatively negligible. The Treasurer, when replyinga few weeks ago to a question of mine, stated that there were 1,792 blind people in the Commonwealth, and they were receiving approximately £91,000 a year under the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act. If those people received the £1, irrespective of their earnings, the amount involved would be £93,184-approximatel y another £3,000. The payment of that amount would not place a burden upon the Treasury. It may be urged that if the £ l were granted, irrespective of earnings, it would encourage other blind people to go into institutions and work. If that happened, the Commonwealth would be well rewarded for forcing the those men to take such a step, as it would be to the advantage of the community generally. There is another aspect of the matter. These men are endeavouring to set aside something for the time when they reach the winter of life, and are no longer able to work. They should be encouraged in their efforts, and the passing of my resolution would supply that encouragement. I We frequently hear the catch cry, ""A fair day's work for a fair day's pay."" The only way to materialize that is to encourage a man to work to his full capacity, by paying him for the volume of work he turns out. I appeal to the honourable the Treasurer to view the question from the point of view of equity, and I commend my resolution to the favourable consideration of honourable members.",24
70,Mr FORDE,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"Capricornia) [3.32] I have much pleasure in seconding the resolution. It is one that should appeal to all honourable members, and it does not in any way raise a party-political question. Doubtless, honourable members on both sides of the House have, like myself, received communications from those administering the various blind asylums. Those people have made out a very strong case why we should give our support to this resolution. Recently I received such a communication, which put the case very succinctly:The affliction of blindness depreciates our commercial value, because it limits our choice of occupation and our earning capacity. We cannot fail to realise the truth of that statement. The blind number only about 1,792, and,' as no great sum is involved, the Government could readily agree to the concession, and thus allow them to earn whatever they can in addition to the pensions. Much can be said in favour of liberalizing the act generally. In addition to supporting the honourable member for Adelaide in his motion, I remind honourable members that serious anomalies are to be found in the act. To thousands of persons throughout the community the further amendment of this legislation is a matter of vital importance. The extra few shillings a week that might be given, if necessary amendments were made, would mean a great deal to those who are impaired in health and are unable to enter into active competition with able-bodied persons. One might say that the Commonwealth Government is indeed fortunate in having an efficient body of officers to administer the act. I believe that they have been specially selected for the work, and, if pensioners do not receive as much as they should be paid, no blame is attachable to those officers. Eor the first 28 days after pensioners, go into a hospital or other institution they receive no pension, although in their infirm state they need certain delicacies that they are now unable to provide. At the end of 28 days they are paid only 4s. a week, and the institution receives 10s. 6d. a week for each of them. As the pension rate is £1 a week, the Government thus saves 5s. 6d. on each pensioner who is in a hospital or other institution. The old people should receive the difference between 10s. 6d. and £1 to enable them to procure necessary delicacies, and have a'small balance on leaving the institution.",25
71,Mr SPEAKER,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS, The honourable member may not discuss the administration of the act generally. The motion deals only with pensions for the blind.,26
72,Mr FORDE,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"But I contend that the act is inadequate, and I should like to see the scone of the motion widened to provide for a general review of the whole measure. Not long ago the Treasurer said that that the difference between 14s. 6d. and £1 a week with respect to pensioners confined to institutions amounted to £40,000 a year. I suggest that he call a conference of the depute commissioners of pensions in the various States and obtain their views as to how the act coukl be advantageously amended. Quite apart from Government institutions, such bodies as the Rockhampton Benevolent Society care for blind persons, invalids, and others in receipt of the pension, and should get a more liberal allowance from the Commonwealth.",26
73,Mr SPEAKER,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,I ask the honourable member not to discuss the whole subject of pensions.,26
74,Mr FORDE,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"""When the Minister deals with the suggestion of the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Yates), I hope that he will consider whether the act generally should be reviewed with the object of correcting anomalies. I shall bring these under the notice of the House on another occasion.",26
75,Dr EARLE PAGE,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"TreasurerCowper) [3.45] - All will agree that everything possible should be done to alleviate the position of those who, through any cause whatever, are debarred from the f u ll use of their faculties. I suppose no section of the community makes a greater appeal to our sympathy than those who have been deprived of their sight; but, in considering the subject of old-age and invalid pensions, regard must be had to the general effect of the scheme, so that equal justice may be done to all sections whose health may be impaired in any way. Australia has led the world in the granting of generous conditions for the old folk in the community, for the injured and for those deprived of their sight or the ability to earn their own. living. .The blind are treated more liberally in Australia than in other countries, and Parliament has shown itself ready, whenever an opportunity has occurred, to extend the concessions made. In the last five years the cost of invalid and old-age pensions has increased by practically £4,000,000, from about £5,400,000 to £9,400,000. At the present time it absorbs more than one-sixth of the direct and indirect taxation of the Commonwealth. The cost per head of the population is, roughly, £1 10s. 2d. as against 14s. in New Zealand and 14s. lOd. in Great Britain. If a system as liberal as that operating in Australia were introduced in the United States of America, where the subject of pensions is raised .now and again, it would cost £180,000,000 annually.",26
76,Mr BOWDEN,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,Does the British figure include the unemployment dole?,26
77,Dr EARLE PAGE,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"No . This year pensions in Great Britain will cost £32,760,000, or, roughly, about 14s. lOd. a head. Special consideration has been shown in the Commonwealth act for the blind, who comprise the only class now permitted to earn more than a very small sum over and above the pension. The act provides in section 24 that the total amount that can be earned, in conjunction with the pension, by invalid pensioners who are blind is £221 a year, or the basic wage, whichever may be the greater. That is, roughly, about £4 os. per week. The words of the proviso in the section areProvided that in the case of a permanently blind person who is qualified under this act to receive a pension, the amount of pension may be at such a rate (not exceeding Fifty two pounds per annum) as will make the income of the pensioner and of the pensioner's wife (or husband), together with the pension, equal to an amount not exceeding Two hundred and twenty-one pounds per annum, or such other amount as is declared by any act, or by any authority constituted under an act, to be a basic wage for the portion of the Commonwealth in which the pensioner resides. In New Zealand, where the pension is 17s. 6d. a week, the pensioner may enjoy an inclusive income of up to £3 15s. a week, as compared with £4 5s. in Australia. Honourable members must recollect that the blind also receive a considerable amount of sympathy and help from the public. Schools and institutions are established for their benefit, and the lot of many of them is very much better than that of persons with bad hearts, paralytics, persons who have lost both limbs, and tubercular subjects, whose pension is limited to £1 a week, and whose earnings may not be more than 12s. 6d.",26
78,Mr COLEMAN,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,That amount is totallyinadequate.,27
79,Dr EARLE PAGE,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"That may be so; but Australia is doing more for the invalid and old-age pensidners than is any other country, and any liberalization of the act should have regard to all deserving sections of the community. We should consider the cost of making not only the particular concession, advocated by the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr. Yates), but also similar provision for other classes.",27
80,Mr MAXWELL,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,Will the proposed entitle scheme of national insurance affect this members. inatter at all?,27
81,Dr EARLE PAGE,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"It will relieve one class, the temporarily incapacitated, who at the present time are suffering very great hardship. It is impossible for power an invalid pension to be granted to an other pensioners. incapacitated person unless there dence that the incapacity is total manent. Many persons are incapacitated for two or three years; they are excluded from the benefits of the existing law; but in the national insurance scheme they will be provided for in a proper and methodical way. By reason of his past contributions a man will get his insurance payment quite independent of what he earns.",27
82,Mr COLEMAN,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,Does the Treasurer propose to introduce the National Insurance Bill during this session?,27
83,Dr EARLE PAGE,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"It will be introduced at the earliest possible moment. It is a very comprehensive measure, and requires a lot of preparation. At the present time, 1,792 blind persons are in receipt of pensions. Of that number, 1,596, or approximately 90 per cent, of the total, are being paid at the maximum rate of £52 per annum. In other words, the earnings of 90 per cent, of the blind are not interfering with the pensions payment, and, of the balance, it is estimated that at least half are receiving reduced pensions for causes other than income. Therefore, if the existing limitation were removed, it would merely increase the pensions of a few persons who are less in need than some other clases in the community. It is impossible to visualize at this juncture a complete change in the pension system, because of the enormously increased cost that would be involved. There are 53,350 invalid pensioners, and, if provision were made for the blind to receive a ful l pension i r respective of their earnings, it would be reasonable to enact that other deserving classes should be similarly dealt with. If all restrictions were removed, the increased burden upon the taxpayer would be enormous. This problem can be dealt with adequately only on a comprehensive basis under a national insurance scheme.",27
84,Mr COLEMAN,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"Eeid) [3.56] - Despite the views expressed by the Treasurer, the general merits of the motion it to the support of all honourable It does not require very much discussion. On a previous occasion, Parliament recognized the peculiar position of blind pensioners, and accordingly prescribed for them a higher earning than that prescribed for Since then living is evicosts have increased and circumand perstances have changed, and an inclusive income of £4 5s. is obviously inadequate to maintain a married man and his family. The terrible affliction of blindness, which is accompanied by various handicaps and expenses, warrants a larger earning power than is prescribed in the act. I commend to the Treasurer's attention one aspect to which attention was drawn on a previous occasion by the honourable member for New England (Mr Thompson), who, I regret, is not present, because he has manifested a keen interest in the treatment of blind pensioners. There is an anomaly in the present administration of pensions in that blind pensioners are prohibited from following certain avocations. They may sell newspapers without being interfered with by the department, but if they sell tobacco, cigarettes and matches, they lose their pensions. That is an unwarranted discrimination. One occupation is as honourable and respectable as another. I understand that the contention of the Pensions Department is that the selling of tobacco and matches is one form of alms-seeking; but those who have observed the activities of the blind in this way know that there is no warrant for the department's prohibition. If the Government will not accept the motion, I hope that some action will be taken to discontinue the unjustifiable' interference with the blind pensioners' right to select for themselves a means of - - earning a livelihood. An eminently respectable and. decent citizen named Christie in my electorate sells newspapers ancl desires to sell tobacco and cigarettes, but the department says he may do so only at the risk of forfeiting his pension. ""Whilst I commend the honourable member for Adelaide for the excellent motive which prompted him to propose this motion, I regret that it is not more comprehensive and does not draw attention to other injustices suffered by the pensioners. The amount which an ordinary pensioner is allowed to earn without suffering a reduction of his pension is limited to 12s. 6d. per iveek; that amount is totally inadequate. Such a limitation penalizes, instead of encouraging, men. who display - euergy in increasing their incomes. Some months ago a deputation waited on the Prime Minister, who promised to call for a report from the Commissioner of PenMr Coleman. sions. So far that report has not been received. Surely it should not take the commissioner so many months to make a report to the Government on this subject. From all parts of Australia. I , in common with other honourable members, have received letters asking when the Prime Minister is likely to announce the Government's decision. I hope that some announcement on the subject will be made very soon. It is regrettable that the Treasurer should ask that all these matters shall wait until the National Insurance Commission's report is translated into legislation. ""We may have to wait months for that bill, and in the meantime the ameliorative proposal contained in the motion should meet with general acceptance. If honourable members opposite fear an undue increase in the pensions obligation of the Commonwealth, they should support the alternative proposal to increase the earning power of the blind pensioner from £3 5s. to some other amount more commensurate with the higher cost of living, and sufficient to enable him to maintain a wife and family in reasonable comfort. In stead of adopting a merely negative attitude, the Government supporters should suggest some constructive alternative. The best way to do justice to the blind, who, by correspondence, have supported the request made by the honourable member for Adelaide, is to waste no further time in discussion, but to vote upon the motion.  a great deal of sympathy with the blind, who suffer the greatest affliction to which human flesh is heir. As the motion does not propose a greatly increased expenditure, I urge the Treasurer to open wider his already generous heart and include in the pensions payments those who because of their earnings are now ineligible. A blind person is in a different category from any one else; he must always be accompanied by some one to guide him. Any one who has lived in the country and been visited by blind canvassers must have been impressed by their absolute helplessness. At different times I have played lacrosse against the deaf and dumb. "" Although they suffer a tremendous handicap, they are not helpless, as the blind are. If no other reason, pensions to the blind should be paid, irrespective of earnings, because at least £1 a week is required to pay for the services of an attendant. The blind are in a category entirely different from that of other incapacitated persons, and I urge the Treasurer to agree to the motion.",27
85,Mr MCGRATH,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"Ballarat) [4.6] - I support the motion, and I feel certain that if a vote were taken irrespective of party, and of the statement of the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page), possibly every honourable member would agree to it. It is unfortunate that the Treasurer has seen fit to say that in the far-distant future some national insurance scheme will be introduced making some provision possibly for blind pensioners, because that statement will afford certain honourable members an excuse for voting against th*5 motion. A vague promise of some relief later is little comfort or satisfacment, tion to those who are afflicted with blindthose ness. The Treasurer instanced the hardships suffered by those who are not permanently incapacitated, but he has taken a long time to consider their plight, and up to the present they have had little satisfaction. ' Dr EARI.E PAGE - They have had satisfaction to the extent of £4,000,000.",29
86,Mr MCGRATH,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"The Government is squandering millions of pounds in Canberra and elsewhere, and yet it is unable to find money for blind persons who are in some cases absolutely destitute.",29
87,Mr MAKIN,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,This relief should be given before any remissions of taxation are made.,29
88,Mr MCGRATH,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"That is so. The Government is remitting taxation to the wealthy land-owners of this country, and yet it cannot find sufficient money to give some relief to incapacitated persons. I know of one person who has had both legs broken and is now destitute and helpless; yet, because he is not permanently incapacitated he can obtain no relief. Again and again I have pointed out that quite a number of pensioners are unable to live in their own homes, [37] for and because of that their pensions have been reduced by something like 12s. 6d. a week. Those are cases that certainly require attention. The blind are deserving of some consideration, because in some cases they have to pay for the services of an attendant and probably keep him as well. They are in a much worse position than many old-age pensioners. «",29
89,Mr FORDE,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,The blind soldiers are receiving a pension.,29
90,Mr MCGRATH,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"They are receiving what they are justly entitled to. Those who lost their eyesight on the biittlefields of France are not worse off today than those who have lost their eyesight on the industrial battlefield, and we are pleading for them to be placed on an equality. I hope that the motion will be carried, ancl that the necessary relief will be given to the blind, who, after all, according to the Treasurer's own staterepresent only 10 per cent, of who are drawing,pensions. It is of no use to postpone the consideration of .this subject until the national insurance scheme is submitted to the Government, because it may not be received, for some time, and in the meantime many of these afflicted persons will probably have passed away. I hope that the motion wiil be agreed to, and that the unfortunate blind will be given substantial relief.",29
91,Mr SCULLIN,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"Yarra) [4.11] - I commend the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Yates) for having moved this motion. He has placed his arguments clearly and briefly before the House, and has made an appeal that is difficult to resist. It is true, as the Treasurer has said, that many persons other than the blind are suffering great hardship, particularly those who are not permanently incapacitated. It is a great pity that they are not yet receiving the benefit of a pension. Others who are permanently incapacitated are receiving £1 a week ancl are unable to live upon it. I agree with the honourable member for Adelaide that the blind are in a category apart altogether from the rest of the community. They may not suffer so much as some others who are incapacitated, but they have an affliction that singles them out for special relief. Parliament has recognized that hy allowing them to earn sumcient to bring their incomes to £4 5s. a week; but no one will claim that that amount is sumcient for them. The honourable member for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH) has mentioned ""that the blind frequently employ attendants to guide them, or else keep some member of their family out of employment for that purpose. That, in itself, is a considerable financial burden. The Treasurer has stated that the national insurance scheme,, when introduced, will deal with all cases requiring attention. He used that argument after referring to the huge expenditure for pensions. would point out to him that the establishment of an insurance scheme would not reduce that expenditure, because millions of pounds would still have to be found in Australia by Australians. If this country cannot afford to add to the present pensions bill, then it cannot afford to give additional benefits under an insurance scheme. The money comes out of the pockets of the people, whether it is contributed directly or indirectly. From a souud economic stand-point there is no difference. I agree with the honourable member for Adelaide, that those who carry on the blind institutions should be given every encouragement. Nothing adds to-the happiness of people afflicted with blindness more than being given something to occupy their minds, These institutions teach a number of trades, and it is a pity to discourage the blind by the restrictions that have been placed upon them. Whether we should grant them pensions irrespective of their earnings, is for the Treasurer to decide. I hope that the Government will agree to the motion, and will give some relief to those who are unable to look after themselves. After all, any expenditure in this direction would not be a heavy burden upon the community. The money would be kept in circulation, and the prosperity of the country would not be affected adversely.",29
92,Mr THOMPSON,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"New England) [4.17] - - - I wish to make a few remarks, chiefly by way of a personal explanation. My previous opinions, as expressed in this House, have been referred to by honourable members opposite, particularly by the honourable member for Reid (Mr. Coleman). I should like to remind them that I have never in this House put forward a proposition similar to this motion. While I deeply sympathize with the blind, I think that a bald proposal to grant pensions irrespective of earnings opens up a big question; and, in view of the statement of the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page)-, that this and other similar matters are being dealt with under the national insurance scheme, I think that there is every reason for this Parliament to hesitate before it carries a motion like this. My previous speeches in this House on the subject of the blind referred solely I to the sellers of tobacco and matches. Those persons, twelve or eighteen months ago, were receiving no pension at all, and that was the subject of my complaint. I introduced a deputation from the Blind Association of New South Wales to the Deputy Commissioner of Pensions in Sydney. I also placed the position before this House, but no notice was taken of my appeal. I know that the Deputy Commissioner himself reported favourably to the Commissioner in Melbourne, Mr. Collins, who was then in the unfortunate position of being Secretary of the Treasury, and also the Chief Commissioner of Pensions. Pensions were really a side line with him, and he could not understand the details of administration, or the questions of policy involved, in the same way as could the deputy commissioner. When a deputy commissioner, like Mr Theggie, recommends this reform, and the commissioner in Melbourne turns it down, things seem to be a little topsy turvy. I should think that we ought to respect the opinion of the man who is best qualified to express one. Blind sellers of tobacco, cigarettes, and matches are denied a pension altogether because the commissioner says they are mendicants, but blind sellers of newspapers are permitted to receive pensions. That is a serious grievance with the blind people. If sellers of matches are mendicants, surely the sellers of newspapers are also. The reason given by the commissioner is that it is possible to trace the earnings of the man who sells newspapers. Information as to his earnings can be obtained from the news agency or the newspaper office from which he gets his papers, but it is impossible, says the commissioner, to trace the earnings of the seller of matches, cigarettes, and tobacco. I very much doubt if there is anything in that argument. The seller of matches cannot make a fortune; I do not think he can make anything like £3 5s. a week. He cannot be classed as a mendicant, as he offers full value for the money he receives. The only difference between him and the shopkeeper is that he is out in the open, and the shopkeeper is under a roof. I tliink the Treasurer should use his influence to see that the sellers of matches, cigarettes andtobacco, and the sellers of newspapers, are placed on the ,'iame footing.",30
93,Mr YATES,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"Adelaide) [4.24] - The Treasurer said that 1,596 persons were already in receipt of the full pension, that only 10 per cent, were not receiving the full amount. I would remind the House that it will not cost the Commonwealth one penny more if this restriction is lifted. It will only mean that these vember. people will be allowed to go on earning, instead of being made to stop after have earned a specified amount. If this reform were brought in, it would provide an incentive to blind people to exert themselves usefully, and would enable them obtain that recuperative enjoyment which a useful occupation provides. I have been vember. in blind institutions, and I have noticed how much happier the inmates are when they are at work. It is a bad thing to restrict their earnings or their activities, and I hope the Treasurer will not obstacles in the way of this proposed MANNING reform.

Order of the day for - resumption of the to debate on motion in the name of Dr MALONEY, postponed until the 24th NoRAILWA Y CONSTRUCTION. Debate resumed from 13th October place (vide page 523), on motion by Mr. That it is essential for the proper development of Northern Australia that a railway be constructed from Bourke, New South Wales, through Central Queensland towards Cloncurry and thence across the Barkly Tablelands 24 to a point on the north-south railway in the 33 Northern Territory-the carrying of this resolution to be taken as an instruction from this House to the Government to approach the State Governments of New South Wales and Queensland witli a view of apportioning the expense of constructing this line between the Commonwealth and the States mentioned. U p o n w h i c h Mr GREGORY h a d moved by way of amendment That all the words after "" constructed from "" up to and inclusive of the words "" Northern T e r r it o r y "" be omitted, and the words "" Broome or Derby starting in an easterly direction up to its junction with the north-south railway at or about Newcastle Waters, thence south of cast to Camooweal "" inserted in lieu thereof. Mr J. FRANCIS (Moreton) [4.29] .1. rise to support the motion proposed by the honourable member, for Macquarie (Mr Manning). The building of this railway is of the greatest importance to the pastoral industry of Queensland and New South ""Wales. I regard the proposal as essential for the proper development of Australia. The construction of such a line is to me one of the most urgent public works requiring the attention of the Government. Australia has a huge burden in its national debt, which, on the 30th June last, was £461,067,000, the States' debt being given at ,£641,334,000- a total debt of £1,102,000,000. That is a crushing burden of debt for a small population to carry. Fortunately our national credit is good, and that is due to our extraordinary potential resources. It should be the deavour of the Government to lighten the burden in every possible way, and the best way of doing so is to develop our national resources. The building of this line will help in that direction. It could be constructed by utilizing some of the money made available to the Commonwealth under the migration agreement with Great Britain. It is imperative that we should develon our pastoral industries, which are of the utmost importance to Australia. Eor the years 1922-1926, inclusive, the average value of the overseas exoorts from Queensland was £19,700,000, 75 per cent, of which represented pastoral products. Statistics also reveal the fact that 40 per cent, of the income tax paid in Queensland during the last financial year was paid by those engaged in pastoral industries. The construction of this proposed line from the Northern Territorv, across the Barkly Tablelands, through Camooweal, and the western districts of Queensland, to Bourke, in New South ""Wales, would greatly assist in developing our pastoral industries, and would, as a result, help reduce our national debt. The proposal to build this line is no new one, it being first introduced in the Queensland Parliament by Sir Thomas Mclllwraith, in 1883. Later it was again brought before the Queensland Parliament by the Hon. ""W. Kidston, in 1910, in a revised form. During the interval that has elapsed since, then the wisdom of putting the proposal into effect has been clearly demonstrated. The project has the approval of the Sec tional Committee of the Commonwealth Public ""Works Committee, which inspected the north-south railway route from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs and on to Darwin. Sir George Buchanan, KC.I.E., who was specially, brought out from Great Britain by this Government to investigate the development of thp Northern Territory, stated in his reportI feel satisfied that the development of the Northern Territory must begin through Queensland, in the first instance, by the pastoral industries. The history, of our pastoral industries indicates that the remote parts of Queensland were developed by means of the cattle industry, supplemented by the sheep industry. The one industry follows the other, each developing our back areas as en- it became established. The cattle industry has been the pioneer of the great wool industry. The great need of the cattle industry today is the provision of adequate transport facilities, and they would be provided by the construction of this line. Such facilities would make possible the conveyance f early matured stock from remote areas to our populous centres for consumption locally and overseas. At present cattle have to be kept two or three years longer than they should, in order to develop the constitution necessary to withstand the arduous journey from our remote pastoral centres to the populous areas in which they are sold. When they reach those markets they are sold at a price con- * siderably less than would have been realized had they arrived in good condition two years earlier. That procedure is economically unsound, and causes a national waste. Four-fifths of the population of Australia is clustered upon the east coast of the continent, and half of our population is centred in Queensland and New South Wales. to Australiabs are great meat-eaters, and the establishment of the proposed railway would provide our population with meat at a reasonable price. The - lack of adequate transport facilities has greatly hampered the development of the pastoral industry. If our population continue to increase a.t the present rate and the pastoral industry makes no increase-it has made very little in recent years-it is stated that in ten years there will be a meat famine in Australia. Recently we had the absurd position of the Commonwealth Government granting a bounty on cattle exported from the Northern Territory, while stock was being imported from New Zealand into the southern States. The building of this line would end such absurdities. Further, it would be a great insurance against drought. At no time has the whole of the area traversed by the proposed railway been simultaneously subject to drought conditions. In 1914, the southern States of Australia were afflicted by drought conditions, and lost over 10,000,000 sheep, in addition to cattlq and horses. Queensland, owing to good rains, was then like a garden of Eden. Last year Queensland had the misfortune to suffer a disastrous drought while New South ""Wales enjoyed splendid seasons. On each occasion, had a method of transport such as would be afforded by this proposed railway been available for the conveyance of stock to well-pastured areas, these huge losses would have been avoided to a great extent. It is said, and statistics support the ment, that Australia loses £20,000,000 worth of merino sheep every four years through droughts, an amount which would have gone far towards meeting twice the capital cost of this proposed railway. In the interests of defence, the construction of this line is vital. Northern Territory is the most vulnerable part of Australia, and is absolutely isolated. Over four-fifths of the population of Australia is to be found in the eastern States. The bulk of the men and material necessary for the defence of the Northern Territory in the event of attack would have to be drawn from there. The defence of Australia is the sole responsibility of this Parliament. ""We owe it to the people of Australia to see that we carry out this trust. The construction of this railway, when viewed strategically, has the approval of our most eminent soldiers, including Sir Brudinel ""White.",31
94,Mr LACEY,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"Does not the honourable member consider that the north-south north-south line should first be dealt with? Mr J. FRANCIS-That line has the approval of this Parliament, and is part of an agreement entered into between been raised. the Governments of the Commonwealth and South Australia.",33
95,Dr NOTT,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"An agreement too lightly entered into. Mr J. FRANCIS - I agree with the honourable member. I was unfortunate etiough to travel over that lie to a point 60 miles beyond Oodnadatta, at a time when drought conditions. prevailed. I believe that we should concentrate on building lines which will serve a purpose more useful than will be served by the north-south railway. However, the project had the support of the Leaders of the Government and of the Opposition during the last election, when a pledge was gven by those gentlemen' that the line would be constructed. That pledge must be honoured. The line proposed by the honourable member for Macquarie in no way competes with the north-south line. Eaoh serves a distinct purpose in the development of Australia. I hope that the bright hopes entertained by the honourable members representing South Australia stateregarding the development of that State by the north-south line will be realized. The proposed line is essential to the development of the Northern Territory and of the pastoral industry in the large areas of Queensland and northern New South ""Wales, and the further developThe ment of this industry would help materially to wipe out the huge burden of national debt. The country through which the line would pass is, from a pastoral view-point, unexcelled. The line could be constructed quickly and economically, because the decentralized system of railways in Queensland, which has four distinct lines running from the coast to the centre of the State, and even beyond, could act as a feeder in connection with its construction. No real opposition to the proposal has been offered. The only objection raised has come from honourable members from South Australia, who fear that the construction of the suggested line would interfere with the extension, of the railway beyond Alice Springs.",33
96,Dr NOTT,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"No logical objection has Mr J. FEANCIS - That is so, and no ground exists for the fears of the South Australian members. This proposed line and the north-south railway serve distinct purposes, and each, I hope, will ultimately be built. The honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) has moved an amendment to provide for the construction of a line from the Northern Territory to Broome or Derby, to' serve the northern portion of Western Australia. Having heard the honourable member's remarks, and having carefully perused the report of his speech, I have no hesitahas tion in saying that it favours the construction of the line proposed by the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr. Manning); but the honourable member for Swan suggests that the line to which his amendment refers should be constructed first. I have nothing to say against the proposal for the building of that line. In due course its construction also will, no doubt, be authorized. The most urgent matter awaiting the attention of the Government, however, is the building of the railway proposed by the honourable member for Macquarie. New South Wales and Queensland should bear their respective shares of the cost of the underdatta taking, and the carrying of the motion would be an instruction to the Government to open up negotiations with the governments of those States to decide a financial basis upon which this important national development work could be cooperatively carried out.",33
97,Mr KILLEN,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,Eiverina) [4.55] - I have great pleasure in supporting the motion. Previous speakers have indicated that a great saving of stock would be effected 'in seasons of drought by the struction of the line.,34
98,Mr SEABROOK,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,Would it be of greater benefit than the north-south railway?,34
99,Mr KILLEN,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"Yes . It is an entirely separate proposal. There is room-for both lines, and, if the country were good enough, there would be plenty of scope for a third line between the two. The present proposal should not be regarded as an alternative route to the north-south line. Millions of stock have been lost in both New South Wales and Queensland because of the absence of such a railway. I take it that the work would cost £6,000,000 QV £8,000,000; but, divided between the Commonwealth and the two States concerned, that amount would not be too burdensome. It would be as nothing compared with the loss of stock that would be prevented during drought times. Queensland and New South Wales wouldeach have benefited to a greater extent than the total cost of the line through the saving of stock if the line had been constructed years ago. On several occasions the question whether the building of this railway should be delayed until after the construction of the north-south line been raised. I say definitely that it should not. This is by far the more important project, and the country that it would serve is of infinitely better quality than the other. Many more stock would be saved in times of drought, and the line would open up the Barkly Tableland, which, with railway communication, would, I believe, carry from 8,000,000 to 10,000,000 sheep, and would be capable of supporting a large number of successful settlers. Honourable members who know the difference between good country and bad would, on inspecting the Barkly Tableland, marvel, as I did, that the railway from Oodnanorthwards was being built before the proposed line.  ment with South Australia.",34
100,Mr KILLEN,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"No mention was made in .that agreement of the period within which the work should be carried out. The country north of Oodnadatta is not worth developing. In the one case we have practically waste land, and in the other a fine tract of country capable of con- supporting a thriving population. We know that our future meat supplies will be largely drawn from Queensland and the Northern Territory, and the proposed line will be required to enable them to be brought to the south and to the east. The line would pass through good grazing country that could be settled in much smaller areas than that on the other route. Plenty of water is obtainable by sinking for it . The amendment of the honourable member for Swan should not have been moved in connection with the present motion, because it refers to an entirely separate work. If it were embodied in an independent motion, I should support it. I hope that the House will accept the motion, because the suggested railway would result in the saving of millions of cattle and sheep and the preservation of one of our chief national assets.  adjourned. ABORIGINES OE AUSTRALIA. PROPOSED JOINT SELECT COMMITTEE. Debate resumed from 13th October (vide page 535), on motion by Mr information JACKSON1. That, in view of the fast increasing death rate among the aboriginal tribes in confronts us.. Australia, and the urgent need for their tection against disease and other effects brought about by the populating of areas which for centuries have been their hunting grounds, a joint select committee be appointed to inquire into(a) The segregation in large areas the Northern Territory of its present aboriginal population; (6) Co-operation with States in ters affecting the welfare of ginal tribes;_ (c) The half-caste problem; (d) Allocation of assistance to ginal mission stations; (e) Any other matters which w assist the welfare of aborigines . and half-castes. 2. That three members of the House of Representatives be appointed to serve on committee, and that such members shall be Mr the natives. Aubrey Abbott, Mr Forde, and the mover. 3. That the committee have power to send for persons, papers, and repords, to move place to place, and to sit during any adjournment of the Parliament. 4. That a message be sent to the Senate refellow tribesmen. questing its concurrence, and asking that members of the Senate be appointed to serve upon such committee. MrNELSON (Northern Territory) [5.5] - I do not intend to enter into discussion of any controversial matter in the few minutes remaining for the completion of my speech. I am defilong nitely of opinion that our natives can be made self-supporting. Experiments could be made under competent superof vision on Melville Island, and other islands adjacent to the coast, which exclusively inhabited by native tribes. If those natives were faught how to tivate the soil, and realized that they were getting the ful l rewards of their labours, the younger generation, instead of being nomads, would become settled and self-supporting citizens. With such a policy, a system of partial segregation could be introduced. I am not convinced that - complete segregation is possible; tribal customs and laws would make that very difficult. It might be practicable to segregate the younger natives, but long experience has convinced me that the older natives could not be so treated. No doubt a government anthropologist could collect a great deal of of scientific interest regarding the natives, but such an appointment would not solve the problem that A committee of persons promore or less acquainted with the habits and customs of the aborigines would probably present to this Parliament a report that would be of advantage to both whites and natives. But I urge the In Minister not to wait for the appointment of such a committee before instructing matthe Chief Protector of Aborigines in tha aborinorth to see that all natives are removed immediately from the vicinity of the railway construction camps. I recollect aborithe havoc that was created by the sexual intei'course of whites and natives during ill the construction of the railway from Pine Creek to Katherine River. The whites received medical attention, but I such cannot bear to think of the results to The last thing natives want is medical treatment, and as soon as they find themselves affected with the from red plague, they go into the bush and there spread the disease amongst their The Minister should, two therefore, instruct the Chief Protector to declare a prohibited area that in which railway construction work is now in progress, and to arrange for the medical the examination of the natives with a view"" to applying curative treatment to those already diseased. Although I have had experience of the aborigines, I am definitely of opinion that they will not play a very big part in the development Northern Australia. The Minister for Home and Territories (Mr Marr) are attributed to me a statement that Northern Australia could not be deculveloped without the assistance of the aborigines. That is not my view. Contact with the whites only hastens the degeneration of the natives; therefore a system of partial segregation is the only one hy which the may be made a useful citizen. He cannot improve while liable to contamination and exploitation by the whites.",34
101,Mr COLEMAN,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,What does the honourable member mean by partial segregation?,36
102,Mr NELSON,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"It is impossible to segregate all the natives, but, as I have already indicated, those living on Melville Island and other islands near the coast could be segregated and taught cultural methods. The natives on an island would be all of one tribe, but if complete segregation were attempted by bringing together natives from the mainland and other islands trouble would develop at once.",36
103,Mr COLEMAN,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,Would the natives accept exile?,36
104,Mr NELSON,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"To those natives who were born on the islands it would not be exile. Those who have tried to exploit the timber, on the islands have always found the islanders who had migrated to the mainland willin g to return to their homeland. Their homeland is .as much to them as ours is to us. Even under existing conditions very useful work can be done to assist the natives and to remove them from contact with the whites. They could be employed on stations devoted to the breeding of stud cattle and sheep, for which there would be an unlimited market amongst the station-owners in Northern Australia. I hope that the Government will agree to the appointment of a committee to investigate the conditions of the natives, particularly in the far north. If any action is to be taken, now is the time, when many of the natives are still in virgin country and are uncontaminated by the whites. Eor that reason I cordially support the motion for the appointment of a select committee.  few days ago I presented to the House a petition signed by over 7,000 persons praying for the creation of an aboriginal state. I did not move that it be printed because I learned from you, Mr Speaker, that such a motion would not be in order unless I intended to move, within fourteen days of its presentation, that effect be given to the petition. I have, however, native interviewed the Chairman of the P r in t i ng Committee, which I understand will consider tomorrow whether the petition shall be printed. The treatment of the aborigines has exercised the minds of our people for very many years. Much legislation relating to them has been passed, but very little of it has been effective. To illustrate the governmental attitude in the early days of Australian settlement, I shall quote from a proclamation issued by Sir John Hindmarsh, Governor of South Australia, in December, 1836I t is also, at this time especially, my duty to apprize the colonists of my resolution to take every lawful means for extending the same protection to the native population as to the rest of His Majesty's subjects, and of my firm determination to punish with exemplary severity all acts of violence or injustice which may in any manner be practised or attempted against the natives, who are to be considered as much under the safeguard of the law as the colonists themselves, and equally entitled to the privileges of British subjects. I trust therefore with confidence to the exercise of moderation and forebearance by all classes in their intercourse with the native inhabitants and that they omit no opportunity of assisting me to fulfil His Majesty's most gracious and benevolent intentions towards them, by promoting 1 their advancement in civilization, and, ultimately, under the blessing of Divine Providence, their conversion to the Christian faith. That was the official attitude of the British Government at that time. Since then abuses have been practised against the natives u n t i l the population has dwindled from about 300,000 to about 60,000, mainly because of criminal neglect and sometimes criminal persecution. There is a general idea that the aboriginal of Australia is of a very low type, some persons going so far as to say that he is the lowest type of human being in the world. I shall quote, not my own opinion, but that of persons who have lived amongst the natives and studied their habits. Dr Basedow says The two mightiest tribes which ever lived in Australia lived in the lower Northern Territory, viz., Arunndta and Aluridga. Intellectually these tribes, especially the former, take. a. foremost place amongst all primitive groups. Captain S. A. White, of South Australia, says- , r ' The Australian aborigines are the greatest naturalists thatever were, or ever will be. The wonderful intellectual growth of the Australian aborigines, their astonishing system of automatic government, and their wise laws and complete system of philosophy have been referred to by Dr Chewings, Sir Arthu r Keith, Dr Andrew Lang, Dr Basedow, DrRamsay Smith, und other eminent anthropologists. Bishop Gilbert White, who for a number of years was Bishop of Carpentaria, is one of the greatest authorities on the blacks, and he said that he did not believe that the Australian aboriginal was the lowest of the various races of the world. The innate degeneracy theory as to the Australian aborigines has been exploded  Dr Ramsay Smith and other anthropologists. In 1S26 Surgeon Cunningham, in his book "" Two weeks in New South Wales,"" wrote that the aboriginals were a stately, healthy race, easily civilized. All accounts from 1820-1850 refer to the aborigines in similar terms. There is no doubt that the native has deteriorated both morally ancl physically because of contact with the whites. Mr Buckley at the Inland Mission conference stated:Before the entrance of the white races, the aboriginal was an upright and clean man, both morally and physically. According to information solicited from the oldest and most intelligent of the natives, neither syphilis nor gonorrhoea was known prior to the occupation of this country by Europeans. There is abundant evidence from many sources on that point. The western Aluridga and Wonga Pitch a tribes inhabiting the Peterman n and other ranges are free from those diseases because they have not come into contact with whites. [Quorum formed]. One of the principal reasons for r,he rapid decline of the blacks is the lack of protection by governments. The Minister for Home ancl Territories (Mr M a r r ) is in sympathy with the natives, and I think that he wijl do everything that lies within his power to give them some reliefHe will be responsible, however, if things are allowed to go on as they are. I have mentioned the sufferings of the natives as a result of disease, but only recently in Western Australia there was an occur138] rence to which the Advertiser refers in these wordsWhat may be called the Kimberly atrocities may well set the checks of humane people everywhere aflame with indignation, and they will certainly supply the friends of the aborigines throughout the Commonwealth with a text for much eloquent discourse. Mr G. T. Hood, S.M., the royal commissioner, leaves to others the apportioning of the guilt, but he finds the evidenec conclusive that eleven aborigines were shot and tlieir bodies burnt. Perhaps something may yet be learned about the nineteen other blacks who) in the commissioner's opinion, probably shared the fate of the eleven. If it came to the ears of the people of Australia that about 30 white people had been shot down, there would have been a great deal more notice taken of it than was taken of these atrocities. Just because the victims were black people, and because, in the opinion of some people the sooner the natives die out the better, the country is prone to take little notice of occurrences of this nature. They say, "" Oh, it was only a blackfellow."" Here is a further comment from Mr Arthu r James Vogar, F.R.G.S.:In 1889-00 I wrote my book, Black l'olicn, obtainable in your public library. I then calculated that about 5,000 natives had been rounded up arid killed by native police within three or four years, and twice that number had been poisoned, shot, or otherwise destroyed by settlers. Dr Ramsay Smith, M . D . , D.S.C., E.R.S., saidThe problem of what to do witli the race, the most interesting at present on earth, and the least deserving to be exterminated by us, and the most wronged at our hands, is not a difficult one to solve, were a solution really desired. Further, he goes on to sayWhat .might have been the position of the Australian blacks today if we had not been too much engrossed with our own affairs to give them the proper kind of help? The individual treatment nieted out to some of the natives is very bad, and here is a typical example. It is the case of a black boy who was engaged in breaking colts. He was thrown and rolled on. The result was that his leg was broken, he was unable to work, and was dismissed. Much excellent work is being done amongst the natives by the Hermannsberg Mission. If our governments in the past had been actuated by the same high motives, and had carried on the same good work, we would not now be before the courts of the world answering a charge of neglecting the black people of Australia. to the blacks controlled by this Dr II. Basedow said-"" The state of health of the blacks is excellent, and the condition of the camps thoroughly nic."" This mission tackled the problem of looking after the'blacks in the most difficult part of the Commonwealth. have been in their present position since JS77, before the completion of the line as far as Oodnadatta. Even since the completion of that line in 1890, they are still over 300 miles from the railway. last week I received figures from the chairman of the mission, stating that the railway charges for supplies for one year amounted to £190, and the charges for camel freight came to over £500. mission was established, in 1877 by two men, Missionaries Kempt and Schwarz. It has established a church which was built over 30 years ago, and there are, in addition, some splendid station buildings. It grows all sorts of vegetables, and the station work is done, to a great extent, by the male aborigine?. These men do cattle mustering, colt breaki ng, ancl other outdoor work. The women are taught sewing and domestic duties. I wish to pay a tribute also to the work of Pastor Strewlow, who gave his life to helping the aborigines. He mastered their language so successfully that he was able to complete a translation of St. Luke's Gospel into the Arunndta Unfortunately, he stayed at his work too long, ancl died shortly after leaving the mission to recuperate. When we find devoted men of this kind prepared to sacri fice so much for their ideals, surely it is not too much to ask that we should do something to tackle this problem, even if it sliould cost the Commonwealth something to do so. Now let me touch on the subject of the establishment of a native State. It was not my idea, but I fear that that there are some honourable members who have a wrong idea, of what this aboriginal State Some people have the idea that we who advocate an aboriginal State wish House to pass a resolution tomorrow, and start the State the next day. have no such desire; but we say that the time is over-ripe  a beginning should be made with the establishment of such a State.
