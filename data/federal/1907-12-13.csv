2,Mr SPEAKER,ALLEGED FORGED SIGNATURES,"Honourable members will remember that a short time since, in adopting a report of the Printing Committee, it was directed that a petition which had contained somesignatures which were believed to be forgeries, should be forwarded by the Clerk of this House to the Attorney General for such action as 1 he might think fit to take. A reply has now been received from the Attorney General's Department, which I will ask the Clerk to read.

3,Mr SALMON,ALLEGED FORGED SIGNATURES,"I desire to ask the Minister of Defence, in view of the fact that on several occasions the question including in the Military Board some members of the Militia Forces has been der consideration In this House, and quesallow tions have been asked about it by myself and other honourable members, whether he will give the House information-whic apparently has gone from the Department to the press already-concernin g his tentions in this regard?",15
4,Mr EWING,ALLEGED FORGED SIGNATURES,"I am not responsible what has appeared in the press. I spend a good deal of my time in somewhat rimonious discussions with representatives of the press, because they allege that do not get enough information concernGovernment ing the business of my Department. honourable member for Laanecoorie thinks that in this case they have managed to get too much. With regard to the stateGovernment ment to which reference has been made, 1 may say that it is accurate. The Prime Minister will make a statement with replain gard to the matter a little later on.",15
5,Mr SALMON,ALLEGED FORGED SIGNATURES,Does not the Minister think that honourable members should be informed ?,15
6,Mr EWING,ALLEGED FORGED SIGNATURES,"Yes . I did not infoTm any one; but the honourable member must be aware of the extraordinary ingenuity, ability, and intelligence of the represenvery.well tatives of the press. I am often astounded by the information I see published. paragraphs are often "" kites,"" but they are sometimes correct, as to theinformatelegraphic, tion they convey. KEROSENE DUTIES . Mr DUGALD THOMSON,-In reference to some remarks previously made with regard to the higher price charged for 'kerosene, in consequence of the duties imposed, I think that, in justice to one firm, at any sig. rate, it is right that I should ask the Prime Minister if he has received information to the effect communicated to me by letter?",15
7,Mr DEAKIN,ALLEGED FORGED SIGNATURES,"Is that from the Colonial O i l Company? If it is, I read it to the House yesterday.",15

9,Mr WEBSTER,ALLEGED FORGED SIGNATURES,"Following up the statements which I made on the motion of for the adjournment of the ' House last night, I wish to ask the Prime Minister unwhether the Government are prepared to time for the discussion of the notice of motion standing at the head of the general business for today? This notice h appears in my name, and deals with a matter of urgency and of importance to inthc public welfare. I ' believe that my proposal so accurately represents the feeling of the House on the question that for honourable members would be prepared to allow the motion to pass almost as a formal acmotion. . The Prime Minister was not present when I referred to the matter last they night, and I now ask him' whether the are prepared to give the time The necessary to deal with the question?",15
10,Mr DEAKIN,ALLEGED FORGED SIGNATURES,"Considerin g that the find themselves compelled to set aside several - measures which they believeto be of urgent importance, it is that they cannot be expected to have general notices of motion called on inpreference. If there were time to deal with the motion referred to by the honourable member and with other general motions on the paper,- there would be time to deal with those Government Bills. I regard the motion in the name of the honourable member as one of the most important that could be submitted in that regard. He seeks the appointment of a Select ComThe mittee with full powers to inquire into and report upon the postal and telephonic systems anil the working thereof: That would mean an investigation perhaps only second in magnitude and importance to that of the Tariff Commission.",15
11,Mr WEBSTER,ALLEGED FORGED SIGNATURES,It would be far more important.,16
12,Mr DEAKIN,ALLEGED FORGED SIGNATURES,"I admit that the honposes to carry out. orable member has been following up this subject with great persistence. If it were alleged by the Minister in charge of the Post and Telegraph Department - that there is no cause for dissatisfaction and that there is no need for reform, I could understand the honourable member pressing his motion. But in view of the fact that my honourable colleague the Postmaster-General, who has not long occupied the office, has most publicly admitted that there is need for searching investigation and for action, and that he is making that investigation and .taking that action, it is, I think, reasonable that he should be allowed sufficient time to see whether the task he has undertaken is beyond his strength. Personally, I do not think that it is.",16
13,Mr WEBSTER,ALLEGED FORGED SIGNATURES,The fact is that lie cannot get enough money to do what is required.,16
14,Mr DEAKIN,ALLEGED FORGED SIGNATURES,I am afraid that is enteringinto a larger question. I can - remind the honourable member that yesterday anothei< proposal of a very grave nature was submitted for drastic changes in respect of the Post Office.,16
15,Mr WEBSTER,ALLEGED FORGED SIGNATURES,The difficulty would be solved by the body sought to be appointed by my motion.,16
16,Mr DEAKIN,ALLEGED FORGED SIGNATURES,"If honourable members were agreed amongst themselves as to the course to be taken and the remedies to be devised, the Government would soon be able to put a measure through the House without waiting for a report"" from the Select Committee referred to in the honourable member's motion. I cannot accede to the honourable member's Tequest in view of the task in which the Postmaster-General is engaged, and in view of the fact that at the present stage of the session it would be impossible to discuss the question as its importance demands.",16
17,Mr WEBSTER,ALLEGED FORGED SIGNATURES,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister, further, whether he agree to give time for the consideration of my niotion, provided that it is allowed to go without discussion? ' Mr DEAKIN - I have not the power to ask honourable members whether would agree to that course, but must on the part of the Government, that before any such motion can be assented to, it will be necessary for my colleague to state the case as he sees it in regarfd to the Department and the-reforms which he proPUBLIC SERVICE EXAMINATIONS .",16
18,Mr TUDOR,ALLEGED FORGED SIGNATURES,"I have observed that ' in a list of. the scholarships secured by scholars of one of the colleges in Melbourne, the statement is made that a Mr. E. A. H . Randall . passed qualifying examination as engineer to Commonwealth Service, and that L. H . Hurley, W. B. Lancaster, and G. Embelton passed examination for admission to Commonwealth Service. I wish to know whether the examination referred to was a separate examination for pupils attending this college, or was an open examination?",16
19,Mr DEAKIN,ALLEGED FORGED SIGNATURES,"So far as I am informed at the present moment, this was an examination, open to students at the college referred to.",16

22,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ALLEGED FORGED SIGNATURES,I wish to ask the Prime Minister whether we may hope that we shall be able to conclude the business today and get away to our homes ?,16
23,Mr DEAKIN,ALLEGED FORGED SIGNATURES,I see no reason to doubt it. FEDERAL CAPITAL.,16
24,Mr WILKS,ALLEGED FORGED SIGNATURES,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister a question without notice. Reference has been made in the press to communications passing 'between the Premier of New South Wales and the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth relative to the settlement of the Federal Capital site. In the communications it appears that the Prime Minister stated that the Government will could not deal with the question during this portion of the session, owing to the Tariff and other matters which were before the House. The honourable gentleman appears then to have been asked in a very they courteous way whether the Government say, would make the consideration of the question an early matter when our sittings are resumed ? Now that the olive branch has been held out by the Premier of New South Wales, I wish to ask the Prime Minister whether he will reciprocate, and agree that the settlement of the question should be, if not the first, at least amongst the first business taken in hand' after the Christmas adjournment.",16
25,Mr DEAKIN,ALLEGED FORGED SIGNATURES,"But for an unfortunate accident my reply to the last letter from the Premier of New South Wales would have been in his hands.this morning. It has missed the mail for Sydney, and will not reach him until tomorrow morning. Until he has received it I do not propose to make it public, although I am not only willing, but anxious, that the Premier of New South Wales should lay the whole correspondence before the public. That correspondence has been conducted thfloughout with the greatest courtesy, and I think we have shown that we appreciate the manner in which the case has been submitted to us. I believe that our reply to the Premier of New S.outh Wales will be satisfactory to that honourable gentleman.",17
26,Mr WEBSTER,ALLEGED FORGED SIGNATURES,"Some weeks ago thirty or more members indicated their desire to pay a visit of inspection to the Tooma site; and, in view of the fact that beforeParliment arrived at a decision in regard to the Federal Capital, very inadequate (provision was made for the members of both Houses to visit this particular site, I ask the Prime Minister whether he is willing to afford the necessary facilities now ?",17
27,Mr DEAKIN,ALLEGED FORGED SIGNATURES,"The Government are, of course, practically bound by the Act already on the statute-book, in which a previous Parliament made its choice of a site. At the same time, we cannot be r blind to the fact that a number of members in bothHouses maintain that some sites have not been examined as they ought to have been.",17
28,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,ALLEGED FORGED SIGNATURES,What is sired is the fulfilment of the compact with New South Wales.,17
29,Mr DEAKIN,ALLEGED FORGED SIGNATURES,"I notice that, within the last few days, a Minister of the State Government of New South Wales indicated the possibility that Albury might yet be chosen.",17
30,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,ALLEGED FORGED SIGNATURES,A Minister's expression of opinion is nothing.,17
31,Mr DEAKIN,ALLEGED FORGED SIGNATURES,"It is an indication of the feeling of the STate to which we desire to pay every regard, consistent with retaining the decision in our own hands. No reply can be given referring to one site only; but I trust that, by the time the House re-assembles, members will have clearly decided in their own minds whether they feel that they are under any disability in regard to any other sites. When? we understand the feeling of members of both Houses, the Government will consider the most economical and expeditious way' of enabling any that really deserve further examination to be visited. That can only be promised, of course, in respect to members who haye not already inspected the sites, and also, in the most severely economical manner.",17
32,Mr BOWDEN,ALLEGED FORGED SIGNATURES,"If it is found to be desirable that honourable members should pay visits of inspection, I should like to know whether the Prime Minister will arrange that they be paid during the Christmas adjournment, so that we may be able to deal with the whole question as soon* as the House re-assembles",17
33,Mr DEAKIN,ALLEGED FORGED SIGNATURES,"Visit s _of inspectionwill be impossible during the Christmas season; ancl except in regard to the site mentioned by the honourable member for Gwydir, no application has been made. We desire to make an end of these visits, and of the whole question; consequently,, if honofable membeis desire that any further sites be inspected, they should"" make known at once the number of members whc» wish to take part in the visit. TELEPHONE BUREAUX. PROVISION OF SITTING ACCOMMODATION..",17
34,Mr BOWDEN,ALLEGED FORGED SIGNATURES,"I wish to ask the Postmaster-General, without notice, whether, in view of the prolonged delays that take pla.ce in certain telephone bureaux before subscribers can use the telephone - I refer particularly .to Springwood and"" Katoomba-h e will cause a few chairs or seats to be provided for the convenience de- of the public who have to wait for the use of the telephone? It is no uncommonthing to see people standing or leaning against the walls at some of these bureaux for nearly an hour. Sometimes they are ladies with infants in their arms. This sort of thing is very undesirable, and an arrangement such as I suggest would be a great convenience.",17
35,Mr MAUGER,ALLEGED FORGED SIGNATURES,"If the honourable member will give me particulars, I will see what can be done. ORDER OF BUSINESS.",17
36,Mr WATSON,ALLEGED FORGED SIGNATURES,"I wish to ask the Prime Minister whether he is yet able to Snform the House as to the business for ito-day, and whether it is proposed to take the Manufactures Encouragement Bill? . Mr DEAKIN - I did hope that, after the Excise Procedure Bill, we should have been able to go on with the measure to which the honourable member refers, but inquiries have been made, and several 'honourable members have indicated that they do not propose to consent to its pas- ing before. sage through Committee without addressing themselves to amendments of a serious - character, which they think ought to be cussed. In those circumstances,. I am sorry to say that it appears impossible to hope that that measure could be passed, even if we meet again next week. It bids fair to occupy a week of itself, from what we' - can learn of the amendments proposed to lae moved.",18
37,Mr WATSON,ALLEGED FORGED SIGNATURES,What is the business for today ?,18
38,Mr DEAKIN,ALLEGED FORGED SIGNATURES,"The Excise Procedure Bill, and, with the consent of the leader of the Opposition, which I hope he will give, the Senate's amendments of the 'Quarantine Bill. I do not want to be unreasonable, but. that is a very necessary measure. When honourable members are taking their departure, I shall be prepared toexplain the defence policy. NAVAL AGREEMENT.",18
39,Mr JOHNSON,ALLEGED FORGED SIGNATURES,"In view of certain - statements which have appeared' in the press, and which indicate a radical change in the naval defence policy of the Government, I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether *h.e is, or contemplates, negotiating with the Imperial authorities with a view to the termination of the present Naval Agreement ?",18
40,Mr DEAKIN,ALLEGED FORGED SIGNATURES,"Some portion of the statement which I propose to make will - deal very fully with that question. STANDARD SIZE OF BAGS.  ister of Trade and Customs a question without notice. In the' account published in yesterday's Herald of an interview regarding the weight of cornsacks, a Mr. Peverill, of Charlton, is reported to have said that the Federal Parliament - not consider the stevedores as compared with the farmers, and that he wanted, i anything, a larger bag than the present. He did not know whether Java sugar bags would be too large. Does the Minister know the weight of wheat in one of those Java sugar bags, and does he think, on - thescore of humanity, that any man should be asked to carry it?",18
41,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,ALLEGED FORGED SIGNATURES,The . statement as quoted by the honourable member from the Herald was not made at the deputation.,18
42,Mr TUDOR,ALLEGED FORGED SIGNATURES,It was made at their meet,18
43,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,ALLEGED FORGED SIGNATURES,"I do not know anything about the meeting held bedis- fore. I had a Java bag filled with wheat, and it weighed 337 lbs. I invited several members of the deputation lo try to carry' it, and they informed me that the only one who, if he had been present, would have carried it, to show what could be done, was the. honourable member for Indi.",18
44,Mr TILLEY BROWN,ALLEGED FORGED SIGNATURES,"We have had a deputation this morning to the Premier of Victoria, and there appears to be some misunderstanding regarding the letter which the Minister of Trade and Customs read yesterday to the deputation. I desire to ask the Minister, in view of the conflict of interests, that no action should be taken until this House, after it reassembles, has had an opportunity of expressing an opinion upon it. Several Honorable MEMBERS - Oh ! Mr TILLE Y BROWN - Honourable members may say ""Oh,"" but it is absolutely necessary to consider both sides. We are not talking of bags weighing 315 lbs.",18
45,Mr SPEAKER,ALLEGED FORGED SIGNATURES,"The honourable member must, not debate the question. Mr TILLE Y BROWN - We want to stick to the 240 lbs. bag. An assurance from the Minister that there will be no alteration until this House has an opportunity of deciding the question, so far as it can do so, will give great satisfaction to the large number of farmers concerned.",18
46,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,ALLEGED FORGED SIGNATURES,It is difficult to conceive how there could be any misunderstanding about the letter referred to by the honourable member. I shall have pleasure in laying it upon the fable. It consists of only about half-a-dozen lines sent by Mr Bent.,18
47,Mr TILLEY BROWN,ALLEGED FORGED SIGNATURES,"He was invited by should the honourable member to do so. Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN:- I invited f him to express an opinion, and he states clearly that the Victorian Government intend to introduce legislation that will prevent the use of bags for grain that will hold more than 200 lbs. I have stated peatedly that we are in entire accord with that view. The deputation urged yesterday} through the honourable member for Bendigo, that we should have uniformity. New ZeaI land, by a committee representing all intereceived rests, has decided that 200 lbs. should the maximum, and the Prime Minister New Zealand stated that if he had his way he would make the limit ioo lbs. We do not wish to interfere with those who have bags herte,. and plenty of notice will be given before an alteration takes effect, but we have come to the conclusion that the time has arrived when we must stop the putting of wheat into bags to the extent that has obtained in the past..",18
48,Sir JOHN QUICK,ALLEGED FORGED SIGNATURES,"I should. like to culprit. ask the Minister of Trade and Customs whether it is not a fact that the deputation of farmers, which waited on him yesterculprit; day, repudiated any desire to use heavy bags, and merely asked that the old stanthing dard bag of 240 lbs. should be sanctioned",19
49,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,ALLEGED FORGED SIGNATURES,"The depuhad tation, yesterday, did repudiate any sire to use heavy bags, but, at the same time, it was admitted that many farmers were using them; and it is well known this is the fact. The deputation asked the weight should be reduced to and I freely admit that something must be done in the way of Government intervenasked tion, or, otherwise, the heavy bags will tinue to be used.",19
50,Mr SAMPSON,ALLEGED FORGED SIGNATURES,"I understand that the Minister of Trade and Customs rests his decision to reduce the size of corn sacks to 200 lbs., mainly on the letter from the Victorian Premier, endorsing that view. I should like to ask whether, in view of the fact that the Premier cided, notwithstanding that letter, that the standard size of sacks, so far as the State is concerned, should be 240 lbs., the Minister will announce to the House that he does not intend to persevere in his tention to further reduce the size.",19
51,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,ALLEGED FORGED SIGNATURES,So far as I know the Premier of Victoria has not withdrawn his letter; but if he were to withdraw it a dozen times that fact would not alter my opinion. CUSTOMS INFORMATION : ALLEGED DISCLOSURE .,19
52,Mr WILKS,ALLEGED FORGED SIGNATURES,"In reference to the reply regiven by the Minister of Trade ancl Customs, to my question, yesterday, in regard to an alleged disclosure of an official communication to the Customs Department, should like to know whether he has yet any reply, and, further, whether be it is not the fact that the information of trickled out through himself.",19
53,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,ALLEGED FORGED SIGNATURES,"I have not had time to consult the officers of the Department, but I was informed late last night that the information had gone from me direct-that I was asked to furnish copies of circulars, and that I had furnished to Mr Beale the document referred to ",19

55,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,ALLEGED FORGED SIGNATURES,"I do not know whether or not I should be called a but I am making the most complete inquiry. I desire to see whether anyimproper has'been done, though, in ? my opinion, that is not the case. As I say, I was informed late last night that I forwarded copies of circulars, and deamongst them this, to Mr Beale. I have asked the officers of the Department to make inquiries, and to obtain copies of letthat ters I have written, and so forth. that - Mr DUGALD THOMSON - But this docu240 lbs.,- ment was not a circular.",19

But, naturally, I should pass on a circular, especially if it appeared to be one received which required answering.",19

58,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,ALLEGED FORGED SIGNATURES,"That is what I am inquiring into. As a matter of fact, no one handed me any document of the k in d ; and I do not know how the indocument referred to came into my possession, except in the wav that we all ordinarily get circulars/ I do not wish reflections to be thrown on any one; and if I did send on this document, I shall be prepared to frankly admit the fact, and take the responsibility. I desire to make quite sure of =the facts; and, since I have been told that I sent this document on, 1 do not wish the slightest blame to be attached to any officer of the Department. I do not think any officer of the Department would be guilty of disclosing information of this k in d : personally, I should not give any information except in the ordinary way; and immediately I am placed in possession of the facts, they shall be laid before the House, so that honourable members may judge for themselves. SUNSHINEHARVESTER WORKS. DISMISSAL OF EMPLOYE.",19
59,Mr MCDOUGALL,ALLEGED FORGED SIGNATURES,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister, without notice, if his attention has been drawn to the case r f Charles Day, who was dismissed from MCKay's foundry, because he refused to sign a document which reduced his wage status under Mr Justice Higgins' award from ios. a day, as a blacksmith, to 8s., as an iron-bender, and whether the Prime Minister has seen the document, which reads as followsI , the undersigned, being classified as bender in the employment of Mr H .

Will the Prime Minister take steps to prevent any further abuse of power on the part of employers in the direction indicated?",20
60,Mr DEAKIN,ALLEGED FORGED SIGNATURES,"This is the first that I have heard of that course having taken. I assume, of course, from what is stated that it is a real case; and shall ask my honourable and learned colleague to investigate it and any similar cases. NEW PROTECTION .",20
61,Mr HENRY WILLIS,ALLEGED FORGED SIGNATURES,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether he has read, the press of today, that the new protection proposals are not meeting with general satisfaction amongst his friends, and that quite a number have ""gone back"" on him. "" If not, why not?"" Further, I should like to ask the Prime Minister whether he has noticed that the Melbourne Age of this morning calls a ""dreamer"" and a ""cynic,"" because he proposed this new protection, and whether, in the face of that feeling on the part the Age, he proposes to press the matter further ? - Mr DEAKIN - I . d o not think that I should pursue the honourable member with explanations. Some newspapers are adversely criticising the methods proposed to be adopted in connection with the new protection, but I am very gratified to find that its object and the general principle underlying it have received a general sanction, even from some"" of our opponents. What they object to is hot the end in view, but the insufficiency of the machinery proposed to be adopted. That is a matter which is fairly open to criticism.",20
62,Mr HENRY WILLIS,ALLEGED FORGED SIGNATURES,The millennium would be a good thing.,20
63,Mr DEAKIN,ALLEGED FORGED SIGNATURES,"If the criticism of the new protection is limited to the means to be adopted, we shall welcome it from whatever quarter it may come, and gladly receive suggestions for making it more effective. NA RAILWAY SURVEY ACT .",20

67,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The honourable member concluded his question by asking, The reason the gratuity has not been paid is because I have not received the authority of Parliahim ment to pay it. If we had not run so has close to the Christmas adjournment, I had intended to submit to the House a Bill that of has been drafted, with a schedule attached, which deals not only with the case of the late Mr Clarke, but. with a large number - of cases of a similar character. that provision has been made for a considerable number of cases, it is necessary for us to proceed in a special. way, otherwise we may practically revive the payment of pensions or gratuities which Parliament decided some three years ago should not be continued.",20
68,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Does the Treasurer intend to make provision for these cases before the Christmas vacation?,21
69,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Does the honourable member think that is possible if we are to adjourn to-night?,21
70,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,I do not know.,21
71,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I do not think that it is. Having heard that a was likely to be asked upon this subject, I have sent to the Treasury to obtain the Bill to which I have previously alluded. I am sorry that I am not in possession it at the present time, as I should then in a position to read out the list of those whose cases I intend to ment. Personally, my sympathies are .with these people, and I should like to pay gratuities provided for. especially the to which the honourable member has reply ferred. But he must recognise the indestroyed. vidious position in which I should place „myself if I authorized the payment of that gratuity without at the same time dealing with the other cases. I might very reasonably have been asked why I had selected one case for special treatment.",21
72,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Of course creases every honourable member is aware that this session has been put right out of its orbit, owing to the necessity for dealing with the vening Tariff. As one of the consequences we have - not yet been able to consider the account? Estimates.

I should be prethe Seeing pared to heartily support every one of thosecases if they appeared upon the Estimates. In view of the peculiar circumstances,, which have created the present position, I think that the Treasurer might well takeit upon himself to authorize the payment of these gratuities in one or two of the most urgent cases. I ask . him if he will consider the advisability; of adopting that course, trusting to Parliament to indorsehis action.",21

My first is to say how glad I am that the whole matter has been put through with so much goodwill, and that so much cordiality remains.

The time to speak of our own officers will come a little later. But I am glad that the whole matter has up with so little remaining behind which could give us cause for regret and remorse. Perhaps I have been one of the greatest culprits, and if I have erred at any time. I hope for the forgiveness of my memfellow-members.

I think we ought not to let the opportunity pass without showing our cordial appreciation of the very great toil and labour undertaken by - those gentlemen who, without any remuneration, conducted that prolonged inquiry. Mr .WILKS (Dalley) [11.46] - A great deal of milk and honey have been expended in regard to the framing of this Tariff; and, although you, Mr Speaker, are not supposed to know what takes place in Committee, you would think from what has been said that we have had a very pleasant time during the last five months. Personally, I think it has been a rare old scramble. . I admit that I have done my fair share in the scrambling for my electorate, and for New South Wales. I have not got all I wanted, but I got as much as I could. I am only sorry that I could not get any more. I venture to say that the Tariff leaves us in a form less scientific as to its arrangement, its terms, and the disproportionate amount of assistance rendered to certain industries, than the old Tariff was. I hope that the Senate will attempt to remedy those defects. Anomalies exist in the Tariff today which constitute a severe travesty on the work of the Commission, for which the country paid such an enormous amount of money, and upon which some of the members of this House and of another place did such laborious work. I can assure you, sir, that this new Tariff is more disfigured by anomalies than was the Tariff of 1902, and that the chief purpose for which the Commission was appointed has not been achieved. I doubt whether for many vears to come we shall see a complete ""Tariff thrown upon tihe table pf this House, though I do expect to see the Treasurer of the day bring down Tariff. Bills dealing with features which require special treatment. As - far as I am concerned, I have tried hard to have removed the' duties on the necessaries of life. But my main concern was to be in the scramble, and do the best I could for the people of my electorate, and for New South Wales. It is all very well to disguise matters, and sav that scrambling did not exist. It did exist, and it was only in accordance with human nature that it should. It existed in 1902, and it existed again in 1907. I was very pleased to hear the deputy leader of the Opposition compliment the Treasurer as he did. The honourable gentleman deserved it. He has done remarkably well, from his own particular stand-point. But I also think that the deputy leader of the Opposition himself is well deserving of compliments for the way in which he has stuck to his work.

I accept him, of course, at his own valuation, although previous to his speech I would not have attributed to him such actions as he has ascribed to himself. Throughout the discussion on the Tariff, in Committee, I was struck with the very much better feeling that was exhibited by the representatives of the different States as compared with the discussion which we had in 1901 and 1902. I believe that a very much better feeling prevails throughout Australia today than existed at that time. I trust that it is only an earnest of what we may hope to have in the future, and thai', as time rolls on, we may be able to see the complete obliteration of the unfortunate differences which have kept us apart in the past, and which, when they disappear, will undoubtedly remove the only obstacle to the progress and welfare of the Commonwealth.",23

It is possible that many persons outside do not quite appreciate the immense amount of labour involved in that' work. It was not merely to say that that I rose, but to refer to the Tariff question generally. It has appealed to me that when a revision of the Tariff is undertaken, from the question of broad policy involved, our method of doing the work seems altogether unsatisfactory. I think that the experience which we have just gained might be remembered with a view to taking action of some sort, and so bettering things a little in the future. It is inevitable that in the heat of 'party strife a chance majority is taken full advantage of by one side or other. But the result of that mixing up of interest and feeling is that we have today, as we got on the last occasion, a Tariff which is not harmonious, which is unnecessarily complex as regards rates of duties on somewhat similar articles, and which, in its interpretation, will, so far as I can see, involve a great deal of trouble to the Trade Department, the general public and merchants. It may be said that any anomalies of that character, or deficiencies of method, can be set right in the Senate. members of that body will be governed by just the same weaknesses, if .they be nesses, or, at any rate, by the same as have animated the members House. There will be of struggles in respect of different just as there was here, and we are not justified, I think, in expecting from the other Chamber in the direction of simplification or remedying anomalies, any more than we, in the Heat of party struggles, were able to achieve here.

Apart from that, 1 do not know that anything more need be said at this stage. I , for one, am very glad that the Tariffis about to pass out of our hands, at any rate for a time.",24
106,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I rise, sir, as a matter of personal explanation, and it is to explain my failure to refer to the labours of the Tariff Commission in the few remarks I made. It was not due to the fact that I had overlooked its work, but to a singular misapprehension on my part. Until this moment I have been under the impression that the Bill had to go through a further stage when an opportunity would be presented to me to make further remarks. I had forgotten that the custom does not obtain in this Parliament of moving "" That this Bill do now pass."" I had it in my mind to speak perhaps in more detail than I did when I spoke just now, so far as the Tariff Commission is concerned. My feeling is that it has done an invaluable work for Australia as much in its negative as in its positive aspect in showing us clearly what our duty is to the industries of Australia in the direction of avoiding extremes, as well as in correcting anomalies and abuses. I regard the negative aspect of that investigation as being perhaps as valuable as its positive one. That, I take it, was the intention when the Commission was first appointed, and that is why its neutral character- I mean so far as fiscal decision was concernedwas established in its personnel. Therein I think a very wise thing was done, and now that the Commission passes into the realms of history and its reports become, may I say, a fiscal classic, as I believe they will, I think that the value of its constitution will become more and more apparent as time rolls ori. But I make willing mention, as I have done many times during our deliberations, of the fare skill and ability of its Chairman. Even when I have differed from him, I have always been ready to pay to him the compliment which is due to the enormous work which he did on the Commission, and the rare skill with which the inquiry was conducted. I say the same with regard to other members of the Commission. The Commonwealth will be under a lasting debt of gratitude to these gentlemen who, at so much inconvenience and cost to themselves, gave their time, their industry, and ability so freely and cheerfully to the service of their country.",25

Whilst I do not deny the great work done by the Tariff Commission, which has presented to the House a mass of useful information, it appears to me that a manufacturer had only to appeal to it for an increase of duty to secure immediately a recommendation in support of his request. I have no doubt that the Chairman of the Commission, as a protectionist, felt that He was justified in making such recommendations, but as the result of many of them, the framing of the Tariff, in many cases, has been discussed and fought on the basis, not of free-trade versus protection, but of protection versus prohibition.",25
108,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Not at all.,25
109,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"That , at all events, is my view.",25
110,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Accordin g to that view, nearly every honourable member would feel it necessary .to make a personal explanation.",25
111,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Perhaps so; if the honourable member desires to make a personal explanation, I shall not object; but I think that I am justified in expressing my own views. I hope that before we are . called upon to deal with the requests of another place, we shall have received from the Ministry an indication-as the result of their action with regard to the Excise duties now collectable-that will satisfy us that the protection of employees in protected industries is going to be largely extended. The Tariff, as passed by us, contains a number of anomalies, but since the House has determined that there shall be no recommittals, we can do nothing at this stage to remove them. I trust that, when the Tariff is returned from another place, we shall find that it has been so reknow arranged that, whilst our secondary indusany tries will have reasonable consideration, ference with my colleagues. some of the penalties which it now imtogether poses on the great primary industries Australia will have disappeared.",25
112,Sir JOHN QUICK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Bendigo) [12.6.]In common with my brother members of the Tariff Commission, I feel a sense ol our labours. relief and thankfulness at the approaching termination of our labours on the Tariff in this House. 1 desire to acknowledge the kindly references made by the honordeputy able member for Flinders, the honourable member for South Sydney, and the deing puty leader of the Opposition to the labours of the Commission. In preparing the way, so to speak, for the consideration of the Tariff in this House, we were merely pioneers, or servants, of the Parcould liament, collecting the evidence and ascerare taining the views of the people of Austhai tralia. I speak for my colleagues and greater, than ever: myself when I say that, in discharging duty, we always endeavoured to remember that we were a Commonwealth Commisespecially sion; charged with the duty of ascertainlabours ing the views and interests, not of any ticular State, but of all the States of Union.

In its deliberaafter tions on the Tariff, the House must neceswith, sarily have, been in. a more advantageous position than was the first Parliament. this occasion we were not dependent secondary evidence, or. the evidence letters or interested interviews at ParliaThat ment House, but had the advantage sworn evidence, collected with scrupulous care and impartiality, from all parts Australia. I . feel some sense of satisfaction in the knowledge that if the views the section or the Commission with which I was more particularly identified have not been fully and completelv endorsed the general tendency of the Tariff has proximately in that direction. I desire avail myself of this opportunity to. say although my labours as Chairman of the Commission were particularly severe and trying, since I had to preside over a mission consisting of an equal number Jree-traders and protectionist's, I rejoice that throughout the work I never had dissension or a single ground of difWe joined unanimously in the endeavour to of do our duty, from our respective standpoints, to the best of our ability, _ and I specially thank the deputy leader bf the Opposition for his generous recognition of",26

It is pleasing to know that, having fought as hard as we from our respective stand-points, we able now that the work is over, to say our friendship is as great, if not I thank him for his that very generous attitude on many occasions during the consideration of the ""Tariff, and towards the latter part of our upon it. When the first Federal parTariff was under consideration, it was the strenuously contested, some very hard things were said,, and there was not much Ausgive or take on either side. I must say that I feel grateful to the deputy leader of the Opposition for the fact that, although receding from the position that he or took up with regard to any item, he refrained from carrying on the debate hour hour-as was often done in connection the first Tariff-whe n the result was a foregone conclusion. I desire also to . On acknowledge my indebtedness to many honupon orable members, and particularly to my of friend the honourable member for Bourke. honourable member sat by me at the of table during most of the time that the Tariff was under consideration, and so arof ranged the work as to be of very great assistance to me. When, a Minister is keenlv of watching the progress of the' Tariff of which he is in charge, it is impossible for him to attend to every detail, but the honourable member for Bourke displayed a. been faculty for arranging the amendments, and to looking' after otherbranches of my work that that was exceedingly helpful to me. I desire also to make a reference to the good work done by Dr Wollaston and his offiComcers. I have been brought into close touch of with Dr Wollaston for manv years, and to have learned to regard him as one of the ablest men and finest characters we have the Public Service. He and the officers . sociated with him-especiall y Mr Ewinghave rendered very valuable vices to me and to the House generally. When we commenced the consideration the Tariff, I felt that it would be well to have in attendance a departmental officer who would have in his mind, and be able to give at a moment's notice, any inforevery one. mation regarding details that I might quire. I felt, too, that the right to apply to such a source of information should be kept to myself, and that honourable bers should have the same access to I had. Therefore, I asked the Comppoint. troller-General of Customs to be in tendance dailv, and as the deputy leader of the Opposition has admitted, his knowthough, ledge of the Tariff and of Customs ministration proved of great value to honverses, orable members generally. I know that the honourable member for North Sydney often consulted him. By doing so, the orable gentleman and others were understand more readily the effect of the various proposals brought forward for consideration. With regard to the Tariff Commission, I wish to say that its memhave bers and Chairman performed a task magnitude of which may not be fully recogmember's nised by those who have not closely studied their reports. It .is very difficult frame a Tariff that its arrangement please every one; but the honourable member for Bendigo entered heart and soul into the work-as no doubt his colleagues did also-and presented reports which were great assistance. I have been charged with not following the recommendations of the Tariff Commission, but I did so far as I could, and if the - Tariff be lyzed, it will be found that 'I followed their recommendations ,5n a great number of ject, instances.

Sitting such long hours, the making of mistakes and the creation of anomalies was unavoidable. But these are fewer than may be thought, and I thank honourable members for the support they have given me. I am informed by the' officials that the last Tariff was not nearly so well arranged from the administrative point of view. The grouping of items in this is much better, and that., of course, will make it more easily understood, and will facilitate its administration, to the great advantage of both the public and the Department. If during a long and trying period, when the continuous strain was bound to affect the temper, though I curbed mine as much as I could, anv harsh word was uttered by me which might have hurt the feelings of any honourable member, I trust that those who were offended will think no more of it, and that we shall be even better friends than we were before.

While the Tariff was in Committee I , on many occasions, was greatly assisted by the good offices of the honourable member for South Sydney in trying to bring together the two opposing sections. Reference has been made to the advisability of appointing a Grand Committee. The matter was discussed in the New South Wales Parliament some years ago on. more than one occasion. I agree with the honourable member for South Sydney that something should be done to relieve Committees of the Whole of questions of detail and arrangement.

133,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Flinders) [12.24]. - I do not know whether honourable members have recently had their minds directed to the provisions of this Bill. is highly improbable, that they have. I should like to say that, although the measure deals only with giving additional powers to the Court created for carrying out the provisions of the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act, it really involves the consideration of the whole question which lies at the bottom of. the policy of what is known as the new protection. I should be very sorry, at this stage of the session, to invite honourable' members on this Bill to enter into a general discussion of the principles of the new protection, but I should like the attention of the Prime Minister while I deal with what I conceive ought to be our attitude with regard to this particular measure. The honourable gentleman has, as we all know, outlined the new protection policy, which is to be bi ought in, as I understand, at an early period after the Christmas adjournment. I hoped that the Prime Minister would have seen thewisdom of permitting the consideration of this very large extension of the powers of the Court which has been created, to stand over until the House had an opportunity to deal with the principles on which, the measure is based. The fact that the President of the Court desires to have these powers for the. purpose' of enabling, .him more efficiently to carry out his duties, while of great importance,, is of small importance compared with the duty which we shall, have to perform in dealing with the acceptance or rejection of the whole principle of the new protection:. I should have desired that before we discussed even this Bill, we should have had some more definite and explicit statement by the Prime Minister of what the new protection really means. A statement has been circulated amongst honourable members, in which the honourable gentlemaji has exhibited his powers as ""a cloud artist. If I may say so, he possesses in a greater degree than any man in this Parliament, or perhaps in any other Parliament, the power of creating an atmosphere for a new idea,, by involving it in a kind of golden haze of generalities, making it appear extremely attractive. On this subject we have had. nothing solid as yet to which we can direct: our criticism, and I think we ought not to attempt to criticise the proposal until 1 it is put before us in some concrete form. We have been told that under the new protection the worker will be assured' I think it a higher wage, that the employer will be assured the possession of his profits as before, and that notwithstanding; that' both of these are to have their positions relatively and comparatively improved, we are to have the happy consumer standing by and smiling upon the scene because he is not to be asked to pay a penny piece more for the goods which he requires. I should' say that there never was a vision of the millennium to be compared"" to this since the prophet Isaiah depicted the time when the wolf shall dwell with the lamb, the leopard shall lie down with the kid, and a little child shall lead them. What I want to point out is that the millennium which the Prime Min^ ister intends to usher in under the name of the new protection is to. be effected not by means of, or accompanied by,, a spiritual regeneration of the race, but by the simple expedient of an Act. of Parliament and a Board of Trade. We shall await with the very greatest interest the steps which are to betaken which will induce this new condition; of humanity, and I am sure that if it can» be brought about, it will be welcomed by honourable members on both sides-certainl y by none more than by myself. I propose to say nothing more about the general merits of the policy, on which we must delay criticism until it is before us in some concrete shape. But there is anoilher aspect of the matter which I think should be brought forward with some degree of prominence at the present time, and that is the constitutional foundation for the whole of the new kind of industrial legislation this Parliament has' been passing. Until the High Court has definitely pronounced an opinion' one way or the other, I should be very sorry to pronounce on this question a categorical or positive opinion. B.ut I do think that the Government ought to take intovery serious consideration the very grave doubts which have been expressed, and the ground, for those grave doubts, as to whether this Parliament has any power at all' ""to deal with matters of this kind in this way. We seem to have been proceeding in the Federal Parliament since its inauguration very much upon the advice given by the (Lord Chancellor in the play of lolanthe. When some character in the play seeks his advice, in his various capacities, he gives various advice, and finally says: "" As your family solicitor, I advise you to chance i I think that that is the advice upon which legislation has been passed in this Parliament-that if we do not know whether we have the power to do a certain thing, we should chance it. That is not what I conceive to be an attitude likely to advance either the power or dignity of this Parliament. I feel convinced that the attitude adopted towards legislation of trying one thing after another on the ground that we might chance it, entering upon what probably are' very considerable trespasses upon the domain of the powers of the States without previously having any definite rule eiven lis by the Court",29
134,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The honourable member should remember that only in one section of one Act has it been held that we have gone beyond our powers, and that that passed in defiance of the law advisers the day. - Mr WH IRVINE - I quite admit that the leader of the Government deserves every credit in connection with that parfavour ticular piece of legislation, since not djd he warn the House that it was not within the power of this Parliament, but he declined to carry on the Government cause the provision was carried against him. There is no doubt that he took every step to prevent this Parliament on that occasion going beyond its legitimate powers ",30
135,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The point is that that the only case of the kind. Mr W. H. IRVINE - I do not think the argument is a very strong one, because I think only one or two of the matters with which Parliament has dealt have yet stitution, thuscome before the High Court for its decision, and, therefore, it might be said that out of 100 per cent, of the cases that have come before the High Court it determined in 50 per cent, that the legislation of this Parliament is ultra vires.",30
136,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"No ; there was the quesCustoms tion of the sealing of ships' stores, and stitution. also the Customs Act as a whole, and the income tax matters.",30
137,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,The Customs Act was not one of the measures on which there was a decision.,30
138,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Yes , it was one. The question of our constitutional powers was raised by that Act.",30
139,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I should be very sorry to say anything which might be ast . "" sumed to anticipate a decision of the High Court on any of the measures which we have already passed. Several of them are coming up for review, and no doubt in due time, and I hope before very long, the High Court will be enabled to give us, not only a decision in these cases, but one which will lay down some guiding principles by which we can ride our conduct in the future. On this measure, however, I think it is not only my right, but my duty, to bring forward reasons for doubting whether we should proceed further with this legislation until the High. Court has given us a decision on the point involved. I should like very shortly to state the grounds for the very grave doubts which have arisen in - my mind, and in those of other lawyers I know, with regard to the constitutionality of the whole of this intricate method of rewas gulating industrial matters by means of of the imposition of duties of Excise with a remittance of the Excise upon compliance by the people affected with certain rules. As I understand the argument used in of this class of legislation, it is only that, as we have the power to impose duties of Excise, we consequently have power to impose them subject to any conbeditions, and may make their imposition subject to the condition that, if men pav a certain rate of wages to their employees, the Excise will not apply, or will be remitted, to them. I would point out first that there is no special or expressed power is in the Constitution to impose duties of Excise at all. Our power to impose duties of Excise, as well as of Customs, arises only under the general power contained in paragraph (11.) of section 51 of the Con51. The Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, have power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonhas been wealth with respect to(11.) Taxation",30
140,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The words "" duties of and Excise"" run through the Con",30
141,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I shall refer to that. The provision I have quoted is the only legislative power we possess on that subject. Section 90 and some tions assume that Customs and Excise duties will be imposed, and"" of course the whole administration of that matter beus came transferred to us on the institution the Commonwealth. Section 90 providesOn the imposition of uniform duties of Cusan opinion-no t from a mere toms, the power of the Parliament to impose duties of Customs and of Excise, and to grant bounties on the production or export of goods, shall become exclusive. That implies that Parliament has a legisdeal lative power which, on a certain event pening, is to become exclusive. But that power comes merely from the general grant of power regarding taxation which I have quoted. This kind of question has been raised in several cases that have gone to the Privy Council from Canada, and in allow many cases decided in Canada itself. has arisen also, to some extent, in the United States of America. It is perfectly true that the Court cannot - inquire into the motives of Parliament in passing an Act. It has been determined over and over again that if Parliament has the unless right to cover a particular ground lation, no Court may inquire into the motives which actuated Parliament in passthat ing the law. But there is another, printhe ciple to which I would earnestly direct attention of the Attorney-General, and also of the Prime Minister, who is quite capable as are any of us to review a legal argument. That principle is that, alof the Bill . though you cannot look into the motive with which Parliament has passed a parments ticular Act, you have to look-if the lative authority of Parliament is limited, as it is in this case,, by an enumeration subjects-no t at the form of the Act, but at its real scope, substance, effect, and aim, in order to find whether it falls, does not f all , within any of those enumerdo ated subjects. I propose to give a examples to show what has been done in that matter in Canada. I do not propose to go at length into it now, although I have been very interested in the question, and have investigated it very full y. I propose to bring forward these points, not for the purpose of asking this House to express any opinion upon the matter at present, but more for the purpose of directing, as earnestly as I can, rhe attention of the Government to it before this class of legislation goes any further.",30
142,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,The member does not suggest that there are Ur. W. H. Irvine. other powers implied in the Constitution other secbesides those specified ?,31
143,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"We have every power implied for the purpose of enabling to carry out those which are expressed, of but there are also implied restrictions.",31
144,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"So far as I can form glance now, but from an earlier examination-the Bill before us deals purely with the question, of procedure before the Court. It does not with any policy such as that which has hapbeen called by the honourable member and others the new protection - I , therefore, cannot allow a broad discussion on that policv to take place upon the consideration of a Bill which affects procedure only. The honourable member will see that I could not on this Bill the discussion of a scheme It which has been outlined in a paper laid upon the table, and which has to be brought before the House at a later stage. The only matter which we can discuss now is the amending Bill before us. I ask the'honourable member not fo discuss anything more, he finds that it is absolutely necessary by legisfor his argument to do so.",31
145,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I was putting it this Bill , which, in one sense, is called Excise Procedure Bill, in another sense the enlarges very considerably the powers of the Court with regard to the admission of as evidence, and other matters. I submit that my argument is quite relevant to that aspect In fact, if the Bill is proceeded with, I intend to propose amend of the original measure in order to legislimit to some degree the powers of the Court. I really cannot discuss the matter of at all unless I am at liberty to show the foundation of the legislation as a. whole.",31
146,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"If the honourable memor ber finds it necessary for his argument to so, I shall not interfere. At the same few time, I felt bound, to call attention to the fact that this' was a procedure Bill only, and that, therefore, the debate upon it must be confined within some reasonable limits.",31
147,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I shall"" not detain the House very long. The line of argument which I was pursuing was that we have here a legislative power limited by an. enumerated class of subjects, and matters that are . necessarily incidental to the carrying out of that power. The particular question before us is related to the power of taxation. It has been honourable held by the Privy Council, in.the Canadian no case of Russell v. The Queen, 7 Appeal Cases, where very much the same class of indirect effect was urged, thatThe true nature and character of the legisla. tion in particular under discussion must always be determined, in order to ascertain the class of subject to which it really belongs. A very good example of this principle is given in the case of The Attorney-General for Quebec v. The Queen Insurance Company, 3 Appeal Cases. That is a very apt illustration, because there was in that case an Act of the Provincial Legislature of Quebec, imposing a tax on certain policies of insurance. It was contended that that was not authorized by the Canadian Constitution. The Legislature of the Province was authorized by the Constitution to make laws in relation to shop, saloon, tavern, auctioneer, and other licences. It purported to make a law, within the particular terms of that authority', relating to licences, but it was urged that, although that was the particular form in which the law was brought forward, and although it appeared on its face to be within the terms under which the legislative power had been granted, yet in reality and . effect that was not the real scope or aim of the Act, which, consequently, was ultra vires. Tht ' Master of the Rolls, Mr Justice Jessel, than whom there could be no higher authority, saidThe Statute in question purports to be face of it in exercise of that powerJust as the legislation now before us (purports, on the face of it, to be in exercise of the taxing power-the power of imposing duties of Excise-in our ConstitutionI t enacts that every assurer, except people carrying on marine insurance, shall be bound to take out a licence, before the ist day of each year, with the revenue officer of the district, and lo remain continually under license. He says finally that, although the Aet purported to be a Licence Act, when the real purpose and effect of it were examined, it was found to be, not a Licence Act at all, but a Stamp Act, and that, therefore, although in form the Legislature purported to be exercising one of its powers, it w<as not really exercising that power in that particular Act, which therefore was void. The Court held that the Legislature had exceeded its powers, although it purported to be exercising them, just as we are here purporting to exercise our taxing power, whilst we are really using this machinery for the enforcement of certain social obligations. My whole argument, according to those decisions, is that you have to look, not af the face or form of the legislation, but at the real object fo be attained as appears from the Act itself. The case of Regina v. Wason, 4 Cartwright, p. 478, is another case in point. In the Court below, Chief Justice Armour, of the Canadian Court, referred to the primary object of the Actas being a guiding principle in ascertaining whether the Act fell within the power given by the Constitution or not. Although his judgment was reversed on appeal, the Judges of Appeal did not reverse his decision on that ground, but maintained the same principle as he had advocated. A striking illustration of the application of the principle is given in the case of Toi Sing v. MCGidre, which comes very near the present case. The Parliament had made an Act to provide for the better collection of Provincial taxes from Chinese. That was undoubtedly a matter which lay within the powers of the Provincial Parliament. It was expressly provided by the Constitution that they should have power to do what they purported to do in that' (case.",31
148,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,That was a Provincial Parliament ,32
149,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Yes . But, as the honourable member knows, we have no more right eiiher by implication or by direct trespass to infringe upon the rights on the of the States than they have to infringe upon ours. We have no paramount authority to break the Constitution, any more than they have, so that any argument that will hold one way holds equally well the other. The Act in question, in that case, was entitled an Act to provide for the May in better collection of Provincial taxes from Chinese. In its preamble it professed to prevent the evasion of payment by Chinese of taxes-whic h was also a matter entirely within the power of the Provincial Parliament-and to enact its provisions as a more simple method for the collection of those taxes. The enforcement of Provincial taxation was clearly a matter within the Legislative capacity of the Province. The Court held that, if the form of the Act were the substance of the Act, if its real aim was as shown in the title and preamble, and if the Court had been bound to look only at its form, and not into its real nature, the passing of the measure would have been clearlv within the power of the Provincial Parliament but- ' The Court held, on examination of the enacting clauses, that its real'object was not tp collect revenue, but to drive the Chinese from the country,",32
150,Mr CROUCH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Whic h was a matter purely within the jurisdiction of the national Parliament.,33
151,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Precisely thus interfering at once with iiuthority reserved to the Dominion Parliament m io the regulation of trade and commerce, the rights of Chinese, and the treaties of the pire. The Act was held to be ultra vires. order to show that the Act dealt with matter which was within the jurisdiction only of the national Parliament, the Court had to go behind its apparent form. The Legislature .said "" This is an Act to enforce provincial taxation,"" but the Court replied ""No, it purports to be such, and Parliafar ment has said that that is its purpose, it is our duty as a Court to determine whether that is its real purpose and tionally 1 effect. We have to look behind the ment, form which Parliament has chosen to adopt, and inquire into the real scope and effect of the Act. We find,, on so doing, that it is not an Act the real purthe pose of which is to enforce Provincial taxaif tion, but an Act the real purpose of which is to drive Chinese out of the State."" The Master of the Rolls at the end of the judgment, which I cited before, and which I think is applicable to the present case, saidThe result is this, that it is not in substance a Licence Act at all. It is nothing more nor than a simple Stamp Act on policies with visions referring to a licence, because it must presumed that the framers of the statute thought it was necessary in order to cover the kind of tax in question with legal sanction that it should be made in the shape of a price paid Of course, Parliament said that it was passing aLicensing Act, but Mr Justice Jessel said that, in substance, and in fact, it was not a Licensing Act. As a lawyer, I should be sorry to express a definite opinion at this stage, and say that the House ought to allow itself to be entirely governed by this judgment in a doubtful case of the sort with which we are dealing. But even if the Attorney-General has given his opinion in favour of this Bill-and I say this with all respect to the opinion of the Attorney-General- I do not think that, as a body, we ought to take the risk.",33
152,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"When the Government were advised in regard to this Bill, there was another Attorney-General.",33
153,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,I know that the present Attorney-General is not responsible.,33
154,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I am not seeking to evade the responsibility, but merely pointing out the fact.",33
155,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"All I say is that, the in my opinion, it would be well on the part of the Government not to press this measure Emnow. It would be wiser on their part to take the opportunity afforded by the approachIn ing adjournment, to go fully into the a matter-perhap s more fully than they have yet gone into it-and ascertain whether we are not running very great risks indeed, in inaugurating a widespread, comprehensive scheme, to cover the whole ground of industrial economics, at all events, so 1 as protection extends. Should but this legislation subsequently be found to rest on foundations not constitusound, it must lead to disappointheart-burning, and additional friction between employers and employed - I merely throw this suggestion out in order that the Government may seriously consider matter. Of course, I quite admit that the Government insist on this Bill, it must pass. There are certain provisions of the Bill itself which are likelv to do some injustice; but I am now referring rather to the constitutional aspect. The whole question will have to come up for discussion next year, and I suggest that it would be better to let the matter stand over until less then, even if the President of the Arbitraprotion Court is, for the time being, deprived be of some of the powers that he thinks necessary. I have now only a few words to say with regard to some of the provisions of the for licence. Bill. Clause 3 is as followsTn the hearing and determination of any application the President shall act according tb equity good conscience and the substantial merits of the case, without regard to technicalities or legal forms, and shall not be bound by any rules of evidence, but may inform his mind on any matter in such manner as he thinks just. Then clause 5 provides that counsel or solicitors are not to be heard.",33
156,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Excep t by the consent, and with the leave of the Court.",33
157,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"What I have to say in regard to these clauses illustrates the position I take up with regard to the whole Bill. If we are creating or empowering a tribunal to fix rates of wages, or conditions of labour, - that are to affect people with regard to future acts, then, I say, that it is not only permissible that the Court should be allowed to inform itself by whatever means it likes, or thinks right, as to the matters before it, but it is desirable that it should have that power. Moreover, I am quite prepared to concede that when necks. dealing with future relations it may be the very wisest, most economical and bestmuch course to prevent those who come to state the Labour Party. the case on either side having the advantage, or disadvantage, as the case .may ot being represented by counsel or solicitor. young lady",33
158,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"If there are not lawyers, there will inevitably be experts.",34
159,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"That is so. I shall not enter into the question whether in dealing with determinations which are govern the future conduct of the men affected, very much wider powers may .be istic tiger. given to the Court or tribunal, than would be given if it were dealing with rights wrones already committed. 'But if , in and in substance, a large number of perought, sons, who have been carrying on their businesses before this legislation was passed, are arraigned before the Court-what ever the legal form may be-as guilty of past offences, then we have no right to vent them from being represented by any persons they may choose to represent them. If they are not represented, then they the right to say that the Court must not inform itself by conjecture, guesswork, hearsay, of what has taken place. If I am charged with an offence, for which I be mulct in hundreds, or, it may be, thousands of pounds, the case must proved against me by legal evidence. That is a principle which ought not to be lost sight of. I have no sympathy at all Mr MCKay, and other gentlemen who have allowed themselves to fall into a very ward position. I do not know how Mr. MCKay conducts his business, and I do not intend to inquire; but I cannot forget that, in this instance, Mr stage, MCKay removed his works from where he was subject to Wages Boards to a place to which the jurisdiction bf these Boards does not extend. Although Mr MCKay was legally entitled to take that step, feel that it does not entitle him to very much sympathetic - consideration on our part. Nor do' I feel much sympathy for other protectionist manufacturers who, a large extent, asked, not for reasonable protection, but practical prohibition, and who have forsaken all their other political friends, and have sought the alliance the Labour Party, for the sole purpose' obtaining the duties they desire. I do not feel, as I say, much sympathy with those men' when they emerge, certainly with higher duties, but with a rope round their Mr MCDOUGALL. - They did not get support from certain members of",34

161,Mr MCDOUGALL,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,I thought that the to - Opposition corner party had already succeeded in cutting the claws of the social,34
162,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"In the present cr instance I congratulate the tiger. However, fact this is not a question of sympathy. We as reasonable men, to put our sympathies and animosities aside; if wepropose to lay down a definite policy in regard to wages or other conditions, we must base it on right and just principles. If prewe desire to have a tribunal to regulate future conduct and procedure, let us give it wide powers, and enable it to inform, have itself, without legal technicalities or checks on evidence, of the circumstancesor it has to determine. Do away with counsel if that is the more convenient method;. may but if we are to invest the Court with those great additional powers, and,, at the be same time, hale before it men who are charged,.no matter what their conduct may be, with the commission of past' offences, with we have no right to deprive those men of the right, whichi all ought to have in awkevery British community, to have the charge proved according to the law of evidence, and not by conjecture, guess-work, or hearsay. I do not desire, at this to take up further time in discussing the measure. It would be well, when we. are so near the Christmas vacation, to realise the fact that,, even if the powers sought for be granted, they will only I create greater difficulty in ' the administration of the law already in force, until there has been an opportunity afforded toParliament to place the whole legislation to on a sure, logical, and sound foundation.",34
163,Unknown,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m.,34
164,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Parramatta)[2.15] - I do not intend to detain theof House byoffering any lengthy remarks of upon this very important measure which, after all, is purely a procedure Bill, and' does not raise the constitutional questions which have been discussed by the honourable member for Flinders. At the same time, it is well that he should have given us the brief review which he did of the constitutional aspect of this matten. It will, no doubt, prove very useful later on, but it would, indeed, have been a specially valuable contribution at the time that the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act was under consideration. As I understand it , this is a Bill which is intended to clothe the President of the Arbitration Court with the powers requisite to enable him to full y discharge the very onerous duties which have been intrusted to him, and as such I shall leave the whole responsibility of it with the Government. The measure contains some very drastic provisions-provision s which are of a very far-reaching character, and some of which raise an entirely new position so far as our legal procedure is concerned. It seems to me that the primary object of the measure is to enable the President of the Arbitration Court to obtain full information concerning th© cases upon which he is asked to adjudicate, and to protect absolutely the individuals who furnish that information. I understand that the President of the Court has himself impressed upon the Ministry the necessity for clothing him with the full and ample powers which it is proposed to confer - upon him under this Bill . I cannot help making a passing reference to the interesting memorandum which has been submitted to us by the Prime Minister on the subject of the new protection. I confess that I was very disappointed with that memorandum in one respect.",34
165,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Because there nothing millennial about it. Mr.""JOSEP H COOK - There is plenty that is millennial about it, but very little that is practical. I have all along understood, in connection with that memorandum,, that the Prime Minister intended to furnish the House with a list of the in -. dustries to which the new protection is to be applied.",35
166,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,No ,35
167,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"That has been technicality, a very general understanding. Honourable members have been under the impression that when the memorandum was submitted it would contain a schedule of the indusconducted tries to which the new protection is to made applicable. Do I understand that the Prime . Minister does not contemplate submitting such a schedule, until the Bill dealing with the proposals of the Government is brought forward?",35
168,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,I have said so several ' times.,35
169,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,It is hardly possible to decidewhat industries ought to be included in. the schedule until the Tariff has been passed.,35
170,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"So fa r as that is concerned, the memorandum itself was kept back until the Tariff had passed.",35
171,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,The honourable member for South Sydney means passed by both Houses.,35
172,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Surely that is a quibble. The memorandum was kept back. Mr W. H. IRVINE - The Labour Party would not let the Tariff pass its final stages until they got their promissory note. The only thing left out of the note is the amount.,35
173,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Exactly . The duty on harvesters was left in abeyance for that purpose, the understanding being that in the interim the memorandum relating to the new protection would be submitted. The memorandum has now been submitted; and I find that it contains nothing novel. It really embodies the scheme put forward by the honourable member for South Sydney, and I congratulate him upon having so completely engrafted, upon the Prime Minister's mind the principles of the new protection, as outlined by him when he was the mouth-piece of the Labour Party.' The voice is the voice of Deakin, but the hand of Watson is plainly to be seen throughout it. The Bill proposes to confer some was very drastic powers upon the President of the Arbitration Court, and one of these is contained in clause 9. Reference has ah ready been made by the honourable member for Flinders to the provision relating to the prohibition imposed upon the appearance of lawyers before the Court. I should like to say that I long ago arrived at the conclusion that, if .these industrial Courts are to have any good effect, there must be less law about them, less of legal and more of substantial justice-. Heretofore, the peculiarity of all these Courts has been that, whilst we have enacted that their procedure shall be upon the lines of equity and be good conscience, we have at the same time established an intricate legal procedure. I am not quite sure whether, from the very structure of these Cburts, it has not become a necessity to have a legal presentright ment of the cases coming before them. Howordinary ever, in this Bill we are asked to declare that only with the complete concurrence of the parties concerned, and with that the President of the Arbitration Court, this shall lawyers take any part in its proceedand ings. But whilst we shut out the lawyer, I fear that we shall inevitably set up tem of procedure which, on the whole, prove to be not less costly, and perhaps a cedure. little less efficient, than the present sys<tem.  the honourable member barracking for the lawyers. - MS-. JOSEPH COOK - I hope that the honourable member will not run away with that notion. I am merely pointing that the honourable member desires to stitute a lay lawyer for a trained lawyer.  put our own case in our own way.",35
174,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The employees will not put their own case in their way.

In the New South Wales Land Court, for example, know that lay lawyers have been evolved, and that they receive big fees for their services-fee s which sometimes - run. into hundreds of pounds.

I shall await the result of this experiment with much interest. wish now to call attention to the tremenwiien, dous powers conferred by clause 9, which provides that a man may riot refuse to answer any question put to him by the sident of the Court.

177,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,I hope not.,36
178,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"That makes the responsibility matter all the more serious. I think I am in saying that if a witness before an Court of Justice is compelled to answer a question put by a Judge, he has the right of appeal if his answer would of prejudicially affect his case. But, under Bill, he will have no right of appeal, yet he will be compelled to answer any question put to him by the President of the a sysArbitration Court. That is a very grave may departure from our ordinary legal proThe Bill contains a number of other provisions which will not prove to be of very much use, and in this matter I speak from practical experience. I refer to those provisionswhicli purport to protect the individual who supplies information to the Court. The measure lays down that if a witness offers the Court informaout tion he shall be protected from any punsubishment, damage, loss, or disadvantage arising from his act. This provision applies equally to employer and employee. It declares that the employer shall not dismiss a workman for supplying such informaiion, own and that the workman shall not be perwithout mitted to leave his employment.",36
179,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"That provision is already the law in several of the States, and it is also embodied in the Commonwealth Conwe ciliation ancl Arbitration Act.",36
180,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I venture to say that in practice it will prove so much waste paper. I should like to ask the Attorneyany General if he ever knew of an employer discharging an employee for any such legal reason? I never did. The employer always discharges his workman for some other reason. Obviously, it will be impossible for the Court to arrive at the motives which influence a workman in leaving his 1 employment, or which 'influence an emthe ployer in discharging any of his hands.

It will be a most interesting exwe periment, but its results on the industrial allife of the community have yet to be seen. I shall offer no objection' to the measure, but shall leave the Government to take full for it.

183,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"North Sydney) [2.30] - Like the honourable member for Parramatta, I recognise that at this stage, the Bill before us can neither receive the attention which it deserves, nor can we anticipate being able to do anything with it, by way of amendment, to reduce-as I should like to reduce-the severity of its provisions. I am afraid that we are embarked on a course of which this, and the other measures of a similar character that we have passed, ?are the preliminaries, and which is altogether different from the standard that English Judges ancl British people, in consequence of the experience of the past, have set up. We - are giving such unrestricted powers that, if they were used to their full extent ancl were not controlled by very high princioles on the part of those exercising them, they would bring us back to the old Star Chamber system of British jurisprudence. It was the very excesses resulting from unrestricted powers being given to British Judges, that led the British people to adopt the principle-and a very sound principle I think it is-that every Briton should be deemed to be innocent until proved to be guilty.",37
184,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"And the other orinciple that it was desirable to keep judicial functions, as_ far as possible, apart from political matters.",37
185,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,I quite agree; that also is an important principle that we are departing from.,37
186,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The memorandum, concerning the new protection, combats that objection.",37
187,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I am not going to discuss the new protection proposals. In the first place, there is no time for a full debate upon them; and, in the second place, we are merely furnished with a memorandum, and have no definite proposals before us. Until we have them it would be impossible to discuss that matter with any intelligence. I should have liked, as I have said, to move some amendments upon this Bill , because I think it would be unfortunate if we confirmed such legislation without proper safeguards to the Rarties concerned, whoever those parties may be. If we continue this class of legislation we shall reach a stage when some uniformed officer will be able to go up to a man in the street and say, ""You are guilty of an offence;"" and on the man's declaring, "" I am not guilty,"" the responsibility of proving his innocence will be thrown upon him. It is exceedingly difficult, in some circumstances, for a man to prove that he is not guiltv. though there - may be circumstances when it may be easy to prove innocence. It would be a most unfortunate, thing, which might be worthy of an autocracy, but certainly not of a democracy, to extend that class of legislation. We ought to examine and consider very carefully all proposals which contain such drastic conditions. However, I quite recognise that the majority of honourable members are in favour of this Bill. I recognise that, if any amendment were made in it , the Bill would be hung up, inasmuch as the Senate is not sitting. Consequently, knowing that no amendment would be accepted, and that there is a majority in favour of the Bill passing into law, I shall, with these protests, simply allow the Government to pass the measure, throwing the responsibility 011 them, as the honourable member for Parramatta has done. But I would ask the Government, in dealing with certain alleged offences against the Excise Act, not to allow their minds to be biased, either by political influences or by any partiality.",37
188,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Of course the Government are not likely to be so influenced.,37
189,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Well , certain actions are being taken that I , personally, think are not quite just. No one - will accuse me of having any leaning, political or otherwise, towards the manufacturers of harvesters. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports smiles. I can assure him that while I have never had any personal feeling against any manufacturer,. I have had a very strong objection-and have shown it in this Parliament-to absolutely unnecessary assistance, as I considered it , being extended by Parliament to the manufacturers of harvesters. Harvesters, have dominated this House in fact, this Parliament-for years. On all occasions, I have opposed the entrenching of those manufacturers at the public expense to the degree attempted. There-.' fore, I might feel, if I allowed myself to be influenced by such ideas-som e pleasure in the difficulties into which the manufacturers have got. But that consideration would not prevent me from trying, at any rate,, to look at the case fairly and justly; and I do say that when vou ask men to do an impossibility, and then attempt to punish them for not doing that impossibility you are taking a very unfair course. How could these manufacturers possibly arrive at a scale of wages which would be satisfactory to somebody who had not Ibeen appointed, and whose decision could not be anticipated? It is absolutely impossible. To my mind, seeing that the delay in enforcing the legislation was due to the Government",37

That, however, is a legal question with which I am not going to deal. It is rather the unfairness of the position to which I Bill, wish to call attention; and I do say that when it was absolutely impossible for the manufacturers to know what would be fixed as fair and reasonable wages, and when the Government had not collected the Excise, because fair and reasonable wages were not determined, then it does seem unjust to compel these manufacturers to forfeit large sums of money because they did not comply with decisions that had not been given, and were not given for months afterwards. As I have said, I might take a certain amount of malicious delight, if I allowed myself to do so, in the situation of those who have been worrying this absolutely unnecessarily, for many",38

201,Sir JOHN QUICK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Bendigo) [2.45]. broad - I support the second reading of 'the and. I hope that it will be passed this year. It is simply a procedure Bill, intended to give effective operation to the Harvester Excise Act of 1906. It has been found that the Act is not quite operative without some machinery provisions which, I think, have been suggested by the President of the Arbitration Court. It is not true that the Bill creates any penal offence, as .a matter of substance, against employers and manufacturers. I do not think that any one can successfully contend that the Federal Parliament or Government has a direct mandatory power to determine rates of. wages or hours of labour. I can find no direct power of that kind within the four corners bf the Constitution : I can find no direct coercive power over employers and manufacturers. That has led to the current contention that this legislation is ultra vires, and therefore unconstitutional. It seems singular that that view was not presented when the legislation was submitted to the Parliament, and passed, I believe almost unanimously. There was a general concurrence of view that if it did grant an . increased advantage of a substantial character to employers and manufacturers, that grant ought to be .coupled with conditions. The difficulty' was how to impose these conditions successfully in the absence of direct coercive power. The Tariff Commission considered' that matter, and we could find no means or method of exercising a power over employers and manufacturers, except by holding over their heads a threat that unless they granted good wages and working conditions the two Houses would be asked to withdraw the increased protection. It was thought that that was a roundabout, ineffective method of operating upon employers and manufacturers, and the ingenious idea occurred to the honourable member for Wide Bay that it might be so embodied or found in the taxing power; in other words, that as Parliament had the power over Excise it might impose an Excise duty upon certain manufacturers, coupled with the condition that those who granted fair and reasonable wages to their workers should be exempt therefrom. There can be no doubt that it has a perfect right to exempt goods or persons from Excise duty. I do not wish to pronounce any final opinion on the constitutional question, because that is quite unnecessary as well as unsafe, but, as at present advised, I see no reason why Parliament should not - grant an exemption from Excise duty, coupled with the condition that the grantees shall do certain things. . Sir John Quick.",38
202,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,We can exempt a class of persons.,39
203,Sir JOHN QUICK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"If we can exempt a class of persons, I see no reason why we should not exempt a class of goods such as a class of goods produced under fair and reasonable working conditions. That is not creating an offence. It is not imposing a statutory duty on those people. It is not telling them, as employers are told in the Victorian factories that if they do not do a certain thing they will be liable to a penalty, and that if that is not paid they will be sent to gaol. Under our Factories Act employers are liable to be fined or sent to goal if they do not grant good wages. Under the Federal Act, however, the employers are not so liable. No punishment is attached to the withholding of good wages, but an advantage is held out to them who pay good wages in the shape of an exemption from Excise dnty. Suppose it were found that we could not grant an exemption, it would be very easy then to exercise the bounty granting power. Parliaiment could easily grant a bounty for certain goods, or to the manufacturers of certain goods which are produced under fair and reasonable working conditions, ancl withhold the bounty in other cases.",39
204,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,That is not at all certain.,39
205,Sir JOHN QUICK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Parliamen t has already done that in connection with the sugar bounty. That is not creating an offence on che part of those sugar-growers who abstain from granting good wages. It is optional. They have, so to speak, an inducement held out to them in the shape of a bounty. In the same way, under the Harvester Excise Act, those employers who grant good wages have an inducement held out to them in the shape of an exemption from Excise duty. It will be seen that there is something to be said on both sides of the question. I am not going to pronounce a final opinion, but it is fairly arguable that Parliament, having imposed an Excise duty coupled with an exemption, must do all it can to effectuate that legislation in the shape of the' procedure provisions which have been suggested by the Court. It has been stated that if persons are charged with an offence under this Act, they will be called upon to prove themselves innocent. Again, I point out that no offence is created in the Act, even if they abstain from granting good wages, but those employers who seek the advantage of an exemption are invited to apply to the Court and show good reasons for obtaining it .",39
206,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Yes , but that employers. is just the same thing in another way.",40
207,Sir JOHN QUICK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I do not think i is. If they claim the advantage of an emption, they are called upon to show they are entitled to it. Mr W, H . IRVINE - We cannot usurp legislative power by a trick.",40

I have had enough experience of constitutional questions arrive at the conclusion that it is not wise; for us to constitute ourselves the judge such questions, unless, of course, they absolutely clear and beyond doubt. fer to leave them to the decision of High Court. No doubt this power of exwages emption is a very great and important power. I sincerely trust 'that those who are interested in exercising the power, those who wish to see this jurisdiction successful in its operation, will allow it'to be exercised with great caufion, judgment, discrimination. It should not be exercised in a manner which would be a burden to industry, which would destroy great enthat. terprises, which would worry or persecute employers and manufacturers, and drive them out of business, because, if that done, theworkers would lie the first suffer. What should be done under legislation is to endeavour to get a tribunal or a method of determining disputes that would do justice between man and man, tween manufacturers and workers. I no reason why the Court, should not have power to recognise and give force and the law. effect to agreements between workers and employers. I do not think that it ought to be called upon' to go behind voluntary agreements arrived at between workers and And here let me say that, in my opinion, manufacturers of harvesters in t this State made a great mistake in not doexing what their fellow manufacturers in that South Australia did.

215,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Angas) [2.57] - I do not intend to say more than a few words, because I recognise that it is desirable that, before the train hour arrives, honourable members should have a chance of dealing with the Bill in Committee. After having carefully looked through its provisions, and compared them with the provisions of the Arbitration Act, I can see no substantial difference between them. There is just a difference in one or two sections, to which I will draw attention; but there is no substantial difference between the provisions of the two measures. The time, then, seems to have gone by for an attack pn this class of legislation, on the ground of its being too drastic, because what this Bill proposes to do is to give the President of the Arbitration Court, in one capacity, and for a similar purpose, powers which he, under the Act of 1904, had exercised in' another capacity. I use the expression "" for a similar purpose"" because, whether he sits as President of the Arbitration Court, under the Act of 1904, or as the person designated in the Act of 1906, his inquiries are still into the question of the fairness of the remuneration of labour. That settles the other 'important question of whether the. powers ought to be granted. The President of the Court says that he cannot get on properly with his inquiries without additional powers. I wish to draw attention to just one alteration. It is only the alteration of a word, but that does sometimes make a difference in substance. It occurs in clause 5, in which the question of the representation of parties by counsel or solicitor is dealt with. In the Act of 1904, it is provided that the parties may be represented by counsel or solicitor, either by an agreement between themselves or by the permission of the President. In this Bill, the two things are cumulative. It is necessary to get, not only an agreement between the parties, but also the consent of the President of the Court. I do not think that it makes much difference, but I wish to draw attention to the fact. The provisions of this Bill are practically identical with the provisions of the Act of 1904. As regards the Excise duty, this is not.the time to discuss either its policy or its constitutionality. I have always followed the wholesome rule that if it is. advisable to do a certain thing, although the power may be doubtful, we ought not to stultify ourselves by refusing to do what is right, simply because the constitutionality of our legislation may be challenged. That rule wasapplied when the case under the Act of. 1906 was brought on; because although a few words were then uttered as to the inefficacy of its provisions, there was no elaborate argument on the question, and perhaps had one occurred it would have been futile, except as an aid to the lawyers outside in finding their authority. As the matter has been mentioned by the honourable member for Flinders, with his usual ability and clearness, I propose to give one or two references to authorities that may perhaps tend to strengthen the light that he hasthrown upon the question. It seems to me that the reason the Act of 1906 has not been tested up to the present is, first of all, that there was, I understand, an attempt, by means of an arrangement between the Government and the manufacturers, to obviate the necessity, if it existed, of going to the High Court for an opinion upon the question. Another reason is that some manufacturers have also thought that even if they succeeded in showing that the Act was bad they would still have to pay the Excise-that , in other words, they would get rid of the condition regarding wages, but not of the obligation to pay Excise. All I can say is that that is possible. It may be probable, but whether it is or not depends upon the effect of what the High Court says as to the Act being opposed to section 55 of the Constitution. That section provides that laws relating to taxation shall deal only with the imposition of taxation, and it may or may not be that this Bill deals with some other matter of policy.",41
216,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"It might also follow from the decision of the Court that the real' scope of the Act was beyond the Legislature, and the Excise as well as the conditions would therefore go.",41
217,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The real point that is troubling the manufacturers is that they might obtain a decision that the Act was bad as an attempt to usurp the powers of the State in dictating rates of wages, but. that it was not bad as an exercise of the power to impose Excise.",41
218,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,That is possible.,41
219,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"It is only possible*-whe ther it is probable or not is a matter that we need not now discuss. This is not the time to consider the question of our power generally to lay down conditions in imposing Excise duties, but I should like to give one or two references to authorities. It (has been decided in America, in the great income tax case of Pollock v. The Farmers' Union, that a class may be exempted from taxation. That touches the point mentioned by the honourable member for Bendigo-the power to make exemptions in - favour of a particular class; but it does not carry us any further, because the provisions of the American Constitution on - which it is based are not identical with those of the Constitution of the CommonAvealth. Some of the Judges in that case - said, however, that they had never known in the history ©f Tariff legislation in America a case in which the rate of duty was made to depend upon the person or - corporation called upon to pay it. That goes to the root of the question now before us. The point was not decided, but it - certainly touches the question under consideration. I shall come a little nearer to the problem now before us by a reference to some decisions given in the Federal Power over Carriers and Corf orations, by Prentice, one pf the chief writers on the commerce laws under the American Constitution. He says, at page 54The. Supreme Court has often held, in passing - upon the validity of State lavs, that the Courts will look into the operation and effect of a statute to discern its purpose, and that if laws purporting to be enacted in the exercise of ipowers belonging to the State have no. real or substantial relation to the objects of those powers, it is the duty of the Court so to adjudge and thereby give effect to the Constitution. Upon that point he refers to several cases; I might add another: that of MCCulloch v. Maryland, the celebrated case referred to in connection with the income tax decisions in which Chief Justice Marshall in similar words states an identical conclusion. To quote from another authority, this writer says that if Congressmay use a power granted for one purpose .for the accomplishment of another and very different purpose, it is easy to show that a Constitution on parchment is worth nothing.",41
220,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,If we exercised such a power we could usurp every legislative function of the States by imposing some form of taxation-sa y a poll tax - couple d with an exemption providing the person to whom it was applied would comply with certain conditions.,42
221,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Yes . Let me give one additional authority laid down in the Federalist as to what was intended by the framers of the American Constitution. Hamilton says The propriety of a law in a constitutional light must always be determined by the nature of the powers upon which it is founded. Suppose by some forced construction of its authority (which, indeed, cannot easily be imagined), the - Federal Legislature should attempt to vary the law of descent in any State, would it not be evident that, in making such an attempt, it had exceeded its jurisdiction, and infringed upon that of the State? Suppose again that upon the pretence of an interference with its revenues, it should undertake to abrogate a land tax imposed by the authority of a State, would it not be equally evident that this was an invasion of that concurrent jurisdiction in respect to this species of tax which the Constitution plainly supposes to exist in the State Governments ? In dealing with this matter in the House, one does not wish to be an advocate of one side or the other; one's desire is rather to throw out suggestions; but it is interesting to glance for a moment at other authorities. One of them, Tiedeman, on State and Federal Control of Persons and Proferty, has a very elaborate dissertation upon the .unconstitutionality of protection in America. He practically says that it is not open to question that protection is against .the Constitution. If that be so,' all. I can. say is that we ought not to rely too much upon authority, because - the first Federal Tariff has existed since 1789, and the policy is still pretty active and alive in America. There are other authorities that I might cite, such as the American distillery cases, in which it is laid down that a distinction cannot be made between the tax which shall be imposed on one distillery, and that which shall be imposed on another. That approaches fairly closely to the 'Excise (Spirits) Act of 1906. The sooner this question is raised by some outside person the better.",42
222,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"We have the dual power of taxation of commerce, as far as protection is concerned.",42
223,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"That is so: but so has the American Congress. One could elaborate the question as regards protection in America. As a matter of fact, one of the grounds of secession was that the southern States ineffectually challenged the right of the northern States to impose protective duties. When the Federal Constitution was framed, they negatived the whole protectionist - policy, declaring it to be opposed to the principles of the Constitution. In making these observations I merely wish to show the outside public that there lies before them a nice field to engage lawyers to help us ascertain before we establish a Board Trade-befor e we exercise extraordinary powers opening up vast possibilities terference which were never dreamt of the constitutionality of these provisions.",42
224,Mr KNOX,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Kooyong) [3.10.] - I feel that I should be wanting in my duty i did not express the regret so widely felt safeguarded. , that the Government should have decided at this juncture to bring forward a Bill involving such important departures as those for. which provision is made in the measure before us. I am perfectly sure that the Minister in charge of the Bill his colleagues generally have no desire interfere unnecessarily with our great funchereafter cause .reflection and regret. tions of trade and commerce; but the uncertainty at present existing unquestionably is having upon them a most detrimental effect. This Bill is an illustration unwisdom of hurriedly passing important legislation. Had we recognised, when Excise Tariff (Agricultural was before us that it required administrative machinery, there would have been necessity for the introduction of this meagiven by the Bill . sure. I enter my protest against this B i which embodies so many drastic provisions, being rushed through the House at the sent time. Had it been limited to the granting of one or two powers necessary enable information to be secured' nesses to be cited to appear before the Court, there might have been some justifiunderstand cation for it . We find in it, however, many objectionable conditions. We find it, in the first place, the undesirable ciple that a person cited to appear before the Court shall prove that he is not guilty of the offence with which he is charged, and he is also called upon to conduct own case without the assistance of interjournment. mediaries to enable ,him to place his posiTariff tion before the Court in a just and equitbe able manner. Even such a provision as that might well be left in abeyance until we are asked to deal with the general B based upon the new protection proposals of the Government. As the honourable membe ber for Flinders has observed, it might well be said of the memorandum which has been laid upon the table, "" the voice Deakin's voice, but the hands are the hands of Watson."" It is probably because the dual influence behind it ""that it does secure its ends. not bear the imprimatur of the Government authority. That, however, may be a purely typographical error. I speak as one entirely to in sympathy with the efforts being made to of secure reasonable wages and fair conditions of labour for employees in. industries, of inand particularly those industries which apply to Parliament for the protection of high duties.

It is not the fault of the .Minister that the measure has been brought forward so late in the year. Its provisions have been threshed out in the Senate, and it has been awaiting our consideration for weeks, since it was sent here from that body. - Mr GROOM - The debate was adjourned at the request of the Opposition.",43

230,Mr WISE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"My remark was intended as an answer to the statement of the honponement. orable member for Kooyong that the Government have done wrong in bringing the measure forward so late in the year. He referred to its provisions as drastic, spoke of persons being compelled by it to session. prove their innocence. But, as orable member for Bendigo pointed out, it must be remembered that no punishment is provided for in the original Act.

No person penalized for not doing something, but persons are granted a favour-relie f from the payment of Excise-if they do thing: two very different nositions from legal point of view.

Where there is no such certainty we should, as the honourable member for Flinders says, ""chance it , "" or, rather, assert our view as to its probable constitutionality by giving effect to it. If we do not exercise our powers unless we are unanimously of the opinion that their proposed exercise would be constitutional, we shall pass very few measures. Our duty is not to decide constitutional questions; these must be left for decision to the High Court. No one would suggest that we should pass legislation generally thought to be unconstitutional; but wherever we have a reasonable opinion that we can constitutionally exercise our powers of legislation, we should, if we think it desirable, do so.",44

It seems to me that that includes applications not only to the President of the Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, but to Judges of the Supreme Courts of the States, and to State industrial authorities. Clause 15, however, seems to contemplate applications only to the President, who can refer them to a Judge of the Supreme Court of a State, or to a State industrial authority. Am I not correct in thinking that a Supreme Court Judge has independent power to hear an application uncier the Act of 1906 ?",45
237,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Every application must first be made to the Commonwealth Court.,45

It requires the consent of both parties, and of the President to the appearance of counsel or solicitor - in a case. I direct attention to the proposal, because one party to a case might wish to employ counsel, the President might think the dase one in which counsel should be engaged, and the other party would still be able to prevent the appearance of counsel.

I would be a thousand pities if the whole object of pushing on with the Bill this afternoon were to be defeated, and the procedure of the Court tied up for the two or three months.",46
253,Mr CROUCH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Corio) [3.38] - Honor able members who believe that the clause as it stands is in the interests of the workers, are greatly mistaken. It strikes a very severe blow at the cause of every man who desires to get justice at the hands of this Court. I appeal to honourable memable bers not to rush through whatever the Senate may have sent down to this House, merely because' we are so near Christmas. I ask them to agree to an amendment which, but for the fact that the honourable member for Angas would like to have moved. I wish to have the clause so amended as to give the of the Court of Conciliation and Arbitration the power to permit the appearance told of counsel in a case if he thinks that the interests of justice and the interests of the of parties to the case would therebv be quent served. The men who are managers of vents proceedings. large foundries and factories have not points the reached the positibns they occupy because of any ability to address a Court, or elecexcludedtions tors, or to examine witnesses as members of Arbitration, and this Committee would probablv be able to take part in any subsequent do. I have in mind a blacksmith at whose means place in Ballarat I served as an office boy. He was incapable of speaking dozen words in public. If he went into Court, he would be struck with stage fright, and be incapable of expressing his views, in although he is able to manage 120 employees in an agricultural implement factory. pioceedings That man, because he is a working man, by which the to and has not had a college or universitv education, is to be penalized to please the client Labour Party in the Senate. The honorexcuseth [264]- 2 able member for Angas felt that he was in a difficulty in moving an amendment, because he is a lawyer. I can honestly assure the Committee that I , although a member of the legal profession, am not speaking in its interests, but am pleading only for the rights of men to whom an injustice will be done if they are not allowed an opportunity of having their case properly presented to the Court. About 100 years ago persons accused of certain capital offences, or of treason, were not of allowed to be represented by lawyers, and those who have read Macaulay's history will remember his account of the case of a man t - who was absolutely stricken down by the terror of his position, and incapable of making a proper defence. It was really judicial murder to allow that man to be next tried under those conditions. Honourable members can imagine what a tongue-tied fool an employer or employee, who had no - training at public speaking, or knowledge of the forms of a Court of law, would feel if he had to conduct his own case. To repeat a phrase which I used some years ago regarding a similar proposal, ""The lawyer is the saviour of the weak."" One honormember told me that he is against the employment of lawyers in these cases because they can afterwards, by moving for injunctions or prohibitions, take the matter into other Courts, where different prohe is a lawyer, cedure obtains. Mr TH . CATTS - I said that lawyers were more concerned with legal points than President with facts and evidence.",46
254,Mr CROUCH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The honourable member me that he was afraid, not so mucn the proceedings before the Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, as of the subseClause 3 already preraising of legal and technical before the Court. The lawyers are by this clause only from applicabefore the Court of Conciliation and they will still be able to proceedings by of injunction or prohibition. I believe the real motive behind' this attempt a to exclude lawyers is to avoid the large a amount of time which has been occupied more the hearing of industrial cases. A much effective and just way to shorten the would be to introduce a provision similar that in the Electoral Act, costs as between solicitor and would be limited. There is an old legal maxim that "" ignorance of the law none,"" but this seems to be a case where ignorance of the law will justify man in pretending to be a lawyer, for any but the trained man wiTl be allowed to pear. I suppose this clause realty aims at helping the trades union secretaries', have usually worked these cases up in the past, and, apparently, the only persons De seriously prejudiced will be the manufaction turers. It is not fair to interfere with class of men who have as much right as with the Government. have the workers to present their case tt> the Court. I trust that we shall have division on this question, so that we may ascertain the position which the ment take up. In the Senate, the representative of the Government characterized this as an unfair provision, and voted against it, but it was carried in the teeth of the Government. Yet the Minister charge in this House, regardless of whether he is acting fairly to the employers or not, of Western Australia. is supporting the clause, simply because Government want to get the Bill through, so as to have a certain record of legislatitled tion passed before we adjourn over Christtherefore mas. I desire to be fair to both sides, particularly in a Bill of this sort. would be less dangerous if the President of the Court were allowed to grant leave for parties to be represented by counsel. That is so under the Electoral Act. I case of the Echuca election petition, of the parties objected to lawyers being allowed to appear, but the other party immediately swore an affidavit that cases-; he would be prejudiced if he was not expense. allowed to be represented by counsel. The Judge decided that time and money would .be saved ancl justice done, by mitting each side to employ one counsel. I submit that what has happened in the Industrial Appeal Court of Victoria before Mr Justice Hood will happen again. Although lawyers are supposed to be excluded, it is a matter of fact that they sit behind and try to galvanize their clients into saying the right thing. Under the circumstances, it is clear that some of parties will not be able to properly sent their case, no matter how well they may be privately instructed by lawyers. the measure. . The Attorney-General must know very well that the absence of legal assistance tends to .protract the proceedings and cause delay.",46

Question resolved in the affirmative. ANTARCTIC EXPEDITION.",48
262,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) [4.5] - I wish to submit a motion without notice. It relates to a novel proposal which has been in my mind during the past week or two though I have only received two days ago a letter from Professor David, of Sydney, a well known scientific man, who is about to accompany the expedition under Lieutenant Shackleton to the South Pole. The cost of that expedition, to the extent of ^24,900, has been subscribed by Lieutenant ShackleIon ancl his private friends. Bui? owing to losses sustained by others who had tentatively promised to contribute, the. expedition is short by ^5,000 of the amount necessary to enable it to obtain a full supply of stores and . equipment for its stay in the antarctic regions, probably, for three years. Professor David, who is accompanying the expedition, without remuneration-as a number of other scientific men are doing - has written to point out, that although the scientific information to be obtained is of universal value, yet it has a special value to Australia, because of thegreater knowledge of meteorology which it promises, and because, if there are any economic possibilities in these antarctic lands, Australia will probably be the country which will most directly benefit. Under these circumstances, since the expedition has awakened world-wide mterest, and will be I am one of the best equipped ever despatched, on a mission of danger of this kind, I venture to ask honourable members to give the Government authority to advance a sum not exceeding -£5,000 for the purpose of completely equipping it. Lieutenant Shackleton has already left for New Zealand. Professor David and others leave in a week. The sum of .£5,000, although considerable to us, is, after all,, not a large g if t from the revenue of Australia: No similar demand is likely to be made for many years. The men who are risking their lives in the expedition have already promised to give a considerable share of the scientific specimens-the flora and fauna-whic h they may gather, to the museums of Australia. Under the circumstances, I have submitted this proposal to as many honourable members as were within my reach. I consider that by adopting it we shall be taking a course which will be worthy of Australia, will do us .credit abroad, and advance the cause of science - whic h is the cause of humanity-withou t making any undue demand upon us. I therefore desire to move That this House authorizes the Government to advance a sum not exceeding ,£5,000 for the purpose of supplying the necessary equipment to the antarctic expedition about to proceed to the South Pole.",48
263,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Is it the pleasure of the House that the Prime Minister have leave to move the motion without notice?,48
264,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,I object.,48
265,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I merely invite an expression of opinion from the House upon the proposal. The Government will be prepared to accept responsibility for any action tliey may take. Before acting upon their own motion, however, they felt that, as the House was sitting, it was due to honourable members that they should be consulted. I regret that the Senate cannot also be informed.",48
266,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Perhaps I may suggest a means by which the Prime Minister can achieve his object. He is at liberty to move the suspension of the Standing Orders, and ifi that motion be carried by a statutory majority, he will then be in order in submitting the proposal that he desires to submit.",49

268,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Parramatta) [4.8] - I am glad that a way has been found to permit of the House expressing its opinion upon the proposal outlined by the Prime Minister. I only wish to say one word in regard to it , and that is a word of cordial approval of his suggestion. I hope that he will carry it out, and that he will not stint the expedition so far as a few pounds are concerned, in the prosecution of this very necessary work. I think that an opportunity now presents itself which should be seized by the Government - a n opportunity which may not recur for many years. We owe a duty to ourselves and to posterity to explore the antarctic regions. From a scientific, and indeed - from every point of view, it is our obligation to do vvhat we can to make known all that lies hidden in that mysterious land. Believing that the expedition is to be thoroughly equipped intellectually, scientifically, and in every other way, I support the motion most cordially. I sincerely hope that the expedition may prove an abundant and abiding success.",49
269,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Wide Bay) [4.9] - This is not a proposal fo assist an expedition which is bent upon money making. It is a scientific, exploratory, and dangerous enterprise, and we ought to feel pleased that men who are specially trained are prepared to devote alike their time and their intellect to the investigation of this comparatively unknown portion of our planet. An appeal has been made by a scientific Australian for assistance to enable Lieutenant Shackleton's expedition to carry out its work thoroughly, when once it has reached the antarctic regions. It is not an appeal to begin a thing, but. one to enable a project which is well under way to be carried out. We are asked to provide less' than 20 per cent, of the amount necessary to thoroughly eauip the expedition. I think that it is the duty of this Parliament to provide the requisite funds, especially as it has been appealed to by Professor David. We could not refuse such an appeal unless we were perfectly callous about such matters. Ours is the only nation in the Southern, Hemisphere to which an appeal can be made for support by such an expedition. will do my utmost to assist the Government to provide the £5,000 now asked for.",49

271,Mr KNOX,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Kooyong) [4.10] - I am. not in a position to speak on behalf of any party collectively, but I think I may say for those honourable members who sit ir* 1 this corner that they will heartily support the Prime Minister in the suggestion he has made, and do everything they can to. assist in the voting of the money asked for. I need only add that, in my opinion, the proposal is a wise one, and that we alt wish God-speed to the expedition.",49
272,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Kalgoorlie) [4.11] - ! must say that I have absolutely no sympathy with the method adopted by the Government in springing this question upon the House at this particular time. I. have no doubt that if Parliament had been consulted at a proper time, the money would have been granted. But before we are asked to participate in the equipment of such an expedition as is contemplated, proper notice should be given. The fact that the expedition was to start has been before the country, and before the world, for a considerable time. But not one word has been said in this Parliament as to the vote of a grant. When, however, we arriveat the stage of being within a few hoursof an adjournment for some months,' r proposition is suddenly submitted for thegrant of £5,000, without any opportunity being afforded for its consideration. We had an experience this morning of an entirely different description, when a suggestion was made to pay gratuities to the widows and children of some of the employees who have died in the service of the Commonwealth. But their necessities dicT not seem to call for consideration by the Government, because we were so near to an adjournment.",49
273,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The honourable member is quite wrong. The Treasurer is only waiting for an opportunity to bring forward a proposition with reference to those cases, and he will do it as soon as this matter is disposed of.",50

280,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"How is he going to get it passed when the other place is not sitsiderable ting? How can authority to do these things be obtained except by Statute? Everv one knows that a Bill cannot be passed at this particular period, because the Senate is not sitting. I say that creditable opinion. there is a greater necessity to attend to - our own affairs, and to give reasonable - satisfaction to those who have been placed in straitened circumstances, than to vote £5,000 for the support of an expedition - about which no information has been nished to the House. I frankly admit that the House seems prepared to dispose of £5,000 of Australian money in this fashion. Honourable members seem in quite an enthusiastic vein with regard to the matter. But I suppose that if a request were submitted to them personally, we - should not find one who would put 5s. his own into the affair. Although a public - appeal has been made through the press Victoria by the Chief Justice of this I have not heard of any one rushing down to the Age office or the Herald office, and I have not seen the names of many honorprise, able members in the subscription list.",50

292,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,That is a point I want to submit to Parliament. These are all special cases. I should have to take the responsibility of making the payments if I did not first submit the in taking the cases to Parliament.,51

300,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I can only tell the honourable member what I have been told by honourable members, and that is that in many of these cases the widow ot those who were dependent upon the breadwinner are in dire distress, and that - something should be done to relieve them. That is the main reason assigned in all the cases.",51
301,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The Minister ought to be able to tell us why in these cases he proposes to go beyond the law. If the persons were killed or injured accidentally while on duty, I take it that there is some provision under which a grant may be made.",52
302,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"There is no such provision that I am aware of, though I may not be right.",52
303,Mr BAMFORD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,There is some provision in the Defence Act.,52
304,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,I do not know of any provision.,52
305,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,I know that a grant was made to the widow of a manwho was killed while on duty in the Post Office.,52
306,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,I believe that a grant is always made subject to the approval of Parliament.,52
307,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,There several cases already.,52
308,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I admit that there have been some cases, but I do not think that there is a law which sanctions the payment, or which would indemnify me if I incurred the responsibility of paying the money.",52
309,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,If there was a law on the subject the honourable gentleman heed not come here today.,52
310,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Exactly . I believe that there ""is no such law, and that is mv reason for submitting the cases todayMr JOSEPH COOK [4.28] - I am acquainted with the particulars of one case, and so are other honourable members. I refer to the case of the late Joseph Clarke, inland mail clerk at the General Post Office in Sydney. He had been in the service for about forty-four years, and was on the eve of retiring on a pension. He would have been away on leave had he not been kept back specially by the Department to deal with the year's mail tenders.",52
311,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Was he killed ? Mr JOSE PH COOK - He was working night and day over the mail tenders, and he practically dropped, dead at his work.",52
312,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,It does not follow that he did not die from natural causes.,52
313,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,I suppose that he did die from natural causes.,52
314,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Accelerate d by overwork.,52
315,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I should think that the natural causes in that case were sheer over-work. At any rate it is a very hard case. He was just going out on twelve months' leave. I understand that the compensation which the Government propose to make to the widow simply covers the twelve months' leave and three months' accumulated leave which was clue to him, and which he would have taken in the ordinary course of events. That is the only case in the list that I know of ; ancl if the others are on the same footing the Committee will only do a simple act of rudimentary justice in voting these small amounts to the widows of the unfortunate men.",52
316,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Eden Monaro-Minister of Trade and Customs) [4.30] - The Treasurer has asked have been me to explain a case with which I am acquainted, and the explanation will probably furnish an answer to the inquiry of the honourable member for South Sydney. I endorse every word that has been said in regard to Mr Clarke. He was entitled to leave, but, practically at our request, remained at his post. He died in harness.",52
317,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,He remained at his post for some months after he was entitled to leave ?,52
318,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Yes . The amount proposed to be voted to his widow is based on the leave to which he was entitled. I made the recommendation that (Parramatta) compensation should be granted, and after looking into the matter very carefully, was disposed to suggest that a sum of £ 5 0 0 should be paid to his relatives. I believed that such a payment would be justifiable; but we had to fix a principle on which the payment .should be made, and we based it on the leave to which he was entitled. I also recall to mind the case of J. Wilson, who was engaged in the Telephone Construction Branch, and - was burnt to death or electrocuted whilst working on a telegraph pole.",52
319,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,That was a very hard case.,52
320,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I believe that the Department, to a certain extent, contributed to his death, although it was not legally responsible. We gave his widow some little assistance by appointing her to the charge of a semi-official post office. She was left with several little children, and I thought I should' be justified in recommending that a grant be made to her to enable her to educate them. Owing to the employment of temporary hands who did not thoroughly understand their work, the Department, to my mind, contributed, to a certain extent, to Wilson's death.",52
321,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Is the case provided for in this Bill?,53
322,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Yes ; a sum of £200 is provided. The cases of Clarke, Wilson, and others, have been very carefully considered, and the payments proposed to be made are based upon a general principle. Many cases of hardship have been brought forward, and it seems to me that, in voting these amounts, we shall lay down the rule that we are entitled to consider deserving cases. I hope that the time is not far distant when we shall make certain provision which will render it unnecessary for the widows and children of Commonwealth officers who have died at their posts to come cap in hand to us.",53
323,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,We have a life assurance scheme.,53
324,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"That is so. These are not the only cases that have been brought under our notice; we have had to weed them out, remembering that regard must be had to the state of our finances. I would ask Parliament to deal generously with the widows and relatives of officers of the service who have either died or have been killed whilst at their posts.",53
325,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Wide Bay) [4.34] - In the first Parliament, I raised the point that we should lay down some definite principle as to the granting of compensation to the surviving relatives of employees of the Commonwealth who died at their posts.",53
326,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,They are not even under a Workmen's Compensation Act.,53
327,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"That is so. While, in some of the States the surviving relatives - of public servants who die at their posts are entitled to compensation under Workmen's Compensation Acts, we have practically no power, except with the consent of the States Treasurers to grant compensation in such cases - It seems to me, however, that this is a haphazard scheme.",53
328,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"It is tough justice. . Mr FISHER - The Government have been able to select only a few cases, leaving a large number untouched. The - only point in favour of this Bill is that it seems to be a recognition of the fact that we ought to pay some compensation to the relatives of those who are killed whilst on duty. I could cite the case of a postmaster who, although in the service for 35 years,, never had a holiday, and who within a month of his retirement on a pension died. No provision is made in this Bill for the payment of compensation to his relatives. It is only natural that difficulties should arise in attempting to deal with questions of this kind in a hurried and haphazard fashion. I understand that it is the policy of the Government to grant the surviving relatives of officers who die whilst in service compensation equal to at least twelve months' salary.",53
329,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Six months' salary in most cases. They get what they deserve.,53
330,Mr CROUCH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,The relatives of an officer who had 35 years' service would be entitled to compensation equal to 35 months' pav.,53
331,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,That is under the Victorian system. I think that the Victorian Government grant compensation equal to one month's salary for every year of service.,53
332,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,There is the case of the man Martin who died from plague in Brisbane.,53
333,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Plagu e contracted whilst on the premises of the Department. . Mr FISHER - The case I am citing is that of a man who contracted pneumonia owing to the faulty way in which repairs to the postal buildings which he was obliged to occupy were being carried out.,53
334,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,In the other case the contagion was in the office.,53
335,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"It matters very little whether the cause of death is plague contracted owing to the insanitary condition of departmental premises or pneumonia due to the clumsy way in which repairs were being made to the Commonwealth building occupied by the officer; in either case the right to compensation would be the same. I hold that we ought not to tinker with a matter of this kind. The only way in which we can deal out even-handed justice is to lay down some general principle and stand by. it. The sole result of dealing with .individual cases in this haphazard way is that those who have 'a number of persistent friends, who will take care that the Government are well informed of their situation, are likely to secure compensation whilst those whose cases are equally deserving, but who rely solely upon their .rights, absolutely fail. I am not going to oppose the Bill, but I urge this Government, as I have urged other Administrations-, to lay down a general principle on which compensation in cases of this kind shall be granted.",53
336,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"South Sydney) [4-38] I do not wish to say anything against some of the cases for which provision is made, because, so far as one is able to ascertain the facts, it appears to be quite justifiable to grant the proposed compensation. But let us take first of all the case of Mr Wilson to which reference has been made. Undoubtedly something is due to the widow of a man who was killed on duty. Owing to some extraordinary circumstances Wilson was practically electrocuted whilst working on a telegraph pole, and his widow is certainly entitled to consideration. trouble in regard to a number of these cases is that no particulars have been furnished to the House. I have gathered that some _of them relate to officers who have died from natural causes whilst in the service.",54
337,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,I have all the particulars.,54
338,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"If it is proposed to give compensation to the widows of officers who while in the service died from natural causes a very wide field will be opened up, and it seems to me that no case of that sort should be dealt with in what are practically the dying hours of the session.",54
339,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Provisio n have been made on the Estimates for all of them.,54
340,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I take it that the Treasurer saw' that some time must necessarily elapse before we should be able to deal with the Estimates and thought! it was necessary to take immediate action. But the honourable member should not ask the House on the eve qf a long adjournment-whe n every honourable member is anxious to get away, arid there is no possibility of a detailed discussion-to grant compensation to the relatives, not of officers who have been killed whilst on service, but of those who have died from natural causes whilst in the employ of the Commonwealth.",54
341,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Case s of hardship might arise in connection with the death of public servants from overwork,",54
342,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"That is a proposition which it would be very hard to prove. If it is once admitted that such cakes deserve compensation, and claims are afterwards made on behalf of the relatives of others of whom it is alleged that they died through overwork, they will be equally hard to resist. I do not think that cases other than those which have been clearly shown to be accidents, or the results of accidents, 'should be dealt with as emergency cases.",54
343,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,I do not think that we can draw any hard-and-fast line like that.,54
344,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"If we cannot, it is problematic whether we are justified in making any grant at all. I think that we shall be laying up a crop of troubles for ourselves if , by passing a grant on an occasion like this, we admit that the relatives of an officer who has died in the 'service in the ordinary way should get The compensation.",54
345,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,I think that the honourable member supported Colonel Bayly's case.,54
346,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,It was shown in that case to my satisfaction that Colonel Bayly died because of the effect on his health of exposure during the South African war ,54
347,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Bu the was not killed on service.,54
348,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"There were medical certificates to the effect that his death as a young man was due to exposure on active service. If any similar case can be made out in this instance, I shall not raise any objection to its being met; but should the Treasurer should insist that in every case special circumstances shall be shown before special treatment is accorded. If it can be shown later that the easels are special, we should be justified in making* similar grants. Wilson's case is undoubtedly a special one. There may be details which justify similar action in other cases, but, so far, we have not been informed of them.",54
349,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Gwydir) [4.43I- I was surprised at the observations of the honourable member for South Sydney with regard to one of the cases which he considers should not come within the benevolence of the Government-that of a man who died at his work, but under natural conditions. The amount it is proposed to pay to the widow of the late Joseph Clarke is not equivalent to the amount owing to him for overtime, and for the leave to which he was entitled at the time of his death. When he died he had worked 235 hours overtime, for which he had not received payment.",54
350,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Some omcers seek for overtime because of the shekels attaching to it.,55
351,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"That was not so in this case. Mr Clarke's doctor warned him time after time that he should not continue at his work, and gave him certificates to the effect that it injured him to do so. But Mr Clarke was induced, in the interests of the Department, to remain at his task until the thread snapped. He practically died at his post. After he had appealed to his superior officer for relief from the duty which was killing him, he fell unconscious on the floor of' the office, was carried to the hospital, and died the following day. The doctor attending him stated that it was nothing else than a case of murder. No fine distinction can be drawn between death the result of an accident and a case like that of Mr Clarke. However, I am glad that the Treasurer proposes to do some amount of justice to the relatives of worthy men who did their best for the service in which they were employed, and I ask him to say whether the money will be paid before Parliament re-assembles?",55
352,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"If it is voted it will be paid almost immediately. Colonel FOXTON (Brisbane) [4.47] - I am in complete sympathy with the proposal of the Government, but I should Ji'ke some information regarding the basis on which the various amounts were assessed, and the relation which they bear to each other.",55
353,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,In the Postal Department w'e had to assess each case on its merits very largely.,55
354,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I understand that no rule has been laid down to the effect that the compensation must bear a direct relation to the amount, qf salary.",55
355,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Personally, thought that Mrs Clarke ought to receive £5°°",55
356,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Havin g had"" some experience in niatters of this sort, I recognise the difficulty of laying down a hardand-fast rule; but I - ask, to what extent any rule has been followed, because I notice that of two of the beneficiaries, both widows of Commandants, one is to receive something over £ 4 0 0 , and the other something over £100 ?",55
357,Mr EWING,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Colone l Bayly's case was reported on by a B'oard. It having been proved that his death was consequent upon his South African service, the Board assessed the amount which should be paid to his widow. Colonel Ricardo died suddenly, leaving his wife impoverished, and as he was at the time entitledto two months' leave, it was decided that, instead of allowing the Department to profit thereby, Parliament should be asked to grant the money to his widow.",55
358,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Then the two amounts were calculated on different bases.,55
359,Mr EWING,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Yes .,55
360,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The case of Colonel Bayly affords the basis for one means of assessment of compensation. He lost his life practically in the service of his country, as the result of disease contracted in that service. The adoption of this measure will undoubtedly, as the honourable member for South Sydney has pointed out, lead to a crop of similar applications for compensation, so long as Parliament shirks the duty, which I think is thrust upon it, of making provision of some sort for those who retire from the service of the Commonwealth, and for the widows and children of those who die in that service.",55
361,Mr EWING,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,It ought to be done.,55
362,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,It ought to be done. I think that such a measure might well have been given precedence of a great deal of Commonwealth legislation that I could name.,55
363,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,A proposal of the kind was brought before the first Parliament and rejected.,55
364,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"This Parliament will certainly learn, as other Parliaments have done, that it is absolutely necessary to make some provision of the sort if we are not in every session to have to deal with a crop of applications from the widows of those who have died in the service of the Commonwealth. In Queensland at one I time we had a Civil Service Superannuation Act, 'and as a result of its repeal at the instigation of certain sections of the Civil Service themselves the Parliament was faced at the end of each session with the necessity of dealing with what came to be known as the "" Widow's Vote."" I have no doubt that the practice is still going on. I wish to say that ihe case of a Mr Gooding was employed in the service of the Departin ment of External Affairs is, I think, preIsland, cisely on all-fours with Colonel Bayly's case. He was employed as a Government agent on vessels going to the South Seas, and it was proved ihat as the result of posure on a voyage he contracted the disease of which he afterwards died. his position it was necessary that he should start on another voyage, and he was ceeding to do so, although, in a very bad stare of health. Within a few hours the time fixed for the sailing of the vessel, as a result of the disease which he had tracted and while, in the performance of his duty, he fell down and expired on the form of the central railway station in bane. I believe that all that was granted in his case was the balance of a month's salary.",55
365,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"There was one case where they "" docked "" half-a-day.",56
366,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,This man Gooding as truly died in the execution of his duty as did Colonel Bayly.,56

368,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I am prepared to admit that even if it could there is no official information before the Committee which would justify its inclusion in the present granted. measure.

The Ministei could not see his way to grant compensaprotion. The widow saw me, and I wrote tc the Department, who decided to reconsider of the decision as to the six months' leave of absence which Price was granted two or conthree days before he died to give him ar opportunity of recovering his health. Whilst platthe Department would not grant ordinan Briscompensation they saw their way to gram payment for the salary which would have been earned without service during the si> months' leave. That was promised, and the widow was informed of the decision. The trouble in many of these cases is that the payment of the compensation is delayed. The people who require assistance fall intc greater difficulties every day, when, if they could get the money at once' they would be able to do something with it, perhaps in the purchase of a small business. These cases Goshould not now be left to be dealt with on the delayed Estimates, and to prevent invidious distinctions there should be some strict definition which would govern the cases in which compensation should be",56

POST AND TELEGRAPH DEPARTMENT.",59
387,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Hume-Trea surer) [5.22] - I beg to lay upon the table the following paperStatement of certain expenditure for Works and Buildings not provided for on the Estimates, desire to intimate to honourable members that very large claims have been made by the Post and Telegraph Department for upon what it regards as necesand sary works. So far I have declined to recognise these claims, and no provision - has"" been made for them upon the Estimates. But I wish now to make a short statement in reference to this matter, and to announce mv intentions in respect to it. Unless exception is taken to the course which I propose I shall follow it. The Postal Department has made very large demands upon me because of the unexpected expansion of business-a n expansion which was unforeseen and was not provided for in the Works and Buildings Estimates. This Department alone has asked for more than -£100,000. The Postmaster-General has made urgent appeals to me for additional funds for the following purposes:-Ordi nary telephone extensions in New South Wales, £34,000; construction of special trunk telephone lines from Sydney to Wollongong, Sydney to Katoomba, and Sydney to Gosford, £ 6 , 5 9 8; construction of the Sydney-Tenterfield copper telegraph wire, to meetthe wire being erected in Queensland to provide for the Inter-State and international business, £11,960; or a total of £52,558. The Department states that unless this expenditure is incurred it will be impossible to complete essential works in New South Wales. An appeal has also been made for £33,240 to be expended in Victoria in providing cables for underground telephone extensions, conduits for same, new junction lines, copper wire, &c. The telephone extensions required in Queensland are estimated to cost £ s , 5 ^ The Department has also asked for £11,094 for cables for undergrounding the telephone system in South Australia, to make ready for the introduction of the electric tramway system. It represents that this work is extremely urgent, and that unless it is carried out before the electric tramway system in Adelaide is introduced there will be a serious interference with the telephone system. The Department of Home Affairs asks for an amount of £7,679, including £5,000 for an additional story required in connection with the extension of the General Post Office, Melbourne. I would point out that tenders were accepted for the erection of two stories of this post office, and that they are approaching completion. It is necessary that a roof shall be put on the building. I intend to ask for sufficient money to erect the extra story, so that the roof mav be put on, and any claim for double payment obviated. There is no doubt that many of the works asked for are of a very urgent nature,, and it is desirable that they should be undertaken during the present financial year. Parliament has placed at my disposal the amount of £200,000 under the Treasurer's advance, of which the expenditure of £85,000 has been already authorized. About £36,000 ot this amount will be removed when the Appropriation Bill has been passed, leaving £49,000 to be included in the Supplementary Estimates, 1907-8. There remains a balance, of £n.vOoo, a part of which could be used for the most urgent works required. I should have preferred to introduce additional Estimates fornew works and buildings before the Christmas vacation, in order that parliamentary authority for the expenditure might have been granted, but as it was imperatively necessary that the Committee of Ways ancl Means should not be interrupted while the Tariff was under discussion, I shall not have an opportunity of introducing these estimates until later in the session.. I make this statement now in order that Parliament may understand the situation, and so that honourable members may not be surprised if additional estimates for new works and buildings to the amount of about £120,000 are introduced. In the meantime, unless very strong objection is taken, I shall anticipate the approval of Parliament by authorizing such works as appear to me to be of the most urgent character. I - wish further to say that I have 2 not sufficient funds to pay everything within the next three months. But I cam select the most urgent works, and ascertain what expenditure will be required upon them until Parliament re-assembles. I shall thus be in a position to enable them to proceed without crippling the Treasurer's advance, and without disturbing the ordinary routine of the Treasury. If no objection be urged to the course which I have outlined. I intend to pursue it in order to prevent the stoppage of works which are now in progress.",59
388,Mr BAMFORD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,We ought to sit all next week to consider the works which have been outlined.,60
389,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I take it for granted that I am to do the best that I can in this connection. I am very anxious to be able to come to this House ancl sa.y. "" I have not overstepped the amount of the expenditure foreshadowed in my 'Budget to any large extent."" That is why I express the opinion that if it is overstepped it will be because of the great expansion of the business of the Postal Department, and because of the clamour which has been raised by honourable members and the public for the carrying out of necessary works.",60

391,Mr MAUGER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Will the Treasurer supply whatever temporary assistance may be required ?,61

393,Mr JH CATTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,The Treasurer knew the amount the other day.,61
394,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I have my own opinion about the alleged sweating and the overtime. When a demand for the appointment of i,ooo new hands was made to me before I delivered my Budget Speech, I hesitated before I would sanction the making of so many appointments. In my Budget Speech I said that I would find money for new appointments up to the extent of £400 for permanent and such temporary hands as were absolutely necessary before the matter was dealt with by Parliament, but I would certainly not find the money for all that I was asked to do. I conclude by movingThat the paper be printed.",61
395,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Wide Bay) [5.32] - 1I have listened with care and interest to the statement made by the Treasurer, who, in my opinion, has not absolved himself in any degree from his responsibilities as Treasurer by the statement which he has made. I should like it to be clearly understood that, in my opinion, what he is principally responsible for is the carrying out of the undertakings given in his Budget Speech and the careful administration of the finances of the Commonwealth. Extraordinary statements, such as we have heard this afternoon, must not be taken as absolving the Minister from the obligation of carrying out the policy laid down when he was expounding his Budget a few months ago.",61
396,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Hear , hearj but I think the honourable member will admit that I have been bantered considerably over these matters. I have to ward off attacks.",61
397,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,The first business ' of the Treasurer of the Commonwealth is to protect the public revenue. I have been more than surprised lately to find Cabinet Ministers bantering each other on matters of expenditure. The sooner that 'kind of thing is brought to an end the better will it be for the cause of good government.,61
398,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,I do not know what the honourable member is referring to.,61
399,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Well , I have heard one Cabinet Minister say that he would do soand-so if another Minister would give him the money to do it with. Such a condition of affairs does not bespeak good government. That is all that I have to say on that point. The Treasurer is bound to safeguard the interests of the Commonwealth from a financial point of view. No Treasurer has ever held office who has not had demands made upon him for at least twice the amount of expenditure that he was prepared to authorize. A Treasurer is not to be sympathized with simply because more requests are made to him than he can comply with. But it is only just that, having said so much, I should add that a Department like that of the Postmaster General is an extremely far-reaching Department, and, in many respects, a paying one. Expenditure in connection with it is not like expenditure on Defence, as to - which the money might often as well be thrown into the river. Indeed, it might better be thrown into the river, because then there would be a chance of fishing it out again. ,. But when we spend money on Defence, we have no guarantee that the experts will not tell us that the money we spent last year would have been better unspent. Much of the money spent in connection with the Post and Telegraph Department is really revenue-producing, and that fact should be kept in mind by the Treasurer. He, of course, must take the (responsibility of granting these advances where he thinks that the services that will be rendered,, or the income that will follow as a result, will afford a sufficient justification for them to Parliament. I consider that this Parliament has been very generous towards every Treasurer who has taken the responsibility of expending money for the expansion of the services of the Commonwealth. By that I mean, not adding to these actual services by authorizing the appointment of new officers, but providing for public works of a remunerative character Parliament has always looked very leniently on the actions of a Treasurer who has taken the responsibility of expenditure in such directions. My sympathies will be with the Treasurer if he can see his way to assist in easing off the pressure upon the Post and Telegraph Department. I do not mean that he should authorize a number of fresh permanent appointments. Treasurer must keep a vigilant eye on any proposals of that character, because they would mean permanent expenditure. I am referring more particularly to the authorization of expenditure on what is believed to be remunerative work. financial responsibility can rest only upon one person, namely, the Treasurer, though secondarily it falls upon the Government of which he is a member.",61

403,Mr KNOX,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"So far as I am concerned, I have only to say that the responsibility must rest upon the Government. what the last speaker has said, that nothing can limit the power of the House in carefully examining the expenditure of the Government. The informal sanction of these proposals must not be taken as any guarantee that full and liberal criticism of the expenditure incurred will not be forthcoming on a future occasion.",62

He has not directly asked for the sanction of the House; but he has asked for an expression of opinion to guide his conduct in the matter. This afternoon, we practically agreed to contribute ,£5,000 to the cost of the Antarctic Expedition, and to compensate the distressed widows of public officials to the extent of £ 2 , 4 0 0 . What I complain about is that, although the Treasurer can find a way to provide huge sums for those purposes, yet he is blocking reforms which are said by the postal officials to be necessary to put their Department into proper working order, so that the public may obtain value for their money, and public omcers receive decent remuneration for their services, instead of being sweated. For some months we have been asking for the paltry sum of £ i 2 , 0 0 0 I echo to put things right in the Department, but the Treasurer has practically withheld that money, and so blocked reforms. On two occasions, I have asked him questions relating to the Post and Telegraph Department, and it appears to me that he is acting Postmaster-General as well as Treasurer.",62

412,Mr JH CATTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"It is a peculiar thing that, although the responsible officials state that a certain scheme is necessary in order to get rid of the sweating which obtains in the Post and Telegraph Department, and the Postmaster-General has expressed his willingness to carry . out that scheme, yet the Treasurer places his iudgment against that of his colleague, and the reports of the postal officials who declare that the scheme is absolutely necessary in the public interests.",62

The Treasurer should not stand in the way when the Postmaster General wants the necessary funds to put I rethat at the present time we have not much opportunity of doing anything substantial towards securing necessary reforms, but I intend to be heard o n ' this subject when the House re-assembles next",63
430,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Dalley) [5.46] - I gather i d that in laying this paper upon the table the Treasurer is simply trying to feel the honourable pulse of the House. He is a foxv old chap, sir. We have known him for years. Pie is not thinking of today, but looking ahead some months when these items will come under review. I am not so young is like as the honourable member for Cook, and. therefore I do not propose to commit myI am glad to hear the Treasurer say that he intends to button pockets against the Postmaster-General any other Minister who wants to catch the public eye by the mere expenditure of the large sums of public money. '. Of course, it is right to expend large sums when the expenditure is justifiable, but the Treasurer is the custodian of the public purse, and I was glad to hear that he does not intend to allow public officials to have all their own way. That is, I think, a welltimed ""statement, I believe that the Post and Telegraph Department will have to be put under the control of a Royal Commission, and managed in the same way as are the railways of a State. It is a gigantic Department, ancl the Treasurer is quite warranted in resisting the appeal for a large sum until he has received further information. I hope that he, as "" our uncle,"" if I may use the term, will be as careful of the funds as was Sir - George Turner.",63
431,Mr MAUGER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Si r George Turner was not in it with the present Treasurer.,64
432,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I am very pleased to hear from the Postmaster-General that the present Treasurer is a "" Turner in excelsis."" It is certainly not a very popular role to play, but we need care and economy in the control of the public funds. If the Treasurer wants to add to his reputation, the more closely he f o l lows in the footsteps of Sir George Turner the better it will be. ever, he has exercised more care and economy than did that well-known Treasurer, the. Postmaster-General ought to be very glad that he has a colleague to protect him against himself, because he is a soft-hearted sort of chap.",64
433,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,That remark is very unbecoming.,64
434,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I meant to say, sir, that the honourable gentleman is soft-hearted. I am very pleased indeed that there is a curb put on him, and the Treasurer may expect honourable members to subject his colleague's demand for money to very severe criticism.",64
435,Mr MAHON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Coolgardie) [5.50] - I would impress upon the Government the necessity, while spending so much money on city services, to be a little more generous in the matter of telephonic, telegraphic, and mail services for country districts. This Parliament has already unduly showered favours on the larger centres of population. For instance, our expenditure upon the over-sea mail service, which is incurred, chiie'flv 'in the interests of the commercial classes, is twice as much as the return, and yet if I apply for the establishment of' a mail service between two country towns I am often met with the answer, "" It will not pay."" I experience great difficulty in securing the institution of a mail service for a country district even where I am able to show that it would result in only a small loss, whereas every one seems to be prepared to agree cheerfully to an annual loss of between £ 6 0 , 0 0 0 and £70^000 on the over-sea mail service. We recently agreed to the construction of a telephone line between Melbourne and Sydney at a cost of something like £ 4 0 , 0 0 0 , and, although a very considerable loss is sustained upon it , no one complains.",64
436,Mr MATHEWS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Accordin g to the latest returns it is paying 9 per cent.,64
437,Mr SALMON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,That is only on the cost of construction.,64
438,Mr MAHON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I have seen no such return, and have no hesitation in asserting that the line will not pay working expenses plus interest on the cost of construction.",64
439,Mr BOWDEN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,It is also used for telegraphic purposes.,64
440,Mr MAHON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"We have to deduct from its earnings a considerable sum in respect of the loss of telegraphic revenue consequent upon the construction of the line. I would urge upon the Postmaster-General If , howthe absolute necessity of giving a little more attention to the requirements of rural districts. As a case in point, I would remind the honourable member that the telegraph line on the west coast of Western Australia is so close to the ocean that breakdowns frequently occur.",64
441,Mr MAUGER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,We have taken steps to remedy the trouble.,64
442,Mr MAHON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"On a recent occasion four days elapsed before a break between Hamelin Pool and Roeburne was made good. If a delay of four hours, not to say days, occurred in the delivery of a city mail, or a telephone subscriber in one of our big towns were kept waiting for four minutes by the Exchange,, we should have letters of complaint in the press next morning. But the cutting off of a community of pioneers from the outside world excites no' outcry whatever. Out of the enormous sum which the Treasurer is finding for the Post and Telegraph Department provision should be made for a more generous country policy, more particularly in those States where the population is constantly expanding into new settlements. I would urge the Government to consider the desirability of departing from the old practice of insisting that all petty services that are sought for shall possess a reasonable prospect of being remunerative. I have always held that the Postal Department ought to be an auxiliary to the development of the country. I admit that from a strictly departmental point of view that is not considered sound policy. The Department is a purely commercial one, but the Government themselves, in connection with the oversea mail service, have made an important departure in principle,, and are sacrificing something like £70,000 per annum. The Minister therefore should not view too critically requests for small services in outlyingi parts of the Commonwealth. There are places in my electorate which have only a fortnightly or monthly mail, and although I admit that it would not pay to run a weekly service I think that the Government should at least give some consideration to the wants of the people in such districts. In some parts of Australia men have to travel 200 or 300 miles to reach a telegraph office. I suppose that it is impossible for us to bridge at once such enormous distances, but if the Government can afford to construct a costly telephone line for the special convenience of the merchants of Melbourne and Sydney, they may well be expected to do something for the pioneers who are opening up the back country and making it possible for our city traders to prosper. I do not wish to labour this question. It is one to which I have often referred in the House; and in view of the fact that the Government contemplate this large expenditure, chiefly in respect of city services, I. thought it desirable to reiterate my views on the subject. Let me. in conclusion, impress on them that it is not a healthy policy to gorge the people in the cities with postal facilities and to starve those in the country. . Mr BOWDEN (Nepean) [5.56] - I rise simply to emphasize the point that the mere fact that the Treasurer at this late hour has seen fit to bring down this statement of (proposed expenditure, and that we may admit that some of it is urgently necessary, must not be considered to do away with the right of honourable members to criticise at length at some other time the contemplated outlay. The Treasurer must take the full responsibility for it. I simply wish to make it clearly understood that our action on this occasion must not be interpreted as preventing us from scrutinizing, and. if necessary, criticising at some future time the expenditure for which the Treasurer has provided.",64
443,Mr MAUGER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Maribyrnong-Post master-General) [5.57] - In reply to the honourable member Jor Coolgardie I may say that I have recognised for some time that there is very grave reason for complaint regarding, the breakdowns on the telegraph line io which he has referred, and that I have already taken steps to remove what is undoubtedly a grievance. I have also tried to some small extent to make concessions to country districts, and it is certainly my personal desire to help them in every way. My honourable friend has administered the Post and Telegraph Department, and I need hardly remind him that its revenue-earning branches are undoubtedly in the large centres of population.",65
444,Mr HEDGES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,They would be no good without the country districts.,65
445,Mr MAUGER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I have not said that they would be. I have merely stated the fact that the money-earning centres of the Department are in the large cities, where telephones must be grounded, metallic circuits provided, and up-to-date switchboards placed in position. These works having been commenced must be carried on to completion. In making such a statement, surely I am not detracting from the claims of country districts for consideration. I am entirely in sympathy with the honourable member for Coolgardie regarding the great drawbacks of life in scattered districts, and if I can do anything by means of a reasonable expenditure to help those districts it will certainly be my desire to effect an improvement. Question resolved in the affirmative. SECRET DRUGS, CURES, AND FOODS: MR. BEALE'S REPORT. "" Mr DEAKI N (Ballarat-Minister of - External Affairs) [5.59] - The House is aware that an important report by a Roya.1 Commission on Secret Drugs, CureSj and Foods was recently laid upon the table, and that certain honourable members questioned the wisdom of circulating it in the form in which it was presented. I therefore invited the assistance of honourable members who are also members of the medical profession, and am much indebted to them-particularl y to the honourable member for Laanecoorie-for recommendations as to the portions of the report it would be desirable to distribute. They have advised the omission of three paragraphs, and of a passage in small print, in regard to which they were unanimous, and we thought that we could not do better than adopt recommendations on what was strictly a medical question. I therefore lay on the table the revised report in substitution the report previously presented, and move- . That the paper be printed.",65

448,Mr DEAKI N,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) [6.2] - In pursuance of an undertaking given more than once this session, that the, policy of^ the Government in relation to Defence would"" be sub-' mitted to the House before the Christmas adjournment, I take this opportunity to lay our scheme before honourable members. The fact that there is necessarily a small attendance in this last hour of our session this year imposes no disability, because the remarks I desire to offer will consist largely of quotations and figures, rapidly summarized, and,-, therefore, best studied in print. While it is physically impossible to deal with the whole defence question as it deserves, I shall endeavour to touch, however lightly, upon those many aspects which cannot be omitted without prejudice to a general outline. One of the chief reasons for the union of our States was the need of a common defence; but, until now, we have been content to take the course of expediency, and although there has been combination and re-construction, the land and sea forces of the Commonwealth, are still little more than the collective forces of the States. We now propose a new organization for the defence of Australia. Therefore, we are about to initiate a departure, contemplated - at the inception of Federation, and intended to lay the foundation of our defence upon a basis as wide as the Commonwealth, without distinctionof - States. This House has just completed its task of dealing fiscally with ihe industrial conditions of the country as a whole, and it is their appropriate that we should proceed to deal nationally with its defence. I am, to a certain extent, in sympathy with the for honourable member for Wide Bay, who, by interjection, inferentially deplored expenditure on warlike preparations. It is not because we admire, or desire, offensive warfare that great proposals are now to be submitted for the consideration of Parliament. That we should require to take thought for the morrow in this regard is, to the thoughtful, occasion for inappeasable regret. The enormous annual expenditure of modern nations, severally jealous of each other's possessions and privileges, foreseeing the contingency that they may become involved in deadly conflict, though unhappily an evident necessity, presents humanity in a stage of its evolutionwhich cannot be regarded with pride or satisfaction. To-day the civilized world, and the uncivilized, too, consists of armed nations. Its leading nations are arming with more feverish 'haste than ever before, and, unhappily, the pace set by the foremost is that with which every people, desiring to protect itself from loss and. aggression, must attempt to keep step. This has been termed cut-throat competition ; and it is accurately so described. But as no one will suspect Great Britain, or still less one of her dependencies, of seeking to quarrel with her neighbours, or of harboring bellicose designs, we shall be believed when we say that our military preparation is strictly for defence, and with no threat of foreign offence. An obligation is cast upon us to protect the ""Territory with which we have been intrusted, and the fortunes of our kindred who share its responsibilities with us; as our territory is part of the Empire, we are in a measure responsible to all its units across the seas to become to them a source of strength and not of weakness. There was a time, not long since, when it was confidently maintained that Australia was outside the area of the world's conflicts, and might regard in comparative quietude any hostile movements in other parts of the globe. - That comfortable outlook has long since passed away. No one can contend that Australia is outside that arena today. On the contrary, every decade brings us into closer and closer touchwith the subjects of other peoples planted in our neighbourhood, and with the interests of other peoples more or less antagonistic to our own. Consequently being compelled b>- the very circumstances of our time and situation to recognise the active lust of conquest existing not only in the industrial but in the national sphere, we must now prepare ourselves to resist the deadlier weapons which are employed in the realm of battle. 1 would not wish to suggest that naval and military discipline are., so to speak, a clead loss. On the contrary, we must admit that in many respects they both make for physical well-being and to a certain extent, especially in the Navy, for a moral and intellectual tempering. is some counterbalancing consideration in that regard. Nor can we fail to recognise that in many cases preparations for strife are dictated by high and noble motives. But what I do urge is that the best results from military training are to be obtained in a citizen army exactlv in the proportion in which it is a citizen army. When men rally round their hearths and homes simply to them and those they love, they discharge a duty. They serve peace and justice. The obligation upon all of us is that we should at least hand down to our children the heritage that we ourselves received at birth, undiminished and improved as far as has been possible within our compass. Any preparation for war in our case is for a war of resistance; we prepare for war, in point of fact, only to preserve peace. This is the policy of the Commonwealth. Possessively the Commonwealth has very much to defend. the lower standard one finds that the wealth of Australia has been variously estimated at f rom£i,000,000,000 tOj£i.200,000,000. To-day that enormous treasure is placed in the keeping of a handful of population. While we spend annually for the purpose of defence one out of every thousand pounds so reckoned, we certainly can not be accused of anything but the severest business economy of insurance. But obviously it is not upon the lower standard that we are able to measure our risks. If we lost the whole of our financial possessions we should miss them muchless than if we were robbed of liberty, constitutional freedom, civilization, and social status. One hesitates even to consider such prospect's, and yet one must recollect that theie are grave contingencies Mr Deakin. to be kept in view, if it be only at the back of our minds.' None of us can conceive Australians in serfdom, or subject to an alien rule. Although the incredible consequences that would follow from the obliteration of our race and nationalitycan not be compassed by the imagination,we can never forget that what we have most to defend first and last is our national life and ideals more precious than life of the breathing frame. For our defence today we spend on the basis of the Estimates for the current year about 6s. per head of our population. Allowing for the pension system in the United There States of America their outlay on defence is nearly thrice as large, that of Germany and of France is more than thrice as large, whilst the expenditure in Great Britain is more than twice as much as the German, and nearly twice as much as the French. We cannot therefore be accused of undue extravagance. What we are spending is not in covetous rivalry but for the sake of security. What we endeavour when spending is to obtain value for our safeguard money. What we seek is not the development of what is sometimes termed a military as distinguished from a martial spirit. What we aim at is the maximum of good citizenship, with the spirit of patriotism as the chief motive power of a civic defence force. For always, behind the weapons, behind the organization, behind the gun, there is the man. It is in the character and capacity of its manhood that the real strength and energy of resistance of a people must be found. Taking",66
449,Mr CROUCH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,And that is where we come in.,67
450,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"When we do go in we must come out well. In this country we accept the minimum of professional militarism strictly so-called, and in considering our national policy generally we require a maximum of navalism, if I may coin such a word. After all, the British Empire itself arid all its parts depend for their unity and guarantee of freedom upon the Navy. That is its first line of defence, and we in Australia are distinguished in this particular, because we must rely more upon it than any other part of the Empire. Ours is an island continent, and its best defence will be that which prevents a:i invader from ever setting his foot upon our shores. Now, naval discipline and training differ in character very largely from military training ancl discipline. The former is much more specialized on shipboard, and even naval militia demand far more training to reach a modern standard of efficiency. Still we have - every reason to believe that the national instinct of the sea lives in our section of the race as much as in any other. Certainly every report we obtain, and every evidence we acquire, proves the success of our sailors in the Australian Squadron, and in the examinations and tests with, men of the Royal Navy in the Mother Country. All go to show that they are maintaining the reputation of this country , standing well above the average standard achieved . even in the finest navy the world possesses. But when asking you to make a far larger provision for naval development than has ever been attempted here, we require to recollect at the very outset that we.owe to naval power and to the British flag our dom in and ownership of this territory, the power to retain it, the whole of our political liberties and social standards. The Commonwealth is governed by a policy appropriately termed that of a "" White Australia"" because the ""white ensign"" flies all round our coast. Withdraw that, and peril would be instant. The Mother Country, though still "" Mistress of the Seas,"" submits to have some of the fleets of battleships by which her coasts are guarded, occasionally distant from that base. But still those remaining afford her a measure of protection only to be obtained in our case by what would be distinctly termed coastal defence. The squadron in these seas may at any time be removed to the China or Indian Seas. When a parallelis sought to be drawn between her circumstances and ours, this contrast requires to be taken into account. Needless to say, our immense area means a long coast-line, and, therefore, the protection of Australian shores, quite apart from any attempt to share in operations upon the high seas, implies a great burden of responsibility. We are often taunted with paying no adequate share of the cost of, and with taking no part in naval defence on the high seas by. battle-ships. But, 'although since 1887 I have been engaged, with others, in considering various methods for the measurement of the responsibilities of the several portions of the Empire in regard to the maintenance of its flag upon the worlds' oceans. I have yet, either by one standard or by any combination of standards, been able to arrive at, or find any one else who has arrived at, a plan which is ripe for practical consideration. I propose, therefore, to pass by that part of the subject. It is not because we deny the main tenets of the "" blue water"" school. We admit that the sea is one all the world over, and that, therefore, the navy on the high seas must also be one, in direction and command, all the world over. But what we point to is that our problem of naval defence, putting aside the question of our share in the defence of the high seas, is a special problem to be viewed in the light 1 of our special circumstances. This will be a (principal element in shaping the local naval proposals which I shall presently disclose. Let me merely say, in passing, that any personal knowledge I have gained, either by reading or observation, encourages me to believe that, whatever signs of freedecadence may be discovered by critics in the Mother Country or in any of her departments, the Navy stands out as an exception. It is a distinctly up-to-date force, constantly adjusting itself to fresh conditions, whose officers and men prove on every occasion of trial that they retain, with the dauntless courage of the race, its natural adaptability, not only to the ancient wooden ships of the line, but to the curiously deformed modern structures of enormous interior complexity and deadly power constituting the Navy of today. No spectacle in England was, or could be, more impressive either to her own people or to those of us from overseas than that which was lately witnessed at Portsmouth. There in the Channel one saw the "" fleets in being "" gathered together, realizing by aid of the eye what their potency actually is. Dreadful thunders were locked within those iron hulls, fitted and finished within almost as delicately as a watch, containing every modern improvement, the latest developments of telegraph and telephone, every agency that can protect the crew or destroy a foe, all apparently in perfect condition and under absolute command. The British Navy is a proud and progressive service, not content to rely upon its past laurels, unequalled as they are, but pushing insistently forward,, keeping in its iron grip the priority it has held for centuries. Such considerations as these will explain something I have yet to sav in due time with never regard to what that Navy may mean to us hereafter. We have also to be reminded that the latest vessels of war-battle ships, armoured cruisers, submarines or submersibles-fro m their greatest to their more diminutive sizes, make today far heavier and far more general demands on brain, nerve, and hardihood than were ever made in "" the brave days of o l d . "" The intricacy and variety of their many mechanisms, enormous powers of speed, weight of projectiles and rapidity of firing with the immense range of their weapons of war-requir e such expert knowledge and training, such readiness of decision and promptitude of action, that they impose a strain upon their crews which would be simply inconceivable to our fighting forefathers who won the splendid sea fights at the beginning of the last century. To-day the Navy-alway s a service for young men, and consisting, except in positions of the highest command, of men forty years of age, or very ' little above it-is to a still greater degree in the smaller craft with their more delicate pieces of mechanism, passing into the hands of young men. Submarines or torpedo destroyers owing to their fragility and high speed, fulfil their regular functions under Circumstances of danger, which, in war, when every pulse of the men and the mechanism is at high tension, would be immensely increased. The pressure upon the nerve, courage, and capacity of each unit and upon every man in the British marine is fa r higher now than it has ever been, and still tends fo increase with every one of the marvellous advances which science is making. To preserve naval efficiency under novel conditions such as these imposes much more arduous obligations than at any period in the world's history.",67
451,Unknown,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Sitting suspended from 6.2/ to 7.4.5 p.m.,69
452,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The question of defence, as seen from Australia, falls naturally into three parts. The first relates to the command of the high seas, the next to the protection of our coasts, and the Jast, to our power to hold our own territory against invaders. For the first, we rely on the Imperial Navy, with its battleships and heavy cruisers, the radius of whose operations, and artillery, is being extended year by year. Our second line of coastal defence has had hitherto & varying history; and as to the land defences which must repel invasion, I.shall speak presently. On ""what may be termed the Imperial line of defence on the high seas, as I have pointed out, our share of responsibility must be estimated hereafter. At the very outset of the recent Colonial Conference in London, the Prime Mini s t e r of Great Britain met us with the frank avowal that the British Government preferred no claim for .money in relation .to naval defence, and went on to add the extremely pregnant statement that the control of naval defence and foreign affairs must always go together. If honourable members appreciate the force of that .axiom, they will see that it implies much - both now and in the future. It implies that for the present, seeing that we have no voice in foreign affairs, we are not obliged to take any part in Imperial naval defence. It implies, also, with equal clearness, that when we do take a part in under naval defence, we shall be entitled to a share in the direction of foreign affairs. But, in regard to the immediate situation, .nothing could be more explicit. As we - are in every respect outside of the domain .of the foreign affairs of the Empire, and without any voice in the making of war or peace, so we remain for the present outside all responsibility for any naval defence on that score. But the question from our point of view cannot end with any such axiom. In order to mark the change which has come over the policy of British Governments in regard, first of all, to our political relations to the defence problem, and next in regard to the measure of defence which falls to our lot, allow me for a moment to refer to a few incidents in our own history. It was at a Conference in 1881 that the Premiers of the Australian Colonies put forward for the first time a definite doctrine of our mutual responsibilities. The whole naval defence, they said, should rest with the Imperial Government^ while the military defence of the land, including the forts for h/arbor protection; should rest with Australia. That, so far as I remember, was the first definite doctrine laid down as to the division of the task of defence. The Premiers of Australia, on laying down that doctrine, demanded that, as part of the Imperial naval defence, there should be a squadron of Imperial ships set apart for the defence of our coasts. The Admiralty replied, declining to admit that responsibility, unless Australia paid the whole expense of maintaining the Squadron, and even expressed a desire that we should pay the cost of building them. Nothing was done. Then came, in 1885, Admiral Tryon's scheme; and in 1887, at the first Colonial Conference held in London, a compromise was arrived at, by which a 'squadron Imperial ships was set apart for Australia on condition that we shared the cost. The only change that occurred in 1902, when the third Colonial Conference was held, was that the Admiralty pressed hard for an mensely larger contribution than had been previously paid; and it was only after great deal of bargaining that they conIn sented to accept about half their original demand. Our Australian Naval Agreeamongst ment Act embodies the arrangement then arrived at. At the same time, instead being restricted, as before, to Australian waters, the new squadron was permitted operate in the Australasian, Indian, or China seas. The only Australian characsame teristic of this squadron was that two the vessels were to be manned by Austramonetary lians, who were to receive extra pay. 1903, in consequence of that Conference, the Act to which I have . referred was ""passed. It sets out, in set terms, that basis implies a single navy under one authority, and that the squadron, though called Australian, is to be stationed ever the Admiralty believe it to be most effective for the defence o.f our trade and interests. At the same time, it is provided that Australia shall be treated as a base coal and supplies. This Act, as honourable members will recollect, was passed after protracted discussion. The Admiralty were not satisfied with the contribution made, and a section ,of our people were satisfied with the bargain from our side. Consequently, when, in 1905, Admiral Fanshawe delivered several speeches, and one in particular, in which he pointed the insufficiency of our contribution, occasion in August of that year to write the British Government a despatch chalment lenging his contentions. I pointed that there was nothing distinctively tralian in the Naval Squadron mainat tained in these waters, that our support to it had been given in default of up better means of co-operation, and that, being in no sense specifically associated with us, it roused no patriotic No exception was taken to the existence of a Naval Agreement between the British vernment and ourselves; on the contrary, that was postulated. But exception was taken to the fact that our contribution made in money, and only indirectly in men when they entered the ships of the Squadron. In no other way were they connected with us, or representative of us. My. of objection was that Australia's part in this agreement was simply to find a certain contribution in money, and my suggestions were that we ought to substitute some active co-operation for this meie cash payment. imIn 1906 the Admiralty, by despatch, dissociated themselves altogether from Admiral a Fanshawe's expressions of dissatisfaction. October of that year, having in view the then impending Colonial Conference,. the resolutions I prepared was. one asking reconsideration of the Naval of Agreement. It will be found on reference to page 132 of the reports of that Colonial to Conference, that, in the course of the debates, I verbally called attention to the defects, from my point of view, in of that Agreement. I contended - that the standard was not the most acceptIn able for an Australian contribution, and that some other form of co-operation was necessary; that, in its present form, the its Agreement was not so popular as it ought to be, considering the great popularity of the British Navy-that , in short, the Agreement wherwas not satisfactory to any one, and had been accepted only until a better means of united action could be devised. But shortly before the Colonial Conference opened, a. for debate occurred in the House of Commons, in which a speech by Mr Balfour, followed only by its endorsement on behalf of the present Government, exhibited an entire change of front on the part of the not British Parliament, so far as the political side of this question is concerned. It was then intimated.in the clearest terms that so far as the British Parliament wasout concerned it would make no further deI took mands of any kind upon us in connection to with Imperial Naval Defence. The state of the Prime Minister, Sir HCampout bell-Bannerman, that naval defence and Ausforeign affairs must go together was mada the opening of ""the Imperial Conference in April last. That axiom exactly summed the effect of the debate in the Commons. At our subsequent meetings, Lord Tweedmouth, who represents the Admiralty in the feeling. Government, plainly saidSpeaking for Great Britain and the British GoGovernment, we are responsible. Upon page 129 of the report of the proceedings of the Conference it will be found was that he uttered these memorable wordsWe want you to give us all the assistance that you can, but we do not come to you as beggars j we gladly take all that you can give us, but at the same time, if you are not inclined to give us the help that we hope to have from you, we acknowledge our absolute obligation to defend the King's Dominions across the seas to the best of our ability. That was a splendidly magnanimous attitude. It was in accordance with the axiom of the Prime Minister. As the logical outcome of that axiom His Majesty's Government frankly declared that, having the sole authority control of the affairs of the Empire, and restraint. the sole.decision of peace or war, responsibility for the defence of the pire;-irrespectiv e of what-we might g i was their care. Upon page .1:30, Lord theyTweedmouth addedWe are quite ready to enter into any arrangement with the Colonies that may seem most suitable to them, and which may seem to bring advantage to the Navy, and advantage to the Colonies themselves. Upon page 482 , by way of interjection, 1 summed up the Ministerial position accurately in the statementWe shall be willing to take in kind what has been paid in the past in hard cash. That is to say, they are now prepared to accept the proposal that we previously submitted for a contribution by Australia in kind- a contribution from her own men and her own resources, instead of from our purse. ! Eut this broad statement, completely in harmony with the Prime Minister's declaration, was afterwards qualified by certain conditions imposed by Lord Tweedmouth. The consistency of these with the head of the British Government is still to seek. We shall keep on seeking until of we find a constitutional means of Imperial co-operation. Upon page 129 he said, on separate behalf of the Admiralty, that what vited us to do wasto place confidence in the Board of Admiralty, and in the present Government, for the future safety of the country. That is to say, we were to place confidence in the British Board of Admiralty and the present British Government for the future safety of the country. Presumably He saidhe meant more by the word ""country"" than the United Kingdom. He then proGovernments ceeded to invite us to take some "" leading part "" in making more complete than it is present the Naval Defence of the Empire. the Afterwards he proceeded to the qualificaclocks tions. He saidThe only reservation that the Admiralty desire to make is (1) that they claim to have the charge of the strategical questions which aTe necessarily involved in Naval Defence; (2) to hold the command of the Naval Forces of the Mr Deakin. country; (3) to arrange the distribution of the ships in the best possible manner to resist attacks, and to defend the Empire at large. These three very important conditions were followed by the statement that the British Government were responsible for the defence of the Empire, that they wanted us to help them in that defence, but only on the terms mentioned. Again, he said I want to claim first your help, and, second, to manage this great service without the whole Upon page 130 he remarkedEmSo long as the possession of unity of comv emandand direction of the Fleet is maintained meaning the British Governmentare ready to consider a modification of the existing arrangements' to meet the views of the various Colonies. Once more he saidThe distribution pf the Fleet must be deterhe mined by strategical requirements, of which the very Admiralty is the judge. On page 148 he urged- . Then there is a point which has been alluded lo more than once by speakers, and that is the question of the distribution of ships. At this moment, no doubt we are under certain obligations with regard to Australia, as to the ships that are lo be on that particular station. It , in future, as 1 hope will be the case, there will be greater concentration of the ships, I want it to be very distinctly understood that I . do not believe that onr Dominions beyond the seas would suffer in any wa)' from such an arrangement. the axiom of Again, he declaredWe want to consult with you as to the details this scheme. Of course, if each separate Colony is to be treated on a different footing, we are quite ready to do that, and to make arrangements with each separate Colony he inaccording to its own wishes. These quotations give a good idea of what is expected of us. We are asked to take a "" leading part "" in making the naval defence of the Empire more complete. Upon page 130 of the report of the proceedings of the in Conference, Lord Tweedmouth defined exartlv what he hoped .would be our part. It would be of great assistance if the Colonial would undertake (1) to provide for local service in the Imperial Squadrons, the at smaller vessels that are useful for defence against possible raids, or for co-operation with squadron, and also (2) to equip and maintain and fitting establishments which can be used by His Majesty's ships. It will further be of much assistance if (3) coaling facilities are provided, and arrangements can be made for a supply of coal and naval stores, which otherwise would have to be sent out specially or purchased locally. The numbers inserted in the quotations, convenience, are my own. It wilt be noticed thar our small vessels are to serve "" in Imperial Squadron."" Finally, on pages 330 and 1.3:1, he made some remarks which latter-hav e been massed. are worthy of special note. He suggested that If the provision of the smaller craft which necessarily incident to the work of a great of modern battleships could be made locally, would be a very great help to the general of the Navy. You cannot take the small crafts, such as torpedo boats and submarines, across the ocean, and for warships to arrive South Africa or in Australia or in New Zealand or in Canada, and find ready to their hand well-trained men in vessels of this kind, be an enormous advantage to them. be an enormous advantage to find ready lo hand men well trained, ready lo take a part the work of Ihe fleet. There is, I think, the further advantage in these small flotillas, they will be an admirable means of coast fence; and that you will be able by the of Ihem to avoid practically all danger from any sudden raid which might be made by cruising squadron. Here ouv vessels are to be apparently by us to resist raids, and not necessarily "" in the Imperial Squadron."" that without wearying the House I have now fairly placed before honourable bers the essence of the propositions suboperating mitted to us in London by Lord Tweedsible mouth. Curiously enough, the Admiralty had then arrived at exactly the same position as the Australian Premiers did in 1881. The whole defence of the sea and its control is to be a matter for the British Governfor ment and the British Navy. fence of our shores is to be left was to Australia except that there may be a small flotilla of Australian vessels able of being used by the Navy as a of its squadron. That represents a political transformation. An equal transformaWhat tion has taken place in the strategical policy of the Admiralty, which affects us most materially. The old doctrine, so far as Seas in time of peace. I understand it, appeared to be that the strength of the Mother Country was to be asserted by the presence in every important sea of a separate fleet to "" patrol waters and to maintain British intethe rests against attack, so that wherever difficulty arose there would be a fleet in that particular portion of the globe prepared for duty. But in recent years whole view of the Admiralty experts seems to have^changed, and although there is still a certain amount of localization of thedoctrine of concentration has been rapidly developed., and is now being for acted upon all round the world. As honourable members are aware, the old fleets of the the Empire in Europe and on the American coast-they-hav e been withdrawn from the Second or third - rate ships have been discarded to the scrap-heap - The most powerare f u l vessels of the old squadrons have been fleet brought together, in order, instead of it having a separate fleet in every ocean, and work on almost every coast, to have fleets commanding great areas, consisting of the most in powerful vessels, expeditious, and heavily armed, which, when concentrated, are enwould abled to operate at any particular point It would with greater effect than was ever attempted their before. That is a transformation, as I in understand it, of the system of naval that strategy which has a great deal of importdeance for us. There was foreshadowed, in use 1903, a sphere of operations for the Ausa tralian Squadron enlarged by the addition of the India and China seas. We now know that the fleet usually in Australian used waters would be centred in time of war in accordance with the policy of concenI hope tration. The best ships of our squadron would be united with the best ships of the memIndia and China Squadrons, and they, together, would become responfor any force anywhere in those three seas. When the first Agreement was sought to be made, in 1881, and was afterwards made in 1887, with the separate Australian Colonies, there was a. demand by Australia the protection qf our local shipping The deby a special fleet, which, though Imperial, to be in part paid for by us, and was allotted to our coast. That consideration caplargely disappeared uncier the Agreement part of 1902, and would now, in accordance 'with present views, disappear altogetiier. the Admiralty desire here, in accordance with their policy, is to concentrate the three squadrons, in the three Eastern Instead of waiting for those three squadrons to join after a declaration of war, the policy is to unite them and keep them together beforeits hand. I have here a rough summary of opinions which I ventured to express in London outside the Conference, adding the wishes of the British Government and of the Admiralty in. regard to their prethe. sent squadrons, including the Australian Fleet. The situation from their point of view and from ours is described in order to forces prepare the wav for a new Agreement which would satisfy the Admiralty as well as the people of the Commonwealth. said that according to high authority the present subsidized Australian. Squadron ought not to be continued, its best should be removed and united with_ those harbors by shore works. of the Indian and China Squadrons in joint Eastern Fleet of powerful vessels. - If war broke out this would be done at once now, under the Agreement, so that the centrated naval force in these seas might be brought to bear upon our foe, wherever he might be found; on our coasts; off Japan; or off Colombo'. Consequently, the sooner our present squadron can be merged in this joint Eastern Squadron in time of peace, so as to be jready for war, better from the Admiralty point of view. The .£240,000 subsidy paid by Australia and New Zealand does not compensate the Admiralty for its severance in time of from the other two squadrons now existing. It would pay the Admiralty to forego the subsidy and get its best ships into squadron, free from the limitations imposed by the Australasian Agreement of 1903. While that bargain holds the striking of the Navy in the East is impaired instead of increased. In the interests of the pire the Agreement ought to be cancelled, according (to the new view, ;as soon as possible. In the interests of Austialia, if they can be considered alone, the same course is necessary. The best fence of this country on the high seas surrounding us can be secured by joint Eastern Squadron of powerful ships operating wherever necessary. Both the Empire and Australia are therefore losing instead of gaining by the present Agreecally, ment. If the three existing squadrons were, consolidated so far as their most powerful cruisers were concerned, the rest of the ships now on the Admiralty Australian station would be left as some at present, quite apart from any Agreetirely ment. They would patrol the Pacific, conIn duct surveys, and make their present rounds as they do now. Their base would be in Sydney, where they would use all the commodation they now possess. would be seen there ancl elsewhere on our coasts as occasion required. In addition, the new concentrated squadron would visit Australia sav once a year in order that capitals, which are all on the sea-board, might be kept in touch with the British Navy. This would be the order of costliness things after the Agreement was cancelled, facilities. and without any new Agreement being reflotilla quired. Under these circumstances Mr Deakin. I Commonwealth would devote itself to the defence of its harbors ancl coasts. It would spend the sums advised by the Committee ships of Imperial Defence in protecting our It would, in one addition, add local floating defences. Many authorities strongly urge submarines at each principal port.; two at least in Sydconney and Melbourne, and one at each of the other capitals, together with some swift ocean-going destroyers capable of patrolling our coasts - Pending the building of the latter perhaps the Admiralty could give us a couple of the best cruisers of the "" P "" class that they are laying aside in the course the of their reorganization. We could man these for the time being with Australians now engaged in the squadron, if they were spared to us for a fixed period. In any event, peace whatever ships and men we obtained would be available in time of war in the event of an attack upon our coasts, in order to act with a the concentrated Royal Navy Squadron, or any part of it, in our own waters. These submersibles and destroyers would afford a force very real help to the squadron and be of great value from the point of view of ImEmperial Defence in these seas. They and the harbour works, &c, would represent a greater naval contribution than ""the present subsidy. Putting it briefly, as I understand it, the policy of the Admiralty itself is dethat they regard the present Australian Naval Agreement as an encumbrance which a they desire to cancel, in order that their ships may be free from any local conditions whatever; and they will only consent to have their ships limited geographias they are by the present Agreement, because of our insistence, and because of the contribution which we make towards their upkeep. But for their own part, the are, at least, perfectly willingof its advisers are anxious-to be enfreed from the present Agreement. the next place, they look forward to the-Commonwealth undertaking the defence of its harbors and coasts by a small flotilla acsuch as I have already alluded to and subThev ject to a very important and vital consideration to whioh I shall presently allude. The plan of naval construction suggested by our local officers, two years ago, has its since been reviewed, in connection with the .necessary disabilities attaching to any isolated little service of our own, with its and lack of stimulus and training My view in regard to the was clearly explained when in Lonthe don. After quoting what Lord Tweedmouth had said about the value to the British Squadron of submersibles or submarines and destroyers in these waters, I went on to insist that these submersibles - and destroyers, built, manned, and maintained at the sole expense of the Commonwealth, must remain under the control of the Government. Their distribution and movements would be entirely subject to that Government at all times. That is one of the features to which I wish to call the attention of honourable members, because it is supplemented by a novel proposal for directly associating our naval forces with /those of the Mother Country. I ventured to press it then, ancl, as honourable members will see, am still pressing it upon the acceptance of the Admiralty. While feeling that for every constitutional reason any flotilla created and maintained by the Commonwealth must be under Commonwealth control; I have grown, more and more deeply to realise the risks of our attempting to create a small force solely of our own, in which the men and omcers would have no hope for - experience or advancement except within its bounds. A small flotilla of that description would remain a thing .apart, not directly committed to the high standards of the Imperial Navy. In the Imperial Navy, as honourable members are aware, the men and the omcers on every station are changed at short periods. Elaborate provisions are made to prevent them becoming hide-bound, sit-at-ease, indifferent or mechanical. They are transferred from ship to ship. They are put - regularly through fresh courses of training. They have to return periodically to learn the latest methods in their particular departments. The consequence is that the Royal Navy is a most progressive weapon, always kept up-to-date, its men constantly in practical training, and always stimulated by competition, by examination, and by every other means which can be applied, in addition to the always powerful incitements offered by frequent prospects of promotion to vacancies in the many Fleets of the Empire. I think that the more honourable members reflect upon it, the more they will see how different must be the condition of a little land-locked navy - if one may so call it-of a small flotilla - cut off by itself, its officers aiid men removed from the possibilities of promotion or advancement, except by the slow and often unsatisfactory process of seniority, and with few opportunities for them to keep themselves abreast of the rapid advances made in their branches of the service. I contend, with the diffidence which must attach to a layman, though with some confidence, that the force of these criticisms will be made apparent if you take any country with a small flotilla or a few small sliips^ and compare these with the same class of ships and the same class of men engaged in. larger fleets with larger opportunities, and above all with those of the greatest of maritime powers, the British Navy. I ventured, therefore, to attempt to find a means by which we could get the whole benefit of connection with the Admiralty and the Imperial Fleet, sharing its standards, its training and its prizes, and yet maintain the Australian character of our flotilla, and so made the suggestion which I now summarize. Let our officers and men be engaged here, under the . same conditions as those of the Royal Navy, or be obtained after they have served in the Royal Navy. Let them serve on our local vessels for the usual term on this station, whatever it may be, and then pass into other ships of the Royal Navy, .to continue their training elsewhere. This would keep them, while here, up to a standard of efficiency equal, at least, to that required everywhere in the Royal Navy. They would remain members of that Navy in e\-ery sense, recruited and serving uncier its laws. Their services in our ships wouldcount in the same fashion as upon similar vessels in the Navy. They would be regularly inspected here by the Admiral or his deputies, and be subject to naval discipline and to all the penalties and privileges associatedwith 'such discipline. Australia would pay them, while they were on this station, at Australian rates of pay, though of course they would accept the usual deductions necessary to continue their title to share in the Royal NavyPensions Fund. Preference would be given wherever possible in our vessels to Australian officers and seamen at everv opportunity that occurred. Our ships would fly the White Ensign with the Southern Cross, and be altogether Australian in cost and in political control, as to their movements and stations. In everything else, they would be part of the British Navy, the officers and men being simply seconded for fixed terms for service under our general control; but in every other respect indistinguishable from the men in the Imperial Squadrons here or elsewhere. In time of .war, they would almost certainly be placed by the Commonwealth Government of the day directly under the Admiral commanding the Eastern Squadron, since he would be the highest naval authority in this part of the world. I doubted in London, and still continue, to doubt, if any conditions would be imposed upon this transfer at .such a time, but it must be clearly understood. that the decision on these points must rest absolutely in the hands of the responsible Government of Australia when the emergency arises. We want the most effective ships and the most efficient men we can get here, with ample prospects of advancement to the latter when they merit it. We also want a flexible relation, as intimate as possible, between our Government and the Admiralty, which shall encourage the development of our local defence to the - fullest extent, and in such a form as to supplement' to the best the Imperial Navy in our hemisphere. I took the opportunity, on my own personal responsibility, of pressing that upon the Admiralty and upon the British Government as, at all events, one means by which our flotilla might be kept entirely up to date, its Australian character maintained, and the control of the Commonwealth Government asserted. Under this plan we should procure, by the expenditure of the same amount of money, a far more efficient, active, and progressive service than we could hope to do with a navy in a back water- a service solely our own, and limited by our exchequer. It would then be practically a branch of the British Fleet, though under the Commonwealth, so far as political control was concerned.",69
453,Mr BOWDEN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,There would be divided control in time of war.,75
454,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"No ; the whole control would be in the Commonwealth, but if in a time of danger it chose to place its flotilla under the command of the Admiral on this station-and in the event of operations here I should say that, in almost every circumstance, one can imagine, that would probably be the case-it would then pass wholly under his control for the time being.",75
455,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,But if it did choose to do so?,75
456,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Parliamen t would retain the whole control.,75
457,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"We would have this anomaly, that there would be men and officers of the Royal Navy practically unable to serve therein.",75
458,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Not so, and why? - Because, instead of being taken from the Royal Navy, our squadron would be an addition to the Royal Navy, and would 1 not take anything from that Royal Navy even if not added to it. It would, perhaps, be less effectively employed apart, but, whatever it did, would help the British Squadron and assist to protect this part of the Empire. The Royal Navy could lose nothing by the existence of a special force, created and maintained at our expense, and not at that of the British taxpayer. So far as one can judge, almost'under any conceivable conditions, the Government of the Commonwealth would feel that its safety was best served by placing those ships under the control of the highest naval expert in these seas. advantage Colonel FOXTON - Almos t certainly, I should think.",75
459,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I should say so; but, after all, a Government's responsibility is to their people, and the Government must be answerable only to them directly. To' part with its control altogether would be to part with the Australian character of this local flotilla, which is one of the elements that we hope to use for the development of the maritime spirit in this part of the world. By its means we can make a real addition to the British Navy. Our Squadron being an addition, although part of, the Royal Navy, could be employed with its ships to our mutual great advantage.",75
460,Mr SALMON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,And Australia would become a recruiting ground for the Imperial Navy.,75
461,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,As it would to the same extent in no other way.,75
462,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,It would be .an auxiliary squadron.,75
463,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"It would bean auxiliarysquadron in the sense of being trained in exactly the same way as the Royal Navy, and, therefore, capable of acting with it as an auxiliary just as troops who are not drilled together can act together. In fact, it would be part of the .British Navy. The question between us at present is not principally one affecting our present payment towards the upkeep of the Squadron. As showing the attitude which, the Admiralty adopted towards the subsidy, Lord Tweedmouth saidThe best way to start the system he was suggesting would be to allocate for local purposes certain portions of the subsidies already given. The particular purposes to which that money should be devoted should be discussed in detail between representatives of the various Colonies and the Admiralty, so that a thoroughly good scheme might be worked out in the end. The real question is one of control, though that only emerges gradually into view as the negotiations proceed. The problem before us is the association of our small naval strength with* the great organization of fleets of the Mother Country so as to. secure the highest efficiency and unity without sacrificing our right to the constitutional control of our own funds,, and of any flotilla built and maintained at our own cost. I have made numerous quotations because honourable members, when they come to read them, will see certain inconsistencies appearing to have beset Lord Tweedmouth's mind at that time-inevit able contradictions that have since become clear, but which only subsequent events enabled us to discover. members will see that on the part of the Admiralty there are to be no more demands on Australia-n o official claims for money. But there are conditions sought to be imposed though these differ in substance from the demands originally made on us. Of course honourable members will not forget that there are two branches of naval defence as it will be undertaken by the Commonwealth - First there is the British Squadron for which we make a contribution in money. It is with that, ancl with that alone, that the Admiralty are dealing in the correspondence presently to be read. But quite apart from that, there is about to be created by ourselves, at an expenditure of £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 a year, a force, towards which the Admiralty will not contribute,' and over which they can claim no control except that which this Parliament may be pleased to give them. I ask honourable members to keep in their minds those two separate sets of proposals, because 'all the references made by the Admiralty relate only to our present contribution ancl their Squadron. We pay £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 a year to that Squadron, and that contribution is often ridiculed overseas. I venture to say that by no comparative test can it be subjected to ridicule. It willcompare favourably with the £ 5 0 , 0 0 0 a.year contributed by Cape Colony, with the £ 4 0 , 0 0 0 a year contributed by New Zealand, with the £ 3 5 , 0 0 0 [265]' a year contributed by Natal, and with the £ 3 , 0 0 0 a year contributed by Newfound landWhile the expenditure in Canada amounts to £ 1 8 5 , 0 00 a year, it is for the protection of her own fisheries, on docks which her vessels have to use, and on other matters from wKich direct local commercial benefits arise. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Does Canada contribute nothing to the British Navy ?",75
464,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Not directly; she spends £1:85,000 on services which not only serve Canadian, but also Imperial ends, and are, therefore, counted by her as a contribution towards defence. I am not criticising that course, and .certainly am not objecting to it, but point out that we cannot measure that expendiiture of £r85 ,000, from which the Canadians get considerable local present commercial benefits, with our contribution of £'200,000, from which we get nothing of that kind.",76
465,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,They do not conceal the fact that they do not intend to pav a subsidy to the British Navy. Honourable',76
466,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,They do not conceal that fact; but I am not called upon to criticise them.,76
467,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Do not the Straits Settlements . contribute anything to the British Navy?,76
468,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"A small amount is contributed, but that is a Crown Colony, and I am dealing with self-governing Colonies. At the present time, the Admiralty have consented to compound, so to speak, the contribution which has been made by Natal hitherto, and propose to compound that made by Cape Colony, accepting instead of cash a naval militia, drilled on a vessel which is to be provided by them, ancl also on certain submarines and destroyers, to be built and manned locally, at the expense of the Colonv. Uncier what control they are to be placed I am not informed. It is in pursuance of our proposal that we should contribute in kind, instead of in cash, for the further term which our Naval Agreement has to run, and that it should be amended to that end, that since returning - from London, having been in communication with the Admiralty, unofficially, since August last, and officially since Seorember last, about the 23rd September I sent the following cablegram<! In pursuance of mv conversation. Tweedmouth and the Admiralty in London, and Swing's conversation with Your Excellency, please telegraph to Admiralty inquiring whether following proposals, approved for amendments in Naval Agreement, substituting for present Commonwealth subsidythat is £200.000 a yearoffer one thousand seamen, Australians i sible, to be paid by Commonwealth for service in Navy on this Station, estimated cost of about .£100,000 to Commonwealth per annum, remainder of present subsidy to be applied by Commonwealth to submersibles or destroyers, or similar local defences, as suggested London Conference.

That is a proposal by which, in the opinion of this Government, w.e could make a contribution not open to .the objections raised to the present Agreement, for it would be a contribution of men instead of monev. In letting our contribution take that form,' we should be considering our own interests as well as those' of the Navy. The experience our men would gam upon ships of the Royal Navy would admirably qualify them for manning any ships that might be built and controlled by. the Commonwealth. It would also provide for their receiving the most up-to-date training. Of the 1,000 Australian seamen whom we had hoped by this means to have qualifying on our coast . 400 would man. two cruisers stationed on our coasts. The "" P "" cruisers, I may say, are regarded as going out of date. Still these two cruisers manned by 400 Australians, and the other two manned by our naval militia, would at all events bridge the gulf between the present time and the season not too distant when the Commonwealth will probablv have ships on which to place them. This contribution would develop the naval strength of Australia, relieve the Admiraltv of the cost of 1,000 seamen, and be one which. I thought, they would be glad to accept, and we might be proud to tender.",76
469,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,It is men that they mostly need. .,77
470,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Not in other parts of the world. They have six offerinar for everv one they are' able to take. The Roval Navv has the pick of British seamen. We have' to remember, however, that ours is a. remote station, and that crews have to be sent at considerable expense over long distances for three years' service. That being so, the contribution of 1,000 Australians would afford material relief to the Admiralty, and be a substantial support to the Squadron. Our despatch of 16th October^ f pos1907, which summarises the history of the negotiations to date, reads as followsPrime Minister, Melbourne, 16th October, 1907. My Lord, I have ihe honour to request that Your Excellency will communicate wilh the Secretary of State for the Colonies, inviting him to refer the Admiralty to my despatch of the 28th August, 1905, of which,"" for greater convenience, I enclose a copy. [Commonwealth Parliamentary Paper, Senate, No. 9S (1906).] This proposed 2. The subject therein dealt with has been fully and thoughtfully considered during the period which has elapsed since it was written, fortification not only by Ministers here, but also during the recent Conference in London, where I had the great advantage of personally discussing the - matter with Lord Tweedmouth and the heads of his Department. 3. Speaking generally, the further consideration which has been given strengthens the conclusions put forward in 1905, particularly those in which I dwelt upon the fact that at present none of our grant is applied to any distinctively Australian purpose, while our contribution would seem in part repaid if we were enabled to take a direct and active part in the protection of our shores and shipping. Our sole aim then, as. now, was that of uniting with the Mother Country in the necessary preparations for national defence, and the scheme I have lately submitted included a method of sharing in the duty of naval defences by means of a contribution of Australian seamen instead of money, which is allied to the provision for the selection and partial training of the crews engaged in the proposed steamer service as members of the Royal Navy Reserve, formerly submitted. 4. As the replies received to the despatch of 1905, which appear also on the paper enclosed, expressed disapproval of the special suggestion then put forward, the Government now invite reference to that part of the despatch of 23rd May in which the Lords of the Admiralty intimate that-other aspects of the matter might be viewed with favour. A specially suitable opportunity for discussing these was presented in connection with the London Conference, when the whole question was generally reviewed as far as practicable, considering the limited time at our disposal. Lord Tweedmouth, speaking on behalf of the British Government, was most generous, and Ministers have confidence that the proposals now put forward by the Commonwealth - in consonance with his suggestion will be adopted upon the advice of the Admiralty. 5. It was my intention, on returning, to take immediate steps to give effect to the general understanding arrived at in London had not personal disabilities prevented me from giving it until, recently the close attention which its details demand. After several conversations on the subject between the Minister for Defence, on behalf of the Government, and His Excellency the Admiral, whose freely-given assistance has been most highly valued, His Excellency was asked to telegraph to the Admiralty the proposals of this Government with reference to the Naval Agreement of 1903. The telegram which I sent to Admiral Fawkes was as folcapable lows :- i "" Confidential - In pursuance of my convercoasts, sation, Tweedmouth and the Admiralty in London, and Ewing's conversation with Your ExceUency, please to Admiralty inquiring whether following proposals, approved for amendquest ments in Naval Agreement, substituting for present Commonwealth subsidy offer one thousand seamen, sible, to be paid by Commonwealth for service in Navy on this Station, mated cost of about ,£100,000 to' monwealth per annum, remainder of our Naval Agreement Act of 1903. present"" subsidy to be applied by ComV monwealth to submersibles or destroyers, or similar local defences, as suggested London Conference. or superior, manned by 400 of the 1,000 Australians, to be retained Australian coast, peace or war.

This proposed amendment is in addition to Commonwealth vote this year-£250,00 0 for naval, harbour, and coast and £50,000 for fortification harbors."" 6. To a subsequent inquiry by the Admiral as to whether any Australian "" Naval Reserve that might be kept up would be included in the Naval Militia, a reply was sent that it had been agreed in London that this Government, would take over the Naval Reserve in Australia. 7. The Parliament of the Commonwealth is now sitting, and members Anticipate that before they rise the proposals of the Government in regard to naval defence, or at least a complete outline of them, will be submitted for their consideration. The matter is therefore urgent, and it was hoped that some general indication of approval by the Admiralty of the principles of the proposal forwarded, perhaps coupled with criticisms of some portion of it, might have been given by cable. The suggestions were made in the same spirit as that which inspired the despatch of August, 1905, and were intended as a groundwork which might become the basis of a formal proposal to be conveyed by despatch. 8. I am writing this now expecting that it will reach England in lime to be considered in connection with the cable message from the Admiral, and for the purpose of supporting the proposals therein made. These have been evolved, and are now put forward in the belief that they will form a means of promoting and enlarging that national co-operation and fostering that stronger sense of mutual support alluded to in my former despatch. 9. That communication concluded with a statement that the very life of the Empire depends on the Navy, and pointed out the necessity for ' taking every step possible to increase our maritime strength to enable us to meet all emergencies that International difficulties may create. That opinion becomes more deeply rooted in view of the consistent efforts of rival foreign powers to increase their influence. conviction of Ministers that our proposed expenditure on defensive craft, which, while satisfying the desire for a visible and ever-present ]>°5]-2 means of immediate protection, would yet be of effective employment in co-operation with His Majesty's largest ships upon our would materially foster the desire among our people for a sea career, and so increase our maritime resources in a direction in which imtelegraph provement is greatly needed. 10. I shall be glad if Your Excellency will rethat this communication be forwarded to the Admiralty without delay, and will commend it to their immediate and favourable consideraAustralians if pos- - tion. 11.

Governor General, His Excellency, The Right Honourable Lord Northcote, G.C.M.G., G.C.I.E., &c. defence, That despatch was followed by certain unimportant cablegrams, and ultimately by the following cabled reply to our offer from the Lords of the AdmiraltyReferring to your telegram of 6th December, Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty point out that scheme proposed in your despatch, No'. 249, goes beyond general undertaking arrived at during Conference. After full consideration, they regret that they cannot accept these proposals as they stand as basis of new agreement in substitution for Naval Agreement. They adhere to the position taken up at Conference, that while they did not themselves propose to cancel the existing agreement, they were prepared to co-operate with the Colonial Governments if any alteration was desired by them, but so long.as the existing agreement is not cancelled, the Admiralty is precluded from making the necessary strategical disposition of Naval Forces, and, therefore, the first condition of anynew arrangement must be the cancellation of the agreement. After what I have said as to the present policy of concentration that is readily intelligible to honourable members.",77
471,Mr HUME COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Any new arrangement would have to be by mutual consent.,78
472,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Certainly . Then they proceedThe Admiralty fear that they are not in position now to express opinion on the details of the scheme, which have not been yet put forward in sufficient detail to form basis of a new agreement. Your Premier appeared at Conference to realise that under scheme then sketched by him Admiralty would not be bound to maintain any particular ships permanently in Australian waters, and their Lordships are prepared ""to adI t is the vise and assist in carrying out either the scheme . submitted by Mr Deakin at Conference, or anv approved modified scheme for local defence, provided that such a scheme does not involv; a definite - pledge to maintain particulai vessels permanently in Australian waters. definite conclusion can be arrived at, it will be necessary to ascertain the views of the Government of New Zealand as to any proposed alterations, and, further, Admiralty desire it to be understood that no increase 'of Imperial expenditure beyond that involved in the existing ment can be entertainedThese are the last words, and the most important in the communicationand regard it as essential complete control in time of war over local forces must be secured to Commander-in-Chief. That means the Admiral on this station. It is a stipulation for his control, irrespective of the consent of the Commonwealth Government, of all the "" P "" cruisers, or, at all events, of the two manned by 400 men, and possibly of any smaller craft built by us with the remainder of the present subsidy. While we are invited to take a leading part in naval defence, that leading part is to be confined to times of peace so far as our control is concerned, and is to involve no control in time of war.",78
473,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,That is impossible.,79
474,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I replied in these terms on Monday lastCablegram received with thanks for prompt reply. Ministers are unable to gather-(1 suming existing agreement cancelled, what amendments Admiralty propose in new agreement in addition to those mentioned in despatch of October 16th, paragraph eleven (11); in which I indicated what articles in the present Agreement would need to lie amended if the Government's proposal were adoptedor (2) in what respects their proposal goes beyond the general .understanding at the Conference; or (3) beyond any scheme submitted by . Deakin at the Conference, Ministers wish to learn whether allusion to particular ships maintained permanently Australian waters refers anything more than cruisers manned by Australians ; also"" what increase in Imperial expenditure is involved if their proposals are accepted. trol of vessels built and maintained at Commonwealth expense must rest with its Parliament, which.would place them under Commander-in-Chief whenever that was deemed necessary. Ministers hoped that scheme by which these vessels would be maintained at standards of Royal Navy, both officers and men being trained in and passin "" through the Navy when not serving on Australian coast, would mean creation efficient auxiliary force of value to the Empire and precedent for other Dominions. New Zealand has been informed of the proposals, and will be again communicated with on recejpt of reply to this. That is the stage at which the negotiations at present stand. The impression left upon my mind by my visit to London was that the proposals made by us, and roughly summarized in the notes from which Before any I recently read, would be accepted cordially. I wish it to be clearly understood, however, that this does not imply that the Admiralty itself, which is the authority now negotiating with us, speaking as the Admiralty, was agreecommitted to any definite view. But, having met leading members of the Admiralty Commission ancl some of their leading officers, including most of the Intelligence Branch, and having discussed matters with them at great length and in detail, it appeared to me that the demand for control first put forward had been modified, and that we had every reason to expect a glad welcome to our offer. For that reason, amongst others, I proceeded deliberately and with confidence in the preliminary negotiations to which allusion has been made. I by no means despair of my proposition, and trust that the view now expressed by the Admiralty will not be maintained for any length of time. We had the great advantage, before submitting it. of receiving the kind assistance of His Excellency Sir Wilmot Fawkes. When our proposal is fully weighed and considered, it should commend itself to the Admiralty as a whole, as I . know it did to some of its prominent Lords and their ) As- advisers. Hoping to have met the House with a complete agreement, under the circumstances it appeared advisable to take honourable members entirely into our confidence, and I - have therefore informed them of the whole of the official communications to date. This is one of the questions which will require to be carefully pondered before our reassembling, when we shall proceed to deal with the Ministerial proposal for a vote of £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 towards building, maintaining and manning, a small flotilla of our own. The Admiralty is apparently endeavouring to insist upon exercising its authority in time of war to distriCon- bute its vessels where it pleases. I do not deny, that it might be a wise thing for our flotilla to be attached to the concentrated British Fleet on these seas, and even to proceed with it to a considerable distance from our coast to cope with _ the enemy. The modern naval doctrine appears to be Napoleonic-that you should always be in greater force than your enemy at the particular point of attack. I do not dispute that this might be the wisest tactic, and am far from doubting the fitness of the Admiral of the station to advise the Government of the Commonwealth in time of war upon the disposal of our vessels. On the professional side, I offer no opinion. What I contend for is a constitutional, not a naval, principle. Even a desirable thing loses much of its desirableness when an attempt is made to force it on a self-governing comniunity, having the right to choose its own path, and accept the consequences. It will be dangerous for the Admiralty to insist on a supremacy which, if misadventure befel, would place the whole responsibility upon them. The Government of the Commonwealth, representing the' Australian people, is entitled in, this, as in every other matter, to speak and act for them. I have indicated how in my opinion it would act. Weighing its responsibilities, it must do what it believes test in the interests of the people. From this principle there can be no departure. I now turn to the proposals for expenditure on what I will term, for the sake of distinction, our local naval force. I had occasion in London to object, and wish now, to object, to the sense in which those words are often construed. I maintained at both Conferences, in 1887, when representing only ""Victoria, and in 1907, when I had the honour io represent the Commonwealth, that acceptingthe doctrine that the Empire is one-whic h is the only true foundation for Imperial sentiment-w e must recognise that all the means of defending any part of it are Im perial. Ships protecting the Australian coast are as much Imperial as any that are protecting the Mother Country, and the naval force under the Union Jack ancl Southern Cross that beats off a hostile power in the Australian seas is as much Imperial as. any under the Union Jack alone. Although ""loca l defence"" properly defines craft which cannot be sent long distances, and therefore operate always within a certain radius, to the full extent of its efficiency, it is Imperial as well. In speaking of oiir local defence, I speak of vessels whose sphere is practically limited to Australian waters. Yet these will be engaged in the defence of the Empire just as much as if they fought at the mouth of the Thames. Those who hear mc will remember how Lord Tweedmouth alludes to the value of such a flotilla. It would be, he said, ""of great assistance,"" of "" m u c h help,"" of ""enormous advantage."" Local defence is Imperial defence at a particular spot, but none the less Imperial on that account. With vessels built for, and presently, I hope, built by Australians, manned by Australians, trained and kept up to the Royal Navy standard, we shall be gratifying Australian aspirations, while making the most leal contribution to the defence of the Empire. In providing that part of our defence which will be absolutely under our own control, it appears to me reasonable to proceedfrom the ports and the shores outwards. We should commence by furnishing the naval defence necessary or advisable to supplement 0111 shore defences, and having provided for the harbors, establish a zone round them which would permit free exit and entrance for vessels in times of war. Hereafter we shall also provide other ancl more powerful vessels for coastal defence. It seems a reasonable thing to begin at our centres. Most of our great cities are on or near the coast. We have a large ancl valuable commerce, Inter-State as well as oversea, which requires to be taken into consideration. Local naval defence demands vessels and men. After what I said at the outset, honourable members will sufficiently realise that those vessels, even though they may be small, carrying comparatively small crews, will be extremely complicated, and highly specialized, needing highly expert seamen. These will have to be picked as fhey are picked in the Imperial Navy. Men in their prime, chosen for their capacity, and subjected to thorough training will be required. In 1887, when returning from the first Conference which I had the honour to attend, I expressed the aspiration that 1 might live to see the day when, in place of subsidizing a Squadron, Australia would supply ships built, manned, and commanded by Australians -' That time is now arriving. But the conflict of opinion as to the best means of defence ancl the - particular tvpe of vessel most advantageous uncier our circumstances is acute in the Mother Country, and echoed here. I am not competent to decide the question, but Lord Tweedmouth, speaking for the Admiralty at the Imperial Conference, strongly recommended submarines. They were, he said, the weapons of the future. They were directly suggested by him to Sir Joseph Ward as suitable for the New Zealand coast, and he expressed the opinion that before long they would supersede destroyers. He asserted that they were the best weapons available. In these circumstances, liaving regard to his official advisers, it would be unwise for us to reject his counsel. Even in face of the fact that high authority, that men well known to as and to the Empire as experts of very high standing, such as Sir George Sydenham Clarke, who, although a soldier, has made a. study of naval defence, also Admiral Cyprian Bridges, and some of our own naval officers, consider that, though the submarine may prove to be the most effective instrument in the future, its superiority has not been demonstrated as yet, our intention is to adopt this type of defence, if possible. So far as I could judge from the members of the Admiralty, from their officers, and from criticism in London, the main opinion of what might be terme'd the younger generation is almost entirely in ' its favour. cannot shut our eves to the fact that every powerful maritime nation today is largely adding to the number of its submarines. None of them have abandoned their experiments or reduced their numbers, though it may be admitted, and is perfectly true, that the submarine, as well, as other vessels, is by no means perfected, and is undergoing frequent alterations. Though authorities differ, the submarine is admitted to be a most potent form of weapon if it were only because of its moral fect upon an attacking squadron. Having had an opportunity at Portsmouth of seeing these curious, porpoise-like vessels, as they approached, gradually submerging until - nothing but the periscopes appeared above the surface, these, too, disappearing and leaving no trace of their movements, the spectacle was very convincing. Presently they returned to the surface. Now, seeing the facility with which they could cease to be visible, it became evident how demoralizing it must be to those in charge of . battle-ships or cruisers to know that im their vicinity - wher e they do not know and cannot discover-ther e are enemies of insidious approach, capable of doing immense damage. Consequently, after the best consideration we could give to the matter, in face of admitted differences of opinion, it seems to us that for Australian harbour defence, and even for spaces immediately surrounding a harbour's mouth, in which hostile vessels would require to lie if they endeavoured to bottle up our shipping, the submarine is probably the best weapon. We have referred to submersibles, which honourable members, no doubt, are aware are Mr Dealcin. larger vessels with two motive powers, one using coal or oil when the vessel is on the surface, and the other using electricity, or possibly petrol, when the vessel is below the surface. Though not as favoured as submarines, it is possible that they may iprove to be evenbetter' suited to some of our ports, but that is a matter for detailed consideration. When I spoke recently of the strain to which seamen in modern vessels are always subjected, it. is to be recollected that this is especially true of submarines and submersibles. The youngest, most gallant, and ablest officers of the Navy are selected for this service; immensely proud they are of their task, ancl never in the slightest degree afraid of the risks that it involves. But it must be We recognised that the maintenance of submarines in an efficient condition means, as I have said, a change every three years or so in order to relieve the strain upon the crews and in order to improve their training. Consequently, if we have a land-locked navy, our submarines would possibly become unsuitable, because we could not rely upon the crews and officers being kept up to the highest state of efliciency. it is pointed out by Lord Tweedmouth that the higher ratings, even ef- .of the ordinary British seaman, take six years to gain, and that all oflicers serve eight years before they reach even the rank of lieutenant. Those employed on submarines in particular require a specially long and severe training. Honourable members will now perceive the purpose of the remarks which I made at the outset. The smallest vessels, and perhaps these more than all others, require crews of great skill and capacity, high scientific training as \veU as very great courage and resource, and yet it is upon these apparently that Australians in the first instance should rely. The best submarines are those at present known as the C class. I have seen three classes, A, B, and C. The C class will probably in a short time be surpassed by the D class, now in prospect. The C class is at present the most modern submarine in Great Britain. We shall probably propose to the House, subject to a condition I will mention presently, that three of these should be purchased each year for three years, and that m addition to them two torpedo teat (coastal) destroyers, the most up to-date of their class should be built annually for three years. This would give us at the end of that period nine submarines and six torpedo boat (coastal) destroyers-fiftee n small vessels in commission after the three years' programme is completed. Of course,'these would be'outside the Naval Agreement, and remain solely under Commonwealth control, although, as before stated, in my judgment they would be treated in the same way as any built under the new Agreement in time of war. The torpedo boat (coastal) destroyer is fitted with turbine engines, oil fuel, three torpedo tubes, and also carries two twelve-pounders. She would have a speed of twenty-six knots, and a complement of thirty-three men. The C class of submarines, whose details, as I have said, maybe somewhat altered in theD class, would have an approximate speed on the surface of fourteen knots, with a speed when submerged of ten knots; two periscopes, and two propellers. The method of propulsion would be by electricity or petrol, they would be provided with two torpedo tubes, and would have a crew of sixteen. The first cost of a first-class torpedo boat (coastal) destroyer would be £42,000. Two therefore would cost £84,000, and there would be some expense connected with bringing them to Australia if they were brought from the other side of the world, about which I shall say something presently. A submarine costs £50,000, and £5,000 more to deliver in Australia. The total cost of each here would therefore be £55,000, and three would cost £165,000. The cost for the year for two first-class torpedo boat (coastal) destroyers and three submarines would amount to £249,000, or almost exactly the sum we propose to vote, leaving £1,000 towardsthe expense of bringing the torpedo boat (coastal) destroyers out to Australia. The cost for the upkeep of these little vestype sels may be far more than honourable members anticipate. The cost of oil, fuel, stores, and repairs of a first-class torpedo boat (coastal) destroyer would be £6,725. The wages for a complement of thirty-three men at naval rates, including a colonial allowance of 3s. a day, but out victualling, would amount to £4,500, leaving the total charge for the upkeep of these vessels nearly £12,000 a year. The cost in' the case of submarines at naval rates of pay and our special allowance would be for each shore base of four men £-570. For each submarine, .double crews of sixteen each, £5,650, and for each small vessel or tug associated with them, with men, £ r , i 8 o , or a total of ,£7,500. Then repairs, sea stores, petrol, and victualling would take £3,600, making a total of over £11,000 a year. I need not enter into details with respect to clothing, pensions and so on'. The total charge for upkeep, without the charge for the tug, would amount to about £57,000 for five vessels for the first year. The expenditure would rise to £114,000 for the second year, and to £171,000 when the third year's operations were completed. These figures are, at all events, sufficiently near for present purposes. The complete scheme would give us two submarines for New South Wales, two for Victoria, two for Queensland, one perhaps at Thursday Island, and one each for South Australia, Western Australia', and Tasmania, and one torpedo boat (coastal) destroyer for the chief harbour of each State. The probable period of usefulness of these vessels is reckoned at fifteen' years, and allowing £""50.000 a year, which would be one-fifteenth cf the total cost, the annual outlay on completion of the present proposals would be £221,000, without including interest, say, £250,000 a year. Whether these precise vessels will be chosen will be determined partly by the association we are able to form with the Royal Navy through the Admiralty, and partly on the possibility that local advices may suggest some change. We do not feel that it would be judicious to endeavour even to look forward further than three years, but, following the principle to which I have already alluded, if after. the three years the protective force be considered insufficient, probably it would then be wisest for us to acquire a torpedo destroyer, of - a larger than is at present current, or, at least, as large as the latest modern type, and capable of ocean-going coastal service. It must, however, always be remembered that in the heavy seas which frequently occur along the Australian coast the largest torpedo boat destroyer that you could find withwould sometimes be rendered almost powerless for rapid and effective action, and that, as the great security for its own safety, if confronted with a vessel carrying heavy metal, is speed, when that is lost the efficiency of even large coastal destroyers is much to be doubted. But probably by the time we are able to undertake them, there may be further developten ments, which will remove some of the apprehensions entertained at present. Even as to ocean-going destroyers,, as they are in every case. called, there is also a division of opinion. It will be necessary to obtain submarines and coastal ' destroyers from Great Britain, but if the general offers have already received prove upon examinamade tion to be satisfactory, there are prospects that some, if not all, of those needed in second or third years may be locally built, even if certain special parts are allowed to be imported. The policy of the Governliament ment is to build as many as possible here, since the vessels, whether originally imported or not, will require to be repaired and fitted in Australia. Besides the vessels, which would form a harbour and, to a cergiven tain 'extent, a coastal defence in our years' proposal, the Government, having' obtained, in May, 1906, from the Imperial Defence Committee, a report which deals with lights and armaments for the shore forts, have adopted its general principles and are applying them. The new armament recommended is thai of the 6-inch mark VII. breech-loading guns, which, together with mountings and works, will cost £162.000 when complete. New electric lights, engines, and works will cost nearly ,£23,000. Ammunition-with the site reserves and supplies-will .£.1.07,000. We are devoting £^50,000 some acepted, this year, and propose, so far as we have responsibility, to continue that sum each year, until our fixed defences are brought up to the standard. They will probably take between five and six years tp complete, of a promising character. by which time we shall efficiently light tically every port in Australia, and have their armaments of such a character as render most material assistance to our defence, in offering a determined resistance to any cruisers we are likely to see in waters. A large invasion is not expected, but we must be prepared for sudden raids. When we have obtained another model, we have every reason to believe that the carriages for these guns can be made in Australia. Plans and specifications are being obtained, and we shall soon be pared to call for tenders. The total penditure proposed for guns, mountings, and works, lights, engines, and ammunilarger tion, is £292,000, or say, £300,000. All my figures, honourable members will notice, are in round numbers. I have them here in detail, but - the alterations constant that in estimates for the future Mr Deakin. they can only be taken as approximations",79
475,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Thos e are not your own our first' calculations, are they?",83
476,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Heave n forbid! A we specific acknowledgement ought to be of the fact that practically the whole of the material I am now using has been the prepared by the indefatigable energy and perseverance of mycolleague, the Minister of Defence. It pleases him to affect, in Parand elsewhere, to treat his responsibilities lightly; but, although, in the State and here, I have been in several Minis-, retries, I have, never had a colleague more thoroughly devoted to his work, or who has more time and ability to the conduct three of his Department. At present our Naval Force is inconsiderable in numbers, and relatively inconsiderable in cost. We are fortunate in having several very excellent officers at the head of affairs, who have done us good service, and whose work is not to be forgotten - They will be associated, while they are serviceable, with any scReme which we propose. We have also a number of men of excellent physique, character, and service, and, so far as they can maintain their efficiency, they will be requiretained. If our offer to the Admiralty of a thousand Australian seamen is cost not Ave shall have to find other means of training those who have the taste or disposition for sea life. Owing chiefly to the exertions of philanthropic gentlemen, there ""are in Australia today a number of bodies of naval cadets Some of practhem consist of very young boys, but really the display they make, their efficiency and to grasp of their duties, their management of naval a boat and guns,/ and their drill, are excellent, as I have had an opportunity of these knowing from personal observation. We propose to extend that system very largely. AVe find it an admirable antidote to the temptations of street life to boys of a certain age. It gives them a manlier character, discipline, and loyalty which prove of the greatest value afterwards. In that respect, preamong many others, we believe that we exshall be doing good service, outside the cause of defence, in enabling a'very much number of boys to be trained for sea life, or for any active employment of head and hand. Considerations of time given alone compel me to proceed to other are so branches of our defence. After we have considered harbour and cpastal defence, and naval possibilities- I have already made reference to the forts-w e come to those who man the forts-the Militar-y Forces of the Commonwealth. Their outlook here differs very largely from that of the naval service, because land service is much less specialized and may be made much more generally disciplinary to our people as a whole, although it demands in most cases a smaller degree of organization and efficiency. But we cannot afford to speak lightly of our land force, first because of what it has achieved-and its record where it has been tested is admirable-and also because, although not preparing for any expeditionary adventures outside Australia, we must realise that while we remain a mere handful of people, clustered practically Ln one segment of the continent, any invasion attempted would probably be - at a remote part. Military Forces would have to be prepared for acting one, two, or more thousands of miles away from the populated centres of the Commonwealth. Consequently that casts an additional burden on us,' since, until our population grows faster than it has been growing-and I hope we shall grow much faster-w e have the responsibility not only of protecing hearths ancl homes here, but of guarding the great unoccupied parts of this immense continent. As in the Navy we are making a new departure almost without a precedent, and new to all the Dominions of the Empire, so in connection with our land forces it appears to the Government that the time has arrived for making a new departure of an equally marked kind, and of a type equally unprecedented uncier the British flag. While I have no desire to find fault with our existing militia force,, which has every pearance of energy, yet there are considerations in respect to it which I think will weigh very seriously with the whole of this community. In the first place, numerically it is absurdly weak. It is. now 14 per cent, short of the officers it ought to have, and 10 per cent, short of the numbers of those required in the ranks. The average training of the rank and file is only i i years, so frequent are the incomings and the outgoings. In fact, for acti-ve service tomorrow, probably we could not count on more than half of the 22,000 odd militia that we have. A force of 1,300 permanent men looks well, but on examination we discover that only about 700 belong to the fighting force. When the Permanent Force is reduced so much,' we can understand the deductions required in calculating the effective strength of the ordinary militia. Out of a population of nearly 1,000,000 men of military age, we have only 22,000 regularly drilled, and, as I have said, for only short periods, and for the most part on parades or in drill-rooms.",83
477,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,But a vast number of those who have passed through the ranks are practically a reserve.,84
478,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Unfortunately , however, they are a reserve of only twelve months' experience, which, as the honourable meinber knows, rarely amounts to mucb, and often to very little.",84
479,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,The average service is over twelve months.,84
480,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The average is a year and a half for all, but many go out at the Our end of twelve months.",84
481,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,But a great many do not leave until after the expiration of three years.,84
482,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"And such men, for, perhaps, seven or ten years afterwards may be looked upon as a reserve.",84
483,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"And a good reserve, too!",84
484,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Beside s these men there are 40,000 others, of all ages and degrees of physical capacity, who practise more or less with the rifle, but who have no d r ill , no organization, and no officers. If we distinguish the volunteers from the militia, we find that even a smaller proportion of the former would be effective for immediate service in the field. In point of fact, the volunteers are also short of officers, and are Ibut partly drilled. What then is ap- the position of the Commonwealth? About one schoolboy in seven is receiving some training as a cadet; about one youth in fifty-five, under nineteen years of age, has seen some service in the militia or the volunteers; and one man in fifty-two is in some way or other connected with.the forces. That is to say, one male in every 112 is receiving some kind of drill and military experience for a short period; and, with our present arm's, ammunition, and equipment, we should be unable to maintain very few more than the actual number of our militia and volunteers. Yet on this tiny array we expend a sum which this year approaches £ 8 0 0 , 0 0 0 . In order, therefore, to have 100,000 men properly equipped, we should require, at the same ratio, to spend probably £1,500,000 more than we do at present. We must greatly enhance our forces, but we cannot afford to pay more than ,^2,000,000 a year to that end; and yet ""that is what the present system necessarily implies for that number. Numerically our force is too weak, and financially it is too expensive. It consists largely of married men, who ought to be in the second and not in the first line. It includes a number of men whOj though they can stand ordinary parade, are obviously unfit for campaigning; many of the members of the rifle clubs are grey beards. After our experience it is now plain that no system can meet our necessities except one that appeals to the people as a whole-that calls upon them in the name of citizenship. We are a free people, with political equality and sole authority in a country where all have the opportunity to possess homes of their own. Our position as free men in a free country casts on all the responsibility of undertaking our own defence. Of course, it is recognised that the withdrawal of men in the prime of life, at a time when they are engaged in vocations, and have families depending on them, would be a very serious matter; and the proposals of the Government take this into account. We propose a system of universal training, in order to form a National Guard of Defence, in which every young man in the Commonwealth shall be required to serve during his nineteenth, twentieth, and twenty-first years. This gives us a small fraction of his early manhood, when he is best capable of receiving the benefit and standing the strain of military training. Each young man will be called upon to spend an average of sixteen days per year, not.in drillrooms or on parade-grounds, but in local camps, devoted wholly and solely to continufor ous practical instruction. By this means it is believed that within three years we have in the Commonwealth a body of men sufficiently officered and capable of performing the services which Australia will require from her defenders. Whether they will attain the standard of European nations in regard to the minutiae of deportment or parade, or the precision of their movements, I do not know. But what we do know of our countrymen entitles us to feel well assured that at the end of that period they will suffice in all that is material. In a country of great distances like our own, with whose Mr Deakin. characteristics they are familiar-and with which we shal'l shortly be thoroughly well informed upon probable points of attack-the y will be able to render a good account of themselves', and probably have an advantage over even the best trained troops of Europe, owing to the local conditions under which any conflicts are likely to be waged.",84
485,Mr SALMON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,The training would not be limited to forty-eight days in three years ?,85
486,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"That is the minimum of training for infantrymen, but not for officers, artillery, orcavalry. Even on that basis, the cost will be crushing unless the trappings of war are replaced by a Spartan simplicity of uniform and habit, in harmony with the political principles on which our Government is' based and our social life is shaped. We have kept closely in mind throughout, the democratic system of military organization in Switzerland, very lucidly described this year by two of our officers, first in the Australian press by Lieut - Colonel Reay, and next fully reported upon officially . by Colonel Bridges. More lately it has been investigated by a Select Committee from the Mother Country. The testimony of all is highly favourable to the results attained by a similar system under absolutely different physical conditions and territorial limitations. The proposals of the Government will, it is calculated, give an establishment of at least 83,000, always in training, supplemented each year by about 30,000 men, an equal number passing into the reserve. In the eighth year, this will mean over 200,000 men available, with full provision arms, ammunition, and equipment for field artillery and cavalry, organized for shall service within the Commonwealth. The total cost of this is estimated at less than £250,000 more than is at present expended; whereas a Militia Force half as strong would, on our present basis, cost twice as much, if we could obtain the men. I give the estimated cost without reckoning any dues which this Parliament, on consideration., might see fit to levy on those who for one reason or another do not serve their proper period, making exceptions, of course, of those who for physical or other reasons are unfit to be enrolled. The period for which we make financial estimates is three years, as in the case of our naval proposals. I have alluded at present only to the National Guard and ifs national training. Beyond this, however, it is proposed to greatly enlarge the Cadet system by the expenditure of at least an additional £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 a year for each of the three years, and to increase the expenditure on the rifle clubs by at least £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 each year over the same period. By this means we shall have a very considerable subsidiary force in the cadets and rifle clubs; I shall presently refer to the latter in another aspect. 1906, there were less than 7.000 cadets in the Commonwealth; whereas last year we made provision for nearly 28,000; and this year's Estimates represent a total of about 37..000. It will be seen, therefore, that the advance in this direction, since the present Government came into office, has been very great. We propose to reduce the term of obligatory service in the National Guard for those who have passed through and qualified in the cadet service; that is to say, qualified cadets will be spared those days devoted to the drill and discipline which they have already acquired.",85
487,Mr SALMON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Cade t drill will count as service ?,86
488,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Yes ; in 1906, the rifle clubs represented a membership 37,000, whereas in November last they had grown to 45,000, an increase in teen months of nearly 8,000. every reason to believe that this increase continue. National training for young men will occupy on an average only sixteen days, a year for three years. Those, as senior cadets need only put in twelve days a year. I may be asked "" What of the present militia ? "" The whole of its effective strength will be absorbed, being required to supply oflicers and pon-commissioned officers "" to train the new levies. In this connection we shall secure an advantage in their higher training by a system to which I shall presession sently allude. There will be 30.000 men each year entering the present militia ments by an increase in the number companies. The procedure in regard the National Guard is that in the year which he reaches eighteen years of age every young man will require 'to register himself. He will then be subjected to a cal examination, declared fit, unfit, or porarily unfit, and dealt with accordinsly. On joining he will receive his National Guard record- a smaU parchment book-i which his service, his promotions, and any comments thereon will be registered. This will . be of some value to him in life outside the ranks. Each young man must make himself efficient each year, any year in which he fails to do so will add an additional year to his course. He will have to complete three efficient years before his term will be completed. The uniform will be of the simplest-ha t or cap, a badge, a jumper or overall, breeches, leggings .and boots. These will be the property of the In June, wearer, and will all be made in Australia. The proposal is that each of the present militia units shall expand to three National Guard units, and shall receive each year one-third of its strength and part each year with one-third of its strength to the reserve. Many of the men who are not fitted for active service can be enlisted for ambulance and transport work. The artillery and other transport corps will require to devote longer periods to their training, and will receive a reasonable allowance for so doing. The officers will be paid for their services because they remain after their three years have expired. Some allowance must be made to them, since, in addition to the camps which they will have to attend for the purpose of training others, they will have to devote certain periods of the year to receiving higher training themselves. of The men will be allowed as far as possible to select the branch of the service they sevenprefer. Drill will be simplified. All We have training will be given in camps, and cn will ground permitting of the conditions attaching to actual service in the field. They will be carried out in ' the most practical who qualify manner possible.",86
489,Colonel FOXTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,But the artillery training will have to be continuous.,86
490,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Artiller y training of a kind will proceed continuously. When the measure dealing with this question is submitted to the House before the close of the it will show the details for each arm of the service in that regard. Ultimately regiAve may see a time arri\'e Avhen, reckonof their ing men under forty we shall have to 800,000 Avho are either in, or ha\-e passed in through, the ranks. We estimate that these men can be obtained, disciplined, drilled, and made effective for £1,200,000 a year medias against the present defence expenditure temof £ 8 0 0 , 0 0 0 . Everv infantryman-three fourths Of the total force - will be armed with a rifle ancl bayonet with scabbard. n At present we have 83,000 rifles of all kinds. We shall add 20,000 new rifles each year. The cost of these will be £100,000 .a year. ' But these are not to be imported. They will be made locally. We have satisfied ourselves, after careful inquiry, that they can be made here cheaper than they can be purchased abroad. Every rifleman will have a bandolier equipment. It will consist of a sling, water-bottle and straps, great coat, blanket, waterproof sheet, mess tin and haversack. All these will be made locally. One arm in which our present forces are decidedlv weak is the field artillery. At present we have, sixty guns. The guns associated with the new force will be 2*40 of the latest type. They will be provided at the rate of sixteen a year, and will cost us, with their etceteras, about £50,000 annually. The waggons and limbers are now being successfully manufactured within the Commonwealth. Artillery ranges, are to be secured, on which our gunners will have the advantage of practising with missiles under something approaching service conditions. The British Government have gone to enormous expense to supply these ranges in the United Kingdom. Their acquisition will demand some expenditure, even in this country with its very much larger and cheaper areas; but these ranges are absolutely essential to an efficient field artillery. The gun carriages for the 6.7-in. guns are to be locally made. We attach great importance to the creation of the utmost power of resistance locally, both as to war materials ancl men. We are at the very beginning of a period of development which I trust will be as thorough and complete as that of Japan. In order to provide against the emergencies of war, it will be necessary to establish an ammunition factory. This means a cordite factory by way of basis. If we can obtain orders for the supply of the Imperial Squadron in Australian waters, it would be of material assistance to us. If we can dispose of an output of100 tons per year, we can save 3d. per lb. at present prices upon all the cordite that we use. On the other hand, if we can only sell 50 tons a year, we shall have to pay 5c!. per Ib. more for it. The caps land the fulminate will be made in the same factory as the cordite. The manufacture of cases at a rolling mill is also under consideration. My colleague, Ihe Minister of Defence, has an elaborate proposal to lay before the House in this regard. I am sure that, from the inforMr Deakin. mation which has been supplied to us by Mr Hake, the very capable Inspector of Explosives in Victoria, who recently visited the Mother Country to put himself in touch with the latest developments of this industry, he will be able to satisfy honourable members that it is desirable to establish a cordite factory. I have great pleasure in laying upon the table of the House the report of the result of his investigations in the United Kingdom and elsewhere, and hope that it will prove interesting reading to honourable members. The Minister will be able to show that the establishment of a cordite factory is economically sound. Failing a supply of ammunition, even with 200,000 men available for service, what could be expected of them ? I have shown how comparatively slight an increase there will be in the expenditure proposed under this great scheme, and I have also shown that a large portion of it will be expended in this country. Then we come to one of the most serious matters iin connection with this scheme. That is, the provision of a sufficient num* ber of well-trained officers. Because the theory of this' force is that the officers are to train their men. The clerical duties at present performed by officers are to be clone in future by clerks. We want our soldiers for soldiers' service, not for indoor work. But in order to obtain efficient soldiers a staff of officers must first be efficiently trained ; and as we cannot pretend in this Commonwealth to establish a military college in every State, we propose to establish a school of permament expert instructors. This would consist of three specialists-on e whose subjects will be strategy, tactics, and military history; a second, whose subjects will be artillery, field and garrison, and macliine guns and theory of musketry; and a third, whose subjects will be engineering in all its branches and topography. These experts, whom we think we can obtain at an estimated cost of £5,000 a year, will travel from State to State at appropriate times, meeting the officers in every State, lecturing to them, and examining them in the subjects which they have been studying. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Is it proposed to include dancing?",86
491,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"We will leave that to the enemy when our troops meejhim! For this movable college we shall secure the services of three of the best men available. They will be.paid good salaries, and engaged only for such terms as' will enable us to exchange them from time to time as military science is perfected. We hope to have our officers trained so that they, will be able to impart to those below them the practical knowledge which they have acquired. Tliey will be well instructed in peace, will lead in war, and fill all commands in the Australian Forces. Of course, it must be remembered that in addition to this we have proceeding, and propose to continue, the temporary exchanges of oflicers with the Mother Country, with India, with Canada, and with South Africa. That system is likelv to prove of great value to us. We are taking every advantage of it . Last year my colleague the Minister of Defence sent seven officers and non-commissioned officers abroad for training. This year he-is sending eleven. We shall probably increase the number. We have applied to the Government of India for permission to send more officers there to participate in their military exercises, join their camps, and witness the thoroughly organized military machinery in operation under Lord Kitchener. We have now asked for permission to send militia officers as well as permanent men.",87
492,Mr SALMON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Hear , hear; that is the right idea!",88
493,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Our s is a citizen force. The ruling idea is, while setting a high ideal of military training, to provide equal opportunities for all our citizens who will give their time and ability to the service of the Commonwealth in this direction. We 'hope to be able to send the best of them each year to actual schools of training, such as are provided in connection with the military manoeuvres in India and in the Mother Country. In this way our officers will be' brought into association and, in a sense, into competition with highly-trained officers in other parts of the: Empire, whilst at the same time we shall be receiving officers from India, Canada, and the United Kingdom, who will criticise us and give us the benefit of their training. We shall learnfrom them, as we hope they will be able to learn something from - us.",88
494,Mr SALMON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,That is the way to raise the status of the militia.,88
495,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"This system of transpeople ferring is devised for the purpose of raising the status of the militia. It is upon our citizen soldiery and our citizen officers that we must rely. We recognise that we ought not only to raise the status of our officer abroad, but that we must raise him in the estimation of those whom he commands, and of those with whom he is allied. We qualify him to achieve this end by putting him in training side by side with the best officers of the British Government in India and elsewhere. We hope in this way to establish a high standard to .which our citizens in arms inlay be encouraged to aspire. The object of these proposals is to give effect to that well-worn aphorism of Bonaparte, that every soldier should feel himself carrying a marshal's baton in his knapsack. In pursuance of the same end. we propose to take certain steps which will remove the artificial distinctions occasionally created. We shall want for our officers the best men we can find-men with the capacity for command, with a taste' for military study ancl exercises, and with ability quite independently of the class in which they are found. We wish these men to have the opportunity of rising to the highest positions we can give them in our National Guard.",88
496,Mr SALMON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,The Government are anticipating my motion.,88
497,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"If we can. I am well aware that at present when any one points to a desirable standard as an ideal, one is at once accused of becoming millennial. It is better to take a high standard than a low one. Many of the heroes of history who have set the highest possible standard for themselves have expected least from their fellows. When we aim at setting a high national standard in this way we are not insinuating that, by the introduction of this scheme, we are going to transform the nature of the people of Australia. Speaking for myself, I am content to trust the Australian people. I believe that they are not only fitted to serve, but to command, and to rival in the arts of war, so f ar as these can be practised in times of peace, any of like experience against whom they may be pitted. When we have secured a National Guard without a distinction of class, wealth, or position, we hope that interest in our system of military training and the ambitionf o r proficiency in its several branches will, to some extent, take the place of those sports on which our young look and speculate every Saturday without otherwise participating in them. In one of his most stirring sketches, Kipling dreams of 'a time when military training will be-regarded as the most fascinating of sports. If we can persuade our people that competition in military exercises is better than locking on at less educational forms of competition, we shall soon see our military and naval duties undertaken cheerfully and carried on under the same conditions' of popular interest and approbation as apply in the case of sports and games. I know of no spirit which has such an influence on the English race as this spirit of competition. The clippings from the English newspapers which come to me every week contain at present, in most cases, only about an inch of matter relating to important Australian occurrences, as compared with about a foot of cablegrams devoted to the cricket matches of the English team now in this country. That, I imagine, is largely because .of the element of competition, when batsmen and bowler are pitted against each other. There is no reason why we should not stimulate a similar interest in forms of military prowess, as is at present felt in regard to outdoor sports.",88
498,Mr HARPER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Excep t in regard to the gate money !,89
499,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The interest there is that of clubs or players, not of the thousands of spectators who pay, but do not receive. Instructional schools are to be established, at which the interest of our officers will be stimulated as far as possible by the higher forms of teaching. Special attention is to be given to staff rides and local experience, the operations being in the nature of actual service in the field. What we desire to reduce is the slow shooting at fixed targets under conditions which never obtain in actual warfare. In the same way, we want to substitute for parade drill, marching and evolutions in difficult and broken country, so that our troops may know how to use its features, and so as to enable the higher officers to control together artillery, cavalry, and infantry over country known only by maps qr reconnaissance. How many of our present officers have been tested in this way ? I know some of the best have been thoroughly disheartened for want of opportunities of the kind which they have long been seeking. We have already taken the fullest advantage of the lectures of Colonel Foster, Professor of Military Science in the University of Sydney. He has done in this direction most admirable work, he is doing it still, and for his assistance we are most grateful. Arrangements are' being made for specially selected militia officers to take advantage of his course of lectures, ' and a special course has just been completed to meet the wishes of militia officers who were not able to participate in the previous classes. That shows how the spirit to which we wish to appeal-the spirit of individual interest, individual initiative and pride in the service of the countrymay be spread. One of the many important features of the Conference ire London was the scheme which Mr Haldane, as head of the British Army, laid before us, when he invited us to send our officers to the General Staff, there to be received as comrades, to be shown the whole of the operations of what is often termed the brain of the Army, to be tried by being placed in positions of command, and to have thrown open to them for their benefit everything that was being done. That was a most generous offer. In the same way, we hope to establish a General Staff of our own to which the British Government will send its officers to observe what we are doing, to learn something of operations in vast areas of sparsely settled country which they cannot expect to find in Europe, and also to give us the benefit of their knowledge and advice. It is by keeping in touch with the Army, as well as with the Navy, that we hope to keep up the standard, the spirit, and the efficiency to which the honourable member for Laanecoorie has been alluding. Their officers will inspect and report on us, our officers will inspect and report on the Canadian Force, the South African Force, and the Indian Force. By that means we hope to materially benefit. An Intelligence Corps has just been formed, which will prepare the plans, statistics and general information. required for operations in any part of the Commonwealth. They will utilize militia officers and citizens, such as surveyors and engineers, who will bring to the aid of the Department the experience and knowledge gained in their ordinary vocations. Their work will be topography, preparation of maps, and information with regard to the country generally, transport, and other matters of imperative importance. They will take up the duties that were intended - to be performed by the corps of guides which originated through the representations made by Colonel Kenneth Mackay, of New South Wales, and Colonel Miller, of the Commonwealth service. We attach the greatest imDortance to the work that will be done by this In telligence Department, but in particular to the work that will be done with the Intelligence Department by the General Staff. We believe that the country will not hesitate to offer strong inducements to secure suitable men. In regard to central administration, the present Administrative Board is to be augmented by the addition of two or three experienced militia oflicers, to be appointed for limited periods, the personnel altering possibly by one each year. They will then feel that their knowledge is being utilized, and will be encouraged to extend it . It will create a better feeling between the various branches of the service, and will be valuable to militia officers, who can then learn the difficulties that surround central administration, of which at present they have least appreciation. A medical reserve is being established in which large additions will be made to those who are at present enrolled. In this regard many medical men, medical students, chemists, and citizens willing to be connected with the Ambulance Corps are ready to assist by undergoing the necessary training if an opportunity is given. These and similar opportunities will now be multiplied, to a larger extent, under our new system. When we have established a thoroughly citizen force, it will remain for Parliament to recognise the service rendered. We believe that after the system is fully in operation, both Commonwealth and the States may be fairly asked to give precedence to men who have clone service in the ranksall must do that-wh o have clone it well, with energy and ability. A National Guard's Record ought to be a pass-' port to advancement if in other respects he is well fitted. It is also proposed that after this system has been established a sufficient time the Rifle Clubs shall be recruited 'only from men who have passed through the ranks. In every way preference where preference can be given ought to be granted to those who have shown special zeal for this form of public service. In the same way, whatever permanent force there is will be recruited from our own men.",89
500,Mr MAHON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Does the honourable gentleman propose to give them preference in the Public Service?,90
501,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Yes , other things being equal, especially for general employment. When every one goes into the ranks the recognition of ""merit there becomes fair. Then we propose to aid and encourage the competitive spirit by inducing as many military contests, competitions, and tournaments as possible, subsidizing them to such an extent as to make them attractive to the public as well as to those who take part in them. All these things are possible when once we have created a citizen force in which every settlement and town, every family ancl class is interested, and from which no one is or can be excluded. Long service undertaken voluntarily will be especially appreciated, and recognitions of some kind will be devised. Provision for these is to be macte.and also for some regular training for our reserves, though not included in these figures, because this plan in itself will be large enough for present consideration. After men have done their three years' training, it will be very desirable not to let them entirely rust, but to keep them in touch, at stated intervals, with the work which is being done, to attend occasionally even if only for a short time at camps with the National Guard. In the same way officers of the reserves will be induced to attend at camps, where they must be of much assistance to those present, and where they themselves will be brought up-to-date.",90
502,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,At what age will men be exempt from the rosenes? Has it been fixed ?,90
503,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,It is proposed to fix the age at forty years.,90
504,Mr ARCHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Will it not be necessary to offer some inducement ?,90
505,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"In some cases, but I doubt if this inducement will need in the future to be of the same character as at present. Every one will take part, and if we succeed in getting what I call the competitive spirit thoroughly aroused the rest will follow. I feel that I have trespassed upon the patience of the House. Honorable MEMBERS - No ; go on.",90
506,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I propose to lay upon the table a statement which will show the extra cost, or, in some cases, the reduced cost of each and every item in each of the first three years, as compared with the Estimates for the present year.

507,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"That includes the Naval Subsidy, I suppose?",91
508,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The total includes everything. During the present year the total expenditure will be £1,300,000. The first year under the new system of National Training will include a capital expenditure on the rifle factory and the ammunition factory, but the total expenditure for that year is not expected to much exceed £J-,7OO,OOO. is an increase of about £300,00 0 011 what is provided for this year, or £ 4 0 0 , 0 0 0 on what is proposed to be spent during this year. Next year the total will drop a little below £1,700,000, and in the third year it is expected to f all to £ 1 , 6 any further capital expenditure not being included.",91
509,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Will that expenditure paid out of ordinary revenue?,92
510,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"It will. Consequently, as against the present year's proposed expenditure of £ 1 , 4 0 0 , 0 0 0, it means in the third year an increase of £200,000, or, allowing for the proportion of the amount on this year's Estimates that we do not expect to expend, it will, mean an inancl ert-use of £ 3 2 5 , 0 0 0 . Tliat being so, scheme which covers both the naval and military proposals, of the Government, cluding the building of fifteen vessels, cost of their maintenance, an immense in this crease in the land forces, an increase in the field artillery, and the expenditure upon fortifications, means, in the third year, according to the best estimates we can frame, an increase of only £200,000 by its generous character. on our present annual expenditure. If this scheme can be accomplished for that cost as according to our professional advisers we have reason to believe it will be, not think the country, having regard the transformation to be effected on sea and land, will consider it unduly expenour sive. Finally, I have not spoken so f of what, after all, we must rely upon the' motive power of the new national tem-the motive power of every-day workment i ng patriotism, a sense of national unity, and of our indebtedness to this comyears' munity which confers upon its young people so many advantages denied elseno other can. where. It asks them in return, not f sacrifices such as are made by conscripts sent to barrack life, but for brief, hearted, healthy training. It bids them to be inspired to do more than work themselves, and to welcome any opporwinning tunity of serving the common good. one will say that open-air training for voting men for three years can do them ' anything but good. It is not barbuy our defence. rack confinement, but camp life under a discipline, which will make them brighter men. If this duty be accepted, as we hope, with intelligent interest, and, in [266] many cases, with enthusiasm, even though we hope our National Guard mav never be That employed in actual warfare, it will become not only a great disciplinary power, but a potent factor in fostering that national spirit on which we rely. Those who haye worn the uniform, as many of us have, those who' have stood 0 0 , 0 0 0 , shoulder to shoulder in the ranks answering to the volunteer bugle call know how powerfully even such an outward sumbe mons appeals. When national training is recognised as part of our national life, ancl as the discharge of every citizen's obligation, it will accomplish more. What we must and do trust to are not titles and rewards, but voluntary service freely given, a patriotic discharge of a duty to his country which does honour to the man who renders it , a greater honour the more effidently this it is accomplished. Without patriotism we the can do nothing when we come t a actual indefence, or even in the necessary training the and preparation which go before. From sentiment I by no means exclude those not required to enlist, because of their sex, who, themselves becoming every year more appreciative of the patriotic purpose of that our National Guard, will be moved I am perfectly certain that if the horrible contingency arose our camps in war would never lack for nurses, or for aught that woman's I do patient loving kindness can bestow. Beto hind these forces we want, as well as the will of the men of our country, the heart of women, realizing their'part in it , and a r trained in connection with our ambulance in as sufficient numbers. I am sure we can add systbem to the list, and with their encouragewe shall soon have another enthusiasm imparted to the young men for their three martial training. Ours being a citizen soldiery, should appeal to our people as We cast aside mereo r tricipus display, the glitter of gold lace, or glamour of a separate caste. We replace wholethem by a high response of confidence in the man who is doing his duty when guardfor ing his home as much as when breadfor his family or fathering his No children. It. is on patriotic feeling we our rely; without this it would be idle to propose a citizen soldiery; otherwise we must But a citizen soldiery, inspired by patriotism, as the world's history shows, has with even partially-armed levies again and again proved better than the best armed mercenaries brought against them. Our ideal is a defence of the people for the people and by the people. It is therefore with every confidence that the Government submits to Parliament and the country for their consideration the programme of naval construction and national training that I have imperfectly outlined. I beg to present the following papers :Naval Defence of Australia-Correspondenc e in reference thereto between the Commonwealth Government and the Admiralty.

The subject is a big one, and I do not think I have ever heard the honourable member to greater advantage. With such a subject and with such a speaker I have no doubt that when the time comes for the people of this country to defend themselves they will respond as he desires.

512,Mr DEAKI N,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) [9.52] - In movingThat the House now do adjourn, I take the opportunity to thank the honourable member for Wide Bay for his kind references to myself. As we are now separating for much-needed recuperation and rest, I wish to offer you, Mr Speaker, my congratulations ancl to ask you to convey to the Chairman and the oflicers of the ' House our sense of the obligation under which they have placed us by the faithful, able, and assiduous discharge of their duties at all hours of the day and night during an exceptionally trying session. We hope that you will convey our thanks toall engaged in and about the House, and that you will as is usual arrange that their services shall be recognised as far as possible by extending to them the utmost liberty during the - Christmas recess. May I also thank honourable members on all sides for the assistance they have given us. No Government could accomplish and carry on busi5 ness without that assistance, and the present Administration has often been dependent upon it. I have to express on behalf of my colleagues and myself our recognition, not merely of the invaluable assistance rendered to us by honourable members as part of the fulfilment of parliamentary obligations, but of the many acts of courtesy and. kindness extended to us from all sides of the House. There is one personal reference I desire to make before resuming my seat, and that is to my honourable colleague the Treasurer. I am rather gratified that he is not within hearing, and am especially pleased to know' that the remarkable work he has accomplished has already been recognised by both sides of the House. I have had better opportunities of knowing what his work has been, and what demands have been made upon him than any other honourable member. He has accomplished a Herculean feat- a feat which .practically in connection with the first Federal Tariff broke down ,the iron constitution of our old friend the right honourable member for Adelaide, who, most unhappily, is unable to be with us. A task which would have broken clown the constitution of any other man has just been completed by the honourable member for Hume with the most resolute and dogged determination, at a personal sacrifice rarely paralleled in Parliament. Under the"" special circumstances of the case, honourable members will recognise that I may say that even of a colleague, because the praise is most richly deserved.",93
513,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Eden Monaro-Minister of Trade and Customs) [9-S7]-- A question was asked by the honourable member for Dalley in connection with a statement read in this Chamber a day or two ago, about which I promised to make inquiries. Having done so, I am in a position to clear the matter up. I received a request from Mr Beale for a copy of the circulars which had been sent to me concerning pianos, and I instructed a clerk to forward any that I might have. Amongst these circulars was that read by the honourable member for Maranoa or the honourable member for Coolgardie. type-written, and marked on it in pencil was "" From Allan and' Co., 13th September, 1907.""",93
514,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,It was not the sent.,94
515,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"No . had requests from scores of industries, asking for circulars, and these were sent, excepting, of course, any marked private and confidential. But of this particular circular I knew nothing until it was read in the House.",94
516,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,It was by the honourable member's authority that it was sent.,94
517,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Yes . The clerk who sent it could not be held responsible. But the Collector of Customs could not have discovered that it had been sent, because it was one of many, and merely marked with my compliments. But amongst my private letters, I have turned up one from Mr Beale, dated 29th October, acknowledging the circular, and asking if I saw any reason why he should not reply to it , pointing out to members statements which were contradictory of each other. In answer to that letter, I wrote on the 30th OctoberDear Mr Beale, Yours of the 29th October to hand, and contents noted. .AV the particulars forwarded to you, they came in the way of a circular, and 1 presume have been placed in the hands of other members. Therefore, I think you are quite within your rights in answering same without any further reference to the author of it. Or why not put your case in similar form, and send it to members? I will be glad to have any representations from you, covering the facts as regards this industry. That I . had written that letter had quite slipped my memory, and when it was stated that' the Treasurer had supplied private information, I was naturally indignant, and demanded that the document be placed on the table, so that it might be traced. I had forgotten that I had supplied Mr Beale with this circular until, meeting him last evening, he said, "" You sent the information to me."" - Mr FISHER - Does the honourable member usually supply copies of his letterfile?",94
518,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Nothin g of that kind was done. Many persons terested in industries have asked culars, and such as do not appear in the slightest degree confidential have been fur nished to them. It was Mr Mahon - Did the honourable member furnish any other circular to Mr. Beale?",94
519,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I inonly one structed the clerk to send along copies of any circulars I might have; but, so far as I know, I did not see the circular before it I was sent.",94
520,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Does not . the honourable member think that it was a peculiar thing for Mr Beale to ask for it?,94
521,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,No . I find that it is a verbal request. Every time. I go to Sydney I am asked for information of this sort by all sorts of persons interested in manufactures.,94
522,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,That makes it a great deal worse.,94
523,Mr WILSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,The Minister admits that it was not a circular.,94
524,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"No . There is no heading to it , and it is type-written like an ordinary circular. It is not signed by Allan, though it is marked as issued by Allan and Co., Melbourne.",94
525,Mr WILSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"It contained . private notes by Mr Allan, taken for the purpose . of giving information to the Treasurer.",94
526,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"That is Mr Allan's statement. The Treasurer says that Mr Allan handed him this document. Somehow it came on my table as a circular, and I instructed my clerk to forward a copy of it to Mr Beale.",94

528,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,No .,94

530,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The clerk sent a copy marked with my compliments; the original has never been out of my office. Evidently the clerk looked upon it as a circular. I wanted to clear the Treasurer of any accusation, and to clear Mr Beale, who, when he saw this circular, evidentlythought that it would be the right thing to ask me whether he could refer to it. In replying I pointed out that the information was in the form of a circular, and that I presumed other members had been supplied with it, and I suggested that he should put his reply before members.",94

534,Mr WILSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Did not the Minister that he should be criminallv iprosecuted,95
535,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,I said some that if it was stated that the Treasurer divulged private information he should prosecuted. That is why I asked that the document be laid on the table. Should I have done that had I thought that there saidwas anything to hide?,95
536,Mr WILSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,The Minister should apologize to Mr Allan.,95
537,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,I do not think so.,95
538,Mr WILSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,The Minister he should be criminally prosecuted.,95
539,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,That was in answer to an of interjection of mine that if what was said was true the Treasurer should prosecute Mr Allan.,95
540,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I said that the Treasurer would disprove it, that he could disprove it in a court law. I think that mv statement acquits Allan.",95
541,Mr MAHON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Mr Allan does not want any acquittal at the Minister's hands. The Minister owes him an apologv.,95
542,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I do not - I know why. I did not receive anything from Mr Allan. The document which reservedly came into my hands was not marked priit vate, and had reference to something fore Parliament. It has been place the facts of the case before honourable members so that they may form their own opinionsWhat I was most anxious about was that no charge should be laid at the see it. door of the Department. What was done was done in accordance with my instrucI tions; but I had forgotten about the matI ter, because any number of these have been sent to me.",95

Official files are, of say course, dealt with with discretion. But ? what I wish to do is to clear those to whom blame appeared to be attached, and to take the blame myself. Whatever the be blame may be for what has occurred, it is on my shoulders. I - have already quoted the letter of the 29th October, in which I Re the particulars forwarded to you, they came in the way of a circular, because I had never seen the document, and gave instructions that copies of the said that circular should be sentand I presume have been placed in the hands other members, and therefore 1 think you are quite within your rights in answering same without any reference to the author of it. Or why not put your case in similar form, and send it to members? Honourable members must know that all and kinds of representations are made to me. of Only today representations were made to Mr me concerning the size of wheat bags, and in the ordinary course I would refer them to business persons in the city and have the statements made carefully inquired into by officers of the Department. However, have stated the facts, and if any blame attaches to any one in the matter, I untake it upon myself, and I leave to any unprejudiced men with a knowbeledge of the facts to say whether I demy duty to serve blame or not.",95

Beale I hope the Government will make some change in this regard. I believe there are amongst the casual hands six compositors, I four readers, and four warehousemen, and the House has been sitting they have the had to work the same hours as the permanent hands. I should like to word with respect to the Prime Minister's reference to the terrible task which the Treasurer was called upon to perform. The honourable gentleman sat at the table for twenty-two hours at one stretch, ancl day after day, for over seventy days, in carrybusiness ing the 'Tariff through.

551,Mr WILSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Not at all ; I do think that there has * been any generosity statement he did in his circular. exhibited by the honourable gentleman.

The Miniscarried ter has gone into the matter now, but at time to which I refer he said directly, in answer to a question, that Mr George Allan .should have been prosecuted crimior nally for having issued the circular in which clay or night. he said that some private information which he had given to the Department or to say a Treasurer had leaked out, and had been used for the purpose of supplying information to a trade rival. That sort of thing is to be deprecated, ancl if the practice were to be continued it would mean that men engaged in business, and particularly in the of importation, would withhold information which ought to be given to the Department. I think that the Minister of Trade and Customs should by letter or in some other way make reparation in the form of .an apology to Mr Allan, because ""as he was the cause of the bitterness of feeling it is from him reparation should come.",96
