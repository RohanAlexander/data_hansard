1,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"--Has the Minister of Defence yet received a reply to the inquiry which I understand he made regarding the arbitrary closing of the rifle - range at Buffalo Hill, Gladesville?",14
2,Mr EWING,Unknown,"When the honourable member brought the matter under my notice, I communicated with the State Commandant, who informed me that the range had been closed because there was danger in firing on it. The papers have not yet come to hand, but may arrive today.",14
3,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"There has not been a house built or a road made in the neighbourhood for ten years, and yet this man closed the range without even telling. the companv of his intention to do so.",14
4,Mr EWING,Unknown,"The Commandant informed me that there was an element of danger involved. In those circumstances, the only course open for me was to send for the papers, and, as soon as they reach me, I shall inform the honourable member. DEFENCE POLICY.",14
5,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"for Mr BOWDEN) asked the Minister of Defence, ufon notice I. Whether the opinion of the officers and rank and file of the forces generally, including cadets, is sought on the Government's military policy or on the best method to execute it? 2. If so, how are the officers and rank better qualified to offer advice than the tor-General or .responsible bodies like the M i l i tary Board and the Council of Defence?",14
6,Mr EWING,Unknown,"If the honourable memexhibitors; ber seriously asks for a reply to this tion, I shall give it.",14
7,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,It is time this was stopped.,14
8,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I wish to kno.w, Speaker, whether the Minister is in order in regarding as frivolous a question asked by an honourable member"" in the pursuit of his duty.. .Mr SPEAKER - It is entirely for the Minister to determine what answer shall be given to a question, and for the honourable member who asks it to take any to step he may please in respect of that answer.",14
9,Mr EWING,Unknown,I am sure that no sane member of the House would regard as otherwise than ridiculous the inference sought to be drawn in the second paragraph.,14
10,Mr REID,Unknown,The honourable member would riot say that of an honourable member sitting below the gangway.,14
11,Mr EWING,Unknown,I am not referring spe-daily to any one. - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - The honourable member will have to alter his tone in answering questions.,14
12,Mr EWING,Unknown,"The honourable member will find me quite able to look after myself. The invitation referred to in the question, was wide enough to embrace all sections of the community. There has been no differentiation with regard to the capability or capacity of any member of the forces. It is inferred in the question that we have thought more of the opinion of the cadets than of the Inspector-General, or the Military Board.",14
13,Mr REID,Unknown,The inference to be drawn from the question is that in this matter the Government have placed them on an equal footing.,14
14,Mr EWING,Unknown,"I do not think that the second paragraph of the question is worth discussing. We have not differentiated; we are prepared to hear from any honourable member, or any portion of the forces, or section of the' public, any statement with regard to this important matter.

19,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Hume-Trea surer) [10.30] - I move That leave be given to bring in a Bill for an Act relating to the payment to the several States of the surplus revenue of the Commonwealth.,15
20,Mr REID,Unknown,What is the object of the Bill?,15
21,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,The Bill relates to the distribution among the States of all surplus revenue. Without going into details I may say that its object is to vary the method of payment to the several States under section 94 of the Constitution.,15
22,Mr REID,Unknown,East Sydney) [10.31] - Section 94 of the Constitution provides for the distribution of surplus revenue after five years from the imposition of uniform duties of Customs. . Sir WILLIAM LYNE - At the present time the surplus revenue is returned to the States at the end of each month.,15
23,Mr REID,Unknown,"Sectio n 94 of the Constitution opens up a far more important question than the mere period within which surplus revenue is to be paid over, to the States. The intention was that after five years we should determine whether the distribution should be on aper capita or some other basis. touched by the Bill ?",15
24,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"The Bill is being slightly revised, and I should like the right honourable member to see it .",15
25,Mr REID,Unknown,"I do not seek at present for details,-but I think we are entitled to ask the Treasurer whether the Bill is intended to change the present method of distribution.",15
26,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I do not think that it is, so far as a per capita distribution is concerned. what is the Mr Reid - The distribution is not at present made on a per capita basis.",15
27,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I am aware of that, but a slight alteration is being made this morning in the draft Bill.",15
28,Mr REID,Unknown,Sligh t alterations are im- ' material.,15
29,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"So far as I cars say positively, it does not deal with the question of a per capita distribution. Queenton, Mr Reid - Surely the Minister knowsSt. Lawrence, whether or not he is going to deal with it in the Bill . I do not want to bother him about trivial matters, but a change in the present system of distributing the surplusmoneys of the revenue of the Commonwealth is one of the most important propositions that any Government could make under the Federal Constitution. All that I ask is whether there is any proposal in the Bill to change the present method of distribution'.",15
30,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Regardin g a per capita distribution? It is not in my mind to do that. .,15
31,Mr REID,Unknown,Does the honourable member contemplate doing anything at all ire that direction?,15
32,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I intend to make a. proposal to vary the system of distribution, but not in regard to a per capita basis. . Mr Reid - To vary the present system in regard only to the period of distribution ?",15
33,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,No ; the Bil l provides for something more than that.,15
34,Mr REID,Unknown,Then it is most important?,15
35,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,It is.,15
36,Mr REID,Unknown,I hope that the Minister will in reply give us an outline of the main provisions of the Bill .,15
37,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Hume-Trea surer) [10.40] - On e of the main provisionsof the Bil l will give this House power toÂ» reserve for certain works, for which appn> priations may be made during the year; Is that matter some of the surplus moneys of the Commonwealth. At present, at the end of each month,. all surplus revenue is returned to the States; we cannot keep a penny after the end of each month. One of the main principles-if not the main principle-of the Bil l is to enable the House to control better than we can now do any money that""we require for our own use.",15
38,Mr REID,Unknown,It will not affect the basis ofdistributing what money is left?,15
39,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"No . Question so resolved in the affirmative. NA PRESERVATI ON BILL . Debate resumed from 12th March (vide page 8963), on motion by Mr GROOMThat this Bill be now read a second time.",15
40,Mr REID,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"East Sydney) [10.45] There are two very important proposals in this Bill to which I desire to invite the .attention of the House. I do not propose to revert to the multitude of vexed and - heated controversies which the discussion - of the principal Act provoked when it was - under consideration in this Chamber. merely desire to say that I have always"" .agreed with the main principle underlying .any legislation which would, in the early history of the Commonwealth, provide machinery for preventing the growth of any - combination of persons engaged in trade to injure the public interests. is a view which I think is common to all parties in this House. In the Act which we passed last year there are some provisions contained in the sections relating to dumping, about which I am not quite so clear, but I think that honourable members on all sides of the House are in> sympathy with the main principle underlying that portion of the Statute which - deals with trusts and combinations. It is infinitely better that in the early stages of the Commonwealth we should place some measure of the kind upon the statute-book than that we should wait until abuses have - become more obvious. Having said that, I now desire to draw the attention of the House to a matter of grave importance. I hope that I may engage the attention of honourable members for a few minutes whilst I address myself to a question of some consequence. I presume that there are occasions upon which we may subdue the mania for holding private conversations, and this I conceive to be one of them. I hold that one of the most serious questions relating to the way in which justice is to be administered is involved in this Bill . I desire to explain to the House what I mean by that statement, if honourable members will give me their attention. The principal Act, somehow or other, is now considered to be very seriously defective. At the time it was passed it was generally thought it would prove an efficient Act. Of course, everybody admits the difficulty of dealing with such matters as are involved in that mea-sure. No matter how wise any Government or parliamentary draftsman may be, it would be unreasonable to expect that an Act of that kind would not be in some degree imperfect. But it would haye been interesting to the House if the Attorney General, in moving the second reading of this Bill , had more clearly indicated what, in his view, was the necessity for certain of its provisions. Some of its provisions are absolutely necessary, and I am rather surprised that the legislation of Canada upon this subject years ago was not in the view of the Government when the principal Act was before Parliament. Of course, there I is a great difference between the powers of the Federal Government in Canada ancl our powers, because the Canadian Government is vested with general powers under its Constitution. It has all the powers which the States have not expressly reserved to' them, whereas our position is That exactly the opposite. This Parliament possesses only the powers which the States bave conferred upon it. Consequently, the sphere for the exercise of legislative power in Canada is much larger than it is here. In section 18 of chapter 6 of an Act which was passed by the Canadian Parliament in 1897, the Legislature sought to put down the evils of combinations in a certain direction-that of unfairly enhancing the price of goods to the consurner. I admit that the most obvious power which should have been conferred' by the Act which we passed last year, was one to compel the production of books. In section 18 of the Canadian Act, that power is conferred. Under that Act the charge laid against any combination is at once referred to a Judge. It is rather surprising, therefore, that in view of Canadian legislation, our. principal Act did not compel the production of books.",16
41,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,We experienced some difficulty in inducing the House to pass the principal Act in its present form.,16
42,Mr REID,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"But a proposal to compel the production of books was never made. I have not recently referred to the original provisions of the Bill , but my recollection is that it contained no power to compel the production of books.",16
43,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,My recollection is that it was most difficult to get the measure passed even in its modified form.,16
44,Mr REID,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"But I hope the honourable member will see that that fact has nothing to do with what I am saying. I merely say that the power to which I have referred was not contained in the Bill as originally, introduced.",16
45,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I admit that.,17
46,Mr REID,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Since we were never asked by the Government to grant that power, we must not be reproached because we did not grant it. So far as the power to compel the production of books is concerned, I do not oppose it . No legislation can be effective unless it contains such a power. If this legislation is to - be effective, we must grant powers to the Government, many of which are rather out of the beaten track. Although I am as slow as are most people to unduly enlarge any power affecting the liberty of the subject, there are occasions when to some extent we must depart fron'i the beaten track. But in Canada, the effect of the inquiry which was instituted upon the production of books by any combination, was not to punish anybody. Where a combination is found to exist-whethe r it is an internal or an external combination is quite immaterial, because the provision applies to both-whos e operations tend to enhance the price of goods to the public, the Governor in Council has power to reduce the duties upon, the articles in question. This afforded the consumer some protection against the rings which were operated under cover of the Tariff. Honourable members will readily recognise that in any country a ring can work more easily behind a fence than it can if there be no fence at all. It is a. convenience to a ring inside a country to have a fence to shut out competition.",17
47,Mr BATCHELOR,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,But such . a provision would also hit a. man who was not a member of the combination.,17
48,Mr REID,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"In Canada, the advantage of this particular provision was that it did not hit the public. Perhaps it .did not provide a very effectual cure for the evil, but that was the method of bringing it about.",17
49,Mr FAIRBAIRN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The information disclosed by the books would be regarded as confidential ?,17
50,Mr REID,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"That is provided for in the Bill under consideration. I merely say that the necessity for the power to compel the production of books is inherent in legislation of this kind, and it is a pity that the fact was not recognised when the principal Act was under review. That statement means that I do not oppose the inclusion of this power in this Bill . Seeing that it is not contained in the principal Act, we ought certainly to allow of its insertion in this measure. I am sorry that the Attorney-General is not present because I wanted to ask a question which, with the exception of the Prime Minister, he alone can answer. It is a question of law. In this Bill a provision is incorporated from the Customs Act of 1901 ancl the Excise Act of the same year, and this is a very important matter, to which I desire to direct, attention. It is spe-ciallv important, in the light of a. decision which has been given by the Full Court of New South Wales. Section 255 of the Customs Act readsIn every Customs prosecution the averment of the prosecutor or plaintiff contained in the information, declaration, or claim shall be deemed to be proved in the absence of proof to the contrary, but so that(a) When an intent to defraud the revenue is charged, the averment shall not be deemed sufficient to prove the intent, and (*) In all proceedings for an indictable offence, or for an offence directly punishable by imprisonment, the guilt of the defendant must be established by evidence. I am labouring under a great inconvenience owing to the absence of the Attorney General, because I desire to ask him a very important question of law. Sir William LYNE - He is engaged in the High Court.",17
51,Mr REID,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I had forgotten that. That is quite a. sufficient reason for his absence. Sir John FORREST - The Minister of Trade and Customs will answer the right honourable member's question.,17
52,Mr REID,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I am afraid that he is scarcely competent to give me the desired information.,17
53,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,But even lawyers differ.,17
54,Mr REID,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Yes . The only time when one can be quite sure that a lawyer is right is when he is the final court of appeal. Section 255 of the Customs Act of 1901 ancl section 144 of the Excise Act of that year are identical with the provision contained in clause 4 of this Bill . That clause incorporates the sections in question in exactly the' same words. Sir John FORREST - Not in the same words as the right honourable member read just now.,17
55,Mr REID,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Then I must have read the section erroneously. Clause 4 of this Bill has been copied word for word from the sections to which I have alluded, as honourable-members will see by reference toils marginal note. Now I take it that whatever, powers we may grant in this Bill , we do not desire the Courts to fight over their meaningHonorable members will probably consider that the wordsThe averment of the prosecutor or plaintiff contained in the information, declaration, or claim shall be deemed to be proved in the absence of proof to the contrary mean that if a person accused is unable to produce evidence which disproves the accusation against him, he shall be deemed to be guilty. This is the way in which a layman would read them. Of course, everything depends upon the meaning that is attached to those words. I cannot illustrate my point better than by inviting the attention of honourable members to a decision of the Full Court of New South Wales upon the meaning of these, very words in the case of ex parte Healy, reported in the New South Wales Law Reports of 1903. Under the Excise Act an information was laid charging a. person with keeping an illicit stiTT; and the magistrate had to construe the provision, which, speaking roughly, is that the words of the information shall be deemed to prove the offence in the absence of evidence disproving it. Evidence was given on behalf of the Commonwealth in support of the charge, and the person charged gave evidence in reply. The magistrate, having heard both sides, was in doubt whether the man was really guilty; but he held that the words of the .statute compelled him to find the man guilty. The words areIn every . . . . prosecution for an offence the avermentsThat is the allegation. . . . contained in the information . . . . shall be deemed to be proved in the absence of proof to the contrary. That is, on the words alleging that the man kept an illicit still, he must be deemed to have kept it unless he could produce proof to the contrary.",17
56,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I think the magistrate was very fine in his feelings. He said he was doubtful, but that in view of the positive language of the section, he must convict the defendant.",18
57,Mr REID,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Does the honourable member propose in this, or any other Bill that we ever pass, to provide that a man should be found guilty and punished, when the person who is trying him has a doubt as to his guilt? I am sure that is not the intention of the honourable member.",18
58,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,If the magistrate was in doubt he should have given a verdict in favour of the accused.,18
59,Mr REID,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"That is exactly the point I desire to make. Laymen, I think, will be glad to know that, in spite of the view of the magistrate, the Full Court took exactly the view of the honourable member for Wide Bay, and others. The Court held that it would be monstrous and contrary to the principle of. the administration of justice, at any rate, in British communities, that a magistrate should convict a man if it was not proved to his satisfaction that the man was guilty. But the Full Court had some difficulty in arriving at its conclusion, because these are words which another Court might construe in a different way. I desire those words to be so placed in the Bill that the intention of Parliament shall be perfectly plain-that is my only object in addressing honourable members-that the real object of such a provision is to make the information primd facie evidence. Those who have any experience of legal matters know that sometimes charges collapse on some technical points, without any evidence being given. Very often, when a charge is made, the lawyer appearing for the person charged, asks the magistrate whether there is really anything to answer; and the case is disposed of without the merits being gone into. The real object, I submit, of the words is that the statements in the information should put the inatter before a magistrate, so that evidence must be gone into before the case can be disposed of, and that.when the evidence is gone into, the charge must be disposed of on its merits. I may not be here when this Bill is considered in Committee, and, therefore, I am taking advantage of the present opportunity to lay these views before the House.  keeping an illicit still, do those words mean that he would be held to be guilty unless he could bring evidence to disprove the charge ?",18
60,Mr REID,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Absolutely .  sion is repealed, the better.",18
61,Mr REID,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The honourable member is absolutely right. The information is read out in Court, and the allegation that the man has kept an illicit still is deemed to be proof-no t evidence, but proof-that he has committed the offence, in the ab-' sence of the accused producing evidence to disprove the charge.",18
62,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Coul d a prosecution succeed without offering any evidence?,18
63,Mr REID,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Absolutely .,19
64,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I should like to know a case.,19
65,Mr REID,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Fortunately , there is not such a case; but I think I have cited a worse one. I suppose honourable members will agree that when these words were put into a statute they were intended to bear the ordinary natural meaning. Let me read the words' of the proposed new section againIn any prosecution for an offence . the averments of the prosecutor Those are the statements made in the information. In some cases the statements may be verbal, but, if it is an information, they must be in writingthe averments of the prosecutor contained in the information or claim shall be deemed to be proved in the absence of proof to the contrary.",19
66,Mr HUTCHISON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,That is nothing new; it is an accepted principle in English law today.,19
67,Mr REID,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The honourable member for Hindmarsh may not have been here when these particular provisions were passed.  share of the responsibility.,19
68,Mr REID,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The honourable member for Maranoa has intimated that if he had known the meaning of the words to be what I have explained he never would have voted for the section. Honourable members who are not of the legal profession may be forgiven ; indeed, even lawyers sometimes find it difficult to decide upon the meaning of the words in Acts. I am only inviting the House on this occasion to think seriously over what we are ,doing - It is, of course, for the House to decide; but let us clearly understand the position.",19
69,Mr CARR,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Are the qualifications in the clause not a safeguard?,19
70,Mr REID,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Exactly the same words are used.,19
71,Mr CARR,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Then what is the amending Act for?,19
72,Mr REID,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The qualifications do not qualify the words. it would be absurd to make an enactment, and then qualify it in the next clause.",19
73,Mr CARR,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Is that not done often?,19
74,Mr REID,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,It is foolish. - Mr SAMPSON - Is it not done in Constitution ?,19
75,Mr REID,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"It is done in the Constitution in order to safeguard against something which might be thought fo be done by preceding words. But the words I have read are intended to do a particular thing, and further words are not needed tc* show that that is not their meaning.",19
76,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Words aresometimes afterwards used to qualify provisions.,19
77,Mr REID,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"We are now getting intoa disquisition upon technicalities that is unnecessary. Tam taking the words in their plain English meaning, and asking the House to consider them.  in the' Bill.",19
78,Mr REID,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Ma v I suggest that thisprovision is not qualified by any other words ?,19
79,Mr CARR,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"There are the words ""but so that'' at the end of the clause.",19
80,Mr REID,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I quite agree, and I have read the whole clause. The question of intent is dealt with in this particular clause, though it was not in the Customs or Excise Acts. Admitting all that, just let us look at what is held to be proved. If honourable members will turn to section 4 of the Principal Act, they will find it as follows :Any person who, either as principal or as- agent, makes or enters into any contract, or isor continues lo be a member of or engages in any combination, in relation to trade or commerce with other countries or among the States{a) with intent to restrain trade or commerce to the detriment of the public; or, (Â£) with intent to destroy or injure, by means of unfair competition, any Australian industry, the preservation of which is advantageous to the Commonwealth, having due regard to the interests of producers, workers, and consumers. I am endeavouring to show now what is taken to be proved outside intent. First, it is taken to be proved that the person charged has entered into such a combination, and if he cannot disprove that he isconvicted as to that part. - Mr BATCHELOR - Quite right; how else could the object be attained?",19
81,Mr REID,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"It may be quite right; I am only anxious to show what the section really means. Then, according to subsection b it must be held, in the absence of. proof'to the contrary, that the person acthe cused has been guilty of unfair competition, that there is an Australian industry the preservation of which is advantageous to the Commonwealth, having due regard to the interests of producers, workers, and consumers-al l this has to be taken as proved on the mere statement of an official, in the form of an information. The oniis is thrown on the accused person of showing, simply because an official has put a lot of words on a piece of paper, not only that, as a matter of fact, he is not engaged in any such combination, but that there is not an Australian industry affected in regard to which, having in view the interests of producers, consumers, and so forth, his conduct is objectionable. All these matters, I think, should be proved just in the same way as intent is proved. The intent and the act itself are so mixed up that it is - very difficult to separate them, and I am very glad the honourable member for Macquarie interjected as he did, because it is very important that the point he raised should be considered. In the sections the Customs and Excise Acts there is not even the protection afforded as to intent; because, in the case of an illicit still, the keeping of it includes the intent. Of course, the mere possession of an illicit still is, in itself, evidence of intent. But everything else in the information is to be taken as proved by the mere statement of the Comptroller-General, and the onus of rebuttal is put on the person accused. Even if that provision is adopted, it should be made clear that, when the accused has gone into evidence, and the Justice of the High Court who is to try the case is in doubt of his guilt, he is not to be convicted.",19
82,Mr WATSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,That should go without saying.,20
83,Mr REID,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"In New South Wales, in the case to which I have referred, the Full Court looked upon the contrary as such a monstrous provision that they construed the words, ""shall be deemed to be proved"" to mean ""shall be evidence."" It was a pretty good stretch of construction, and I do not know that any other Court would take the same view. The mere fact that a thing is stated might well be regarded as "" evidence,"" but it should not be held to be "" proof.""",20
84,Mr WATSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The instance cited is another case in which the Judges have apparently acted as legislators.,20
85,Mr REID,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"If the words "" shall be deemed to be proved "" are to be taken to mean that the accused, to escape conviction, must satisfy the Judge of his innocence, the sooner we know that that is the intention the better, so that we may make a straight-out issue of it. If that is what honourable members mean, let them say so like men, and stand by it. Do not let us use the words, and make the excuse afterwards that we never intended them to be applied in the way that they must be applied.",20
86,Mr FAIRBAIRN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Ha d any other construction been placed on the words in the case referred to, an innocent man would now be in gaol.",20
87,Mr REID,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"He might have been able to pay the .Â£100 fine. Suppose there were a law restraining the members of trade unions from in any way interfering with non-unionists, what would be said of a provision for amending it so that the mere charging of a unionist with interference should cause him to be deemed guilty of it, and make it necessary for a magistrate to send himto gaol, should there be any of doubt, after the taking of evidence, as to his guilt ?",20
88,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"No one contends that such a provision should be adopted. The right honourable member does not assert that, if the Justice is doubtful, he must convict ?",20
89,Mr REID,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The honourable member for South Sydney asked why should the Full Court go away from the plain meaning of the words.,20
90,Mr WATSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Quite so. It should not have done so.,20
91,Mr HUTCHISON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,A magistrate who convicted under such circumstances should be removed from the bench.,20
92,Mr REID,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"There are certain landmarks of natural justice which no man wishes to destroy. The injustice to the monopolist of today may become injustice .to the general members of the community tomorrow. In a democracy like this, we do not wish to establish false rules of justice affecting any man's liberty. We may say, "" We intend to put down trusts;"" but it is another thing to say, "" We will reverse the rules of justice by enacting that if the Court is doubtful as to the innocence of an accused, he must go to gaol."" ",20
93,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,No one contends that that should be enacted.,20
94,Mr REID,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Then the intention should be made clear. It would avoid technical objections to an information if the words "" shall be prima facie evidence "" were used. That expression is used in another part of. the Bill, or in the principal Act. If it were used, the information would put the case on its legs, so to speak, and the technical point could not be taken that no offence was shown. Afterwards, the charge would be fought out on its merits. The House does not want to go so far as to provide that, if a man does not clear himself, he must be convicted.",20
95,Mr CARR,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Is not the close alliance of intent and fact favourable to the offender in these cases ?,21
96,Mr REID,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Where an offence consists of five essentials, a man should not be convicted if the existence of any one of these is not proved to the satisfaction of the tribunal before which he is tried. No man should be convicted if the Judge is doubtf u l in regard to the existence of one essential factor. I criticise this provision, not to destroy it, but that it may be altered to make the intention of the House clear. The other matter to which I wish to refer is this : I think that power should be given to any judicial body dealing with these matters, to have the fullest access to documents, so"" that the whole of the transactions concerned may be exposed. But if honourable members will refer to sub-clauses 3 and 4 of clause 4, and to subsequent provisions, they will find that the Comptroller General can bring before him the man or body ot men thought to be violating the law, and compel the accused to answer questions, and to produce all books, letters, and other documents that may be demanded. I do not object to the production of such evidence on a trial. I do not know how effect could be given to the law unless the Court were empowered to order their production. But it is a new idea in British jurisprudence to give this power to the prosecution, to enable a case to be made out.",21
97,Mr WATSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"It is an American idea. Mr Reid , - It is essentially a French idea.",21
98,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Something is wanted.,21
99,Mr REID,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I do not think that the prosecutor in a criminal offence should be empowered to compel an accused to come before him, to produce books, and papers, and to be cross-examined and re-examined on oath, in order that a case might be made out for trial.",21
100,Mr WATSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"It is the latest developcompel ment in the United States, to give the authorities a chance of dealing with trusts. Without such, a power, they would not have a ghost of a show.",21
101,Mr REID,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"When a case is-being tried, the Court should have the fullest power to order the production of books, papers, and documents, but the prosecutor should not lae given that power. I would rather give the Comptroller-General-althoug h an official subject to Ministerial influence, but one of high responsibility, and one who, I am sure, will always be a man' of high character-the power to try these matters, than introduce this new idea into our legislation.",21
102,Mr MCDOUGALL,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,That would kill the lawyer's business altogether.,21
103,Mr REID,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Would not that be a good thing? I pity every client who comes my way. In my opinion, the sensible man is he who pays up rather than go to law. Public necessity may sometimes compel us to do things which are foreign to our ideas and principles; but is it not too soon to establish this French method-so foreign to our ideas of justice-befor e the necessity for its adoption is proved? If I were in America, so enormous are the abuses prevailing there, I should be inclined to stretch a number of points in order to facilitate the detection and exposure of what I believe to be gigantic robberies of the public. .",21
104,Mr WATSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"In proportion, there are some here just as bad.",21
105,Mr REID,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I hope not.,21
106,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The brick combine, in Melbourne, is pretty strong.",21
107,Mr WATSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,So is that in Sydney.,21
108,Mr REID,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I am doubtful if we could deal with the Victorian combine.,21
109,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"At any rate, we are sure of its existence.",21
110,Mr REID,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,That is not the question. Have we power to deal with a combine whose operations do not extend beyond any one State?,21
111,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,We could deal with the jam manufacturers.,21
112,Mr HUTCHISON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,And with the oil combine.,21
113,Mr REID,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The Constitution empowers us to make laws respecting trade with foreign countries, and between the States; but an abuse of this kind must extend beyond any one State before we can deal with it. Until the absolute necessity for introducing the French system of justice is proved, we ought not to adopt it . It is sufficient to give the Court power to the accused to appear, to produce all necessary papers, and to answer all questions. We should not strain the brOad principles of natural justice which have grown up with the nation, and which, even in the darkest days of our history, were the main security of the masses of the British people. We must not forget that, in the despotic times gone by, some of these old principles of justice were the great protection of the weak and the helpless, and we ought not to abandon them unless it is proved necessary to do so in the public interest. I suggest that this novel method of criminal justice should be reserved until it is proved to be necessary. Let the accused be compelled, under very heavy penalties, to tell the Court everything. In all countries there are special Acts which go very far ; but I do not think'that in any British country an accused is compelled to go before his prosecutor, and put everything before him before being tried. We have not got to that yet. I have never heard of a man being compelled to enter the Attorney General's office to be raked fore and a f t , in order that the Attorney-General may bring a charge against him and produce, at the hearing of the charge, the evidence so obtained.",21
114,Mr WATSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,We have never previously had combinations so intangible as some of those which now exist.,22
115,Mr REID,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I am yielding to that necessity. As a rule, we ought not to compel a man to incriminate himself before a Judge. It is an extraordinary thing to compel a man to prove his own guilt by means of his own confession before a Judge; but it may be absolutely necessary to do so. Do not honourable members think that it is quite good enough for a start, in this instance, to provide for such a procedure? Are we to say that a man shall be taken to the Crown Prosecutor's office, and there compelled to produce the whole of his books, and to submit to be cross examined on oath in order that everything he says may be used against him. Sir John FORREST - It cannot be used.",22
116,Mr REID,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,It can be used for an offence against this Act. That is the very purpose for which it is to be used.,22
117,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Not for any civil or criminal proceeding.,22
118,Mr REID,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"That is another matter. I ask the House to consider whether it is not, for a start, a great stretch to compel a man to incriminate himself before a Judge, and that it is going too far to compel him in addition to enter the Crown Prosecutor's room before he is tried in order to supply the material on which he shall be tried. There are a number of other points in the Bill which, I think, will give rise to a great deal of trouble, but I am thoroughly in favour of its main object. I hope honourable members, in carrying out what may be great reforms, will be slow, in the absence of some absolutely proved necessity, to push too far changes in respect of the rules of natural justice between the accused and the .Court. If it came about by-and-by that this law would absolutely break down if power were not given to put a man into the Crown Prosecutor'sroom before the case against him began, the House could reconsider the matter, and,, if it thought fit, go to the full exrre.ne. But I hope that the Labour Party will never associate itself with a proposal to sav toa man, "" You are to go to the prosecutor before you are tried, and disclose your offence, so that we may use against voir every word that you utter."" I hope that, the Labour Party will not associate its name with that system of administering justice until it has been proved absolutely necessary. We ought to remember that rules of justice, which may sometimes facilitate the escape of an offender, may ""inmany other cases protect an innocent man' from"" an undeserved wrong and injustice. 'We must not be too strongly influenced by our desire to carry out a certain policy; let us try to carry out our views on questions of policy without disregarding any natural rights of justice. Let us remember that a method of oppression and injustice, under the force of law, is sometimes a more odious form of oppression and injustice than is the act of any crowned tyrant. Necessity sometimes compels a community in self-defence to do extreme things, but. I object to a proposal that, before he is tried, a man shall be put into the hands of his accuser, in order that the. accuser may put him on the rack and afterwards make use of the confessions, made under torture, as evidence of his guilt.",22
119,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Wide Bay) [11.35] - We are indebted to the right honourable member for elucidating some of the points of this Bill , which deals with a very important subject, and appreciate his anxiety that no innocent person may suffer an injustice under any legislation we pass. I am exceedingly pleased that he has taken on this occasion a much wider view of the question of restriction than he did when the principal Bill was before us. He has certainly adopted a much wider view as to the necessity of our taking action to prevent combines securing in Australia such a position as they occupy in some other countries. Honourable members of the Labour Party, I am sure, are pleased that that is so.",22
120,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,-It happens not to be so.,22
121,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I shall accept the assurance of the honourable member for Parramatta that the desire of the Opposition to prevent combines was as thorough when the original Bill was before us as it is day. They certainly adopted a very strange method of indicating such a desire on part. We were then told that the proposals of the Government were an interference with trade, and an attempt to embarrass people who were carrying on the great dustries of Australia.",22
122,Mr REID,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The basis of this measure that the people at which it aims are'interthey fering with trade. That is the justification for it.,23
123,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"When the original Bill was before us, it was thought by some honourable members of the Opposition it would be a very proper thing for House to resist any legislation that would ' interfere with combines, which were scribed as a large aggregation of traders. It was said that competition, without any interference on the part of the State, keep them in check, and that one competitor would prevent another from doing wrong.",23
124,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"We have always been against detrimental combines. Mr FISHER,-The question is, what is a detrimental combine? Then, again, what is a beneficent combine?",23
125,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The Labour Party.,23
126,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Undoubtedly it honourable member's interjection reminds me of the illustration given by the right able member for East Sydney.,23
127,Mr REID,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I do not object to combines as long as they act fairly by their neighunion bours in trade, supply at a fair price, do not sweat their employees. If I objected to a combine, I should object to every trade union in Australia.",23
128,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Exactly . We put our position more briefly, saying that our tion is to secure economic justice.",23
129,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"That , too, is position.",23
130,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The reference made by to the honourable member for Wentworth to members of my own party reminds me an illustration given by the leader of the Opposition, and which I adopt. He asked what we should think if a union were charged with being a combine, and were compelled to produce all its books, letters, and other documentary evidence in support of that charge.",23
131,Mr REID,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,To the prosecutor.,23
132,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"As one connected with unions and labour bodies, I have no hesienough. tation in saying that if a trade union were charged with being a combine it ought to toproduce its books to show that it was not.",23
133,Mr REID,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,To a Judge. But how their would the honourable member like a union to be compelled to produce them to the Employers' Federation?,23
134,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Knowin g that unions inare honest combinations designed to secure justice for their members, and not seeking is to do an injustice to any one, I am sure would be ready and willing to have their books examined by any party.",23
135,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,B y non-unionists?,23
136,Mr WATSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,B y Government officials.,23
137,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I would allow them.to that be produced to any one. The only conthe dition I should lay down in respect of unions and all other bodies, is that the deother side in such circumstances should also be compelled to produce their books.",23
138,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Eve n this Act deals only would with combinations in restraint of trade.,23
139,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The great charge made against unions by economists and others opposed to them, is that they are more or less in restraint of trade. It is said that unionists have false notions because they desire to produce more wealth by restricting production.",23
140,Mr FAIRBAIRN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Would a labour union is. The be illegal under this Bill ?,23
141,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,It would not be illegal honorany more than the Employers' Federation would be.,23
142,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"But an employers' is not illegal under this Bill. Until and. comparatively recent times, neither employers' unions nor jabour unions were legal in the great Mother Country of which we speak so often. It is as but yesterday in the history of our country, since it was ambiacknowledged that even a combination of workmen, designed to secure fair conditions our of labour, was lawful. We have now gone to the opposite extreme. In this young country, the party with which I am proud be associated, very early in the history of the the Commonwealth sought to place on the of statute-book a law which would prevent the creation of combines such as have arisen in the United States of America, where a glorious freedom of trade had been allowed to run 'riot. We did good work in supporting such legislation. No one is more pleased than I am to learn that the step we then took is now admitted to have been a proper one, and that nearly every honourable member today asserts that it did not go far",23
143,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Did not the honourable member'sparty take the view that that legislation.would be ineffective?,24
144,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,My view is that even this drastic amending Bill will be ineffective.,24
145,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Then the honourable member proposes to assist in passing legisin lation in which he does not believe?,24
146,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"We say that it is into sufficient, but that, representing as we a large body of the electors of the Comthe monwealth, we are bound to do the best we can to take the steps which we think are convict. urgently necessary in the meantime, and also as practical men to obtain legislation that we can obtain instead of seeking secure legislation that would have no intent to defraud. chance of being passed by this Parliament. If honourable members find that under this Bill the operations of trusts and combines cannot be controlled they will have agree to a further amendment of the law. It. is a truism in all British communitiesdant that no law can exist which is proved by a majority of the electors.",24
147,Mr REID,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,But if a law affected the liberty of only a small number of persons would be very much more difficult to secure its amendment than it would be if it inout juriously affected the liberty of a large number.,24
148,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The right honourable member has made a .serious charge against the electors of the Commonwealth. If he and his followers really believed that any law that we had enacted inflicted injustice upon a single person in the community they would be in duty bound to appeal to the great mass of the people to .remedy that injustice. Does he suggest that we ought to stand aside and see injury done to one individual in order to please the great majority of the people? I do not think that we have come to that. In my opinion the people would very soon correct his guilt. any injustice which was being done even to the poorest member of the community. But we ought to recollect that the persons who will be attacked under this Bil l will be well able to defend themselves. They will be in a position to employ the highest legal talent in the country to put their case in the best possible light. They are not like old-age pensioners who have no means of employing legal talent tp put their case before the public.,24
149,Mr REID,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The honourable member has the power to force the Government to do something for them. Why does he use it?,24
150,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I shall deal with that matter upon another occasion. I come now to another phase of the question dealt with by the right honourable member. I understood him to say that in the Healy case, the defendant, who was charged with conducting an illicit still, proffered evidence rebuttal, and that the magistrate, after hearing his defence, expressed a doubt as his guilt, but held that under the worddo ing of the Act, which was identical with wording of clause 4 of the Bill under consideration, he had no alternative but to",24
151,Mr REID,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Because the man did not clear himself of the "" intent "" to defraud, to the magistrate held that he was guilty of",24
152,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Yes . In my opinion that magistrate was distinctly wrong. The to case was practically a criminal one.,24
153,Mr REID,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Practicall y ! If the defencould not have paid the fine he would not aphave had to go to prison.,24
154,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"If the Judge had any doubt as to the defendant's guilt he was it in duty bound, by the law of evidence, to give him the benefit of that doubt. Withclaiming to possess the right honourable member's legal ability, I - venture to sav that the Supreme Court of New South Wales took that view. I do not agree with the desire of the leader of the Opposition to eliminate from clause 4 the words to which he directed attention, and to substitute for them a provision that a charge preferred against any combination shall be prima facie evidence of guilt. I have had some experience of primd facie evidence in ""connection with our Employers' Liability Acts.",24
155,Mr REID,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,But the honourable member thinks a charge preferred against a defendant should be primd facie evidence of,24
156,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"As a layman, I hold that the words to which the leader of the Opposition has directed attention do not necessarily mean that a person will be convicted of an offence under this Bill if he can produce reasonable evidence in rebuttal.",24
157,Mr REID,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"If that point is not quite clear in the BiH, the honourable member has. no objection to making it clear",24
158,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"No .  not mation against the honourable member for conducting an illicit still in his house, does Tie think it fair that he should be convicted '.because he could not prove his innocence? Mr .FISHER - Yes . In regard to a charge of conducting an illicit still, I should be in a very happy position, because I have a fairly large household, so that I should be able to obtain ample evidence in rebuttal. In regard to illicit distilling operations and illicit coining, there must be a departure from the ordinary rules associated with British justice.",24
159,Mr WILKS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The onus of proof of their innocence is thrown upon licensed victuallers.,25
160,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"An enactment of - this kind must be founded on the assumption that the welfare of individuals must suffer slightly if the welfare of the .community is to be promoted. If absolute proof of the distillation of spirits were required before an accused person could be convicted, the presence of illicit stills in the mountainous portions of the Commonwealth would deprive the Government of the reasonable amount of revenue at present collected.",25
161,Mr ARCHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Do not the honourable, member's remarks apply equally to every last step in social progress. other kind of offence? Under this Bill , a march on. man has to prove that he is innocent of the done. charge laid against him.",25
162,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I have already stated phases of the evil. that there are instances in which the welfare would suffer if the ordinary rules of British justice were followed. there be any greater evidence of the necesism, but justice. sity for stringent legislation in respect of trusts and combines than is furnished by the statement which was made the other day by Senator T a f t , the President Elect of the Republican Party in the United States, who affirmed that unless the Goclause, vernment of the United State obtained power to deal with trade combines and books and other information: financial ruffians, it would have to declare for socialistic legislation. This is the solutely necessary. most significant statement that has been made in any country in the world in consent, nexion with this question. It shows magnitude of the evil in the United States,",25
163,Mr ARCHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,We admit that.,25
164,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The provisions of the Sherman Act relating to interference with trade, and commerce by combines are much stronger than are the provisions of this Bill. Honourable members are about passing a much milder Act. notwithstanding that the greatest authority in America, has declared that all the of the Government of that country are-insufficient to control the operations of trusts and combines.",25
165,Mr ARCHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,But we are dealing with a different proposition.,25
166,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Undoubtedly . But we are only dealing with a different proposition, because in the early days we prevented these combinations from achieving the magnitude which they have achieved there. In the United States these combines not only act in restraint of trade, but I am afraid that they corrupt both Parliament and the Judiciary. That is the problem which we have to face ",25
167,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,But the honourable member has said that all these powers will fai l to effect our purpose.,25
168,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I have not said anything of the kind. I say that all the powers conferred by this legislation will be insufficient to cope with the evil, because new problems will arise. As a representative of the Labour Party, I am not going to say that with the enactment of the legislation proposed, we shall have taken the We must There is a good deal to be It is for that reason that I say that the provisions - of this Bill will prove insufficient to effectually cope with all I am in favour of public conserving the rights of the people Can Mr. JOSEPH COOK - That is not Social-'",25

It is thought that some danger may arise from the positive language used in the owing to charges being held to be proved in the event of a refusal to produce In my opinion, however, such a provision is abThe object of this legislation has been defeated up to the preand may be defeated again by means the which we are unable now to foresee, unless the provisions be made most stringent. The time has passed when it is necessary to fight for the principle of this legislation; all we bave to do now is to consider details, and make the provisions as effective as possible, without injustice to any, whether cavilling capitalists or others.",25
170,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,There has never been conflict in this Chamber as to the prinpowers ciple of this legislation.,25
171,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I take it as a compliGovernment ment to the Labour Party that long before Parliament could be induced to give effect tc the principle we were able to educate public opinion, and thus have been the means, as we hope, of preventing here those terrible economic evils which have arisen in the United States and Canada.",26
172,Mr WILKS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Dalley) [12.1] - A considerable time ago I voted for - legislation of this character, and the necessity for an amending Bill has evidently been proved to the Government in consequence of their inability to carry the Act into effect. voted for the general principle of this lation as a protest against combines and trusts, which have inflicted .great injury, not only on the trading community, but on the humble members of the industrial ranks. Time after time, it has been admitted by the Government that there are suspicious cases; ancl the Administration has been twitted over and over again, by both supporters and opponents, on their not taking action. Of course, as I have indicated, the real reason for the Government's inaction was that the Act we passed some time ago had proved inoperative. The great difficulty presented is to obtain proof that a trust or combine is performing any act detrimental to the community; and I take it that this amending Bill is intended to provide a remedy. The leader of the Opposition has expressed fear of the consequences of any departure from the ordinary practices observed in the administration of British justice. We must remember, however, that much of the Commonwealth legislation involves innovations of the kind, and those innovations are warranted by present day conditions. While listening to the leader of the Opposition, I was reminded of the fact that joint-stock companies and trades unions were at one time quite new departures, and had to be met by legislation suitable to the altered conditions. . No one disputes the necessity for a Bill of the kind before us, or that it should be made as effective as possible. the fears in connection with throwing the onus of proof on the person charged, I have only to point to licensing Acts, which have recently been passed in some of the States, and under which a publican summoned for certain offences is called upon to prove his innocence.",26
173,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"But to make parallel complete there must be power to hale an accused person to the office of official, and there to interrogate him so as to make out a case.",26
174,Mr WILKS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The prosecutions under the Bill will not be undertaken by private individuals, but by the Comptroller-General, who is an officer of the Government; ancl provision is made that any information obtained from a person suspected shall not be used as evidence in any other civil or criminal proceedings which may be taken against him. As a layman, I think that is sufficient protection for the person charged, in view of the great evil that has to be comI bated! If I were, as a private citizen, to legisinform the Minister of Trade and Customs that MACRobertson and Company were really a sugar and confectionery combine of . a detrimental character, basing my statement on the fact that certain retailers had informed me they were completely under the thumb of that firm, that would not be sufficient, under the old Act, to justify prosecution. Under the Bill , however, the Comptroller-General will have power to commence inquiries, though, of course, no action will be taken until there is reasonable ground for supposing an illegal act.  inquiry should be made before taking proceedings ?",26
175,Mr WILKS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The Bill provides for inquiry. The Comptroller-General, must, first of all, be satisfied that there is serious reason for believing an offence has been committed. ' He cannot obtain information except from somebody interested; and it is .not reasonable to believe that a person will voluntarily give information against his employer. If the Comptroller-General is satisfied that there is reasonable ground, he can take the next step of calling for books and documents, and putting questions to the parties with the proviso that the information so obtained shall not be used against them in any civil or criminal action. Of course, I can conceive of Parliament being as tyrannical as any despot; and there As to might be some danger if prosecutions could be initiated by private individual's - We must remember, however, that the Comptroller-General is responsible to his political head, who, in turn, is responsible - to Parliament; and there is always the protection of that sense of justice which prevails in every British community. If any innocent man were to the suffer by reason of the action of the officials, the matter could be remedied in a view of Ministerial responsibilities. The circumstances are such that unusual legislation must be adopted, and I regard this as only a portion of the legislation of a similar character which will be found necessary in the near future. As Australia grows older she adopts the practices and devices of older countries; and as our trade and commerce and industries expand, so we shall have . to fight the evils which have arisen in America and elsewhere. I have always been at issue with the Labour Party as to their methods of dealing with these questions. I have always been favourable to trusts and combines being regulated by legislation, but not by the application of the principles of absolute Socialism. This amending Bill should have been introduced immediately it was discovered that the original Act had proved, ineffective. The members of trusts and combines are no mere weaklings, but wealthy men, able to fight their own battles; and I have already compared their position under the Bill with that of publicans under various licensing Acts. A brewing or distilling combine can do much more than can any individual publican. I am not making a plea for the licensed victualler, because I know that the Licens-ing Acts of the States were a dead letter fore the present provisions were adopted. The police had a miserable time in trying to obtain evidence of offences against the law, because of the secrecy observed, and because both parties to illegal acts were interested in preventing convictions. So in the case of combines, not only will those directly interested in the profits of a combine, but also those who obtain advantages by dealing with it, be concerned in preventing convictions. It is because so many diffiwhich culties surround the prosecution of offences of this nature that I think we are compelled to adopt the procedure set out in the Bill.",26
176,Mr WATSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"South Sydney) [12.17]. - It seems to me that the honourable member for Dalley has adopted a logical position from the stand-point of those who believe in regulation; but his attitude emphasizes the inconsistency or want of logic of others on the opposition side of the House who, while declaring their belief in the need for the regulation of .trusts and combines, oppose every attempt to secure it. They, like the members of the Labour Party and the Government, say that they do not believe in trusts, and desire to take all proper steps to prevent them from injuring the people; but when proposals are made which would have the effect of regulating them, they make all sorts of excuses for voting against them. I am not sure that, even from their own stand-point, that attitude is wise. Mr Secretary Taft,. who, we are told, is likely to be the next President of the United States of America, has stated that if the Republican Partyfails to successfully regulate trusts, the government of that country will, in hisopinion, be handed over to the Socialists.",27
177,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Does the honourable member subscribe to all that Mr Taft says ?,27
178,Mr WATSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"No ; nor to all that the honourable' member says, although occasionally I hear pearls of wisdom from his lips. I referred to the matter merely to show that an opponent of Socialism recognises that those who wish to successfully keep it downmust sweep away the evils of which the Socialists complain. I do. not think that' legislation such as we are considering will be completely successful. It may be possible to destroy, or, at any rate, to cripple, trusts which are unwise enough to allow their agreements to become public; but in the United States of America many of the trade combinations most opposed to the bepublic interest-notably , the great Beef Trust-have , sinceadverse decisions were given by the Courts, continued their nefarious practices without a written agreement, under an arrangement termed euphemistically a ""gentlemen's agreement."" That shows that, even with the most rigorous laws that can be drafted, it will be extremly difficult to secure the proper regulation of combinations opposed to the public interest. We have other concerns put an unfair price on commodities, but are not trusts or combines. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company is neither a combine nor a trust, but it is a monopoly.",27
179,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,A corporation and a collective institution !,27
180,Mr WATSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"It has adopted all the features of Socialism which conduce to economy of production and distribution, but it keeps all the profits, instead of dividing them with the community.",27
181,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,There would be the same exhibition of human nature under the honourable member's scheme.,27
182,Mr WATSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I have a sincere beliet in the ability of civilization to find a remedy for these abuses, but I have not a cut-and dried scheme. A very important step forward will be made when the State takes over monopolies of all descriptions, and manages them in the interests of the public. as it already manages a number of concerns. In my opinion, the leader of the Opposition was, during the greater part of his speech, merely beating the air, and devoted a considerable part of his argument to the discovery of a mare's nest. His first contention was that it would be improper to provide that the. averments of the prosecutor shall be deemed to be proved in the absence of proof to the contrary. But he had to admit that, even from his stand-point, paragraphs a and b of clause 4 modify the position very considerably. He said that paragraph a removed his objection in regard to intent, although he declared that matters of fact could be deemed proved. I , as a layman, reluctantly place my views against his legal knowledge, but, having carefully looked through the principal Act, I am of opinion that every offence of importance provided for there rests upon the basis of intent. Section 4 readsAny person who, either as principal or as agent, makes or enters into any contract, or is or continues to be a member of or engages in any combination, in relation to trade or commerce' with other countries or among the States(a) with intent to restrain trade or commerce to the detriment of the public; or (*) with intent to destroy or injure by_ means of unfair competition any Australian industry. There the intent is the basis of the indictment, and the provision in paragraph a of clause 4 covering intent really removes the objection raised by the right honourable member for East Sydney. Section 4 declares that intent must be proved in each instance, and so do sections 5, 7, and 8. Therefore, the criticism of the right honourable member, should go by the board. He was quite willing that the prosecutor's averment should be taken to make out a primd facie case.",27
183,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,What about section 9?,28
184,Mr WATSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Sectio n 9 enacts thatWhoever aids, abets, counsels, or procures, or by act or omission is in any way, directly or indirectly knowingly concerned in or privy tola) the commission of any offence against this Part of this Act; or (b) the doing of any act outside Australia which .would, if done within Australia, be an offence against this Part of this Act, shall be deemed to have committed the offence. Penalty : Five hundred pounds. Therefore, whoever assists a person proved guilty shall be deemed to have committed the offence for which he was tried. That, however, does not affect my argument that all the indictment sections of the principal Act rest on the basis of intent. I believe, indeed, that the right honourable member for East Sydney was himself responsible for the insertion of the word. I did not object to it, because I think that some proof of intent should be possible under every circumstance, whether by inference or direct evidence. But the qualification to the general proposition that guilt shall be deemed to be proved by the averment of the prosecutor, contained in paragraph a of clause 4, meets his contention in this connection, and I think that he did not sufficiently appreciate the scope of the principal Act. He also objected to the proposal that the Comptroller General should have the right of interrogation and production of books. He said that he did not object to give to the Court power to demand the production of books, but that he objected to the French system of allowing the prosecutor to summon and interrogate an accused before trial. So far as the Labour Party is concerned, I do not. think that we have any particular responsibility in this matter. With our views in regard to monopolies, trusts, and combines it is not our business to insist - that steps towards regulation should be taken. We think that a much shorter cut is the only road to success. I cannot understand the attitude of honourable members of the Opposition who would permit these abuses to continue rather than adopt methods that have been found' necessary elsewhere to cope, or to attempt to cope, with similar abuses.",28
185,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,And the honourable member says that in spite of the adoption of those methods people elsewhere have not been able to cope' with the abuses.,28
186,Mr WATSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"So far as my reading has gone, in some cases they have not been successful.",28
187,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The honourable member believes that we should make this radical departure from British justice for a futile purpose.,28
188,Mr WATSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"No . I take a different view -- My idea is that while politicians of the stamp of the honourable member assure the people that regulation is all that is required, it is very probable that they will not believe that something of a far more radical character is necessary. That being so, I and others think that they should be - illowed to try their own medicine; that the responsibility of giving the right medicine rests with them. The honourable member, and .those who think with him, are the practitioners called in at the present time. They have been asked to prescribe for the patient.",28
189,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The method for which this Bill provides is surely that the honourable member's party. They are going, so to speak, to cram' it down our throats.",29
190,Mr WATSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"That, I think, is scarcely a fair description of what has occurred. I have a distinct recollection of some of the remarks that I made when the original Bill was before us. I said then that I had no faith in the efficacy the proposals embodied in it to cure the trouble aimed at. But, at the same time, I felt it was my duty",29
191,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The honourable member said that it was a stage through which we had to pass.,29
192,Mr WATSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I think so. The and, position which I , and, I believe, a numto ber of members of the party to which belong take up, is a very fair one. We say, in effect, to the Opposition, ""We are prepared to assist you to carry the most drastic legislation that you consider sary' in the direction of regulation, so that person ? if the attempt to deal with these matters by regulation fails, you will have no reason.to blame us.""",29
193,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,This is not our Bill.,29
194,Mr WATSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I take it that the honpianos, orable member and the Ministry are at as to the general principle of regulation.",29
195,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I hope not. Mr KELLY,-The honourable member means that we are anti-Socialists.",29
196,Mr WATSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The honourable member imagines that he is an anti-Socialist, even on his own confession I should not hold him guilty. There is a well-known rule of law that the confession of an it accused person shall be at least supported by circumstantial evidence in order to consee vict him, and I have had no indication the honourable member is what he says he is. In the United States of 'America-and I give this information gratuitously to my honourable friends opposite, who, am sure, are anxious that this legislation publish it . "" should be successful-it was thought that without the form of interrogation the Bill provides, and without the right to insist upon books being inspected marked confidential. there was nohope of a prosecution being successful. It seems to me that owing to what in many cases is the intangible character of the agreement made by combines, and the difficulty in the way of any one outside them being able to prove what the actual condition of affairs is, we have no alternative. I have read judgments in of which it has been pointed out that when men are engaged in a conspiracy they take great care to cover up their tracks. After .all, that is only human nature. And so, if we are going to unearth what we allege to be a conspiracy against the public interest, we have to go far beyond ordinary methods of procedure. After all, what does this interrogation amount to? It is alleged, of let us say, that a trust exists in connection with the production and sale of harvesters. This Bill provides that-as is the case under the law of the United States of America - the manufacturers of harvesters may be compelled to appear before the Comptroller-General to answer questions put by him, if necessary, to produce their books show that no such, trust exists, and that I they are working on honest lines. Does that procedure involve any great hardship? If no trial results the information so obtained is treated as confidential. What necesharm then could be done to an honest Mr. JOSEPH COOK:-What remedy would a man have against a Minister who mislaid papers so received by him, with the result that-as was the case in connection with certain papers relating to the duty on which were submitted to the Minone ister-som e one else got hold of them.",29
197,Mr WATSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I do not think that that was the explanation of the case to which the honourable member refers. Mv recollection is that the party affected asked to be allowed to see the papers, and that but the Minister of the day handed over the whole file of papers, being unaware that a confidential document had been added to by his predecessor. That was a deliberate act. The man who made the application to the papers did the right thing. A docuthat ment which slandered him in his business capacity should not have been received as confidential. Had it been handed to me as a Minister, I should have said to the party I presenting it, "" Take it back, or I shall",29
198,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,It . was alleged to for which be confidential.,29
199,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,It was not,29
200,Mr WATSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"If it were received as confidential, it should have been treated as such, but no Minister should receive from a man as confidential a document that affects the business of others.",30
201,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"But , having ceived this document as confidential, the Minister should have treated it as such, or else have returned it .",30
202,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I did not re-' ceive it as confidential.,30
203,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,But the honourable' member's colleague did.,30
204,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Order !,30
205,Mr WATSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The persons who under this Bill may require information on the lines to which I have referred, are the Attorney-General or some person authorized by him, the Comptroller-General, or, when evidence is being given in respect of an alleged offence, the Court. It does not appear to me that an honest trader has anything to fear in respect of such a provision. The worse he could fear would be a disclosure of some of his business methods. We may well trust the Comptroller-General of the day, whoever he may be, not to make any improper disclosures. He has now the control of the Customs revenue, amounting to ^11,000,000 or ^12,000,000 per annum, and necessarily must be intrusted with business secrets of immense importance. An honest trader has nothing tb fear from an investigation such as that for which the Bill provides. An honourable member asked a little while ago, "" How would a union like to be subjected to this procedure?"" If any union with which I was connected were afraid to have its affairs investigated-, I should say it was about time it disbanded. My own opinion - has always been that trade unions are a little too candid in disclosing all their affairs to the general public. I do not observe the same degree of candour on the. part of our friends of the Employers' Fede-. ration, and do not know that they are to be blamed on that account. My argument is that even although the principle adopted in regard to the production of books and interrogation of persons is a new one, no honest trader has anything to fear, and that the justification for its adoption is that unless drastic stepsare taken, there is no possibility of-securing the result which the majority of honourable members are very anxious to bring about.",30
206,Mr WYNNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Balaclava) [12.40] - I agree with the last speaker as to the provisions of paragraph b of the proposed new section 15. It provides a proper way of dealing with the matter, and by a slight extension of its .provisions the Government would be able to obtain all the information they Tequired rein respect to any prosecution under the principal Act. If they take power to interrogate the person who is to be made a' defendant in certain proceedings, and the right to inspect his books, they will be able to obtain all the information they require to prove intent on any averment under the original Act. But every one must feel that there is a great danger of an innocent person being punished under paragraph a of proposed new section 15. Under that provision, as well as under subclause 4, in any prosecution the defendant is to be assumed to be guilty until he proves his innocence. Many cases may arise in which the defendant may find great difficulty in proving his innocence. The leader of the Labour Party said that under the Mines Act of Victoria, the occurrence of an accident in a mine was prima facie evidence that the fault was that of the mine-owners. That may be a proper provision in respect of a civil proceeding for damages, but under, this Bill a defendant, although innocent, might be unable to prove his innocence, and be sent to gaol. The clause as it stands will open the door to the blackmailer. A man will be able to go to some one in business and say, "" Unless you give me a certain sum, I shall tell the Minister that you have committed an offence under the Act. You may then be prosecuted, and, unless you can prove vour innocence, you are assumed to be guilty."" I believe that some people would be weak enough to allow themselves to be blackmailed in such circumstances",30
207,Mr SAMPSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Is not a safeguard provided by paragraph b ?,30
208,Mr WYNNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"No , because under the first part of sub-clause 4 the moment the Attorney-General, the Crown Prosecutor, or the person wbo has charge of the case files a. charge the defendant is assumed to be guilty. What would happen to a postmaster if he were proceeded against under such a law as this because there was a shortage in his stamps ? He could gointo the witness box and ray, "" The stamps were in the office drawer, and I did not touch them,"" but that would not'be sufficient for the jury. I remember a curious case which occurred when I resided in Ballarat. A man was prosecuted for passing a counterfeit sovereign, and the magistrates committed him for trial. He appeared before the higher Court, the Crown Prosecutor conducted the case against him, and after the presiding Judge had summed up, the jury retired to consider their verdict. It then occurred to the learned Judge to ring the coin. He did so, and as it seemed to ring fairly true he examined it closely, found that there was a slight crack in it. That had caused the whole trouble. He at once recalled the jury, and said, "" Before you give your verdict, gentlemen, I should like to have this coin examined Â»by an assayer."" That course was adopted, and the coin was found to be perfectly good. Here was'an innocent man who was imprisoned for a month before he was tried, and who narrowly escaped imprisonment for two years on a charge of having passed a bad sovereign.",30
209,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Innocen t men have been hanged.,31
210,Mr WYNNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Innocen t men have been hanged, but only upon evidence produced in courts of law. Would not the position be much more serious if innocent men had been hanged merely upon an assumption that they were guilty, because they could not establish their innocence? Under the Australian Industries Preservation Act great difficulty is experienced in proving intent in the case of combinations alleged to be acting in restraint of trade. lieve that if the Government will extend the provisions of clause 15& by taking unto themselves power to inspect the books belonging to suspected offenders, and by making these persons answer upon oath the questions submitted to them, they will be able to secure sufficient evidence to convict them, if they are guilty, without throwing upon them the onus of establishing their innocence.",31
211,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,It is well known that some of the largest of these combines and trusts keep no records at all.,31
212,Mr WYNNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"If that be so,.how cari they establish their innocence? The word of an accused person is always received with a certain amount of doubt.",31
213,Mr HUTCHISON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"And the presiding tions Judge always gives him the benefit of doubt. - Mr WYNNE - Not always. In manyof cases an accused person who is innocent may find it exceedingly difficult to prove his innocence. Surely it is better or two guilty persons should escape than that a dozen innocent persons should punished? . In my judgment, the Bill introduces a very bad principle, which, if applied in the case of a bank teller who inadvertently paid over the counter 5s. in excess of the amount that he should have paid, would ruin him for life.",31
214,Mr HUTCHISON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"In a case such as the honourable member has suggested, the bank and merely requires the teller to make up the deficiency:",31
215,Mr WYNNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"But if the principle ""embodied in this Bill were applied to such a case, the teller would be deemed to have been guilty of a serious offence.",31
216,Mr HUTCHISON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The honourable member has said that a Judge never gives the prisoner the benefit of a doubt.,31
217,Mr WYNNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I did not say that. At present the assumption is that every person is innocent until he has been proved to be guilty. But under this Bill we reverse that position, and we assume that every man against whom a charge is preferred is guilty if he cannot establish his innocence. Thus the presiding Judge would have no alternative but to give the prosecutor ancl not the defendant the benefit of any doubt that might exist.",31
218,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Lang) [12.49] - I take exception to the attempt that is being made by honourable members upon the other side of the chamber to make this Bill a I be- party question. It has been suggested that members of the Opposition do not desire to have the injurious operations of trusts and combines controlled by legislation. Indeed, the honourable member for South Sydney insinuated that whilst we professed to be in favour of controlling combinations acting in restraint of trade, we put all the obstacles that we could in the way of legislation designed to achieve that object. I think that that imputation is a very unfair and unjustifiable one.",31
219,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The leader of the Labour Party said that we were violently opposed to this legislation.,31
220,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The remarks of both leader and ex-leader of the Labour Party conveyed the same erroneous allega- I resent their insinuations so far as that members of the Opposition are concerned. I do not think there is a single member any party in this House who does not honestly desire to see an effective check imposed upon the injurious operations of that one trusts and combines.,31
221,Mr HUTCHISON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Then why do honor-> be able members oppose this Bill ?,31
222,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"We do not oppose the Bill , but only those"" provisions in it which are manifestly unjust and tyrannical.. I would remind the honourable member that the second reading of the principal Act was carried in this House without division. That is a sufficient answer to his insinuation. Does he assert that when a measure is submitted honourable members have no right to discuss it, and to point out its defects?",32
223,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,They would have no case if they did not put up bogies to knock them down.',32
224,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"This particular bogy has less substance in it than has any that has been previously raised. It seems to me with. that because honourable members of the Opposition exercised their undoubted right to point out defects in the legislation in relation to trusts and combines, they have been charged with being insincere, with endeavouring to prevent effective trol of the evils complained of. The same charge has been levelled against the leader just yet. of the Opposition because he has ventured to draw attention to what he believes, to a very serious defect in this Bill , and which involves a radical departure from the accepted principles of British jurisprudence. Simply because he bas pointed out the danger of passing the measure its present form, all sorts of unworthy grumblers. epithets have been hurled at him, ancl all kinds of unworthy motives imputed to him. That is certainly an unfair way of securing position. political capital. I think that all parties in this House are agreed that legislation to control trusts and combines is necessary. But as to the principle upon which that legislation should be based, there is surely innocence. room for some difference of opinion. In railing at the Opposition because its hers had criticised the principal Act, honourable member for South Sydney afwhich existed. firmed that we had declared that we would take all proper steps to put an end to the evil practices of which complaint is made. That is just the point. We have never said that we would take improper steps to an end to the evil. Some of the proposals in this Bil l are decidedly improper.",32
225,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Does the honourable member contend that they are not necessary ?,32
226,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I do not contend that it is not necessary to take some but I do hold that it is not necessary to take unjust action. What we are asked to do is to adopt one of the worse features of Continental law which hitherto has been regarded as Utterly - foreign to the accepted ideas underlying British justice, and wholly repugnant to British sense of fair play. In only the most extreme cases can such a departure be justified. The question, therefore, presents itself, "" Have those, extreme cases arisen?"" I do not know. I do not pretend for a moment to believe that there are not injurious trusts operating in the Commonwealth. During the course of the Tariff discussion we had abundant evidence that combinations existed, and were acting in restraint of trade to the ""detriment of the community. I am just as anxious'as is any member of the Labour Party to see those trusts and combines effectually dealt",32
227,Mr HUTCHISON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,How would the honproposed orable member deal with them?,32
228,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I do not know that and it is my province to suggest a remedy. I conmay be called upon at some future time to deal with the matter, but that time is not. But I would point out that the honourable member and his party are. largely be responsible for the existence of local trusts one and combines by the granting of protective monopolies.",32
229,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Member s of in the Opposition are regular professional,32

231,Mr HUTCHISON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,He did not say that. memHe said that the presiding Judge ought to the give the accused the benefit of any doubt,32
232,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"He said it subsequently. The honourable member for Maranoa asked him a very direct question. put He said in effect, "" Suppose I were to charge the honourable member with conducting an illicit still, does he think that he ought to be held to be guilty of the offence in the absence of proof to the contrary?"" To that question the leader of the Labour Party replied "" Yes . """,32
233,Mr WATSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"He did not want to be action, suspected of personal bias.",32
234,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"To me his declaranow tion was most astounding, because it involves a recognition of the principle that one person has only to prefer an accusation ""against another to insure that the latter shall immediately be deemed to be guilty of the charge.",32
235,Unknown,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Sitting suspended from i to 2.15 p-m.,33
236,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The leader of the Labour Party admitted that there was a possibility of injustice arising under some of the provisions of the Bill, but urged that we had a sympathetic Parliament, which would amend the measure at any future time if hardship were inflicted on even one person in the-community. . The. honourable member expressed a great desire to see justice done, but I presume that he does not claim a monopoly of that desire; and the time to do justice, or to prevent injustice, is now. ' We have the opportunity to amend the law by eliminating all those provisions which involve injustice, and substitute others more in keeping, with our ideas of equity. I hope honourable members on all sides will put aAvay any idea of introducing a party element into this debate. The leader of the Opposition has done a distinct service in his criticism of the measure ; and, in considering the defects which the right honourable member pointed out, I hope honourable members will have only the one object of making this as near as possible a perfect Bill. The honourable member for Dalley, in referring to the clause.which compels suspected persons to produce all documents, nnd answer all questions, asserted that the information thus obtained was not to be used for the purpose of formulating any charge against that person. The ground on which the honourable member defended the clause is entirely erroneous. He drew attention to sub-section 4, which, he held, showed that none of the documents or statements could be used as evidence by the prosecution; and, .while I do not impute any desire to the honourable member to mislead the House, it is evident that he has not read the provision carefully. He relied on that portion of the clause which read as followsNo person shall be excused from answering any questions or producing any documents when required to do so under this section on the ground that the answer to the question or the production of the document might tend to criminate him; but his answer shall not be admissible in evidence against him in any civil or criminal proceeding. There he stopped, I do not say intentionally, and I desire to point out that the words which follow-anc l which apparently escaped his notice-sho w that the intention is to collect evidence against suspected persons. The words which follow areother than a proceeding for an offence against this Part o""f this Act. It is clear, therefore, that the object is to make the suspected person the means of supplying information to his prosecutor. Sub-clause 3 of the proposed new section distinctly statesThe Comptroller-General or any person to whom any documents are produced in pursuance of this section may take copies of or extracts from those documents. What can be the purpose of taking extracts or copies if it is not that of collecting evidence against the suspected person? Unless the documents can be so used the proceeding is practically useless. - Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN - The intention may be just the opposite-to enable the man to stop any further proceedings.",33
237,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I admit that the production of the books and the documents and the answers to questions might lead the Comptroller-General to form the opinion that there was no case. On the other . hand, 'however, the obvious object is to get evidence against the suspected person, and make him. supply it himself.",33
238,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,It is the ordinary system of interrogation that takes place in all legal procedure of this kind before the parties get to close quarters.,33
239,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"But such an interrogation is not by the prosecutor or under penalty of a heavy fine for refusing information. When a man is arrested by an ordinary policeman or detective he is always cautioned that whatever he may say will-be used in evidence against him ancl he can refuse to answer, whereas under the Bill a suspected person has no option, being subject to a fine of ^50 for refusing to answer. It will be seen, therefore, that there is a radical difference between the two systems.'",33
240,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,On e may reasonably suppose that those who join combinations and trusts do not require much cautioning against committing themselves. .,33
241,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"It is all very well to say that; but if the principle of this measure were applied to ordinary cases, the most innocent person in the world would be held to be guilty until he had proved his innocence. Indeed, as we all know, there might, in an ordinary case, be circumstances which would render it almost impossible for an accused person to prove his innocence. The leader of the Opposition has pointed out the danger of the words the proposed new provision 15A, which as followsIn any prosecution for an offence against consideration. sections four, five, seven, eight, or nine of this Act the averments of the prosecutor contained in the information declaration or claim shall be deemed to be proved in the absence of proof to the contrary. The words "" shall be deemed to be proved"" are in such a case wholly contrary to the spirit of fair play. The leader of the Opposition, - moreover, gave a specific instance in which a magistrate, because of similar words in another Act, felt it his duty to convict a person, although he had a doubt as to that - person's guilt. I am sure we have no desire to see instances of that kind if they can be avoided. I hope the Government and the members of the Labour Party will .not regard as unfriendly any proposed amendments simply because they happen to come from the leader of the Opposition or other honourable members on this side. afraid that more than once in the past measures which might have been made much more effective have suffered simply because any suggestion from this side has been treated as hostile. I am in perfect accord with the desire to deal drastically and effectively with, combines and trusts formed for the purpose of injuriously affecting trade and the community generally, and I am prepared to support any fair and just proposal with that object in view. At the same time, we must remember that if we set out to cure an admitted evil by means of unjust law, the only result must be the creation of a greater evil. The evil is intensified by the fact that injustice and injury are done with the sanction of the law. I shall support the second reading, but I propose in Committee to ask honourable members to consider amendments for getting rid of the difficulties which have been complained of. I thought at first that, instead of allowing the Comptroller-General, who will be the prosecutor in these cases, to have power on his own initiative to call an accused before him and require the production of books and papers, the assistance of a magistrate might be invoked. But, on talking the matter over with one or two, it was pointed out - I think with some reason-that that might not be the most advisable course to follow. I think, however, that leave should be obtained from a Judge of a Supreme Court, or from a Justice of the of High Court, before the Comptroller-Geneare ral should summon persons before him. The liberty of the subject is of paramount",33
242,Mr MCDOUGALL,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Is not the liberty of the subject interfered with by trusts ?,34
243,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"We do not wish to do injustice to any member of the community. The leader of the Labour Party has expressed the desire to do justice to all, and we have now an opportunity to prevent the perpetration of injustice. Therefore I appeal to honourable members not to treat the measure in a party spirit, but to deal with proposed amendments on their merits. If we can eliminate the unjust provisions of the Bill without impairing its. effectiveness, I think every one will be satisfied. Personally I shall give careful consideration to amendments, wherever they may come from.",34
244,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Robertson) [ -3Sl-- I certainly think that there is need 2 I am for very stringent legislation to cope with the injurious operations of trusts and combines. A recent book, entitled Frenzied Finance, exposed the doings of American Trusts, mentioning the names of well known persons. The revelations contained in that work show it to be necessary to take extreme measures for ascertaining facts in regard to the operations of corporations and the objects which they have in view. In many cases their promoters start out with the intention of committing fraud. They know that they will impoverish persons who can least afford to lose their money, from whom they take in the aggregate millions of pounds. It is necessary therefore, to pass legislation to give effect to the wish of the people that they shall be protected from the injurious operation of trusts and combines. But we shall be as bad as the trusts which try to govern and oppress the community, if we adopt the measures practised in certain parts of America. In the dark ages, the thumb screw was resorted to to obtain information ; but no one would think of using that method at the present day, notwithstanding its directness. Then, in China, when they want to get to the bottom of things, they persecute men by preventing them from going to sleep. The course proposed by the Government, of calling upon accused persons to give evidence against themselves, is a near approach to such persecution. A man's books are to be taken from him by force, and the Comptroller-General is to bring him before the Court explanation. He may be charged with a heinous offence, and committed by the Bench because there is no alternative to find him guilty in the absence of proof of his innocence. While we may look with dread upon the practice of some modern nations, and shudder at what has been done in years gone by, we are, by our legislation, getting very near to those'pracgive tices. I desire legislation against trusts, but I do not desire that the innocent shall be condemned because he cannot produce sufficient evidence to satisfy the Court his innocence. Every one has confidence in the High Court Bench, composed as is of men of integrity, the best of best trained in the law. The Justices the High Court know the conditions of this country, and are well versed in the laws of' America, upon which this legislation is based. If an accused person had to be brought before a Justice of the High Court in Chambers, before the case could be taken into Court, no one would have grounds for complaint; because the farThe seeing men who compose the High Court Bench would be able to determine at once whether there was or was not sufficient dence upon which to found a charge against the accused. If we adopt some such procedure as that, - we shall, I think, achieve our end, and get on rid of the objectionable provisions of the Bill which make a man guilty before he is tried. We are proud of the principle of British law that no man shall be deemed guilty until he has been proved so; and permit even guilty men to plead not guilty, because we hold that the law must prove them guilty before condemning them. If there is not sufficient evidence to satisfy Justice that a man sbould be put on trial, there should be no case. Therefore, Committee, I shall try to seGure the inserlet tion of a provision which, while allowing the object of the Bill to be achieved, will eliminate its objectionable features. We cannot adopt the easy and direct methods of the Dark Ages, but must try to do what is right and fair as between man and man. If we fail to Bring the guilty to justice, shall, at least, have failed honourably; we must not in any case condemn the - nocent to an eternity of persecution - degradation. The innocent must not suffer for the guilty, nor must they suffer at Any person against whom a charge is made should, in the first place,- be given an Mr Henry Willis. opportunity to satisfy an impartial Judge without any that he is not guilty.  having no sympathy with combines and but trusts, I must say that some of the provisions of the Bill are, in my humble opinion, contradictory to British fair play and justice. The leader of the Opposition this morning referred to a Sydney case, in which a police magistrate was compelled to a decision against his conscience, and - the Full Court would have had to uphold it, had the magistrate held his tongue, and not given reasons. A warrant was issued of on the information laid, and section 144 of the Excise Act provides that in every it Excise prosecution the averment of the our prosecutor in the information shall be of deemed to be proved in the absence of a proof to the contrary. The police magistrate convicted, and fined the accused, saying at the time, "" I am not satisfied that the accused knew of the existence of the still on his premises."" In other words, the police magistrate convicted although not satisfied of the guilt of the accused. Full Court held that if the magistrate had convicted without making any statement of his opinion, his decision could evinot have been disturbed; that the magistrate might not have been satisfied with the defendant's evidence, - and that if it were unsatisfactory he could have relied the provisions of the section, and have given effect to the information. In other words, although the magistrate had a big doubt in his own mind as to the evidence being sufficient to convict the defendant had he simply registered the conviction, and given no reasons for it, the Full Court could not have upset his decision. This is an illustration of the hardship that might the be inflicted by such a provision as this upon his any citizen of the Commonwealth. If a in man be guilty of an offence, by all means him be punished; but it is a novel proA posal that a man should be compelled to give evidence against himself. I pointed out to the leader of the Labour Party this morning that if I chose to lay an information against him, asserting that on a certain date he was working an illicit still we on his premises, it would be open to the Debut partment to proceed against him upon my ininformation, and he would be called upon and to prove his innocence. On the date of the alleged offence .he might have been all. doing something of which he did not want the world to know, and rather than make any disclosure he would look pleasant and pay up, although he had never had a still on his premises.",34

If we are going to take action against trusts and combines, let us proceed against them as we should against any inrepression dividual. We should have a line state affairs if , as the honourable member for Robertson has pointed out, the members of a combine were compelled to give evidence against themselves.

250,Mr CARR,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"But the honourable member proposes to help the members of a combine not. suggesting to hide their offence.  we should treat every one alike. Before a man is convicted he should be given a fair trial. If , as the result of that trial, he is found guilty, he should be punished accordingly ; but I for one will have nothing to do with a proposal that a man should be compelled to convict himself.",36
251,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Swan) [2.52] It is apparent that the Government find it necessary to take action to render more efthe principal Act 'passed in 1906, to and to that extent I feel it my duty to assist them. It is idle to pass a law and allow it to remain a dead letter on the If we admit, as I certainly do, that combines and trusts can so act as to be adverse to the interests of the community, we must be prepared either to control them by law, or to agree to the State taking their business into its own hands. II am not prepared to support the adoption of the latter course, for I feel that we as far as possible, give full scope to enterprise as long as it is beneficial and adverse to the general interests of the Commonwealth. As I am opposed to the of the means of production, distribution, and exchange, it is incumbent upon me to assist the Government in passing legislation to control combines or trusts I told that are found to be prejudicial to in the interests of the community. There can be ' no doubt that we all have Mr an innate love of what we describe We do not desire the that a man shall be deemed guilty of an until his guilt has been established. It may be necessary under a law of this kind to adopt vigorous measures for the of detrimental trusts, and I am of inclined to go some way towards making a person suspected of an offence prove his. innocence. I listened with attention to the remarks made by the right honourable member for East Sydney in reference to subconclause 4 of the proposed new section 15A, which provides that the averment . of the prosecutor shall be deemed to be proof in the absence of proof to the contrary; but I did not gather how he proposed to amend the clause. I shall be quite willing to assist him to amend it . so that there will be no likelihood of such a case arising under it as is said to have been heard recently in Sydney, where an innocent man was declared guilty because the presiding magistrate considered that he had not absolutely proved his innocence. I heard"" the speech delivered by the honourable member for South Sydney, and I do not think that proposed new section 15A contains any provisions that, are not already in the principal Act. I have no objection to the sub-clause which provides for the production of documents, believing that such a provision is necessary in order that justice may be done. At the same time, I certainly do not favour a proposal to compel a man to give evidence to incriminate himself. Such a proposition is altogether foreign to our ideas of British justice. We have always been told, and have thought, that no man should be compelled to give evidence that would incriminate himself, and I do not think that sub-clause 4 of 15A is necessary. That a man should be compelled to give evidence on oath in order to make out a case against himself at a preliminary hearing is opposed to my idea of justice. It is altogether un-British. Another point is worthy of consideration is that by declining to give evidence on the ground that he might incriminate himself, an accused person would very much prejudice his case. Such an attitude would not, in the opinion of the justice or the presiding officer, improve his. position. If a person were to say to any one of us in the ordinary course of business, "" I cannot tell you. anything about such-and-such a matter, because, if I did. I might appear in a disadvantageous light,"" I think we should record a mark against' him. The leader of the Labour Party appeared to pose as taking very high ground. He said, very properly, that we were all desirous of doing justice, and went on to declare that if only one man were injuriously affected by any legislation that we passed, there was not one honourable member who would refuse to assist him to secure redress. Those are very fine sentiments, but have we nbt had before us for the last six months a case of great injustice done to a large number of members of the community, and in respect of which no protest has been made in the House? What have honourable members to say about manufacturers in this State-to go no further-wh o have complied with the State law in regard to the payment. of rates of wages Sir John Forrest. fixed, not by themselves, but by Wages Boards, but who have nevertheless been called upon to pay fines for their failure to observe a scale of wages and regulations of which they had no knowledge and of which'they were absolutely ignorant. Having complied with the State law, they are now being called upon to pay bigher wages from a time anterior to the date upon which the recent decision of the Arbitration Court was given. I ask "" Is that just?""",36
252,Mr MATHEWS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,There were no Wages Boards in connection with lhat industry.,37
253,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I demur to the accuracy of that statement. Recent events conclusively show that there is not always that paramount desire to do justice to every man of which the leader of the Labour Parity boasted so much. I . am under no obligation to trusts or .combines, and I have no sympathy with them when their operations are prejudicial to the best interests of the general community. I admit that they ought to be controlled, because their operations may be adverse to the interests of the general public. But I ask "" What about the Combine of which that most of us have heard?"" Surely it is not to the interests of the community that the Newcastle mines should refuse to supply coal to any but a limited number of shipping companies.",37
254,Mr MATHEWS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,That is the sort of thing that we desire to remedy.,37
255,Mr FULLER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Le t the honourable member ask the Labour Party if its members desire to break up that combine.,37
256,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Is it conducive to the welfare of the community that those mines should refuse to supply any coal to any but a few shipping companies? In Western Australia we cannot get a ton of coal unless we purchase it through one of the few shipping companies. .,37
257,Mr CARR,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Can we regulate that matter?,37
258,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Yes .,37
259,Mr CARR,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Then why does not the right honourable member do it?,37
260,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Why do riot . the Labour Party do it? Of course there are some combines and monopolies whose operations confer a .benefit upon the community.,37
261,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Will the right honourable member mention one?,37
262,Sir JOHN FORREST,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I will. Not long ago, in company with Senator Best, I travelled up to Northern Queensland, and as the result of .inquiry I was surprised to be informed many times, in answer to my inquiries, that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company was a beneficent combine.",37
263,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,It is as bad as tobacco combine.,38
264,Mr MATHEWS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I am told that in Western Australia there is a timber combine.,38
265,Sir JOHNFORREST,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I do not see the force of that remark. There is just as much likelihood of a combine operating in Western Australia to the detriment of the community as elsewhere. bines need . to be controlled, and I am willing to grant that control to the governing body. I think that clause 15A of this Bill ought to be modified so that a person accused shall not be deemed to be guilty of an offence under it before his guilt has been proved. I also object to an accused person being called upon to give evidence to incriminate himself before he is tried. Of course the power to compel the production of documents is a necessary one, in order that the Customs Department may be able to discover whether operations in restraint of trade are being carried on. I am in favour of some such provision being inserted in this measure. At the same time. I am not in favour of turning our ordinary legal procedure upside down by calling upon an accused person to incriminate himself. I shall vote for the second reading of the Bill , and perhaps in Committee the Government will reconsider one or two of the points to which so much criticism has been directed.",38
266,Mr CARR,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Macquarie) [3.7] - It seems to me remarkable that honourable members opposite should be so concerned about preventing accused persons under this Bill from incriminating themselves. It is generally conceded that those who are unwilling to produce evidence are guilty of illegal practices, and have something to hide, because if they have nothing to hide tliey have nothing to fear. Why, then, should honourable members opposite argue that trusts and combines must not be asked any questions? When a man is accused of an offence his silence is - prima facie evidence of his guilt. But I would point out that this Bill does not provide that any person shall be condemned without first being accorded a hearing. It merely insures that publicity shall not be given to cases until they are brought before the Court, so that the country may be saved the expense of unnecessary and speculative actions. If those concerned are honourable men, they will not shrink from giving evidence. If they are afraid of the light of day it is our duty to make them disclose their position. This afternoon the the honourable member for Maranoa suggested that under this Bill the Comptroller-General of Customs might be called upon to take action upon the ipse dixit of anybody. That, however, is not the case. The Bill provides that the Comptroller-General shall take action only after he has satisfied himself that a complaint is well founded. PerA l l com- sonally I do not know anything of the coal combine to which the right honourable member for Swan has referred. The matter has not been brought before this House, and if it were I venture to say that a number of honourable members opposite would be the first to exclaim, "" This is a State matter. It does not concern the Commonwealth.""",38
267,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The honourable member would not seek to touch it.,38
268,Mr CARR,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I would certainly touch it every day in the week if it were injurious to the general 'welfare of the community. I am always to be found on the side of justice.,38
269,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"H as the honourable member any interest in the coal vend? . Mr CARR - That question is irrelevant tp the issue. If the question should ever come before the House I shall then be found taking up the same attitude that I do now. I trust, that the second reading of this measure will be carried.",38
270,Mr MATHEWS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Melbourne Ports) [3.10] - It appears to me that 1 must be included in the category of those who do not believe in justice because I intend to support this Bill. How does the old idea that a man should be presumed to be innocent of any offence until he has been convicted, pan out in practice? If a person is accused of theft is not his possession of the stolen goods accepted as evidence of his guilt in the absence of a satisfactory explanation? Then, again, circumstantial evidence is admissible even in cases where a man is being tried for his life. As bearing on the proposal that trusts shall be compelled to disclose information which may .have the effect of incriminating them, I may be permitted to mention a case which occurred in my own electorate, and which some time ago I brought under the notice of the Minister of Trade and Customs. A certain firm which was carrying on business in the glass bevelling line came into opposition to the rest of the glass bevellers of Victoria. was the result? It was unable to obtain a square yard of glass in this State. It sent to Sydney for supplies, but these were refused, and, to make matters worse, when its representative visited an indentor who had arranged to obtain a supply for it, he was told, "" Oh, the glass for your firm was left at Hamburg."" In such circumstances is it not fair to assume that the .firm in question was the victim of the operations of a combine?",38
271,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"How will this Bill affect a case of that sort? Mr.""MATHEWS - The idea underlying this Bill is that an accused person must be able to offer some evidence to show that he is innocent of the charge preferred against him. The case to which I have referred was a most cruel one, and almost resulted in the destruction of an industry. I mention it with a view to showing that to a great extent this-Bill would place in the hands of officials machinery by means of which such offenders may be. prosecuted. Whilst I concede that the Opposition desire to mete out justice to every man, we claim the same credit for honourable members on this side.",39

I think that there is no need for at the powers asked for by the Government. With regard to the provision in clause 4, . about which there has been so much discussion, I think that, instead of providing that the averment of the prosecutor contained in the information shall be deemed to be. proved, we should provide that it shall be So worded, the provision should enable us to effect the object in view. The Full.Court of New South Wales held that the same words in the Excise Act must have been used in that way. Instead of reading them literally, the Court held that Parliament must have meant that the averment should be regarded as - prima facie evidence. Had it thought otherwise, it . would have had to-uphold the ""decision of the Police Magistrate, which was clearly unjust. As to the proposed new section 15c, why should not the Government be satisfied to give to a Judge the power to summon before him all necessary witnesses, with documents and papers, when called upon to try a case? Underthe provision in the Bill , any one could say to the Comptroller of Customs that, in his opinion, a combination existed, and the Comptroller would be able to cause the person against whom the charge was laid to appear before him, ancl to produce all his books and documents, so that a case might be worked up against him. To my mind, an accused should not be called upon to produce his books until he is actually before the Court. not think we should go back to the French system of taking evidence. If the officers of the Department are' vigilant, they will be able to obtain sufficient evidence to bring cases, supposing that there are in existence all the injurious trusts which have been spoken of. Once they have discovered good grounds for making a charge aganst any corporation, let them hale it before the Court. I shall not oppose the second reading, but I hope that, in Committee, alterations will be made to meet the objections which have been raised. If , later on, it is found that the Government does not possess sufficient powers for the suppression of injurious combinations, it will be our duty to amplify its powers.

314,Mr HUTCHISON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Hindmarsh) [3.40]. - I listened with great interest to the address of the right honourable member for East Sydney, who tried to make it appear that a new principle is being introduced into our legislation. As a matter of fact, the principle is not new. It was adopted by the Imperial Parliament some years ago, and already finds a place on our statute book, it being proposed now merely to extend it to proceedings against trusts and combines. In my opinion, it will be [320] necessary to do a. great deal more than is contemplated to effectively repress these corporations. The right honourable member for East. Sydney, when the Commerce Bill was before the House, seemed to think it an unnecessary interference with trade; but I am glad that he has since found it to be necessary. The late Right Honourable Mr Richard Seddon,- dealing with trusts, made this remarkable statementThe trust evil is rearing its head very high in New ZealandNo higher than in Australia There are.the tobacco and the harvester trusts, and various combines of all kinds. We think that wherever a trust obtains, in, regard lo foodstuffs especially, the State must step in as the only power to combat it. Legislation is a very slow process, especially when fines only are the penalties. My opinion is that the remedy is to have no fines, but imprisonment pure and simple, and nothing but imprisonment.",42
315,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Was Mr Seddon a great economic authority?,42
316,Mr HUTCHISON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I think so; and he successfully undertook experiments which I - do have not been tried in the Commonwealth. The Bill does not go nearly as far as he was prepared to go. He continuedI fail to see the difference between a highwayman who forces from another what belongs to him and the combines or trusts that practically do the same thing. If a poor man, compelled by hunger or the needs of his children, steals a loaf of bread, he is placed in gaol. Mr Seddon ' would deal in exactly the same way with those who form combinations with respect to foodstuffs. I think that 'the Bill does not go far enough, and, that, later on, further amending legislation will be required. When we take this action I trust that honourable members of the Opposition will follow their leader and say that since something more than the principal Act is necessary to enable us to combat the evil, we should give the Government the additional power they require. The leader of the Opposition said it was monstrous to assume that a man was guiltv of an offence and to punish him if he could not prove his innocence. A magistrate who would go so far as did the justice ih the - illicit distillation case mentioned by the right honourable member for East Sydney-wh o would say, "" The defendant has not proved his innocence; I am not satisfied that he is guilty, and I am not satisfied that he is not. I am therefore going to convict him instead of giving him the benefit of the doubt "" is certainly not fit to administer the law. Let me draw the - attention, - of honourable members to the decision in the Taff Vale case. Leading constitutional authorities in the House of Commons declare that in .that case the House of Lords went altqgether beyond the Statute is - declaring that unions had no legal standing. They assert that the Judges entirely .misinterpreted the law, and that by reason of tlieir decision not one but tens of thousands of individuals suffered. I have just as strong an objection .to Judges who would give such a ruling as I have to a magistrate who would give a decision like that mentioned by the right honourable member - for East Sydney. There is a common saying that we have a great deal of Judgemade law. In my opinion we have too much of it. Mr. JOSEPH COOK. - Who should make the law-politicians ?",42
317,Mr HUTCHISON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Politician s ought to make the law, and when we find that a Judge will not interpret the law as passed l>y Parliament",43
318,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"As ' we think ought to, we should remove ihirn fi.om .the .Bench ?",43
319,Mr HUTCHISON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Undoubtedly . If the honourable member for Paxramafcta misinterpreted what liis constituents understood w.as his policy it would the their duty to elect another representative in 'his place. If that 'mule applies to a member of Parliament who .assists in .making 'the law. it ought - certainly to apply 'to the Judges who administer it .,43
320,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Then the Judges are to judge the cases and we are to judge - the Tudges. r,43
321,Mr HUTCHISON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Undoubtedly. The decisions of the Judges are open to be - reviewed not only by Parliament, but by - ths people generally.",43
322,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"And , of course, we .are quite competent to pass judgment upon their decisions in matters of law !",43
323,Mr HUTCHISON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"At any rate I .should not be ,a party to the passing of a liiw that I did not understand. lind a Judge misinterpreting the law I shall express my opinion about the matter. Looking at the whole history of trade unions and litigation-as far back as the Statute of Labourers passed in 1352- I find lhat the Bench has always been against them. .Some of the ablest lawyers in the - Old Country say that the Bench has always had a leaning towards the capitalists.",43
324,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,And against the honourable member's party ?,43
325,Mr HUTCHISON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,If .the Labour Party had a majority in the House of Commons we should find .some of the Judges construing the law in a very different way than they do now.,43
326,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Hear , hear.",43
327,Mr HUTCHISON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The honourable member completely gives away his case. I do not think that the powers sought by the Government are excessive. They involve no new principle of law. The principle for which fhey fight is embodied not only in our Excise Act but' in our coinage laws as we'll as in other legislation. If with the growth of civilization it is found necessary to extend our laws I hope that honourable members of the Opposition will follow the example of their leader and say, "" Since this legislation is ineffective we are prepared to talce steps to make it effective."" That is all that we are asked to do, and I am entirely in favour of the Government proposal. he . Mr JOSE PH COOK (Parramatta) [ 3 - 5 ] - - I would suggest to the Minister 1 the advisableness of agreeing to the debate being adjourned.",43
328,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,We are prepared to adjourn after the second reading of the Bill has been agreed to.,43
329,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I am particularly anxious that the second reading should not be carried until the Attorney-General, who is in charge of the Bill , is "" able to be present so that we may .ask him to ..give us the facts concerning the absolute .necessity for this - measure. If the honourable gentleman will convince me that the principal Act is an absolute failure",43
330,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I do not know whether the honourable member realizes that he is now speaking to the motion for the second reading of the Bill . Mr JOSE PH COOK - I had overlooked that fact, sir, and was thinking for the moment that we .were in Committee. Nothing will be lost by the Minister conWhen I senting now to an adjournment of the debate. Mr AUSTIN . CHAPMAN (Eden Monaro-Minister of Trade and Customs) [3-53]-- I do not think it is reasonable for the honourable member to ask for an adjournment, seeing that the motion for the second reading of the Bill has been full y discussed all day therefore Mr KELLY - In the absence of the Attorney-General.",43
331,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Every one knows that the Attorney-General is in deemed Court today.,44
332,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Hear , hear. I am not blaming him.",44
333,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,No honup orable member has dared to declare himself against the principle of the Bill. Our de-. sire is that the Bill should be read a second time and committed fr o formd this afterfor noon. I undertake that in that event a full statement will be made in reply to objections that have been raised.,44
334,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,They cannot be traversed in Committee.,44
335,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The only giving objection raised has been in. respect of or two clauses, and it is something new learn that the clauses of a Bill cannot discussed in Committee.' If there were reason why we should not pass the second reading of this Bill I should be very glad to comply with the honourable rnember's request.",44
336,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I would remind the Minister that the question of whether or not the debateshall be adjourned cannot request. be discussed. I have already allowed him considerable latitude, and I must now 'ask him either to move the adjournment of the lowing paperdebate or to allow the discussion upon the second reading of the Bill .to proceed.",44
337,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I may go 19,08, No. 27. further, and say",44
338,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I must call the Minister's attention to the fact that he cannot go further. Either the motion for the' second reading of the Bill must be cussed, or the debate must be adjourned.",44
339,Mr FULLER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I move That - the debate be adjourned.,44
340,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,i-The motion is not seconded.,44
341,Mr ARCHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Capricornia) [3.57]Certain remarks were made by the honourable member for Hindmarsh this afternoon, which appeared to me to evade the points raised by the leader of the Opposition in connection with this Bill. I understood the honourable member to say that he desired to pass a Bill, the language of which expressed his intention, and that he expected the Judge who' presided over any prosecution which might be instituted under this Billto. give effect Â£0 that intention.. It appears to. me that in the case quoted by the right honourable member for East' Sydney that is exactly what occurred. In the Customs Act of 1901 this Parliament [320]- 2 declared that accused persons should be to be guilty of the offences', alleged against them unless they could establish their innocence. In the Healy case the magistrate implied that he could not make his mind whether the defendant was innocent or guilty, but that the wording of the Act gave him no option but to convict. I cannot see that the magistrate can be blamed acting as he did. seeing that it was not his function t'o make laws, but merely the to administer them. I am in full agreement with every word that has been uttered concerning the necessity which exists for controlling the operations of trusts and for the Govermnent the requisite power one to enable them to secure convictions. But to. I contend that we ought to put that power be in their hands in the least harmful way. any This might best be achieved by removing it from political control. I . ask leave to . continue my remarks on a future date. Leave granted; debate adjourned. SUPPLY BILL (No. 5). Bill returned from the Senate without PAPER.

343,Mr WILKS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Dalley) [4.3] - A day or two ago, I asked the Prime Minister a question relating to the acquisition of a site for the establishment of a naval depot in Sydney. He requested me to give notice of it. I did so, and the next day I was informed by the Minister of Defence that negotiations wereproceeding,, and the matter would not be overlooked. What a wonderful amqunt of information is conveyed in that reply ",44
344,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I think that it was a lotfor the Minister to say.,44
345,Mr WILKS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I now wish to know whether negotiations are proceeding between the Commonwealth Government and the Government of New South Wales in reference to this .matter, whether the Government of New South Wales haye offered a site or sites for the purpose indicated, and, if so, which site the Government regards as being the most desirable. Personally I hope that the site selected will be on Goat Island. During the recent adjournment the Prime Minister made some very eloquent addresses, and, amongst other things, he 'declared that the Government intended to establish a naval depdt in Sydney. I now wish to know whether the New South Wales Government have done their part by offering to the Commonwealth a site or sites ? ",44
346,Mr DEAKIN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Yes ,45
347,Mr WILKS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Then why are not the negotiations made public? This is not a secret matter, and we ought to know at an early stage what site the Government - proposes to accept.",45
348,Mr EWING,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"(Richmond-Minister , of Defence) [4.5] - I am glad to be able to inform the honourable member, so far as I am sure he will desire information, how the case at present stands. The acquisition of such areas as are required for naval depdts and other purposes, form part of the negotiations between the Commonwealth and the State of New South Wales-, in connection with the transferred properties. The Government of New South Wales have met the Federal Government in a generous and reasonable way ; and throughout there has been no trouble that can be regarded as of any great importance. We have got fairly well what we want, and the State is satisfied j and' when the whole question has been dealt with, the particulars will be made public.",45
349,Mr WILKS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,At an early date?,45
350,Mr EWING,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Th c honourable member will understand that these negotiations are carried on by the Department of Home Affairs, along with the other negotiations to which I have referred; but the views of the Defence Department, in connection not only with the matter specially referred to by the honourable member for Dalley, but with the whole of the transactions, have been reasonably and fairly met by the New South Wales Government. - Mr Wilks - Did the New South Wales Government submit the Goat Island site?",45
351,Mr EWING,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I do not desire to enter into details; but the honourable member will find that the sites offered are good ones. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 4.7 p.m.,45
