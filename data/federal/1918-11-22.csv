1,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"Some time ago I suggested' that steps should be taken for the issuing of the discharges of members of the Navy on parchment instead of onpaper, and the Minister promised to give the matter oonsideration. In view of the probability of the early discharge of a number of men who have been engaged on naval work, I ask if the matter islikely to receive immediate attention? '  ceiving attention. I shall be able to tell the honourable member more later. WORKS AT NAVAL BASES.",20

8,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"' I recognise the seriousness of the matter, and shall give the honourable member a reply as soon as possible. MINISTERS IN ENGLAND. ' Mr HIGGS-There was in the Ministerial statement a paragraph to the effect that the prolongation of the stay of the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) and the Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook) in England was due to the necessity for ' looking after Australian produce, releasing shipping, &c. I ask the Acting Prime Minister if he will cable to the Minister the Navy asking' him if the statement of which recently appeared in the' Melbourne Age, that he had not seen the Prime Minister for three months, is correct, and if it is true, will he ask either the Minister for I the Navy or the Prime. Minister to return at once to Australia ?",20
9,Mr WATT,Unknown,"A cablegram dealing i with the matter was despatched yes ter-' day. I shall not disclose its contents at this stage, but its object was that the Ministry might be furnished with the exact facta, instead of having .to-depend on unat the Sydauthorized, press gossip. .

If so, what reply has he made. What is going to be done in the matter?",21
12,Mr WATT,Unknown,"The honourable gentleman must have read in the newspapers the telegram sent by Mr Fuller, on behalf of the New South Wales Government, to me, as acting head of this Government, which 1 received in due course. Before it came  with him on the telephone, and discussed the whole situation. I then pointed out to him the difficulty, if not impossibility, of accepting the suggestion of the New South Wales Government to evacuate Jervis Bay suddenly, and to make a quarantine station of a place wholly unsuited for the purpose. By permission of ths Acting Minister for Trade aud Customs, I asked the Directoiof Quarantine to at once communicate on the wire with Mr. Puller. A conference which had been called for Monday has been postponed to Tuesday, and I have informe""d the New South Wales Government that, if there are any difficulties of a special kind which they think should be dealt with immediately, the Director of Quarantine will leave for Sydney to-night, so that he may settle them and return to Melbourne in time for the conference. SALE OF AUSTRALIAN WHEAT.  Minister seen the statement of the New South Wales Minister for Agriculture (Mr Graham) to the effect that 1,000,000 bushels of wheat have been sold in London at 4s. 9d. per bushel? If that statement is incorrect, will the Acting Prime Minister enlighten the public on the subject?",21
13,Mr WATT,Unknown,"I saw the statement' and at once cabled to Mr Holman, giving him my view upon it.

14,Mr STORY,Unknown,"Some weeks ago I asked two questions of the Minister for Works and Railways-on e relating to the work on which the Director of Federal Capital Design and Construction was engaged, and the other to the fees, if any, which had been paid to him by this Government. One question was answered, but not the other. I again ask the Minister if he is prepared to furnifih a reply relative to the fees paid to Mi. Griffin ?",21
15,Mr GROOM,Unknown,1I have a reply which I shall give to the honourable member during the day. WEATHER REPORTS.,21
16,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,"I understand that weather forecasts are no longer supplied to the Marine Board at Hobart. The Board has sent to me a letter, in which it says that it trusts that the Government may see its way clear to reconsider the matter, and continue the supply, as the reports are of the greatest use to the shipping community, and very extensively referred to. The Board's offices are situated on the wharf, and the reports are exhibited in a case outside, which has been specially made for the purpose. The Board is of opinion that the discontinuance of the reports will cause great inconvenience to shipping masters, shipping agents, and other persons who are in the habit of consulting them and the maps issued in connection with them. Can the Minister see his way to re-issue these valuable reports, which are evidently greatly appreciated hy the public ?",21
17,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"That must depend on the amount of money made available for the purpose. Without more money, we cannot do more than we are doing. Wodo our best to supply this information to the Marine Boards and to similar bodies throughout Australia. The reports are sent to the press, to subscribers, and to the Post Offices, where they are published, immediately they are received. That is as much as we can do now that the vote for the purpose has been cut down considerably. "" POSTAGE ON LETTERS TO NURSES OVERSEAS.  General been able to arrange that the i d . tax shall not apply to letters addressed to nurses serving overseas?",21
18,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,Steps will be taken without delay to extend to nurses overseas the concession of the original postage^rate. REPATRIATION. LAND SETTLEMENT.,22
19,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"An arrangement has been made between the Commonwealth and the States to grant financial assistance to returned soldiers who take up land from the Crown, to those who held land before they, enlisted but sold their stock and implements, and to others who may become leaseholders of freehold land; but owing to the defective law in the State of Victoria, the two latter classes have been deprived of the ^opportunity of getting assistance. Will the Minister of Repatriation take immediate action to see that they are placed on exactly the same footing in regard to securing advances to enable them to buy stock and effect improvements as that upon which the Victorian law places returned soldiers who take up land from the Crown ?",22
20,Mr GROOM,Unknown,I shall place the honourable member's representations forthwith before the Minister for Repatriation. WHEAT POOLS.,22
21,Mr LYNCH,Unknown,"In view of the imminence of the establishment of the fourth Wheat Pool and the disastrous experience furnished by the operations of wheat certificate trafficking under previous pools, resulting as it has done ini wholesale robbery of the genuine wheat grower",22
22,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! The honourable member must ask a question.,22
23,Mr LYNCH,Unknown,Owing to suspicion of injustice being cast on those who instigated the pools and consequent injury to the farmers,22
24,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member is not submitting a question. This is a dissertation.,22
25,Mr LYNCH,Unknown,Will the Government consider the proposal to do away with trafficking in wheat certificates considering the robbery which is being perpetrated and the suspicion of injustice which is cast upon the instigators of the pool?,22
26,Mr WATT,Unknown,"Mr Speaker has ruled, with great propriety, although honourable members frequently seem to ignore the ruling, that substantive statements involved in questions are improper, and I wish to say, as a Minister, that parenthetical questions, such as those which the honourable member so frequently and so eloquently asks, tend to embarrass the Government. I propose, if I am permitted, to make a statement on the subject of the Wheat Pool before the House rises today. In the meantime I may say that I am not sure there will be a Wheat Pool next year unless certain matters are cleared up. I do not propose to allow the Commonwealth Government to be embarrassed by these frequent attacks. Whilst seeking to help .the wheat fanners, Ministers seem to be treated as a band of bandits desirous of robbing them. As to whether there will be any wheat scrip in a Pool which is managed in some other way, I cannot say at this stage, but I am heartily sick and tired of the attacks made upon a Government which is endeavouring to discharge an important national function.",22
27,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"'asked the Acting Prime Minister, upon notice I. Whether the London Wheat Selling and Delivery Board will receive selling commission on sales of the 1917-18 wheat harvest now offered hy the Government? 2. If so, at what rate? 3. In 'view of the letter dated 18th June, 1918, to the Victorian Producers Company by the Central Wheat Commission, which stated "" The Wheat Board is favourably disposed toward the representation in London of cooperative companies,"" and now that the sale of the 1017-18 crop is in negotiation, will the Acting' Prinie Minister instruct the Central Board to at once make such appointment in order that growers' societies will at least participate in the commissions or charges?",22
28,Mr WATT,Unknown,"The answers to the h o n o r a b l e member's questions are as f o l l o w : 1 and 2. No! 3. It is the intention of the Australian Wheat Board to give representation to the co-operative societies in any oversea contracts in connection with the 1917-18 wheat harvest. Should any sales be made by the Government direct the only payment that will be made will be for services other than selling-whic h can only. be determined when a contract is finally signed. Should any such services be required the cooperative societies will be permitted to participate therein. ALLOWANCE POST OFFICES. Mr LECKIE . ^ Will the Postmastercan be obtained. General consider the advisability of fixing a minimum allowance for non-official offices in country districts, some of which are open from 9 o'clock in the morning till 6 o'clock at night for a reward of £6 noticeper annum? Will the Minister take steps to provide a minimum so that this soandal of sweating people in country districts may cease? - Mr Webster - The observation the latter portion of the honourable member's question is unwarranted. No one in is being' sweated. Persons who conduct with allowance post' offices are paid on the mediate value of the work done. They enter into ticularly the agreement with the Department with their eye3 open, and contract to carry out the conditions attaching to it. They are of parties to the contract. The Department simply asks them to carry out the agreefor ment into which they have voluntarily producers entered, subject to the work available required to be carried out, and the payment allotted for such work.

31,Mr WEST,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"During the debate on the War Precautions Bill, will the Acting Attorney-General give honourable members the opportunity and pleasure of perusing the various regulations which have been issued under the War Precautions Act?",23
32,Mr GROOM,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"The regulations issued during 1915, 1916, and 1917 are available in a book which can be found in the Library, and, on application, copies of those which have been issued since then BUTTER AND CHEESE POOL.",23
33,Mr MACKAY,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"the Assistant Minister for Trade and Customs, upon 1. Whether the Board of Control of the Butter Pool waa consulted, and agreed to the sale of the surplus butter of the Commonwealth to the British Government? ' 2. What is the price per owt. to be paid, and in when does the contract expire? -3. Is the Butter and Cheese Pool to continue existence until the expiry of the contract the British Government? 4. If so, will the Minister consider an imincrease in the local price fixed, parin Queensland, where severe losses of dairy cattle have occurred owing to drought conditions, and in justice to producers generally on account of the largely increased cost production? 5. Does the increased p'rice to 168s. per cwt. butter in South Australia apply to the in that State, or only to the shortage or to the imported for local consumption?",23
34,Mr MASSYGREENE,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:,1. Yes. 2. The price per cwt. is 175s. for butter grading 90 points, Is. per cwt. less to be paid for point under 90, and Is. per cwt. more for point from 91 to 95 inclusive. The price of unsalted butter is 3s. per cwt. more than for butter. The contract is for the period of the war and one clear season after. 3. Yes. 4. The matter is under consideration. 5. The increased price applies to butter imfrom other States, and that produced, locally. This is the usual course. OIL-FIELDS IN NEW GUINEA.",23
35,Mr BAYLE Y,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"the Minister for Home and Territories, upon notice Whether it is the intention of the Government to develop the oil industry in New Guinea, or is it considering the question of handing the field over to the Imperial Government for development? ",24
36,Mr GLYNN,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"The suggestion that the Imperial and Commonwealth Governmovements should co-operate in the develop3 That ment of these fields is"" now under consideration in the United Kingdom. As soon as a decision is reached, I shall make a public announcement. NA TRAINEES.",24
37,Mr WISE,DISCONTENT AMONGST,"On the 14th day of Nothe vember the honourable member for Meltial bourne Ports (Mr Mathews) asked the following question:Has the Assistant Minister for Defence ceived any intimation that one of the principal their homes by Christmas. - causes for dissatisfaction amongst the trainees at Bendigo Camp was the insufficient ferior food? I am now able to inform the honourable member that an officer was specially tailed to investigate, this matter, and report will be laid on the table of Library for the honourable member's perusal. SOLDIERS' UNIFORMS.",24
38,Mr WISE,DISCONTENT AMONGST,"On the 19th November the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr. MCGRATH) asked the following quesvise tion :Is the Assistant Minister for Defence aware that, in consequence of the demobilization of the troops now in camp in Australia, the men are being required to give up their uniforms, and to assume civilian clothes? Will he take action to see that these lads, like the soldiers who have been abroad, are permitted to retain their uniforms? I a m n o w able to f u r n is h the honourable member with the following in f t i on : The regulations do not permit of the retention of uniforms by men discharged from the Australian Imperial Force prior to service abroad, but"" permission is granted to retain their underclothing, boots, & c , and certain small articles of k it . Commandants are being instructed to issue plain clothes suits to such men on discharge Bhould they not already be in possession of plain clothes. In the case of men returned from active service, permission is granted for the retention of their uniforms. The Minister cannot see his way to vary this instruction. ADDITIONAL SITTING DAY.",24
39,Mr WATT,DISCONTENT AMONGST,"Balaclava-Actin g Prime Minister and Treasurer) [11.28] - I the House, at its rising, adjourn until. o'clock p.m. on Tuesday next. We have made substantial progress this week, but there are three .or four important matters in addition to those already on the business paper which the Government will feel obliged to introduce for the consideration. of honourable members before we rise. Therefore, it is felt that extra sitting day per week is essenin order to terminate the present sittings of the House in sufficient time to enable honourable members representing reconstituencies in distant States to he at I hope that or in the motion will be agreed to without debate.",24

Question resolved in the affirmative. WAR PRECAUTIONS BILL . SECOND READING.",24
41,Mr GROOM,DISCONTENT AMONGST,"Darling Downs-Minister for Works and Railways and Acting; o r m a - Attorney-General) [11.30] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. Section 2 of the War Precautions Act 1914-16 reads.1. This Act shall continue in operation during the continuance of the present state of war,, nnd no longer. 2. For the purposes of this Act the present, state of war means the period from the 4 t b day of August, 1914, at the hour of 11 o'clock. post meridiem, reckoned according to Greenwich standard time, until the issue of - clamation by the Governor General that the war between His Majesty the King and the - German Emperor and between His Majesty the King and the Emperor of Austria, King - of Hungary, has ceased. That means that, at the conclusion of the - war, a proclamation would issue, and - thereupon the War Precautions Act and - the regulations under it would, generally speaking, cease to operate. It is to meet the difficulties' arising put of that situa- sued. tion that this Bill is introduced. As the - end of the war has, to all appearances, now almost been reached, it has opened up - to the various Governments problems no less complex than those which arose when the great conflict began. The far-reaching nature of the operations of the war - necessitated the exercise of extraordinary - emergency powers, .the administrative in trusion on the part of the Government 'int o areas of finance, industry, product i o n , and distribution never before contemplated, and an interference with the rights of individuals and their freedom - of action of a character quite alien to the customs of our race. By the exercise of these"" extraordinary powers, there have been built up various governmental and semi-governmental activities in national interest. The problems now before the Government involve the gradual restoration of the community to its normal peace conditions. The aims and intentions of the - Government are to govern, as far as possible, without undue recourse to these extraordinary powers during the period of transition from war to peace, and to establish as speedily as possible normal conditions. But the sudden cessation of the --activities which have arisen in consequence - of the war could not be accomplished with, out danger to the community, financial ;and commercial loss of a serious character, and a grave disturbance of social and - economic conditions. It is quite impossible, therefore, to allow a sadden termination of various Acts and regulations in troduced to meet the conditions arising - out of the war. To do so would involve the community in chaos and disaster. Many of the war activities have become so interwoven in-the commercial and indust r i a l life of Australia that their sudden a protermination would lead to endless confusion. To secure the public safety and the defence of the Commonwealth, it became necessary here, as elsewhere, to enact the War Precautions Act, and to delegate to the Executive a very wide discretion in the making of regulations and orders. Under the authority of that Act, a large number of regulations and orders were isThe main body were framed for defence purposes only, and were supplementary to the powers exercised under the Defence Act. Others were closely allied, but were meant to safeguard national safety and well-being. These dealt with such matters as the control of aliens and enemy subjects, and the prevention of in ternal trouble and disaffection. Other regulations were passed in the exercise of that wider power of defence as interpreted by the High Court in the case of Farey v. Burvett (21 C.L.R.), and were meant to safeguard the nation's economic and financial resources, both for local and Imperial purposes. Referring to the nature of the defence power under the Constitution, the Chief Justice (Sir Samuel Griffith) saidthe I agree generally with Mr Mann's argument that the power to legislate with respect to defence extends to any law which may tend to the conservation or development of the resources of the Commonwealth so far as they can be directed to success in war, or may tend to distress the enemy or diminish his resources, as, fbr instance, by the prohibition of trading with him or with persons associated with him. But this definition is not exhaustive. The control of finance or trade may be the most potent weapon of all. One test, however, must always be applied, namely : Can the measure in question conduce to the efficiency of the forces of the Empire, or is the connection of cause and effect between the measure and the desired efficiency so remote that the one cannot reasonably be regarded as affecting the other Applying this well established doctrine, the question is whether the Act and regulationthe validity of which is now called in question - ca n be regarded as substantial laws relating to defence; in other words, whether the provisions of the regulation can conduce to the more effectual prosecution of the war. ft is not necessary for the Court to point out theparticular way in which they can have that effect. But the Court may, I think, fake judicial notice of the fact that the past season's harvest was most abundant, and that vast quantities of wheat, far exceeding the possible consumption of the Commonwealth, are awaiting export; while, owing to the operations of war, the supply of freight is deficient. It is obvious that for economical, as well as other reasons, the export of the surplus to the United Kingdom or the Allied nations may be highly desirable for the more efficient prosecution of the war. It seems to follow that any law which may tend, with or without the aid of other measures, to encourage such export, may be conducive to the more efficient conduct of the war. Mr Justice Isaacs saidAs I read the Constitution, the Commonwealth, when charged with the duty of defending the Commonwealth and States, is armed as a self-governing portion of the British Dominion with the legislative power to do in relation to national defence all that Parliament, as the legislative organ of the nation, may deem advisable to enact, in relation to the defence of Australia as a component part of the Empire. A power which is commensurate with the peril it is designed to encounter, or as that peril may appear to the Parliament itself; and, if need be, it is a power to command, control, organize and regulate, for the purposes of guarding against the peril, the whole resources of the continent, living and inert, and the activities of every inhaEitant of the territory. The problem of national defence i's not confined to operations on the battle-field or the-3eck of a man-of-war; the factors enter into every phase of life, and embrace the co-operation of every individual with all that he possesses-hi s property, his energy, his life itself; and, in this supreme crisis we can no more sever the requirements and efforts of the civil population whose liberties and possessions are at stake from the movements of our soldiers and sailors, who are defending them, than we can cut away the root of a living tree and bid it still live and bear fruit deprived of the sustenance it needs. Each of the three classes of regulations to presents problems to be considered Government with respect to the terminamay tion of the lawful authority upon which will meet early and come they rest, and with respect to the policy aspect as regards the date upon they should cease. At this stage, owing to the unsettled conditions existing, and impossibility of predicting the date which normal conditions will be restored in the community, it is impossible to the date at which the particular exercised in each case can terminate. The decision in each instance will involve the consideration of many factors. tention of the Bill before the House is extend the operation of the Act for a period of six months after the proclamawhen tion has been issued under the War Precautions Act that war has ceased. Mr Groom. question arises as to when the war can be legally said to end. In the United K in g dom, a special legal committee, consisting of Mr Justice Atkins, Mr Justice Roche, Mr J . H . Balfour Browne, K . C . , Mr C. O. Lawrence, K . C . , Mr C. A . Russell r KC., Mr R . F . Norton, K . C . , Mr G . A . H . Branson, and Mr Roland B u r rowes as secretary, was appointed to in quire, inter alia, ' ' into the legal questions that may arise as to the determination of the date of termination of the war for the purpose of the various Acts, Orders and regulations, the duration of which depends directly or indirectly upon t j i at date."" In the Commonwealth we have passed a large number of Acts in which that or similar terms are used. This commiteee in Great Britain reported as to the'date of the end of the warWe assume that the war will be ended by a treaty or treaties of peace. In order to arrive at a final conclusion of the treaty, various stages will probably be required, such as' agreements for armistices, cessation of hostilities thereunder, articles of peace, agreement of turms, signature of terms, ratification, exchangeor deposit of ratification. In our opinion, speaking of legislation generally, the war cannot be said to have ceased until peace is finally and irrevocably obtained, and that point of time cannot be earlier than the date wlften the treaty of peace is finally binding on the respective belligerents, and that is the date when ratifications are exchanged.",24
42,Sir ROBERT BEST,DISCONTENT AMONGST,This Bill really means the extension of the Act for twelvemonths.,26
43,Mr GROOM,DISCONTENT AMONGST,"It is impossible for us say at this stage exactly o n by the what date the warwill end. It be that the Peace Conference quickly to a decision. On the contrary, the diswhich cussions may be very prolonged. No one can predict exactly what will happen, and the because of that we must have certainty at in law and administration, and particularly in regard to the great financial fix operations that have been undertaken control during the war. It is considered highlyadvisable that this extended period for the operation of the Act should be given. The inWe have eminent authority for exercising to our power of legislation under the Constitution for the purposes of the extension the war will have'ceased.",26

45,Mr GROOM,DISCONTENT AMONGST,I refer to counsels' opinion.,27
46,Mr BOYD,DISCONTENT AMONGST,That is not worth much.,27
47,Sir ROBERT BEST,DISCONTENT AMONGST,This is a most i m portant matter. Does the Minister assure us that he has unqualified opinion in support of the view that we have to do what he is now proposing?,27
48,Mr GROOM,DISCONTENT AMONGST,"Yes , it has been view of the Department all through that we had the power, and that view is confirmed by outside legal opinion. reason for the extension is partly to continue essential operations and activimembers ties which have been carried out during the period of the war, and partly able the Government and the various departments to take a most careful review of each of the regulations and activities with a view of deciding which of them can be brought to a speedy conclusion and the exact date to which others should be extended. To enable the necessary f u l consideration to be given to this questions tion as to what portions of the War Precautions Regulations should be given statutory authority after the war, Department of Defence desired immediate action to be taken to extend the operation of the Act for six months after the war. The Director of Munitions, who is charged with the control of some most important commodities, has advised that the prolongation of the control of cerUnless tain essential industries in peace time have to be considered on national The Controller of Shipping advises that the sudden termination of control of sire shipping would be disastrous to Australian interests, and that the control should ""jumpy,"" t e continued for at least six months, longer if the return to normal conditions House. cannot be effected within that time. Then, again, the Chairman of the Wool Committee advises-  the same advice.",27

57,Mr GROOM,DISCONTENT AMONGST,"I would ask the House to consider for a moment what .would be the position if immediately peace were declared the whole of these activities and I am endeathe vouring to bring before honourable members the opinions of those who have been directing these operations, and have a thorough grip and knowledge of them. We have relied upon the in to administer these activities in the best interests of the Commonwealth, and we have asked the Departments now to express their opinion as to what should be done in the existing circumstances. When interrupted, I was referring to the work of the Wool Committee, the magnitude of whose financial - transactions is well known to honourable members. We are asking, among other reasons, for an extension of the Act in order not to prejudice the continuance of these and other activities, involving vast financial considerations, until we ascertain the legal position in regard to them. The chairman of the Wool Committee advises that the Imperial Government has arranged to purchase the Australian wool clip for the period up till the termination of one complete wool season. after the close of the war. Hence the activities of the Central Wool .Committee must continue in operation for a considerable period after the close of the war. The Chief Prices Commissioner advises that the Commonwealth Government is committed in the matter of the export of butter and cheese for one season after the declaration of peace, namely, at least until the end of the year 1920. 'The Dairy Produce Pool Committee has been elected to office, under the War Precautions Regulations, until 30th June, 1920. I come now to another phase of this . question, to which I would draw special attention, and which I hope will not be lo3t sight of by honourable members when exercising their judgment with respect to this proposal. With regard to the moratorium, the Farmers Union has asked for an extension of the time for the War Precautions moratorium as applied to pastoral and agricultural interests. active service moratorium regulations, . dealing with certain mortgages, and sales, and purchases of land, postpone payments, by soldiers and their dependants in certain cases until six months after the duration of the war. What would be the effect on the commimity if , on the declaration of peace, the War Precautions Act and the regulations under it ceased to operate, with the result that many of these mortgages could be forthwith called upl Mr Groom ",27
58,Mr BOYD,DISCONTENT AMONGST,'Has not the community known for four years that that would bet-he position at the end of the war?,28
59,Mr GROOM,DISCONTENT AMONGST,"The community did: not know when the war was likely to end. The change from the war period, with its immense attendant expenditures, topeace-conditions, under which such expenditure must be decreased, must involve a. great disturbance of commercial and industrial conditions.",28
60,Sir ROBERT BEST,DISCONTENT AMONGST,"The regulations extend the moratorium until six months beyond .the declaration of peace. Mr GROOM.T-The Act, however, remains in force only until the date of thedeclaration of peace'.",28
61,Sir ROBERT BEST,DISCONTENT AMONGST,Then these regulations are ultra vires?,28
62,Mr GROOM,DISCONTENT AMONGST,"I do not say that. The honourable member is quite right in raising the point, 'but I remind him that this Bill is intended to allay any doubt generally as to the extension of the regulations. Each of the instances to which I havereferred indicates the necessity for someprolongation of the Act. The Government do not desire to extend its provisionsin order to initiate new matters of policy,, and the .power to make new regulations^ will be exercised only in case of national necessity. Though the operation of the Act be extended, it is the intention of the Government that immediate action shall be taken to consider and repeal regulations or orders no longer necessary, and to remove governmental control as soon-as possible in all cases where it is practicable or advisable to do so.  The Mr GROOM - That is impossible. Questions of policy affecting the industries concerned, as well as questions of law, are involved, and have to be considered. It may be necessary, in some cases in the future, to ask Parliament to extend existing activities and regulations beyond the period contemplated by this measure. In those cases> however, Parliament will be specially appealed to by the Government. There are also other Statutes of an emergency character dealing with patents and other matters, the operation of which will have to be considered. Meanwhile, to advise the Government upon the purely legal aspect of problems arising out of the war, an honorary legal Committee has been constituted, consisting of men of dis- cludetinction in the profession, who generously have consented to give iheir services in this connection, and to advise as to .purely legal problems arising out of the cessation of the war. The members of this Committee are-Si r Edward Mitchell, KC, Mr Adrian Knox, K . C , Professor Harrison Moore, Professor J. B. Peden, Mr. H . E. Starke, Mr E. P. Simpson, and Mr J. M . Campbell. The Attorney General for the time being will be the chairman of the Committee. In the United Kingdom advantage has also been taken of the assistance offered by members of the legal profession. As regards the regulations under the War Precautions Act dealing with defence matters, many will not need to be continued, or the powers under them exercised. As regards those relating to internment, no definite announcement can be made at present, as it is understood the question of the ternment of civilians is one of those matters which will have to be settled at the Peace Conference - The action of the Government with respect to this matter, and upon the question of enemy subjects generally, must be to a great extent guided by Imperial policy. As regards the censorship, the Government has no. desire to control this beyond what is absolutely necessary. Until at least peace is signed, some control in the national interest is essential. In the United Kingdom the discussion of peace terms is the subject of censorship. However, the censorship has already been relaxed - with respect to shipping and other matters, and the general policy will be to restore as speedily as possible the right, of expression of .public opinion and freedom of discussion. The regulations dealing with commercial and financial matters involve consideration as regards their operation, and their future extension, even beyond the term contemplated by this Act, has to be seriously considered. One or two instances might be mentioned. The control and management of the wool scheme has been created under the authority of the War Precautions Begulations for the purpose of carrying into effect the purchase by the Imperial Government of the Australian wool clip. The duties involved in(a) the display and handling and reconditioning of wool; (I ) the appraisement of its value; (fi) scouring and repacking as necessary; (d) provisions for its storage until shipment; (e) arrangements for its shipment as and when space becomes available; and (f ) financial arrangements involved. The activities of the Wool Committee include also the handling of sheepskins. The mere reference to this activity shows how impossible it is to contemplate its sudden termination. The purchase operates for a ful l wool year after the close, of the war, so that definite steps of necessity must be taken for the continuance of a scheme which is operating so inbeneficially in the interests of Australia. As to dairy produce, under the War Precautions (Dairy Produce Pool) Regulations 1918, important duties are imposed upon the Committee constituted under the regulations. Its duty is, among other things(a) to provide, as far as possible, butter and cheese for consumption in the Commonwealth; (6) to make such arrangements as it deems necessary with regard to sales of butter and cheese to the Imperial Government and other sales for export; (c) to acquire for storage on such a basis and conditions as will, as far as possible, prevent any factory obtaining an advantage over any other factory, such butter and cheese as it deems necessary in order to meet any shortage that may occur within the Commonwealth ; (d) to hold the produce in cold stores; (e) to arrange for its safe custody - and insurance; (/) to use the butter and cheese in such manner as it deems fit, and to supply it during any period of shortage to those places and States wherein shortage is expected; (cj) to insure certain matters as regards prices.",28
63,Mr BOYD,DISCONTENT AMONGST,They have not started.,30
64,Mr GROOM,DISCONTENT AMONGST,"They have; contracts have already been made that will operate, probably, to 1920. The Committee also, with the approval of the Treasurer, make certain financial arrangements. I have already mentioned that the duration of these regulations is required for some time after the close of the present war. In addition, mention might be made of the regulations, concerning cornsacks, regulations concerning patents, and also regulations controlling prices. At the commencement of the present sittings of Parliament, the Government promised to put price fixing on a more satisfactory basis by introducing a Bill in substitution for the numerous regulations under the ""War Precautions Act, hy which price fixing is controlled at the sent time. The termination of hostilities, and the prospects of an early peace, in the opinion - of the Government, render this course unnecessary. It is not intended to dispense with the existing regulations immediately. Some time must elapse before trade and commerce can be restored to pre-war conditions. The position will, however, be carefully watched, and as opportunity offers the individual articles will be released from control.",30
65,Mr ARCHIBALD,DISCONTENT AMONGST,The British Government are not losing control.,30
66,Mr GROOM,DISCONTENT AMONGST,"They are not, nor are we. We say that as the conditions gradually come back to normal there will be a relaxation of the powers. It is not intended to extend the operations of the Price-fixing Department unless there appears to be grave cause to do so. At the same time, the Government wants the trading public to understand that, pending the return of normal conditions, they will not permit undue advantage to he taken of abnormal conditions existing, or that may arise, in the interim during the transition period before ""shipping and trade resume their usual channels. I have referred to a few of the commercial activities that need consideration, and obviously their sudden termination cannot be contemplated even by the i m mediate cessation of the war, so closely associated as they are with the commercial, industrial, and economic conditions of Australia. It is for reasons such as I have stated, that it is essential to extend the operation of the Act beyond the period prescribed by the present law. The Bill states in its preamble its purposes. It recites the fact thatWhereas the Act and regulations and orders thereunder continue in operation during the present state of war, and no longer, and whereas it may not be possible before the war has ceased to make complete provision for a return to the normal conditions of peace, 'and whereas the extension of the said Act and all regulations and orders made thereunder, in. the absence of such provision, would cause great public danger and inconvenience. The preamble points to the necessity for pre- the extension which is to make complete provision for a return to the normal conditions of peace, and recites the results likely to arrive in the absence of such extension- "" great public danger and inconvenience."" . Clause 2 provides that the period of extension is, as I have stated, for six months after the war and no * longer. The Bill also declares that all regulations and proclamations lawfully made pursuant to the principal Act shall, except in so far as they are amended or repealed, continue in operation for a similar period. There is also a proviso that any regulation or order or proclamation heretofore made orany provision therein contained operating by force of its terms for a longer - period than six months after the termination of the war, shall remain in force, unless amended or repealed, during theperiod provided therein - The effect of this clause will be to continue the existing regulations and to provide for the continued operation for a period longer than six months after the termination of the present war, of any existing regulation whioh contains provision for such operation.",30
67,Mr TUDOR,DISCONTENT AMONGST,That means that the extension is beyond the period named here.,31
68,Mr GROOM,DISCONTENT AMONGST,"It refers only to regulations heretofore made-befor e the passing of the Bill. I desire to oall particular attention to the last clause of the Bill, which deals with the application of certain terms used in the principal Act.",31
69,Mr BRUCE SMITH,DISCONTENT AMONGST,Shal l we not come to the clauses when we are in Committee?,31
70,Mr GROOM,DISCONTENT AMONGST,"I refer to this clause because it involves a principle. The clause is as follows:The terms "" enemy "" , "" alien enemies "" and . "" persons having enemy associations or connexions "" used m the principal Act in relation to any person, shall apply, during the operation of that Act, to any person to whom they would have applied during the continuance of the present war. I simply wish to say that the operation of this portion of the Bill will depend on the terms of peace that are ultimately made, and in its administration regard will be had to Imperial policy. It is presumed that the peace terms themselves will deal with the question of the treatment of enemy subjects; and ""this clause is inserted as a precautionary step to enable us to deal with oonditions which may arise out of the peace terms themselves or the conditions then existing. This Bill is submitted because of the vital necessity of continuing the powers under the Act, and the continuance of those powers is only asked for because, unless it be granted, there is a certainty of grave confusion and serious disturbance economically, financially, and industrially in Australia.

71,Mr BOYD,DISCONTENT AMONGST,Mak e it Thursday.,31
72,Mr GROOM,DISCONTENT AMONGST,"I only desire to fix a day. The debate will be resumed on a day to meet as far as practicable the convenience of honourable members. Question resolved in the affirmative. DEFENCE BILL (No. 3). SECOND READING. Debate resumed from 21st November (vide page 8203), on motion by Mr. WISEThat this Bill be now read a second time.  seems to me strange that it should have been necessary for this Parliament to pass so many amendments of the original Defence Act. I believe that up to the present there have been ten amendments of that measure, and the Bill now under consideration is the twelfth of such amending Bills that have been introduced. The Government have gone so far as to have proposed two amendments of the Defence Act this year. It is more strange still that a further amendment of the Act should be considered necessary when apparently the final flutter of the war is at an end, and the services of the Australian Imperial Force are no longer required in the field. If there is one thing which, more than another, honourable members on both sides desire, it is that every honour should be accorded to the men who took their lives and their courage in both hands, aiid went abroad to preserve the benefits of the freedom and liberty we enjoy in Australia and throughout the British Empire. I feel sure that honourable members are determined that the men who have gone overseas to fight for this country shall have justice done them. One would naturally suppose that the men who have won their spurs and gained distinction and honour on the battle-field, should take precedence of the "" stay-at-homes,' 1 the men who are termed in the Imperial Forces ""feather-bed soldiers."" I clo not care what position may have been held by "" stay-at-homes "" in Australia; they may have been wonderful organizers, but if they had been imbued with the true military spirit no chains would have prevented them from doing a soldier's' duty when such a duty required to be done. Perhaps honourable members do not realise that it is intended by the amending Bill now under consideration to take their seniority away from the men who have won their spurs on the field of 'battle, and have done something, not for Australia, but for the Empire. honourable members going to permit a Bill to pass at the dictate of the vernment, merely in order that a lot "" stay-at-homes "" may occupy senior tions? Every position in our Defence Porce worth having should be preserved for the men who have seen active service.",31

This amending Bill will take that right away.",32
75,Mr BRUCE SMITH,DISCONTENT AMONGST,"The honourable member contends that clause proposes the omission of words from section 20 of the Act which give precedence to men who have seen active service.  of the existing Aet provides thatThe seniority of officers in the Reserve Military Forces shall be as prescribed, of the Active Military Forces shall rank as wnior in their respective ranks to officers of the Pront. the Reserve Military Forces. That is the provision of the existing law which I desire to see retained., In my ""view, clause 2 of the amending Bill will deprive officers of the Active M i l it a r y Forces of the right conferred under section 20 of the existing Act. Will honourable members suffer such a thing as that? T. am confident that they will not. Why is this proposed? The Minister has not told us. Surely if men are good enough to fight for us they are good enough to be given positions above the "" stay-athomes,"" the men who strut about, as do a lot of women, on the block in .

Do not let us be posihypocrites in dealing with these men. Let us act up to what we have said all along. Every member of this Parliament who has appeared on a public platform in connection with any war activities has the reexpressed admiration for the young Aust a ry tralians who - have gone abroad and won their spurs, and I feel that when the in proposal of the Government is exposed, there is not a member of this House who permit this Bill to pass in its pre",32

77,Mr WISE,DISCONTENT AMONGST,"The effect of the Bill will be the very opposite to what the honourable l under member for Maranoa has stated.

84,Mr JOWETT,DISCONTENT AMONGST,"I think that the MinisstancesI ter should explain the definition of these terms.  tunity to do so later. I consider that clause 6 of the Bill, dealing with resisting the draft, is necessary; but I take strong exception to clause 10, which readsSection 98 of the principal inserting after the words "" except for "" the word ""murder."" Section 98 of the principal Act readsNo member of the Defence Force shall be sentenced to death by any court martial except for mutiny, desertion to the enemy, or traitornot ously delivering up to the enemy any garrison, fortress, post, guard, or ship, vessel, or'boat, or traitorous correspondence with no sentence of death passed by any court martial shall be carried into effect until confirmed by. the Governor General. I say that no man should be tried for wilful murder except by a civil Court. remember that, when I was in the perial service, one soldier murdered another. After roll-call at night Christmas Eve, we were sitting fire, when a - gunner who had been discharged from prisoji the day before, seven days' imprisonment for some minor offence, was approached by a bombardier who had been the cause of his imprisonarmy ment. The bombardier tapped the man on the shoulder and said, "" It is time you were in bed. Get up quick and lively, and get to bed."" The gunner said, "" I will shift you, my gentleman,"" and he by pulled the poker out of the fire, charged of the bombardier with it, and put it through-, him. . The bombardier died, but the gunEener was not arrested by the military authorities for murder. He was arrested forassaulting a non-commissioned officer.. Directly the bombardier died, and a civil, verdict of wilful murder was brought in against the gunner, the military .authorihad to hand him over to the civil Repower to be tried. That is the course which I say should be followed in such in . cases. Every one of the offences mentioned in section 98 is a military offence. The war is practically over, so far as the Australian Imperial Force are concerned, I and they are being embarked for Austhe tralia as rapidly as possible. Owing to the armistice, they are not now engaged, on the field of battle, and in the circumshould like to know why such an amendment of section 98 of the principal Act is proposed at this time?

I am satisfied that even those who are opposed to war must be proud of the part that Australia has played in this great struggle. Our troops have undoubtedly proved that they are not vagabonds or mongrels.

I particularly desire to know why we should insert the word "" murder "" in this Bill, and thus associate it with military crimes.

I shall do my best at every I stage of the Bill to defeat the proposal. To my mind, it is the only blemish in the",34
96,Mr CORBOY,DISCONTENT AMONGST,"Swan) [12.40] - I wish, - first, to say how glad I am, as one of the soldier members of this House, that the Government have at last seen fit to rectify one of the many grievances of the returned officers of the Australian Imperial Force. I am now referring to the proposed amendment of section 20 of the principal Act. Up to the present time returning officers of the Australian I m perial Force, upon joining the Reserve Forces, have been ranked junior to officers in our Citizen Forces-officer s who have never left Australia. The proposed amendment will do away with that anomaly, and give seniority to those who have actually fought in the defence of this country. Incidentally, it will abolish much of the discontent .that is felt towards the officers of our Citizen Forces who have remained at home. I have in my mind one specific case-that of a sergeant major who enlisted for service abroad, and who came back to Australia as a captain, with the military cross on his breast. penalty with their lives. Upon his return he was obliged to drop his rank and salute officers who had never left Australia. That was certainly not a proper thing. Biit under the amendment which is now proposed he will become senior to those officers- a procedure that is obviously just. The only other suggested amendment with which I wish to deal is that which has been mentioned by the honourable  proposal to insert the word "" murder "" in section 98 of the principal Act. In the first place, I believe that the soldiers of Australia, as a whole, wish to remain, ' even during the - time that they are wearing khaki, essentially citizens of the Commonwealth. Personally^ I am convinced that some of the sentences which have been imposed for military offences under the Army Act have been savage, and for< all the bigger crimes committed in the Army I desire to see civil trial stituted for military court martial. In the battalion in which I had the honour to serve I know that men received really savage sentences-in some cases amounting to many years of imprisonment-for crimes that a civil magistrate would have laughed at, and possibly dismissed. In this connection, I recall one case especially-that of a corporal, who was sentenced to fifteen years' imprisonment for striking his superior officer, although he did him no damage whatever, and did not even bruise him. Punishments of that character are altogether disproportionate to the magnitude of the offence committed. As the members of our Forces serve as citizens, and not as soldiers, it is high time that we had the right of a civil trial for any crime meriting a big punishment in the Army. In regard to murder, one has, iii many cases, to consider the circumstances under which it is committed. Upon two occasions which came under my personal, observation during my term of service abroad, men committed the crime of murder under great provocation. In both instances, while keyed up to a very high pitch of excitement, they were ridden down by military police with naked sabres. As a result, some of the military police subsequently paid the If the ringleaders in this crime had been caught they would undoubtedly have had to stand their trial for murder, and at a military court martial they would not have received the same consideration that would have been extended to them if they had been tried by a civil Court. It has also to be remembered that accused persons in the Army are not able to secure proper representation at their trial. Ninety-nine men out of 100 are not conversant with one-fifth of the provisions of the Army Act, and do not know how to defend them, selves. That is not just to the accused whose life is trembling in the balance. He should have the right to be represented by a man who is trained in legal matters, and who is able to put up a decent fight for the accused's life. There are many other military crimes which are punishable by death. In many instances the man who is sentenced and shot is really sub- not a case for the executioner so much as he is a case for the doctor. In one instance of which I have knowledge- I was in Ypres, in Flanders, at the time it happened- a young man, .nineteen years of age, who had been conscripted into an English regiment, had been taken into the trenches for the first time. His regiment was subjected to three hours of the heaviest drum fire imaginable. would have broken the nerves, I am sure, of quite three-fourths of the honourable members of this House. The effect .of that drum fire upon the nerves of the lad was ao severe that he turned tail and ran. He was certainly not a coward in the ordinary sense, but he had been subjected to such a fearful ordeal that he lost all control of himself, and hislegs carried him where his head did not direct him. He was caught. Immediately after he had left the trenches, the Germans launched a charge, and it was held against the lad, therefore, that he had deserted in the face of the enemy. Shortly afterwards was taken out and shot in the public square of Ypres, in front of the civil population. That is the type of crime which involves a man's execution in the Army, and I am very much opposed to any extension of our military laws which - would grant power to execute a man following upon a court-martial. war is practically over. Goodness knows why the authorities require now to extend the powers they already seeing that the men are on the eve of returning home. ""We should do away with those hidebound regulations which today hold our men down, and will not allow them to speak. God knows that the discipline in. the Army already is strict enough. English soldiers have told us that they could not understand the freedom which we enjoyed; and it is a fact that they are very much worse of f . than the men of the Australian Force. But the Australian soldier, citizen soldier that he is, has not the liberty so long as he is 'in the Army that we enjoy. Despite the fact that the Australian has been charged with lack of discipline, he has fought secoricT io none in the war; and I fail to see the purpose of binding him down with further discipline. sonal observations have led me to the conclusion-just as with a great many others - that the soldier under the strictest discipline has proved the poorest man. It is for an obvious reason. his officers and non-commissioned have been wiped out, the man who has been accustomed to the severest discipline Jlfr. Corboy. finds himself practically useless with It out a leader. The situation in the Australian A r m y has always been diametrically opposite. Our . soldiershave been accustomed to doing little odd jobs on their own, and when they have got into a tight corner, where the alternatives have been taking another man's' life or of his taking theirs, our Australian lads have known just how to go to work. They have required no officers. They require no extreme discipline to show them what to do. T am opposed to any f u r the r extension of the grip of militarism upon our soldier citizens. he Dr MALONEY (Melbourne) [12.49]. - Whil e I value the assurance given by the Government respecting the amendingclauses in this Bill , I still have many doubts. I recall that once I was assured by Mr George Turner-afterward s Sir George-that a certain paragraph inserted in a particular-Bill was intended, to conThe vey that the salary of the Governor General would never be increased. The amount indicated at that time was £10,000 per possess, annum. I said, "" That is all very well, and I am naturally prepared to take your word for it ; but , "" I added, "" let us have it in black and white. Let us put into the enabling Bill one little word which will assure that the salary shall not be more than that sum."" I thereupon moved to omit the word "" less,"" and to insert in its stead the little word ""more."" An effort was made later to break that promise of Mr Turner, when Lord Hopetoun, our Imperial first Governor General, sought to secure £20,000 a year. It was that section in the Victorian State Statute which prevented the addition being granted. I - am in clined to insist here also that we should' have everything in plain English, so that - there shall be no mistake, or change of purpose. Indeed., I feel inclinedto giveMy per- notice of my intention to move a new clause, based upon the Uode Napoleon.. It would be to the following effect:fighting Notwithstanding anything contained in this""When or any Aet, it shall be mandatory that all men- and officers who have seen active serviee overofficers seas shall rank as senior in their respectiveranks to men and officers of the Reserve Military Forces who have not seen active service overseas.",35
97,Mr BRUCE SMITH,DISCONTENT AMONGST,"That is intended to be the effect of the clause in the amending Bill , but I doubt whether it will produce that result.",37
98,Dr MALONEY,DISCONTENT AMONGST,"I am merely going upon the arguments which carried weight in regard to the Governor General's salary. Let the matter be simply set out, so that the man in the street-ith e returned soldier himself - shall clearly understand. Probably during the war I have had more conversations with "" returned soldiers than any other honourable member. I have cultivated the habit of asking many questions. The majority of these who have attended my office, and have told me their stories, have spoken well of General Birdwood. some of them. I have been acquainted with another point of view. ' I am given to understand that he actually desired that there should be power to inflict the death penalty on our Australian soldiers, just as in the case of the Continental Forces. We have just heard of an instance bearing upon that from the honourable member f b r Swan (Mr Corboy), who has just won his spurs in this Chamber, and whom I heartily compliment upon his maiden effort. HoiroiiAKLE MEMBEBS -'Hear , hear!",37
99,Dr MALONEY,DISCONTENT AMONGST,"I shall vote against the clause which seeks to include the death penalty in our Defence Act. It will be an infamy if it is embraced in the Statutes of a country like Australia, with its voluntary citizen soldiers. It would be bringing in one of the vilest things which has discredited the accursed German military system. Here we are, at a stage'when fighting has ceased, and peace has been virtually declared; and it is sought to provide for the infliction of the death penalty at this dying stage of the - Avar. I have had some experience of courts martial in this State. I could tell a good deal about the case of one unfortunate man, four of whose brothers had enlisted.. One of those lost his l if e on Gallipoli, and another in France. 'Still another has not yet recovered from his wounds, and one is missing. A court martial was held in the case of this individual; and honourable members with legal training will agree, I think, that there is generally no appeal from a court martial, unless it be upon the presentation of new evidence. In this particular case, however, the Assistant Minister for Defence at the time caused an inquiry to be held, which overrode the decision of the court martial. At this second inquiry there was a certain Australian general-on e of those individuals who has never smelt gunpowder at the Front. I refer to GeneraLCuscaden, who ranks as superior to all our returned heroes, and whom even the heroic wearers of the Victoria Cross mu3t salute. I am referring to Dr Cuscaden, who remained in Australia, and, because he belonged to the Government House "" push "" got his But from advances until he held the rank of surgeon-general-althoug h he had never smelt gunpowder, unless it might have been when he let off a cracker in his own back yard. This man had the infernal audacity to say that the poor wretched person who was then being tried a second time, was fit to be put to work. He was sent for six months to.a lunatic asylum, under observation all the time. Where is he now? God knows. He had developed the most phenomenal voice I have ever heard. He spoke from my own platform with me on more than one occasion, but I could never permit him to address the crowd for more thau a few minutes, since he worked himself up to such a frenzy that he trembled from head to foot. Dr Sewell, who has been concerned in the inquiry, told me later that he thought he might have misjudged this man's case. This individual afterwards went to Queensland. There is no doubt that he was mentally unhinged. In that State he spoke from the recruiting platform under another name, and, witli the aid of his truly phenomenal voice, he attracted great crowds. One other incident in his story is that he, a married man, found another gir l to marry him. His illness was such that he could not carry out the functions of a married man with his wife. One day this girl-wife found a letter from his first wife in Melbourne. There was trouble. He thrashed her. They both disappeared. Did she commit suicide? Did he? General Cuscaden said that that man was fit to go out and earn his own living. That was the expressed opinion of an individual whom every V . C . winner must flip his hand to. This is the official who, if he went to the Front, would be laughed at by every doctor in the I m perial armies. There is not one of our returned Army Medical Corps Officers but who is, in fact, the superior of this man. who is their military superior. He would not be allowed to go into the Melbourne Hospital, or the Alfred Hospital, as an out-patient or in-patient surgeon. Let us prevent any legislation such as is here sought, until our fighting men can return and are free to tell us all they know. As for the effort of General Birdwood to secure power to enforce the death penalty in the Australian Imperial Force, I greatly honour the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt) in that sent a message replying that General Birdwood would not be permitted to secure his ends. Are we going to bring in the death penalty now, when the armistice has been signed, when the fighting is over, and when our heroes are on the eve of return? On Monday I shall attend a meeting to welcome home our ANZACs i i i North Melbourne. I shall tell that meeting what the Government are proposing now to do-that the death penalty is to be imposed upon Australian soldiers in the same brutal manner as. with the German armies, and with the armies of other nations.",37

If I can read past and coming events, I do not think Ave shall have militarism in Australia. Some time ago I was promised a return which would show particulars of those officers of the Australian Imperial Force who were receiving salaries of £500 and over-majors , colonels, and the rest of them. I have not yet secured that return. This brilliant General Cuscaden is one of them-this senior officer who has never smelt gunpowder. W it h all his military salary, he is carrying on a ]5rivate practice. Why , if we place him against Dr Kent Hughes, he is a child at surgery.

They will be able to give us the benefit of their experiences. They may be able to show us that such absurdities exist as_ too much discipline, too much recognition of officialdom, and too much red-tape. When we know what they have to tell us, Ave may be able to pass a really good up-to-date Defence Bill . If I am he any reader of political events-and I suppose my parliamentary experience is second only to that of the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Bruce Smith) and the honourable member for Riverina (Mr . Chanter)-that Avhirlwind of change which has absolutely eliminated monarchy from Europe will in other ways eliminate the powers of the p r i v i leged classes, and extend even to Australia, so that anything Ave do now will probably have to be altered again later on. There is no immediate necessity for this legislation, seeing that the armistice has been signed,_ a number of the death-dealing destructive brutes of submarines that previously belonged to Germany have already been handed over,- and the provinces of Alsace-Lorraine are actually in the hands of our Allies. Surely in those circumstances this is not a meet time to amend the Defence Act. I quite agree Will the Assistant Minister for Defence (Mr Wise) that men Avho haA'e actually seen service overseas should rank senior to those who have not done so; but a proA'ision to that effect could be put in a feAv simple AA'ords. I remember that many men Avho rose to high rank did not think it Avorth AA'hile to volunteer for service in the Boer war, and when the late Lord Kitchener Avas here I Avrote to him and asked him if he did not consider that, all things being equal, the man ivho had seen service should have absolute priority over the man who stayed at home. His answer was that, all things being equal, the man who saw service and proved his patriotism to his country should always have preference. I do not think any honourable member in this Chamberwill gainsay the wisdom of the opinion expressed by that great leader of men. If the Government cannot see their way clear to accept my suggestion, I shall move the amendment I have indicated, embodying the principle of the Code Napoleon, as a new clause. I hope I shall not have to do that, because 1 take it that this is a measure on which there should be no - party division, and that we are all united in our desire to give full credit to. the man who has gone to the Eront fit the risk of making the supreme sacrifice.

106,Dr MALONEY,DISCONTENT AMONGST,"I would impress on the Assistant Minister that no medical man or surgeon in active practice can give a full and accurate idea of the nervous diseases which, have been caused by the horrors of this war, or of their effects. Honourable members must have been impressed by the words of the latest accession to the 'House, the honourable member for Swan (Mr Corboy). I was sorry there was not a full House here to listen to the splendid speech of that young man. If the Government have received definite instructions from the Homeland to put this provision in the Bill, let us be told so. I honour the Government, through the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt) for refusing to agree to the death penalty being enforced previously, even though it was recommended by General Birdwood. Honourable members who were in the chamber and heard the cheers with which the Acting Prime Minister's statement was received on that occasion will agree with me that, unless special instructions or orders have come from the Front to the Government - to do this thing, this is certainly a most inappropriate time to do it. If the majority in their wisdom decide to carry that provision, I shall suggest later on, as a way out of the difficulty, the insertion of a proviso at the end of the clause to the effect that, where punishment of that kind is awarded, any man or officer shall have the right ""of appeal to a civil Court. If that is done, I shall not be afraid of the result. If , however, the Government have determined to carry the clause as it stands, it will he my duty to divide the Committee on the question whether the right of appeal to a civil Court shall be allowed. That, if agreed to, will mean that every, man found guilty by a court martial under this heading will have the right of appeal, and the opportunity to prove to a civil Court that he is suffering from some nervous affection, such as shell shock, or one of the hundred-.ind-oneother troubles that in medical and surgical centres are now being traced, although only dimly, to the war. The people outside will certainly be pleased to know that every oflicer or soldier has the right of appeal, which every citizen outside has, to a Court higher than the first Court that has tried him.",39
107,Mr BRUCE SMITH,DISCONTENT AMONGST,"Parkes) [2.24]. - This Bill affords another example of the very injurious practice of setting"" before members a mere series of amendments to existing legislation without putting before them the existing law to which it refers, so that they may clearly ascertain, ' without rumaging among past volumes of Statutes, what the law has been and the effect of the amendments upon it. I have referred to that injurious practice many times in the House, and have had promises from Ministers, going as far back as the beginning of Federation, to the effect that, whenever a Bill was introduced into this House involving amendments of existing Acts, members should have the convenience of seeing at a glance in what respect the existing law was being altered. For a long time, I believe, the expenditure on paper has been a factor in our economy, but the time bas arrived now when the Assistant Minister for Defence (Mr. ""Wise) might promise that,' at all events in his Department, any further amendments of this kind will be so framed that members can - see at a glance what the law is that they are called upon to amend The honourable member who has just spoken had to look baok at the existing law to see in what respect the Act will be affected by one of the amendments put before us in this bald way. So far as the debate h'as gone, there are only two points on which the House differs from' the Minister. One is the inclusion of murder in the iurisdiction of courts martial, and the other is the principle of giving those who have had active service seniority over those who have never been to. the war. The Minister evidently thought at first that the provision in the Bill would effect his purpose, and that appeared to be the impression of the honourable member for Swan (Mr Corboy), whom. I desire to congratulate upon his maiden utterance. I had misgivings when I saw a young man of twenty-one taking the place of a man of seventy-one, with all the accumulated wisdom of his years. I may say now, as probably the oldest parliamentarian in the House, that I was delighted with the honourable member's utterance. The truth with regard to the matter of seniority appears to lie between the rather optimistic view of the honourable member for Swan and the pessimistic view of the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney). I do not think the amendment as framed in the Bill will preserve to members of the active service Porces complete seniority over men who have not .been on active service, because it is quite possible that, for reasons which we cannot now speculate, some of those who have been on active service may not care, or may not think it desirable, to go into the Reserve. If they do not, my impression is that they will lose the benefit of their seniority. It would be well if the. Minister, in making this amendment of the law, would include a proviso by which the principle laid down in the Code Napoleon, quoted by the honourable member for Melbourne, would be ilfr. Bruce Smith. preserved, that in. all caseswhere, men are of equal rank, the man who has been on active service should enjoy seniority over the man who. is in the Reserve, or in any other branch of the Forces. That would satisfy the honourable member for Melbourne, and carry out .what the honourable member for Swan 'thought was carried out by the Bill. The other question is much more difficult. ""We know that courts martial have not, at present, jurisdiction over the crime of murder, and it is sought in the Bill to extend their jurisdiction to cases of that sort. I was shown a' case by the honourable member for Corio (Mr. Lister), in which it seemed that a manwas charged and tried for murder before a court martial, 'but on looking over the papers I see that the court had misgivings as to its. powers, and ultimately convicted the man of manslaughter,, awarding him a punishment which they thought fitted the case in its most serious aspects. There is a great difficulty about this question. ' I quite agree wibh the honourable member for Melbourne that we are not a% favourably disposed towards courts martial as we are towards civil trial. No doubt, trial by jury nowadays is very much abused, and often in the ramifications of society as we know it in a small community men tried before a jury escape justice when they ought not to do so. On the other hand, we all know that in many cases where men are tried by courts martial a military disciplinary harshness is exercised, and humane feeling seems to be al togetlier wanting. We know from experience that a great many men are so seriously affected mentally by the war that at times they absolutely lose all control of upon their will-pow""er. The case mentioned by the honourable member for Swan (Mr Corboy) was that of a young soldier who bore all these disturbing influences for 'a - certain time, and then became so affected by them that he literally ran away. Medical knowledge would have informed the military court martial that tried him, that his state of mind could probably be accounted for by circumstances other than moral cowardice. Notwithstanding all the youth had suffered, he was taken out and deliberately shot for having done something which medical men would now say was the natural result of a tremendous psychological disturbance. My leaning is always towards civil trial, though I recognise it cannot he applied to military conditions without a complete revolution in method and judicial arrangement. I should be very willing to see some sort of t r i a l as the honourable member for Melbourne suggested carried out, but one has only to reflect on the ramifications of military discipline to recognise that two distinct types of mind and two types of jurisdiction and adjudication must be observed in civil and: military affairs. I understand from the Minister, who made the suggestion just now, that it was proposed to . l i m it this investment of courts martial with jurisdiction over murder to cases outside the British {Empire. That seems a feasible proposal, because when a man is outside the British Possessions he is outside the availability of a British civil tribunal. I know the honourable member for Melbourne thinks that, as we have done very .well for four years, we ought"" to do very well now; but we hardly know how many cases there have been in which justice has suffered by reason of courts martial not having that power when they are outside B r it is h ' Possessions. I am quite with the honourable member, and I think that if our minds could be carefully examined misooscopically, I should be found to have as much humanity in me, although perhaps with a more cynical exterior, than the honourable, member himself. I always try to approach these questions in a judicial spirit; and I think if the Minister would l i m it the investment of courts martial with jurisdiction for murder to cases outside British Possessions where there are no civil tribunals available, it would be quite safe. We do not know in what respect courts martial may have been forced to fail in doing justice by their inability to deal with the questions of murder.",39
108,Dr MALONEY,DISCONTENT AMONGST,Then let any such persons be sent back to Australia.,41
109,Mr BRUCE SMITH,DISCONTENT AMONGST,The introduction of a olause to effect that purpose would mean a great variety of amendments.. I think the honourable member ought to be reasonable.,41
110,Mr CORBOY,DISCONTENT AMONGST,But a man should have a right to appeal to a civil Court.,41
111,Mr BRUCE SMITH,DISCONTENT AMONGST,"That is an-, other question, and I am sufficiently in formed of the law to hesitate to take any steps as suggested. When a man knows a little df the law he is like a Scotchman 0 dancing the sworddance-ver y careful where he puts his feet. The labyrinth is so great, so complicated, and so vague, that one hesitates'to embark upon amendments that may be followed by hundreds more. The honourable member anticipates that we are going to have peace soon, and so do I ; and I ask the Minister to . limi t the operation of this amendment to the time that our troops are outside British Possessions. There will then be no groat danger. W it h regard to the other question, I suggest to the Minister that he should take great care to see that the principle in the Code Napoleon, by which a man on active service has preference over a man not on active service, is carefully preserved; and that in any amendment of the law made, no loophole be left in giving an advantage to those who have not been on active service over those who have really helped this country during the war. I want now to say a word or two about the Duntroon officers. It has no ""bearing upon these two particular amendments; but so far as I can learn there is no procedure by which a Duntroon officer can be promoted above the rank of major. I have been to Duntroon, and have taken some trouble to inquire into the modus operandi of that establishment. Men train there for a number of years and undergo a military education which fits them for any position in the military service for which their ability may qualify them.",41

113,Mr BRUCE SMITH,DISCONTENT AMONGST,"They have a magnificent record, and an enormous proportion of these men 'have been killed. This, of course, gives them a claim upon our sympathies and upon our law-making practices. I now draw attention to the disability under which they suffer, and I hope the Minister will give some explanation to the House as to why there is, apparently, some unwritten law against Duntroon officers rising above the rank of major. Mr ""WEST - Surely you understand the reason.",41
114,Mr BRUCESMITH,DISCONTENT AMONGST,"No , and I should be glad if the honourable member can in for m me.",42

We should approach all questions like this with the object*of instilling a spirit of brotherhood among the five .and a half millions of people in Australia. I hope honourable members will do so, and I point out that a remark of the kind just made by the honourable member for East Sydney does not help us. I know of no reason why Duntroon officers should not have the same opportunity to rise in the Military Service as are afforded to other members of it .",42
117,Mr CHARLTON,DISCONTENT AMONGST,"Is the honourable member referring to those who went to the Front from Duntroon? Mr BRU CE SMITH - I am including them, so my remarks are more comprehensive.

Mr BRU CE SMITH - In - the case of promotions in the field, the commanding officers, I - have no doubt, have not troubled to inquire whether a man went through Duntroon or not. I understand' that there is some reason why Duntroon officers cannot rise above major, though some of them may have obtained great honours in the field, and have distinguished themselves in a very remarkable way. Personally, I have no grievance in the matter, but it has been brought under my notice more than once, and I ask the Assistant Minister for Defence whether there is any such rule concerning Duntroon officers, and, if so,, why it has been promulgated. If there is not any such rule, it should be known that . there is no reason why any young man who goes through many years of training at the Military College should not have the same opportunities of reaching the top as any other man who enters the M i l it a ry Service of this country.",42
120,Mr CHARLTON,DISCONTENT AMONGST,"Hunter.) [ 2 . 4 2 ] - I desire in the first place to congratulate the honourable member for Swan (Mr . Corboy) on his maiden effort in this House. Like the honourable member who has preceded me, I have had the privilege of hearing many honourable members make their maiden speeches, but I think I can say, wthout fear of contradiction, that I "" have never heard a better effort on the part of any honourable member than that made by the honourable member for Swan today. His constituents are also to be congratulated in the wise selection they have made; in my opinion he will be an acquisition to the House Regarding the two questions that are under consideration, and there are only two, I was pleased, indeed, to hear the interpretation placed upon' them by the honourable member for Swan, though I am not quite clear, in my own mind, that he is correct. I think there is room for doubt. We are asked in clause 2 of the B i ll to amend section 20 of the Act by striking out the wordsbut officers of the active Military Porces shall rank as senior in their respective ranks cers of the Reserve Military Forces. Section 20 of the Act statesThe seniority of officers in the Reserve tary Forces shall be as prescribed. . . . The definition of active Forces shows that it includes all parts of the Defence Foroe other than the Reserve Forces. I am in harmony with the honourable member for Swan in desiring to make provision for the men who have .been at the Front, but do the words "" active Militar y Forces'' mean those who have participated overseas in this war ?",42
121,Mr WISE,DISCONTENT AMONGST,"l t includes everybody else. ' Mr Charlton - It includes everybody in the Militar y Service, and that being so, it does not give preference to men who have been overseas. That is the point. It gives everybody who is regarded as being in the ' ' active'' Forces an equal opportunity to promotion,. I do not know whether the Assistant Minister for Defence (Mr Wise) intends that to be so, but I can place no otlier interpretation upon the Bill read in conjunction with the interpretation section of the principal Act. The honourable member for Swan is quite right in his contention that we should give preference to those who have been fighting for us, but I am afraid that, with the Bill as it stands, those who have remained here in Australia will still have the right to hold choice positions in connection with the Defence Department - I hope that when peace is signed, we may have a general disarmament of the nations, or, at least, a partial disarmament. That would, of coursej largely reduce our military requirements. If we have to continue our defence establishment, we should, in every instance, give preference to those who have risked their lives for our liberties. Preference should be given to all who have seen active service abroad, including those who have served ^ it h the expeditions to the islands. It has been stated that the cadets who go through Duntroon College are not permitted to rise above the rank' of major. If that is so, a wrong is being done to them which should be righted as soon as possible. There are abroad many men* with the rank of major, who, time and again, have led their battalion into the fight in the absence of their colonel on furlough, or because of sickness or to offi- wounds, and who cannot rise above the rank of major, because only one lieutenant-colonel is appointed to each battalion. MiliA man may rise from the ranks, through the various steps, to his majority, but he must then wait for an opening for promotion to a lieutenant-colonelcy, and these openings do not frequently occur, probably because there is not so much risk attaching to the holding of the higher positions.  tion been issued regarding the Duntroon cadets? -' Mr Charlton : - I do not know, but, if so, it is a wrong instruction. I looked into the matter of promotion some time ago, because I knew men who, for two years, have held the position of major, and have been qualified for promotion, but I learned that they were not promoted because there was no lieutenant-colonelcy vacant. If it is only on that] ground that the Duntroon cadets cannot rise higher than the rank of major, there is nothing to be said. ' In the past, provision has been made for the sending abroad of officers to gain experience. This has cost the country a good deal, but, in future, it will not be necessary, because so many men will ret u r n with a practical experience of modern warfare, and an ounce of experience is said to be worth a ton of theory.  might change.",43
122,Mr CHARLTON,DISCONTENT AMONGST,"I hope that when peace is signed, there will be a disarmament, which would make that impossible. Most of the amendments provided for in the Bill appear to be in the interests of those who are away at the Front. As to the proposal that courts martial shall have the power to inflict the death penaltyfor murder, I would point out that we have gone through four years of warfare without finding it necessary to give them that power, and it should nob be necessary to do so now that an armistice has been signed, and we are within reasonable distance of a peace. The House will be very loath to sanction this proposal, and the Minister sliould consider before going into Committee whether it is absolutely necessary. W it h o u t it , the Bill could be easily passed this afternoon. But the statements of the honourable member for Swan (Mr Corboy), and of the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Bruce Smith) must make us very careful in this matter. Many soldiers are not responsible for 'their actions. In Sydney recently, I met a young fellow whom I knew, accompanied by his littl e daughter. In welcoming him back, I asked after his health, and he said, "" Today I am fairly well, but at any moment I may temporarily lose control of myself. Theu 1 do not know where I am, or what I am doing; and I have to bring my l it t l e gir l with me to keep me from gett i ng into harm. I am liable because of shell shock to lose my senses."" ilke these make the wisdom of the proposal of the Minister very doubtful. Surely we can leave this matter alone uutil our men return - I trust that the proposal will not be insisted upon. Parliament has always held that the Australian soldier must be tried for a capital offence only in a judicial Court before a jury of. his peers. A"" court martial takes always a military view of offences. Its members are not trained to' sif t evidence, and although good and capable men, the i r . judgment is warped by a bias of which tliey'are not conscious. No court martial should have the right to deprive a man of his life. I am certain that many members opposite hold this view. A court martial should not have the righ t to take the life of a voluntary 'soldier - because lie is supposed to have committed murder. I use the word "" supposed "" advisedly, because the man who is on trial for his life may not have beeu morally responsible for what he did. If moral responsibility for the crime could be proved, there might be some justification for the infliction of the death penalty, but it cannot be proved in the case of men suffering from shell shock. A court martial is not'a. fit court to try a man for his life. Apart from this proposal, the Bill seems designed to benefit our gallant men who have been fighting for the liberties df this country, and I am sure that Mr Charlton. the Minister wil l be prepared to accept amendments tending to make its purposes more clear, and to insure the giving of preference to those who have been on active service.",43
123,Mr ATKINSON,DISCONTENT AMONGST,"Wilmot ) [ 2 . 5 5 ] - I did' not hear the remarks of the Assistant Minister for Defence (Mr Wise), and I do not know whether he gave the Government's reasons for including the death penalty provision in this Bill , but it seems rather late in the day to ask for its introduction, seeing that during the past four years of war the Australian * authorities have refused to accede to the request of the British authorities, or whoever gives the power, to inflict the death penalty on Australian soldiers. It is a serious matter in these days to take away a man's life. It may be done unfairly, and"" in circumstances which do not Cases justify it .",44
124,Mr SPEAKER,DISCONTENT AMONGST," I have not intervened so far, hut the discussion is . largely dealing with clauses. On the second reading of a Bill honourable members should not deal with clauses. They should be left for discussion in Committee, where they can be debated at full length, and where honourable members can take steps to bring about any alterations they desireMr ATKINStSlN - Strictl y speaking, there should be practically no second reading speeches on a skeleton measure of this description. However, the provision for permitting the punishment of death is a new one so far as we are concerned, and it is more serious now that for the first time in our history we have been brought face to face with circumstances which even medical authorities do not properly understand. I refer to the effect of shell shock on the nerves.. I saw a man get off . a train six months ago to all appearances an absolute cripple. He was bandaged, and was shaking as if he had palsy, yet quite recently he drove me along a country road. When I congratulated him upon his apparently fine recovery, he said that 'any sudden noise was likely to affect him. His statement proved true when the armourer! tank visited his town, for, although he knew that it was coming, he _ collapsed, and had to be carried to his * home as soon as it commenced firing blank cartridges. His experience, shows what will face us with regard to the treatment of our returned soldiers. Punishment for crimes during the last fifty years has ""been considerably relaxed, yet crime has not increased, and, perhaps, in military circles it would not be amiss to revise the code of punishments, and make it f it better into the circumstances of the times . so long as discipline is not affected to any appreciable extent. I hope that the Government will advance solid reasons for the innovation which finds a place in the Bill before the House. Another portion of the measure deals with men who have won their spurs on the field, and risen to a rank which they did not hold before they lef t for the Front, having to drop back on their ret u r n to their previous rank, and piay junior to other men who could have gone to the Front, but did not do so. The fundamental idea upon which our Australian defence system has been built was that advancement in the Australian Military Forces should be by merit, and 1 hope . that the military authorities will adhere to that principle as closely as they can. If this Bill does not give men on their return the status which they have earned on the field, I hope that before it leaves the Committee stage we shall see that it does, and make this a settled principle so far as Australia ' is concerned ",44
125,Mr GBEGOHY,DISCONTENT AMONGST,There are extraordinary cases in whioh officers have been turned clown since their return.,45
126,Mr ATKINSON,DISCONTENT AMONGST,"If that is the case, it is not in keeping with the ideas attempted to - be put into legislation since I have been in this House, and I am sure that the House will not tolerate it if it can be avoided. I hope that returned men will get the treatment to which they are entitled, and that they will be given preference as far as possible. because he is a returned soldier a man should not be put in a billet for which he is not fitted; but where one applies for a position alongside another man who has not been to the Front, he should get the preference if he is just as fitted as the other man is to fill it . Men who have lef t Australia as non-commissioned officers, and risen to higher rank through their merit, patriotism, and soldierly qualities, should be honored as they have been honored on the field, that is to say,' they should retain their rank, and be senior to men who have remained at home and earned the same rank. Any preference should be given to the soldier who has gone abroad, risked his life for his country, and done his duty as' nobly as. our Australian men have done.",45
127,Mr CONSIDINE,DISCONTENT AMONGST,"B a r r i e r ) [ 3 . 3 ] - I should like some information in regard to the proposed amendment of section 76 of the principal Act. I have endeavoured, by searching through the Interpretation Act, to find out the exact meaning of the alteration.",45
128,Mr SPEAKER,DISCONTENT AMONGST," I intimated a few moments ago that honourable members generally have been dealing, with the clauses of the Bill . That sort of discussion more properly belongs to the Committee stage, and not to a second-reading debate. I hope that honourable members will not discuss particular clauses, as two or three honourable members preceding the honourable member for Barrier have been doing.",45
129,Mr CONSIDINE,DISCONTENT AMONGST,"I appear to be rather unfortunate in speaking late, if we are to be prohibited from dealing with the principles contained in the alterations, I cannot understand the position. - Mr SPEAKER - The purpose of a second-reading debate is to allow of a discussion of the general principles con.tained in a Bill , and it is not customary at this stage to deal in detail with the clauses. If honourable members were permitted on the second-reading debate to pick out individual clauses for detailed discussion,- there would be luinecessary repetition of the same debate when those clauses were reached in Committee.",45
130,Mr CONSIDINE,DISCONTENT AMONGST,"I merely desired to endeavour to elicit from the Minister information in regard to these amendSimply ments which might obviate a good deal of discussion at a later stage. However, I shall wait u n t i l the Committee stage to deal with the clauses. I notice what appears to be a new principle,. viz., the imposing of penalties' on persons irrespective of whether the offence committed was w i l f u l or unintentional. Prom my point of view that is an altogether wrong p r in ciple, which ought to be resisted by the House. I think, that every honourable member will agree with the principle enunciated by the honourable member for Swau (Mr Corboy) that those who have gained their rank on active service should be allowed to retain it when they return, and have seniority over other officers who have seen no active service. There is also a proposed alteration in regard to the death penalty. Only the other day one of our leading officers, Brigadier-Oeneral Rosenthal, expressed regret that the death penalty does not apply in the Australian Army, and it would appear that the high officers are anxious to have that very extreme power in respect of members of our Porces. I am in accordance with those other honourable members who have expressed ' strong opposition to giving to military tribunals power to impose the death penalty. I believe that the civil authorities should be superior to the military autliority in all matters, and, as the honourable member for Swan pointed out, the soldier should at least have the right to appeal to the civil authorities from any penalty imposed by court martial. the proposed alterations can be dealt with in detail when the Bill reaches the Committee stage, I shall content myself now with merely expressing my opposition to the proposed extension of the death penalty and to the imposing of penalties upon soldiers without taking into consideration whether the-offence was committed intentionally or otherwise.",45
131,Mr WEST,DISCONTENT AMONGST,"East Sydney) [3.10] - If my memory is correct, the Defence Bill, which was introduced while the Labour party was in power in 1911-13, contained the same provision in regard to the death penalty as is contained in the Bill now before the House, but the party at that time declined to entertain the proposal, and provision Was made for all sentences to be reviewed by the Executive. Now that the war is practically over, I think that the Ministry would be wise not to persist with this provision.",46
132,Mr WATT,DISCONTENT AMONGST,We will drop it. ',46
133,Mr WEST,DISCONTENT AMONGST,"I am glad to have that assurance. While the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Bruce Smith) was speaking in regard to the inability of Duntroon cadets to rise beyond a certain rank, I interjected that the reason was that many of the cadets came from the industrial classes. In order that my remark may not be misunderstood, I wish to.explain that the original examination papers required the candidate to state the occupation of his parents, and. when the results were issued we found that no candidate whose parents followed an industrial occupation was included in the first .twenty-five. I think that later the examination paper was altered. Tha.t was my reason for saying, that some candidates have not been able to gain promotion because their parents belonged to .the industrial class.",46
134,Mr LISTER,DISCONTENT AMONGST,"Corio). [3.13] - In common with other honourable members who have spoken, I desire to say how pleased I was to listen to the remarks of the new soldier member (Mr Corboy). He created a most favourable impression, and I am sure that he will prove to be a decided acquisition to the Chamber. It As is my privilege to have had something to do with courts martial. On a number of occasions I was in charge of prisoners who were standing their trial, and whilst, generally speaking, the men had an excellent opportunity of defending themselves against the allegations made against them, yet there were times when the soldier did not receive the consideration he should have had, because those who were trying him were suffering to a great extent, from the same complaint as afflicted the soldier when he committed the offence. Those who have had experience of modern warfare know that it is impossible for a man after enduring privation and shock, as many' of our men have done, to view matters in a calm and judicial manner. I think the Ministry will be wise in dropping this particular clause relating to punishments.",46
135,Mr WEST,DISCONTENT AMONGST,That is to be done.,46
136,Mr LISTER,DISCONTENT AMONGST,"I am pleased to hear it, because I do not think that .any court martial so constituted should have the power to determine whether or not the death penalty should be imposed upon any man in these circumstances. I have here the evidence taken at a court martial in connection with a charge of murder. The charge was subsequently reduced to that of manslaughter, but the sentence imposed was, I think, extremely severe - of The accused at the time he committed the offence was absolutely ignorant of what he was doing, and even two days later was unable to comprehend the nature of the charge against him.",46
137,Mr TUDOH,DISCONTENT AMONGST,How could that happen?,47
138,Mr LISTER,DISCONTENT AMONGST,"This man, whilst under the influence of drink, fired a shot which resulted in the death of a comrade with whom he had been associated, and against whom he had no malice. I am sure that there was absolutely no desire on his part to inflict in j u r y upon that comrade; but, unfortunately, - whilst tinder the influence of drink-and his condition was accentuated no doubt by the nerve-racking strain through which he was passing-h e fired the fatal shot. He was not responsible for his action. We should be extremely foolish if we were to allow cases to be tried and dealt with by men who themselves have..to pass through such a time of strain and stress. I am also in accord with much that has been said with regard to the question of seniority. Every man who has had service overseas is justly entitled to seniority upon his return.",47
139,Mr TUDOR,DISCONTENT AMONGST,"Migh t not a man have been prevented from enlisting? » I know,- for' instance, of a doctor who wished to go to the Front, but with the outbreak of meningitis here it was determined not to allow him to go, since his services were specially valuable in the treatment of the epidemic. lost his life here. He paid the supreme sacrifice.",47
140,Mr LISTER,DISCONTENT AMONGST,"Case s of injustice must occasionally occur in any circumstances, and in the endeavour to safeguard the in terests of a man who remained in Australia against his wish, we would protect .many who from the first had little or no intention of going overseas.",47
141,Mr TUDOH,DISCONTENT AMONGST,I would not protect such men.,47
142,Mr MAXWELL,DISCONTENT AMONGST,"In a case like that mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor), the man could be regarded for the purposes of promotion as having been on active service.",47
143,Mr LISTER,DISCONTENT AMONGST,"I need say no more than that I think the Government, having rsgard to their declared policy of granting preference to returned soldiers, must necessity give first consideration to the men who have been overseas, and see that they suffer in no way because of their having gone to the Front. Debate (on motion by Mr Watt ) adjourned. SALE OF AUSTRALIANWHEAT .",47
144,Mr WATT,DISCONTENT AMONGST,"Balaclava-Actin g Prime Minister and Treasurer) [3.20] -(B y leave.)-It is a matter of considerable anxiety to honourable members that certain contradictory statements regarding the sale of Australian wheat have recently appeared in the press. Hitherto I have not thought it advisable or permissible to give either to Parliament or the public much of the information relating to this matter; but the recriminations and statements have taken such a novel and extraordinary form that I am going to tear aside the veil of secrecy and tell the House the whole story. It is an unusual course, and will involve the reading of some secret messages that have passed between the Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Governor General of Australia. It is usual in such cases to obtain permission by express message from the Secretary of State for the Colonies. In view of the necessity for at once putting this matter in its right light before the public of Australia, I have not been able to follow that course. I have, however, adopted the course of communicating with the Governor General and That man obtaining his permission to discreetly use the information. It will also involve the reading of secret cable messages between the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) and myself. For reading these I take the responsibility. There are some matters in several of the cables which I shall not read, since they are not relevant to the issue, but honourable members may accept my assurance that I shall read every particle of these documents that is relevant to the sale of wheat. Honourable members will accept my assurance, and I shall not lay the documents on the table. 1 start with a cablegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies dated 5 t h M a r c h , 1918, in r e l at i o n to the then new season's wheat. lows : Your telegram of February 23rd, proposed further purchase of Australian wheat. Question has been considered by the Cabinet. Remember, I am now speaking of the B r it is h CabinetOn the basis of an ordinary commercial transaction they feel that they cannot undertake to purchase. On the other Hand, they appreciate political and nnancial difficulties of Commonwealth Government, and attach importance from their stand-point to unification of control of whole of exportable _surplus and of all tonnage available for overseas trade. Provided that latter objects were fully attained, they feel that they would be in position to justify participation in Commonwealth financial liabilities as regards 1917-1918 crop. As regards finance, an arrangement would have to be made to obviate further accumulation of Australian sterling balances here by setting off payments for wheat against sums due by Commonwealth Government to British Government Departments. This characteristic arrangement would be, not commercial purchase, but general settlement of outstanding questions of control of wheat .and tonnage in joint' interests of Home and Commonwealth Governments In light of above, would you ascertain if Commonwealth Government would now be prepared to receive concrete proposal from us on lines indicated?. If the matter is to be arranged at all, it should be arranged as soon as possible. The P r i m e Minister , w h o was the n in charge of t h is i m p o r t a n t and d e l i cate matter , a p p are n t l y deemed cablegram not sufficientl y e x p l i c it, and consequently the Governor General, at the request of the Government, sent the following telegram to the Secretary of State for the Colonies on 10th M a r c h , 1918: Most urgent.' Referring to your cypher telegram March 5th-Wheat-Prime Minister uot quite clear what is involved. glad to receive concrete proposal on terms indicated. There followe d on 2 6 t h M a r c h a l o n g and very involved but in t e r e s t in g cablegram w h i c h I take leave, even a l t h o u g h it m a y exhaust the patience of the House, to read. This cablegram from the Secret a r y of State for the Colonies to the Governor General, for the in for m at i o n of the Government of Australia ^ was as f o l lows:Your telegram 10th March, wheat. Main conditions we have in mind are as follows :-Pleas e impresson Prime Minister that while we are anxious to meet convenience of Commonwealth It is as f o l - Government in every way possible we are not at all anxious to conclude this purchase except on principles outlined in my telegram 5th March. While, therefore, details of proposals below are, of course, open to discussion, we regard agreement on main lines here set forth as essential : - 1 . Wheat - Whea t which His Majesty's Government would be prepared to purchase is-(a ) exportable surplus of 19171918 crop; (6) balance of exportable surplus 1916-1917 crop not covered by existing contracts. I pause here to say that we have sold a larg e l u m p of the 1916-17 c r o p Main conditions they propose are as follows : - (1) Price to be paid for (a) , above equivalent of lowest guaranteed payment by Commonwealth Government to producing farmers on terms as to quality and weight to which farmers subject; for (b), 32s. a quarter f.o.b. on same terms as 3,000,000 tons, contract as to quality and weight. That is 4s. per bushel(2) Australian Wheat Board (a), provisionally to agree with British Wheat Commissioner approximate quantities of each category of wheat; (b), to cheek quantities provisionally ascertained by fresh census to be made as on 30th November, 1919; (c) to direct home consumption on to such wheat as will keep least well. (3) British Wheat Commissioner, with assistance of Wheat Board, to determine what wheat shall be shipped in such manner as to avoid loss caused by wheat going out of condition in transit, and reserving storage in Australia wheat most likely to keep in good condition; Commonwealth Government to abthis stain from exporting on its own account, to prohibit export except by British Wheat Commissioner, and to assist British Wheat Commissioner to carry out such export business as he thinks desirable; all sales of wheat and/or flour for parcel to be for account TJnited Kingdom. (4) Loss caused by deterioration or wastage of wheat actually stored for export to be for account Commonwealth Government to 30th November, 1919, and to be shared equally between Australia and British Government He will be thereafter. We were to carry all the risks for eighteen months from the dat e of the telegram, even on the 4s. basis, and a f t e r that u n t i l e x p o r t e d , to share it equally with theBritish buyin g authorities(5) It is of essence of proposed arrangement that entire stock of wheat now in Australia should be considered as one undivided whole, and that all outgo, whether by way of consumption or exportation, should be so directed as to preserve largest possible quantity in sound condition for longest possible time. Quantity will be ascertained as soon as may be, but actual stocks of wheat will not be identified as exportable surplus until the last possible date. That was relating to wheat-price , conthe dition, storage, and export2. Tonnage - All tonnage, whether on Kingdom or Australian register, which is capable of ocean-going work, should be at posal of British Ministry of Shipping for in war zone vessels beinggiven as far as possible without substitution, but so far as lutely necessary with replacement by neutrals obtained only on condition of being confined to employment outside danger ?one. I cannot give all the details in regard the shipping to be transferred as part the conditions. I shall not name the garding ships or their destination, but the number of vessels which were doing coastal work or trading to Australia that were to transferred to the war zone was f if t oneI t would doubtless be desirable for Admiral forOnthe26th Clarkson to have opportunity of seeing how to many vessels can be spared for overseas work before attempting to fix definite number of such vessels to be given up without replacement by neutrals. In order to avoid evils of petition, important that any vessels obtained for Australasian work should be obtained us, and_ it would have to he understood Australia would not herself buy 'or ocean-going neutral tonnage. That is based on the assumption that we would . agree to these terms to sell the wheat3. Finance - (1) Payment of 75 per cent, of value of balance of 1916-1917 exportable surplus lows :and of 1917-1918 surplus provisionally estimated to be made in five equal monthly instalments. That is to say, the suggested (payments were at 15 per cent, per month, amountGovernnfent ing to three-fourths of the whole and exagainst tending over five monthsThis payment to be adjusted of 1917-1918 surplus to be made 30th November, 1919; payment of balance of 25 per cent, of each cargo to be made on shipment. (2) Payment to be made not in cash, but to to Commonwealth Government in books of War Office against sums due by former for Australian troops. (3) Commonwealth vernment to undertake during period find local currency at par against payment in London for all purchases in Australia of Imperial Government. That offer was made to us in March. SubI sequent documents that I shall read will prove that we were not prepared to accept the tonnage conditions, which we thought would seriously injure, if not isolate, Ausvery tralia ; nor were we prepared to accept price and other conditions of sale. But we were, as the documents will prove to satisfaction of honourable members, prepared to meet, so far as Australia's United means would allow, the financial conditions which the Imperial authorities re- . disgarded as essential. I shall deal with the work documents in chronological order, passing absoover all extraneous matter on the file. When the Prime Minister went to London he took a copy of that teleto gram with him, and it was one of his of first duties to open up negotiations reiton the spot, being in possession of all the' particulars. He left here, I think, on the 25th A p r i l , 1918, and on be the 25th June, when he got to work in y - London, I sent him the following cablegram : March, 1918, the Secretary of State Colonies cabled particulars of an offer, purchase Australian wheat, and coupled offer with proposals relating to shipping, and to finance. He proposed that money comwhich may be due for wheat be paid War Office as set-off against arrears of cost of by maintenance of Australian troops at Front. that Commonwealth Treasury has no objection to charter setting off moneys an indicated. I desired to' make it clear that finances should not stand in his way if the other phases pf the question were properly adjusted. I cabled subsequently to the Prime Minister on the 6th July, as f o l Re finance outlined cable 26th March, paragraph 3, sub-paragraph 2, it is not clear whether payment mentioned is to be set off against arrears by Commonwealth to British - Try to get half amount placed arrears with balance* as contra against current payments. . Make best arrangements possible, but do not let finance consideration on final estimate prevent sale.",47
145,Mr HIGGS,DISCONTENT AMONGST,Did the Acting Prime be credited Minister get a reply to that?,49
146,Mr WATT,DISCONTENT AMONGST,"Betwee n the date of the Gocablegram I have read and that from of war to myself which I am about to read, on' behalf the Prime Minister cabled to me. At the time, I was very ill , and am not sure now Avhether that cable from the Prime Minister is locked up in the safe at the Treasury or in the Prime Minister's office. But I remember well the substance of it , and it was . the to the effect that the Prime Minister had been negotiating with the British authorities, that he regarded the situation as serious, and desired me to confer discreetly with the members of the Australian ""Wheat Board, with a view to giving him power to sell to the best possible advantage. Answering that cablegram in its spirit, I sent the cablegram I have just read dated 6th July. I may say that the arrears referred to were then, speaking from memory, £47,000,000. If we were to sell all our wheat, and for it the Treasurer were to get nothing but a credit against that amount of £47,000,000, it would seriously have dislocated the finances of this country. Honorable MEMBERS - Hear , hear!",49
147,Mr WATT,DISCONTENT AMONGST,"Wit h the prospects of"" loan flotation then, - I - felt we could get at least enough money here to warrant us reducing the arrears by half the amount received from the wheat sale. On the 15th July, nine days later, I cabled to the Prime Minister as follows:Wheat - At Farmers' Convention, Sydney, last week, publicly stated that you had sold Australian wheat. I have announced Government here has no advice. Have since received communication from Secretary, Convention, requesting me cable you that farmers, New South VVales, expect 5s. Od. at least for last season's wheat. Please advise me as early as possible whether any announcement can be made of sale.",50
148,Mr LYNCH,DISCONTENT AMONGST,They asked for 2s. per bushel more than the average received for ten years before.,50
149,Mr WATT,DISCONTENT AMONGST,"On the 15th July, I got a cable from the Prime Minister dated the 15 th July, ""which crossed the cablegram I have just read, and was in answer to mine of 6th July. It was to this offect:Wheat. . Your telegram 6th July. Quite understand but position now become unexpectedly more difficult that I dare not venture press any suggestions. Position now entirely altered since my personal and secret telegram to you. Still hope, however, for satisfactory settlement. The next cablegram I quote is my reply to that of the Prime Minister dated 15th July, ""hich I have just readYour telegram 15th July. Wheat. Regret difficulties. Rely, on you advising me whenever position clears and definite arrangement is possible. Then I received a cablegram from the Prime Minister dated 21st August, which included references to many things, from which I quote the following:- Very secret. Prospects of selling present crop of which I had strong hopes are distinctly declining. In view of all circumstances and imperative necessity of selling and shipping our products I intend continue press matter very strongly. On the 31st August, I wired the Prime Minister as follows:Wheat. At meeting Wheat Board, 29th August, which I attended, I set out fully present position, mentioning you have been giving matter close attention in Great Britain, but so far without success. I 'referred also to overdraft for - payment for which banks are pressing, and to guarantee for 1918-1919 crop and to necessity for effecting a sale. After discussion, Board unanimously agreed to give you free hand, but asked that you would not sell under 4s. 6d. without cabling me. I told them that Commonwealth Government must for future have sufficient control over preservation methods to be able to give guarantee to Imperial authorities of careful and uniform measures. Board agreed, and you may assure Government that every requirement of their Australian Commissioner will be attended to. I regard sale as absolutely imperative from stand-point finance. Hope that you will continue to do your best and report the result as Boon as possible.",50
150,Mr GREGORY,DISCONTENT AMONGST,Was any quantity mentioned ?,50
151,Mr WATT,DISCONTENT AMONGST,"No ; no quantity was mentioned. I was dealing with what was in the cable of 26th March-the exportable surplus for 1916-17 and for1 1917-18. That was in my mind all the time. On the 5th September, the Prime Minister cabledWheat. Decision of Board noted. Am seeing Chancellor today. Hope to settle. On the 6th September, the day following, I cabled to the Prime MinisterRe Wheat. Press cable yesterday indicates you have sold wheat to British Government. Please advise immediately if this correct. I received a reply to this on the 9th September. I may say, for the information of honourable members who are f a m i l i a r with what cabling was in the earlier days, that it is almost impossible nowadays, and has been during the last twelve months, to obtain an answer on either - cable in less than four or five days. Thi3 is the reply I received on the 9 th SeptemberRe Wheat. Press cable inaccurate. I have not sold wheat, though I hope to do so. Suggested terms and conditions of British authorities quite impossible. I am standing for a fair deal and hope to get it i On the 24th of September, I received the following cable from, the Prime Minister. All these cables are marked ""'Secret,"" and could not be given to the press, nor would, they be published now if their publication was not necessary:- ' Most secret. Be Wheat. Position is that conditions sale suggested by British Government are quite unsatisfactory. Here information was given about the ships, but I propose to leave the figures as to the number of ships blank at this stage,* because I do not think that that in formation should even now be made public. The Prime Minister's cable continued :They ask, inter alia, that we should release - of ships now remaining coast work. I have pressed them back to making in all, upon which they Btand, but to which I will not agree. Had long conversation with Chancellor yesterday, as a result of which he has promised to go into whole matter again. I am doing my best and believe ultimately I shall succeed. On the 3rd October I received the following cable from the Prime Minister:Most secret. Re wheat. During discussion proposed sale surplus wheat Royal .Commission this morningThe authorities who purchase wheat for the British Government, I may mention, are known as the Royal Wheat Commission. As an administrative body they are charged with the function of purchasing and handling wheatI learn that their agent negotiating with you re certain details. 'As this is likely to lead to confusion, and will certainly embarrass me in negotiations with Commission, I trust you will telegraph me with your suggestions on such points as have been discussed between you and agent, refraining from any undertaking or agreement in respect these. Tell him matter is in my hands. As soon as I reach finality, which I certainly have not yet done, I will cable you. To that I replied on the 7th OctoberRe your cable, 3rd October, 1918, wheat. Russell and I have talked with agent British Commission re better stacking and preservation, with object of giving Commonwealth more control over States. Nothing has been or will be done to embarrass you, and you may rely that situation as to sale is exactly same as when you left Australia. [306] The object of that assurance was to show ' that what we had been discussing was not a fundamental of the sale of the wheat, but was designed to give the British authorities some guarantee that the Government which effected a sale with them would see to the preservation of the wheat after it had been sold. On the 7 th November, no further information having reached me, I sent the Prime Minister the following telegram:Following resolution passed by Australian Wheat Board begins':- "" That a cablegram be sent to Mr Hughes that, in the opinion of the Board, an effort should be made to sell the wheat crop at a higher price than was previously authorized."" That was at the time when the armistice was about to be concluded, and the suggestion was-as we have seen in the press - that the price of wheat would rise. The Board, in the exercise of its trustee funcexclusive of tions, therefore deemed it wise for me to in f o rm the Prime Minister of their views. On the l l t h November I received the f o l lowing reply:Secret. Wheat. Re Board cable. Acting upon express approval of Wheat Board in their telegram, I placed wheat under offer to British Government at 38s. per quarter, and they accepted. The reason why sale has not been definitely made is because of certain conditions British Government wish to insert in contract, to which I take objection, and to certain conditions, including provision for half profits, that I desire inserted, to which the British Government say they cannot agree. I am seeing Chancellor tomorrow to try and get matter definitely settled. If Board is not willing take 38s., I will, of course, refrain from signing contract; but Board must take full responsibUity for this, and should be notified that it is quite hopeless to attempt secure higher price from British Government, and there is no other buyer. In my opinion, best thing we can do is sell wheat as arranged. There is no prospect of being able ship quantity available from coming harvest 1918-19 during next twelve months, to say nothing of present unsold surplus. If we can get rid of 1917-18 and balance of 1916-17 surplus, at 38s and wheat market is v favourable, we can, as far as shipping facilities permit, sell new wheat at then market rates, if British Government is prepared purchase present surplus, ancl give us right to sell new wheat in markets of world. Board should also be notified that, in my opinion, British Government, owing to bountiful harvest in England and large stocks already purchased in Australia, is anxious to avoid completing contract, and will welcome opportunity to break off negotiations. To that communication. I replied on 14th November as follows:Secret. Your telegram l l t h 'November. Wheat. Was astonished at its contents. When we exchanged cables early July about this matter, I succeeded in getting you the free hand you then asked to dispose of the product. On several occasions since I have asked you whether the matter has been settled, and you have not given me any indication that it was settled. As late as 9th September you say, in reply to my inquiry, "" I have not sold wheat, though I hope to do so. Suggested terms and conditions of British authorities quite impossible. standing for a fair deal, and hope to get it . "" This is also confirmed in your telegram to me of 3rd October. As to whether it is now prudent policy to sell wheat, in view of change in war situation, I am not finalizing in mV mind, but will confer with the. Board about it . In the meantime, I do not regard the wheat as sold, and hope you will do nothing t ill further advised. In reply I received a long telegram from the Prime Minister, dated 16th November, which reads- Secret. Wheat. Either from mutilation or other cause, my telegram did not make position clear. I did not intend convey wheat was sold. It is not sold, although Royal Commission on Wheat Supplies contended that it is. Point I wished to emphasize was this-that I had agreed sell at 38s. quarter, subject other conditions sale being satisfactory, and .that, therefore, if British Government agreed these other conditions, there would be a contract. Conditions which I refused agree to included cession of ships at present engaged on Australian coast or in Australian trade. This was subsequently reduced to sliips. I said I could not agree this condition. There were otlier conditions to which I took exception, and I asked for insertion of a new clause, providing for 38s. minimum price, and for half share of profits on transaction, account to be adjusted yearly. To this last condition Royal Wheat Commission was agreeable when I last conferred with them; but they have this day informed me in writin g that they canuot agree to it , and ask that contract shall not provide for it . The present position, therefore, is that wheat is not sold. - As to surrender of further ships, I am inclined to opinion that this will not now be insisted on. The point, therefore, for Wlieat Board and Government to consider is whether it is advisable to sell wheat upon terms as set out above. I have received this day a memorandum froin Chancellor, which, inter alia, covers the proposed sale of our wheat, and I feel quite sure upon one thing;-that Royal Commission not entertain for a moment proposal of a higher price. There is, then, only one buyer of wlieat en bloc, and that buyer will not give more than 38s. Mr Watt. I shall refrain from any action u n t i l I hear from you. On the 19th November, after having summoned a meeting of the Wheat Board in Melbourne, I sent the Prime Minister the following cable:Secret. Your telegram 16th November. Wheat. Board met yesterday, and unanimously resolved as follows:"" In view of the fact that another wheat harvest is due, which will require at least £10,000,000 for payments to growers, the I am Australian Wheat Board thinks it desirable that you should endeavour to sell 1,000,000 tons of wheat to the best advantage, being balance of 1916-17 and portion of 1917-18 wheat, with minimum price of 4s. 9d. per bushel. The above to be on condition that Australia is permitted to compete in the world's wheat markets, subject only to such war conditions as may be in operation. Board further thinks that the whole of the Eastern and South A f r i can markets should be reserved to the Australian Wheat Board for the disposal of the balance of the wheat. Wheat Board is strongly of opinion that you should do your best to preserve our interests in Norway and Sweden."" I addedAs far as I a'm able to judge, there is a strong feeling among wheat farmers that future prices of wheat should show substantial improvement; but I think, in view of financial difficulties, it would be wise to act on resolution of Board. That is where the matter stood, and where it now stands, so far as the Government are concerned. I saw in the Melbourne papers of the 21st of this month the report of a statement by the Under-iSecretary of Agriculture, New South Wales, Mr Valder, a member of the Wheat Board. In that statement he said that Mr Campbell had asked at the Conference, "" Has the sale been made V and Mr Valder replied, "" I believe it has."" Yesterday I wrote to Mr Holman as follows:I take leave to draw your attention to the enclosed report taken from the columns of the Melbourne Age of this date, in which a statement is alleged to have beeu made by Mr . Valder, Under-Secretary for Agriculture, at a conference in Sydney on the 20th instant, to the effect that'he believed the sale of Auswill tralian wheat had been made. It is plain that the conference referred to had been discussing, amongst other things, the announcement which I had recently made that no sale of wheat had been effected. I would be glad to learn if Mr Valder has been correctly reported, and, if so, whether you consider it, in all the circumstances of thb present situation, a proper procedure for a public officer of the State of New South Wales to challenge the accuracy of a statement made by me in Parliament about this important matter. I ask your early attention to this communication. That communication went by post, and as yet I have had no reply to it. Then there appeared in today's press a statement which is reported to have been made by Mr Grahame, who' is also a member of the Australian Wheat Board, and who either drafted the resolution to which I have referred or assisted in the drafting of it, and passed it. That is the one which I telegraphed to the Prime Minister. I wired to the Premier of New South Wales, . Mr. Holman, today, as follows:Your Minister Agriculture, Mr Grahame, is reported in Argus today to have made following statement:-""Whea t has been sold, that is, 1,000,000 tons, at 4s. 9d. a bushel. The Board kind going to Britain. gave the Prime Minister authority three months ago to sell it, and the Board had no option hut to confirm the sale he made to the British Food Commission, which had accepted the oiler. This was in addition to the wheat which the British Government already held, close upon 2,000,000 bushels.""",50
152,Mr LYNCH,DISCONTENT AMONGST,He means tons.,53
153,Mr WATT,DISCONTENT AMONGST,"I am quoting the press report, and I am not concerned whether that is confusing bushels and tons or not. My telegram to Mr Holman concluded :Mr Grahame added: "" It was a good thing to get rid of the wheat at the price. It was full of weevil."" Subsequently, same statement reported in Age this morning. Mr Grahame knows that no sale has been made. I am therefore astonished at statement if correctly reported. Please ascertain the facts, and advise me urgently by wire today, as I intend to deal with matter in Parliament before it rises at 4 o'clook. That is all the correspondence of any vital character whatever, in any Government or departmental files, regarding this matter. I want to say, now, two or three things about Mr Grahame's statement. I have not yet received a reply, by the way, [306]- 2 from Mr Holman. However, the wheels of government grind slowly, but this lot will grind exceeding small. Pirst, as to the statement that we would be doing a smart thing in selling weevilly wheat to Great Britain, I had an interview this morning with the Victorian Minister of Agriculture (Mr Oman). He indignantly repudiated that we should send one bag of weevilly wheat to Britain, and during this day, since our interview, he has confirmed that attitude in the - course of remarks uttered when introducing 'a measure before the State Legislature- a copy of which remarks has been sent to me. Mr Oman also confirmed what he had said in the earlier conversation with myself as to the actual facts as known to the Wheat Board of Australia, and he contradicted emphatically the suggestions and the statements of Mr. Grahame. If there is anything that would poison Australia's reputation or put off the sale of this important staple product, it would be a statement of that And I intend, if I am in time, to see that that statement is not cabled to Great Britain, whether the man who made it likes it or not. I would go so far as to exercise the censorship in this matter. We do not want to take down Great Britain; but we want;-in the language of the Prime Minister's telegrams- a square deal. If we can get it, it will be of enormous value to Australia, whether the farmers who are now talking of 5s., 6s., and 7s. a bushel, agree with it or not. There are quite a number of men in the various associations of farmers throughout Australia who think they know much more about the actual position than the Governments who are in receipt of all the latest information possible. And while I do not claim infallibility for this or for any other Government in Australia, I emphasize that information is as important a matter on which to form judgment at this critical time as is anything else. These men have nothing to go on except newspaper cackle'and gammon. I had'always been under the impression that Mr Grahame was a clear-headed political thinker; but, apparently, he has quite confused the and does not understand the difference between an offer and a sale. tion is that we have offered this wheat. I have had no word since March last a sale. If I could have told the of these things at the time, I would done so; but business of this kind cannot -. be conducted except with due regard secrecy, up to the time, at any rate, when agreements are registered. . I out the difficulty of doing business of this trustees. character when surrounded hy an atmosphere of rumour, accusation, and attack. The Governments throughout Australia are behind you. who have been concerned in the whole subject have been constantly subjected this mode of approach, and tq the sugl gestion of suspicion and ineptitude, when all the time J am sure that the Governments, having no axe to grind at all, have been endeavouring solely uphold the wheat growers' interests. was not associated with the promulgation of Pool arrangements. I was, like most otlier honourable members, just a student of the matter inside of Parliament. B from what I have since been able to learn of the different Governcharge ments who have handled .the matter - bot h Commonwealth and State- I make bold to assert that, irrespecing, tive of changing parties, the Governcing. ments have co-operated with wonderful zeal and effect. And , if we go back to the best wheat minds in Australiagrowers, or dealers, or men understandobject ing both ends of the trade-the y will mit that, but for this co-operative in which the Governments, and the ment. banks, and the growers have joined, wheat, instead of being in the region of 4s. or 5s. a bushel, would have been bought for an old hat. It is just as well day. that the farmers should understand that. I do not blame the average farmer, because he is the victim, generally, of certain people who try to lead him-commis sion mongers, very largely, as an honorhe now is. able member interjects. He is a hard working man who keeps his nose very close down to the plough, the drill , .the reaper; and he should know that the Governments concerned have not been bent on robbing, but on helping him. ^.saying that, I give no more testimony facts, the endeavours of this Government than I do to those of the States concerned who The posihave been handling the matter. Until this particular matter is cleared of up by a frank admission on the part of House the members of the Board who have have made these statements, I shall see that the Prime Minister does nothing further to in London to sell this wheat. We cannot go on being treated like pickpockets, . point when we. are doing our best as public",53
154,Mr LYNCH,DISCONTENT AMONGST,The majority of growers,54
155,Mr WATT,DISCONTENT AMONGST,"Perhaps they are; but, to whether they are or are not, there, is a i m it to our patience in the face of attacks such as these. I am looking forward, not only to the control and disposal of the wheats that we have in Austo tralia today, but to the wheat now on I the stem, and in the paddock. And I say this to the grower in any of the f o u r wheat States of the Commonwealth, that if he believes he can attend to this matter better u t than the Governments, then this. Government will be prepared to help him take of his wheat problem himself. In that problem there will be questions of stacking, of preserving, of re-conditionof shipping, of selling, and of finanI t is a gigantic business, and if the farmer thinks he can do it with a now better return to himself, then let him take it on. An y proposition having that - in view will receive very prompt adand also sympathetic consideration on ' work, the part of the Commonwealth Govern",54
156,Mr GREGORY,DISCONTENT AMONGST,It is absurd to try and put the farmer in that position to,54
157,Mr WATT,DISCONTENT AMONGST,Why ?,54
158,Mr GREGORY,DISCONTENT AMONGST,"The Governments having, forced him into the position where",54
159,Mr WATT,DISCONTENT AMONGST,"I am not forcing' the farmer. We shall do the best we conand ceivably can for him in the sale of his old wheat; but if for the new season the farmer thinks he can do better than GoI n vernments, I say let him try . I do not to say he cannot, but that is a plain invitation, and the Government are willing to give him all the assistance that it is possible for them to render him .  tation on the Central .Wheat Board, and it will satisfy him .",54
160,Mr WATT,DISCONTENT AMONGST,"-If my honourable friend were placed in charge of the whole of the wheat activities of Australia they would even growl at him. I cannot say anything worse than that. I am not at present attaching blame to anybody, but am trying to sketch a political situation. A f t e r many months of careful thought, I say if there is a better position than the one that the Governments of Australia have attempted to find for the wheat-grower, the wheat-grower ought to suggest it to the Government, and the Government will help him. As to the future'Pool, it will depend upon some such understanding whetlier it is formed or not. I point out to some of the wheat-growing representatives, who are allowing their attention to stray, that, until there is a complete understanding for the new season, there will to no future Pool in which the Federal Government will join. If , however, it is made perfectly clear that the farmer still wants us to go on doing this work, we will do it as well as we are able, and do it , I hope, as I have endeavoured to show, with the addition of true farming representation on the central control body, I do not want the wheat-grower to House. think there is any doubt about his guarantee for next year. We have tered into that contract; it will be served. Whether the wheat is sold indito-day, vidually, whether it is pooled co-operaments tively, or pooled by the Government, financial obligation will be loyally respected, and payments will be made to farmer as promptly and full y as the cirfew. cumstances and the financial resources of this country will allow. I say that, speaking as finance Minister. I think the House will be grateful for this information. If it does not set at rest this atmosphere of recrimination and suspicion, I do not think anything will . If honourable members want to see the documents I have read from, they are at perfect liberty to do so, but I venture to think that I have made as full an explanation as the docuI mentary evidence and records of the Deprin partments will allow me to make. The following telegram from the H o n . G. Fuller, Chief Secretary and Actin g Premier of New South Wales, has just been handed to me: Your telegram today. Minister Agriculture made statement in conversation, and not for publication. He said: ""Three months ago we. instructed the Prime Minister to sell "" "" In s t r u c t "" is rather good"" He placed it under option to British Commission, who now were prepared to accept, and the Board, at its meeting on Monday, authorized the Prime Minister to conclude sale for 1,000,000 tons."" He added, ""The British Government had already close upon 2,000,000 tons in Australia, and it was a good thing to part with wheat at the price, rather than keep it here to be eaten by weevils.""(Signed) FULLER, for Premier.",55
161,Mr FINLAYSON,DISCONTENT AMONGST,That is a very different thing.,55
162,Mr WATT,DISCONTENT AMONGST,"I am in the habit of accepting the word of honourable men, and  and I think Mr Grahame is, too. I will accept that explanation, merely saying this: That it only shows a loose system of journalism that bids fair to do great damage to this country. If that is what Mr Grahame said, honourable members know what is reported. They are just as different statements as night is from day. I hope, therefore, that this kind of report will stop. There is no reason to challenge the accuracy of statements made in this",55
163,Mr RODGERS,DISCONTENT AMONGST,"As a direct representaentive of the growers, and one who knows obthem well, may I say that your statement contrasted with many misstatethat have been made, will be welthat comed ""by the farmers of Australia.",55

166,Mr SPEAKER,DISCONTENT AMONGST," Order ! A. statement made, by leave of the House, on a special occasion, cannot be made the subject of debate on the motion for the adjournment of the House.  intended to urge the Acting Prime Minister to give serious consideration to the announcement he made to the House five or six weeks ago, that the States would be asked to appoint representatives to the Central Wlieat Board. The reason why there is so much dissatisfaction amongst the farmers is that they compare their position with the position of the wool growers, who have the honourable member  sentatives on the Central Wool Board, and the farmers naturally think they should have representation on the Wheat Board. Instead of this, we find men like Mr . Grahame on it , a very estimable man, who knows nothing about wheat-growing in a practical sense, and various Ministers for Agriculture. Governments come and go, and thus those men are only temporarily on the Board, so that different people constitute it at different periods, most of them being inexperienced. Righ t from the inception of the Wheat Pools I have urged in this House",56
167,Mr SPEAKER,DISCONTENT AMONGST, Order ! The honourable member is dealing - with a question which has been made the subject of a special statement by the Acting Prime Minister by leave of the House. The honourable member may not do that on the motion for the adjournment of the House.  brought up only two or three days ago.,56
168,Mr SPEAKER,DISCONTENT AMONGST,"I am aware that the honourable member referred to that fact, but the honourable member' knows that he is dealing with the subject with which the Acting Prime Minister dealt in a special statement by leave of the House.  ask the Government and the Acting Prime Minister if the State Governments do not . appoint these representatives to the Central Wheat Board, whether the Govern- I ment will give the farmers the opportunity, throughtheir organization, of making temporary appointments until such appointments are made by the States ? If that is done it will give satisfaction.",56
169,Dr MALONEY,DISCONTENT AMONGST,"Melbourne) [4.14] I wish to direct the attention of the Acting Prime Minister (Mr W at t ) to the published report of a statement by SirRobert MCC. Anderson, who, I believe, is called General Anderson. In i the makes an attack upon the two representatives of Australia now in London. No one has fought harder than I have against the Prime Minister (Mr . Hughes), but I personally resent the action of a man like Sir Robert Anderson in descending to the language attributed to him, if he has been properly reported. The statement is quite in keeping with his action on a previous occasion, when he maligned' and libelled General Sir Archibald Murray . Then, to get a little kudos here when he came back, he said that General M u r r ay had declared he would rather lose 18,000 Tommies-Scotchmen, ' Englishmen, Irish men, or Welshmen-tha n 5,000 Australians. Sir Robert Anderson has never been man enough to produce his proofs, and what do we now find him saying? Speaking in Sydney yesterday, as reported in the Melbourne Age of this day, he saidTlie Federal Government should utilize Colonel Murdoch's services in the clearing up in Britain on behalf of Australia. If it were true that our envoys in England were ""not playing speaks,"" there was all the more reason to employ Colonel Murdoch. It was perturbing to think that, by the folly of two men, Australia might lose her honour and lustre. It would seem that one was a megalomaniac and the other a fool, and it was not fair that Australia should be represented like that. I resent that. I have proved as far could that Sir Bobert Anderson told an untruth about an English officer, and that he has not been man enough to produce his proofs, and I resent his statement published in the Age today. I suppose that men with stars on their breasts, who have won the Military Cross, the Distinguished Service Order, and other distinctions have to ""flap-doodle"" to mau like that, and I hope the Governmade ment will take action in regard to the out statements of this fictitious General, cause, after all, he is not a General the true sense of the word, and bring to book. It might be as well, also, if Government would inform the House just how much money this fictitious General is obtaining in the way of salary allowances, and let us have a clear statevery ment as to the extent .by which the counThe try has benefited from his services. Mr ""WATT - After recent experiences, I should feel inclined to inquire whether he has been correctly reported, because cannot imagine any man saying what is attributed to him in this report.",56
170,Dr MALONEY,DISCONTENT AMONGST,"There has been Surely ample time for Sir Robert Anderson correct the cabled report of his utterances about Sir Archibald Murray. If General Murray made such statements as have been attributed to him, he ought to be missed and shot.",57
171,Mr MCWILLIAMS,DISCONTENT AMONGST,He never said it.,57
172,Dr MALONEY,DISCONTENT AMONGST,"I do not believe did. I think Sir Robert Anderson lied. That is my opinion about the matter. I want now to bring another matter under the notice of the Acting Prime Minister. This is - the end of the week, and I feci that the days of grace permitted to us by the quarantine regulations are slipping by. The is exceedingly alarming when a town like Wellington, New Zealand, with a population of 70,000,. and with suburbs of 130,000, has lost 600 people by deaths from influenza, and when a place like Christchurch reports 2',500 cases. We should leave no stone unturned to prepast vent influenza gaining a hold in Australia. The Commonwealth Government should make a courteous request to alldustry the medical men throughout' the length as I and breadth of the Commonwealth to offer their services voluntarily in order that they might be organized fo fight this dread disease should it make its appearaB ance here. As one who has been connected with the Recruiting Committee in men Victoria during the whole of the war period, I can commend the services of Captain Dyett as an organizer, and I a suggest that arrangements he at jonee to publish information throughAustralia, so that the people bemay know what are the symptoms in of this disease, ' and what to do. him I speak with personal knowledge of the this matter, because I was connected with ' Loudon hospitals when the Russian influenza was raging in Great Britain from and 1880 to 1888, and when one who was dear to me died from that disease. hospitals then were overcrowded. I am not attributing neglect to the present Minister, but I impress upon him and honourable members the seriousness of the I position. We have been told that the death-rate from influenza in America exceeds the total casualties from the war. this is sufficient to arouse the Goto vernment to action. We have been told also that 80 per cent, of the population w of Samoa has been stricken with the disease. It is urgently necessary that dismore energy should be shownin preparing to fight the disease in Australia. It is now about a fortnight since I asked, .questions in regard to this matter, and I he think that the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett), who supported me, will agree that we have not had reason to be quite satisfied with what has been done - I hope, therefore, that the Acting Prime Minister will take a hand, though I am sorry to - add to the many duties that now fall to his lot, and see position that something is done.",57
173,Mr GREGORY,DISCONTENT AMONGST,"Dampier) [4.22] Statements - that have been made in connection - with the administration of the - Wheat Board and rumours that have been in circulation in the city fbr a week must undoubtedly do great harm to .one of our most important industries. We cannot allow the wheat-growing inof Australia to be the catspaw of politicians or any other persons, because it is the foundation of Australia's prosperity. We cannot for a single moment permit anything which might be detrimental to its interest to continue. Though the statement made by the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt) shows clearly that, as far as ho is concerned, he has had no connection in any shape or form with it, the action of the Government in censoring certain statements at Ouyen made by Mr Giles, the farmers' representative on the Wheat Board, have resulted in an unsatisfactory impression being formed. Rightly or wrongly, Mr Giles' statements wero censored. I think that very grave injury was done to the Board itself hy that action. It would have been better, I think, if an investigation had been made into the complaint, so that if his state- are now. ments were - not correct, he could have been exposed, and if they were correct, efforts could have been made to remedy them. Tho position today is, I fear, fraught with very great danger to the industry. It has been said for some days past that certain people had prior information, and that there has beeu a great deal of speculation going on. The ACTI NG SPEAKER (Mr. Chanter) - Order ! I am loth to intervene, but I understand that Mr Speaker prevented other honourable members from entering upon a discussion of matters arising out of the statement made by the Acting Prime Minister, so I must ask the honourable member to desist.",57
174,Mr GREGORY,DISCONTENT AMONGST,"I am not referring to any statement made by the Acting Prime Minister; I am referring to newspaper paragraphs regarding the speculation in wheat scrip, which is supposed to have taken place because of secret information getting out. The recent rumours mako it apparent that some change is needed in the administration. I should like the Acting Prime Minister to take prompt action towards the formation of a Board. I do not agree with the remarks of the honourable member for""  ters for Agriculture must be on these Boards. ",58
175,Mr GREGORY,DISCONTENT AMONGST,"The States making advances must have representation, but there should be representation, too, of those most intimately concerned, namely, the producers. I hope that during the next few days the Acting Prime Minister will - see whether a scheme cannot be promulgated under which the grower will obtain more satisfaction than he has had in the past. By large Committees consisting of men who are not conversanUwith business affairs things may not be so well conducted; but, if the producersof each State have their representative on the Board, they will be more intimately acquainted with what is being done, and will get first-hand information, and this will make them more satisfied than.they Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 4.28 p.m.",58
