2,Mr CURTIN,Unknown,"I ask the Acting Leader of the House whether it is a fact that quite recently the Commonwealth Government communicated with, the Go. vernments of the States, suggesting the desirableness of an immediate resumption of migration to some extent, and inviting the States to indicate the number of migrants they would he prepared to accept? Furthermore, does not the communication indicate that the steps which the Commonwealth Government suggested that the States might take were initiated with the. concurrence of the Government of the United Kingdom ?",11
3,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"The subject of assisted migration was informally discussed by a sub-committee of the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers held recently in Adelaide. Members of that committee requested that definite proposals should be sent to the various States for their consideration. Subsequently, the State Premiers were communicated with and the Commonwealth suggested that,- while the time was not yet opportune for the resumption of assisted migration on the scale which existed prior to the depression, a partial restoration to the extent desired by the different State Governments, might be made of the provisions in relation to assisted passages from the United Kingdom.. While the Premiers of Queensland and New South Wales were in London, they had an opportunity to discuss the matter with the Home authorities, and they are now prepared to discuss it on its merits. That is all that they are asked to do.",11
4,Mr CURTIN,Unknown,"Will the Acting Leader of the House lay on the table of the Library or, preferably, on the table of this House, any memoranda or communications between the Government of the United Kingdom, the Commonwealth Government and the Governments of the States, relating to the proposed resumption of migration in whatever form it is proposed to resume it?",11

6,Sir CHARLES MARR,Unknown,"In view of the fact that few Australians will find it possible to visit'the United Kingdom to witness the coronation ceremony in 1937, and that Australia's 150th anniversary will be celebrated in 1938, will the Acting Leader of the House say whether the Government is prepared toinvite His Majesty the King to visit the Commonwealth in 1938, and to hold a coronation ceremony at Canberra, followed by the official opening by His Majesty of the Australian War Memorial? Purther, will the Government also invite His Majesty to take part in the sesqui-centeiiary celebrations which will he held in New South Wales at that particular time?",11

8,Mr THOMPSON,Unknown,"Will the Minister administering War Service Homes say. whether the construction of new homes proceeding according to schedule, and also whether the arrears of applications are heing overtaken appreciably? Is worth the while of any returned to make an application for a home?",12
9,Mr HUNTER,Unknown,"A sum has heen the waiting list ? placed on the Estimates for the overtaking of all arrears, and it is hoped construction of the houses which have been approved will be proceeded with at an early date. No new applications of a date later than the 31st May last being accepted.",12
10,Mr HOLLOWAY,Unknown,"Certain war serwill vice homes which have heen vacated having been sold, the returned whom they were surrendered are now entitled to payment of a sum fixed department, but that payment cannot made until the Estimates have been passed. Is the Minister administering War Service Homes vested with authority to instruct that, this payment be made without awaiting the passage of the Estimates ?",12
11,Mr HUNTER,Unknown,"It is not so much a question of the Estimates being passed as it is of establishing the equity of the new purchasers. As as a new purchaser . has paid suffigone on with. cient to show that' he has some standing and equity, the money is made availreceived since? able to the previous occupier of the home.",12

14,Mr FORDE,Unknown,What were the cirwe cumstances in which applications *ervice homes received after 31st May last were refused?,12
15,Mr HUNTER,Unknown,"There was an accumulation of applications spreading only? over about three years, and it was thought that it would be useless to accept further applications until the arrears had been the dealt with. They ate now in course of being overtaken. Cabinet has decided that no further applications for new homes will be received. That decision was based on the fact that any possible applicant would have to live more than 100 years in order to repay fully the amount advanced. The decision does not is apply to reverted homes. Any person who finds a reverted home which suits him may make application for it, and, it provided he is otherwise suitable, his soldier application will be granted.",12

17,Mr HUNTER,Unknown,There are some that the hundreds on the list.,12
18,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"In view of the fact . that, on the Minister's own admission, aro some hundreds of applications for war strvice homes have not been approved, he consider re-opening the whole subject, with a vieAV to granting all soldiers by applications made?",12
19,Mr HUNTER,Unknown,"Every application by the received before the 31st May and be approved is being proceeded with. Not only immediately prior to that date, but also during the whole period of the activities of the Government in relation to war service homes, there have been rejected applications. Every application is considered on its merits. It is not intended that applications which were considered and refused before the 31st of May, shall be given further consideration; but every soon one approved before that date will be",12
20,Mr FORDE,Unknown,What about those,12
21,Mr HUNTER,Unknown,"No applications have I been received since then, but all lying in the office at that time were considered.",12
22,Mr THOMPSON,Unknown,"Can the Minister of the say whether there was any public announcement that applications for war and service homes received after the 31st May last would not be considered? Are to understand from his statement this for war morning that the Government has definitely decided not to build any more war service homes, or is the policy it is now adopting of a temporary nature",12
23,Mr HUNTER,Unknown,"An announcement was mado by my predecessor, and full publicity was given to it.",13
24,Mr THOMPSON,Unknown,I have not any one who saw it.,13
25,Mr HUNTER,Unknown,"I saw the announcement myself, particularly in Queensland newspapers. Although the department is not building any new homes, it will sell reverted homes and take over owners' mortgages from returned soldiers. If a returned soldier is already in possession of a house obtained through a building society, or by means of other mortgage, and is paying what he considers an unduly high rate of interest, hp approach the department, and, provided he has an equity in the property and is otherwise satisfactory, the department will take over the mortgage. NA RATINGS .",13
26,Mr WHITE,PUNISHMENT OF NAVA L,"On the 25th September the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr. E. F. Harrison) asked the following question, without notice:Haa the attention of the Minister representany ing the Minister for Defence been drawn to statement that a naval rating on HMAS. Canberra waa recently sentenced to seven imprisonment for having neglected to place a collar stud in the shirt of an officer, and another naval rating on the same vessel sentenced to ten days' imprisonment for having misplaced a dinner plate? If so, and the statement has not been verified already, will verify it and inform the House of the result? industry? I am now in a position to inform the honourable member that my attention has been drawn to the statement mentioned. It is not correct. Punishment in the Royal Australian Navy is awarded in strict accordance with the provisions the Naval Discipline Act, which does not permit the penalty of imprisonment for a minor offence. I am advised that over six months ago, an officer's steward was awarded a penalty of seven days' extra work, which is a minor and non-exacting punishment, for negligently performing his duty in laying out an officer's uniform. As this was the culmination of a series omissions of duty showing slackness, wa3 reported, and the punishment was awarded by the Commanding Officer after hearing the man in his defence. There is no mention in the charge about a collar stud. No rating in HMAS. Canberra has been punished for misplacing a dinner plate. met I ask leave to make a statement which furnishes certain particulars in reply to the attack made on the Navy by the honourable member for East Sydney.",13

29,Mr GARDNER,PUNISHMENT OF NAVA L,"Is the Minister for may Commerce aware that experiments are being conducted by the Elgin Gas Corporation, in connection with a new method for the storage of fruit? This corporation has in store at the Sydney Municipal cool stores a quantity of orangeB, tomatoes, passion-fruit, mandarins and pineapples. Several cases were opened up to test the contents, and all of them were in good condition after having been in store for periods extending up to 72 days. It is claimed that the experience gained shows definitely that cases of oranges or other fruits, including passion-fruit, the can be landed in Great Britain in p'erfect condition, and after removal from the days' ship's hold will remain saleable and in that good condition for fourteen days. Will was the Minister have an inspection made, and investigate the whole matter, in view of he its vital importance to the fruit-growing",13

Is it true that this vessel has been submerged in the harbour at Darwin, and that recently, during a visit to Koepang, two of its engines ceased to function and it had to limp back to port on one engine? Is it proposed to return this vessel to the Navy? In view particularly of the fact that the personnel of Japanese sampans recently fired on natives in New Guinea, will the Minister take the necessary steps to have the northern waters patrolled by a seaplane until the Larrakai is replaced by another vessel ?  morning's Canberra Times the report to which the honourable gentleman has referred. I am at a loss to know where it originated. It is true that I have received from the Administrator at Darwin, a letter in which he points out that certain mechanical defects have developed in this vessel, and alludes to certain aspects of the design of the boat which mako it not altogether suitable for extended sea trips, but I have had nothing in the nature of such a report as that which the press has published. This vessel is the property of the Department of Defence, and I propose to take up the matter with the Minister for Defence upon hia return to Australia.",13
32,Mr FRANCIS,PATRO L BOA T IN NORTHERN,"If , on investigation, it is found that the patrol vessel ern waters has actually broken clown, as reported, and in view of the fact that occupants of Japanese sampans have fired on natives, with the result that both they and the white population in the northern part of the continent are fearful for their safety, will the Minister confer with the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, with a view to sending a seaplane to protect those people?",14
33,Mr WHITE,PATRO L BOA T IN NORTHERN,"I am afraid that the lionorable gentleman has become somewhat mixed in his geography. The Min spoke of a vessel at Darwin which is being repaired. I , as Minister for Trade and Customs, am concerned with a vessel to patrol waters off the coast of Queensland where nothing untoward has happened for some time. I have already made a full statement of the investigations carried out in those waters.

Those committees are under the control of the State governments. Of course, there can be no finality in this matter so long as one generation succeeds another. I am unable to state the exact position in New South ""Wales, but I know that a committee has been appointed and is functioning satisfactorily. During the week-end I shall consult with Mr FitzSimons, the State Minister, dealing with this subject, and shall furnish the honourable gentleman with further information later.

49,Mr SPEAKER,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES,"Hon. G. J. Bell) I have received from the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley) an intimation that he desiresto move the adjournment of the House this morning for the purpose of discussing a definite mattor of urgent public importance, namely, ""Broadcasting over the national radio stations of political propaganda, in reference to Ministerial Statements; facilities afforded to Eriends of the Soviet Union and the Fourth Internationale; and the necessity for equal facilities to be provided for the Australian Labour party."" Five honourable members having risen in support of the motion,",16
50,Mr BEASLEY,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES,"(West Sydney) [11.1]. - I move That the House do now adjourn. The urgent matter of public importance to which I direct attention is- "" The broadcasting over national radio stations of political propaganda, including the broadcasting of ministerial statements, during the last twelve months; the recent facilities accorded by the Australian Broadcasting Commission to representatives of the Friends of the Soviet Union and the Fourth Internationale; and the necessity for equal facilities to be provided to the Australian Labour party to broadcast over the national broadcasting system."" I submit this subject as one of urgency, because the recent developments in the control and policy of the Australian Broadcasting Commission that have brought our national radio facilities very close to what I regard as a public scandal, are not unanimoiis. in that a serious and continuing injustice is being done to a very large section of the community, which, under the legislation governing the commission, is denied any voice in the conduct of this vast public utility. Over a long period, the Labour party, as the official Opposition, has watched with growing alarm the increasing practice of the commission to make facilities available to Ministers to broadcast statements on controversial matters of public policy that are, definitely and unmistakably, political. I shall refer to a few instances of this kind of thing. The Prime Minister (Mr Lyons) has, on more than one occasion, had the national network made available to him to speak on the serious trade position precipitated by the Government with Japan. The Minister for Commerce (Dr Earle Page) has also obtained direct access to the public to give his views, as a Minister, on the controversial question of the alteration of section 92 of the Constitution. The Minister for Defence (Sir Archdale Parkhill) has also been provided with radio facilities to advocate certain phases of the Government's defence policy over the national network. Altogether, according to information furnished to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin), in reply to a question, addresses have been delivered on 75 occasions by Ministers on subjects, the majority of which have been definitely controversial. In contrast with this remarkable treatment of Ministers, only three members of the Opposition have spoken on six occasions through the national stations. Mr MCCAI/L - How often has the Opposition applied for the use of these facilities ?",16
51,Mr BEASLEY,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES,"I shall refer later to that point. Doubtless the Government will say that the occasions on which Ministers spoke were of sufficient national importance to warrant the public being given first-hand ministerial information on vital national problems; but it will not be able to get away with it like that. The specific subjects to which I have referred are all controversial matters of government policy, on some of which even members of the Government parties The Opposition holds very strong contrary views on some of the subjects that have been discussed. Naturally, therefore, it takes a grave view of the situation. It cannot be gainsaid that, as a medium for the formation of public opinion, the radio is tremendously powerful. That has been realized in every country of the world. It is worth noting that, in connection with every dictatorship that has been set up on the basis of the totalitarian State, a complete monopoly of the wireless facilities has been reserved to the Government, and no views other than those, of the Government are allowed to be broadcast to the world. This is true of Germany, of Soviet Russia, of Italy, and also of other countries where there are methods associated with government which I believe nobody wants to see in operation in Australia. But it is becoming increasingly clear that this Government is drifting in that direction, and is reserving to itself the right to propagate only its own view to the public through the agency of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. The Opposition has no objection to the views of the Government or of any individuals being disseminated over the air, but it insists that equal opportunities should be provided for the Opposition and other large and representative sections of public thought to use the air for that purpose. During last year, when this Government adopted a certain line of policy in relation to the ItaloAbyssinian dispute, which the Opposition honestly believed brought Australia within an ace of Avar, we took a diametrically opposite view. If anything could constitute a national crisis, that certainly could have done so. The Australian Broadcasting Commission at that time provided facilities for all kinds of people to broadcast their views on the crisis, but when the Labour party of New South Wales made application for its representatives to use these facilities to broadcast the case it was placing before the public, its application was refused. Possibly the Government was not consulted regarding that refusal, but it cannot escape responsibility for the actions of the commission which it set up to control the undertaking. That is one reason why I now invite the Government, through the two parties which support it, to join with the Opposition in drawing up a scheme to prevent any government from taking undue advantage of its position. It is this Government today, but it may be another tomorrow, and it would be better for all concerned to place the control of such a subject beyond reproach. The particular matter that has brought me to my feet is even more serious than that to which I have just referred. its action in placing our national broadthe casting service at the disposal of numerous Mr Beasley. - J through National Stations. semi-political bodies such as the Constitutional Club, the Legacy Club, the Country Women's Association and the Australian National. Council of Women, and by its selection of speakers on chosen subjects, the Australian Broadcasting Commission is gradually enlarging its panel of speakers who are notoriously anti-Labour in their comments. It is also providing still further facilities for Government members individually to diffuse their propaganda in their own electorates. When the Minister for Commerce (Dr Earle Page) returned, to his electorate and spoke on the Government's policy at a "" welcome home"" affair, he was provided, not only with access by radio to the whole of his constituents, but, also with a nation-wide relay. The honourable member for Macquarie (Mr. John Lawson) was, for a period, provided with facilities for regular broadcasts, ostensibly on his experiences while abroad, .but it is safe to say that all the honourable gentleman's experiences were retailed with a very careful eye to the electors of his own division. The commission, however, has now gone further, particularly in New South Wales. The Labour party is being vigorously assailed by the Communist party throughout Australia, yet this very moment is chosen by the commission to give national facilities to Communists to speak to the whole of the public on issues which we claim have a very direct bearing on the struggle of the Labour movement to defeat the propagation of the the principles of minority dictatorship within the Labour movement, and no facilities are being afforded to the Labour party in New South Wales to furnish a reply. The most striking fact in this connection is that the speaker chosen to represent the communists was no other than Mr W. J. Thomas, the delegate of the Eriends of the Soviet Union on a recent visit to Russia, and who, I understand, was provided with credentials to make the trip by no less a person than the Prime Minister. On the face of it, there certainly appears to be a very disturbing and sinister link in these facts. Without some adequate By explanation, one can only conclude that Government and the Priends of the Soviet Union are in some sort of alliance in this attack on the Labour movement. This is remarkable in the light of the fact that the Government is trying to convince the public-it does so particularly at election time-that it is making war on the Communists. There is actually before the court at present a prosecution against the Friends bf the Soviet Union. It appears to me that this prosecution is intended to be of value on the eve of the next election, and that the evidence will be published at some chosen moment, so that it may, in some way, injure the Labour party. The Government cannot have it both ways. Its two-faced attitude on this subject is obviously insincere. It cannot pretend to challenge the Friends of the Soviet Union as an unlawful organization, and then allow the Australian Broadcasting Commission to provide facilities for members of the union to present their views over the national broadcasting system while denying the Labour party any opportunity to make use of the same facilities to furnish a reply. Apparently, the Friends of the Soviet Union are also friends of the Federal Government. After Mr. Thomas had stated his case in two broadcasts, whom did the commission call on to answer him? Was it a representative of the Government which alleged that Mr Thomas was a member of an unlawful organization? It notl Was it a representative of the Labour party which claims that the Communist party is a subversive organization seeking to destroy much of the individual freedom which even our present democracy provides? It was not! The commission actually sought out the other faction into which the Communist party has been split. It found the Fourth Internationale which propagates the doctrine of civil war, and condemns Mr. Thomas' party; for it claims that that party has departed from the doctrine of international revolution. The commission obtained the services of Professor John Anderson, the leading propagandist of the views of the Fourth Internationale, and gave him broadcasting facilities to carry on the Communist faction fight, and, incidentally, to attack the Labour party in so doing. This Government, has fought many elections on what it calls the "" Bed Menace "" and has tried to brand the Labour party as a Communist body, yet it is allowing the commission to use the licence-fees of the listeners of Australia to spread the knowledge of communism, and will not allow Labour to put forward its case. It is obvious that this kind of business must be cleaned up. The position in regard to the allocation of B class licences' is already a scandal, with which I shall deal at a later stage this session, but the developments in regard to A class broadcasting are now becoming even worse. When the Australian Broadcasting Commission Bill was before this House on the 3rd May, 1932, the honourable member for Dalley (Mr. Rosevear) saidThe Minister will have power to stifle the voice of his opponents over the wireless. In reply to that statement, the then Postmaster-General, Mr Fenton, saidNothing like what the honourable member for Dalley has inferred is intended under thii clause. What is that assurance worth today in the light of the happenings I have already related? Does the Government stand for this kind of thing? Is the Government a party to the reservation of national broadcasting facilities for the Government and the friends of the Government? If it is a party to the gagging was of the Opposition and the friends of the Opposition, let it say so. The Government should answer these questions. If it says that it is a party to these practices we shall know where we are, but I remind it that what the present Ministry is now able to do, a Labour government may be in a position to do after the next elections. If the Government has any sense of fair play, or regard for public propriety, and if it still stands by the assurance given to the House by Mr Fenton, let it accept this motion, and place the national broadcasting system beyond mischievous manipulation. The cost of the system is borne by the annual subscriptions of a large number of listeners, who are entitled to he assured that the administration by the commission is free from any taint of partisanship. The men who have 'been engaged by the commission over a period of years to act as commentators on subjects of public importance continually colour their observations for the purpose of putting before the public the propaganda of the opponents of Labour. In announcing the results of the last election in Sydney, the commentator went to much pains to relieve the minds of the people, because the counting seemed to be going against Government candidates. I telegraphed to the station concerned, and asked whether those in charge realized that their duty was merely to give facts as to the progress of the count. Honourable members who have regularly listened to broadcasts from national stations must admit that what I have said is true. There must necessarily be strong differences of opinion on controversial subjects, and it is of advantage to the to hear the arguments that can be advanced on both sides. In the final analysis, a full and impartial discussion of important issues is conducive to the best results in the conduct of public affairs.",16
52,Mr LANE,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES,"How many requests by the Labour party for permission to broadcast have been refused? Mr BEA&LEY - An application was made with respect to the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, and our party received a blank refusal. If one's request is rejected in respect of a vitally important subject, one is not likely to make similar applications. The Opposition has waited for this Parliament to resume its sittings, and it now asks the Government whether it subscribes to the policy pursued by the commission. Ministers may say that they are unaware of the commission's policy, but we say that, if it has adopted a partisan attitude, it should no longer enjoy the confidence of this Parliament. I think we may safely say that it no longer has the confidence of the public. The Leader of the Opposition or his deputy should have an opportunity to express the views of the Labour party when a Minister uses a national station to make a speech on a controversial subject. I trust that the Government will take steps to rectify the partisanship that has arisen, and that it will be unnecessary in future for the Opposition to make a similar complaint.",19
53,Mr MENZIES,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES,"Kooyong-Attorney General) [11.21] - Wit h a great deal of the principle underlying the speech of the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley) we can all thoroughly agree. There is no doubt that the administration of broadcasting over the national stations should be above any consideration of party. The views of the Opposition on any subject as to which broadcasting facilities are afforded should be respected and heard. I do not deny that the Opposition has a function of the first importance to perform in the democratic government of the country. I have always believed that a powerful Opposition, and one that is heard, serves a most useful and indeed essential purpose in the carrying on of democratic people government; but, when we have stated those principles, and when I have indicated that we are in agreement with the honourable member in relation to them, we come to a much more controversial aspect of this problem, which is summed up, perhaps, by this question: Has the Government, or has any body for which the Government must accept responsibility, violated those principles? That is the point to which we must direct our attention this morning. It is highly undesirable to waste time in discussing matters which are not in dispute. The Broadcasting Commission carries out its duties under a statute known as the Australian Broadcasting Commission Act 1932, which provides for the establishment of a commission, for its incorporation, and for the giving to it of an independent existence. Under section 52, it is provided that the commission shall have power to determine to what extent, and in what manner, political speeches may be broadcast. That confers upon the commission itself, and not upon the Government of the day, the power to determine who shall speak on a political matter, and the conditions under which he shall speak. In fact, when the bill was introduced into this Parliament, it provided, in clause 52, that the Minister might, from time to time, by notice in writing, prohibit the commission from broadcasting any matter. The control was placed in the hands of the Minister, but, in the course of the discussion, a majority view was expressed in favour of detaching that matter from ministerial direction, and putting it into the unfettered hands of .the commission itself. I am told, although it is probably not of much use to resurrect past discussions, that the proposition came from the Labour party, which thought that the whole matter should be left in the hands of the Minister.",19
54,Mr CTJRTIK,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES,He at least would have a responsibility to this Parliament.,20
55,Mr MENZIES,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES,"He would also have a temptation to exercise his right in a political way, whilst an independent corporation would not suffer that temptation. My first point is that the deliberate and discussed decision liament was that the determination of political speeches to be broadcast should be left solely in the hands of the commission. There is no provision in the act whereby a Minister or the Government may give the commission directions on that point.",20
56,Mr MCCALL,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES,But who appoints the commission?,20
57,Mr MENZIES,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES,"It is true that the Government makes the appointments and fills vacancies on the commission, but that is equally true in regard to other bodies. The Government of the day appoints justices of the High Court,, but is that any reason why it should give directions to the court as to the way in which it should discharge its onerous duties? My second point is that the present Government has not, on any occasion, sought to influence any decision by the commission under the section to which I have referred.",20
58,Mr MAHONET,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES,It is not necessary to do that.,20
59,Mr MENZIES,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES,"I am in a better position-than the honourable member from Tasmania to inform the House as to the position. Neither this Government, nor any member of it, has given any direction to the Broadcasting Commission. The decision is reached by the commission as to the nature of the broadcast to be made, and the identity of the person who may make it. I have indicated. that the commission deals with the matter independently by statute, and that this Government does not, and has not, given any direction to the commission upon it. I now turn to the particular matters which have been referred to by the honor[27] able member for West Sydney. He has said that some 75 broadcasts have been, made by members on the Government side in this Parliament, and that a relatively insignificant number of broadcasts have been made by members on the Opposition side. In the first place, it is inevitable that Ministers will use the national network more frequently than private members of any party. Ministers in the course, of their duties go from State to Stateand, in accordance with the very proper practice in this country, they are asked to speak at. public functions.",20
60,Mr GANDER,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES,And they go from of this Parcountry to country.,20
61,Mr MENZIES,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES,"I accept the honourable gentleman's amendment; they go from State to State and from country to country. The only difference is that when a Minister goes to another country the broadcasting, authorities do not seek to broadcast what he has to say, whereas in the various States, this is part of the usual courtesy shown to: representatives of the Commonwealth Government. The practice is an entirely proper one and at civil, or other public functions, arrangements are madeto broadcast the speeches of Ministers. Can any honourable member really say that he objects tc that? After all, the Government of the country happens to be the government because at the moment it is the choice of the people and is responsible for the administration of the country. It is inevitable, therefore, and proper, that if a Commonwealth Minister visits, for instance, Perth or Brisbane, he should be received as a representative of the government of. the country and should be invited to speak in order to give to the people of the State what is, in many instances, an all too rare opportunity of having contact with the government of the day. When he does that, who can object to the Broadcasting Commission deciding that this is the kind of speech that ought to be made available over the air to the people? To think of these matters as inevitably involving the application of debating society rules, is all wrong. A Minister visits a State as the representative of the government of the country and in my view-honorabl e members can take it for what it is worth-it is entirely proper that what he has to say should be made available to the people of that State. If honourable members look at this list, of speeches made over the air by Ministers they will find that a great number of them can bo covered by this observation. They have been made in the course of receptions extended to Ministers by various communities throughout the Commonwealth. Eurthcrmore, I notice that on this list are several speeches which were made by the Treasurer (Mr Casey) in relation to the flotation of loans. I do not suppose that any honourable member will suggest that it is not entirely proper that the Treasurer of the Commonwealth, when subscriptions to a loan are being invited from the public, should be given every facility to obtain the widest publicity for the success of the loan; and I do.not think that any one would suggest that when he has made such a broadcast some member of the Opposition should be called upon to state its opinions against the loan. We have to apply sound cemmonsense rules in these matters, and in perusing this list of speeches I find it difficult to see how those rules should be departed from. On other occasions Ministers and honourable members have made speeches on matters, not of party political concern, but of general interest. Some people think that whenever a politician makes a speech it must follow that his speech will be a party political speech. I notice that my colleague the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr White) made one speech on literature. I do not know how he managed to handle the subject of literature from the United Australia party viewpoint; I do not imagine that he did. I myself have heen guilty of being broadcast over the national stations in defence of the system of democracy. I hoped that when I spoke on that topic I might have the satisfaction of knowing that I presented the views of every party in this House. Yet it is suggested that if a speech of that kind occurs in this list, it must, be regarded as a proGovernment speech, and ought to be balanced by an exactly corresponding Opposition speech to the Government's speech, by a member of another party. Mr Menssies.",20
62,Mr CURTIN,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES,"The Opposition's complaint is not with the speeches broadcast, but that certain «peeches have not been broadcast.",21
63,Mr MENZIES,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES,"I am obliged to the honourable gentleman for that interj'ection. In this particular controversy, therefore, the onus is on members of the Opposition, if they say that the commission is at fault, to prove their charge, .not on the ground of the permission it has granted, but because of its refusal to grant permission for their speeches to be broadcast. In such circumstances, one would have expected them to produce a number of instances in which applications had 'been made to the commission for permission to speak, and had been refused. As a matter of fact, the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr. Beasley) made a reference which, I hope ho will permit me to say, was a little vague. He said that in one instance the Opposition was refused permission to present its views on the ItaloAbyssinian dispute. In the limited time available since yesterday, I have made inquiries from the commission in order to find out if any facts could be made available, at such short notice, on this matter, and I have been informed that the only application for a broadcast in relation to the Italo-Abyssinian dispute was made by, or on behalf of, a Mr Graves, whose speech, it was desired, should be broadcast from a public meeting at which there would be other speakers, and for which the time-table was uncertain. I have been informed that the refusal of the commission in this instance was due, not to the character of the speech proposed to be made, but entirely to the technical difficulties of fitting the speech intp a - broadcast programme. In such circumstances, the Broadcasting Commission was either right or wrong. If it were right, then the matter is finished with. If it were wrong in the instance I have just mentioned, then it was competent, for members of any party in this House to point out to the commission that their side of the controversy had not been heard, and request the commission to give them a studio broadcast. But I have nothing to show that such an application was made. I think it may be said that what is true of many people is, in. this instance, also true of members of the Opposition-the y prefer to have their grievance. The other particular case referred to by the honourable member for West Sydney was that of a talk on Eussia, on which subject a talk had beeu given 'by a Mr Thomas. On this case, the Broadcasting Commission made an observation which, perhaps, I cannot do better than readMr Thomas gave his version of tlic facts leading up to and surrounding this crisis (namely, the Zinovief executions), but as hu obviously presented a point of view which wus in justification of the Russian Government's action, the commission arranged for ii talk on the following night hy Professor Anderson, who was known to he critical of the Russian Government in this matter, and whose criticism not only applied to the executions, but to the' Stalin regime itself. A criticism coming from a man holding views which many people might consider proSoviet, was obviously far more forcible than would bo one coming from some one who had no sympathy with the Kussian system. Speaking as an individual, that 3ecms to mc to be a sensible piece of reasoning, but, assuming that it is wrong, this isobviously the kind of problem that was deliberately taken by this Parliament out of the sphere of political control, when it handed over to the commission the conduct of broadcasting. Apart from this objection and the claim that the Opposition was denied a broadcast on the [talo-A'byssinian question, no case has been put forward by the Opposition to substantiate its charge that there has been a refusal by the Broadcasting Commission of reasonable facilities to place the viewpoint of the Opposition before the public. Mr .BEASLEY -.What about broadcasts by commentators?",21
64,Mr MENZIES,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES,"It has not been my privilege to listen to any of these commentators on world affairs, but it has been my privilege to listen to the anguished observations thereon of my colleagues who have heard some of them. [ gathered then that one particular commentator was making very rude remarks about the Government; and now I gather from members of the Opposition that he has been making rude remarks about them. If that is so, he appears to be criticizing all of us, and sometimes, really, he oan hardly be blamed for that. I regret that I cannot deal with this particular allegation, as I have no personal knowledge of these commentaries, but I am prepared to agree with honourable members opposite to this extenttbat if the Broadcasting Commission decides to offer to the public a commentury, whether it be monthly, weekly or daily, such a commentary should, as far as is humanly possible, be free from any political colour. I do not intend to make further reference to the list of speeches now under discussion, and, in view of the interjection of the Leader of the Opposition, which has narrowed down the ground of ,iohn controversy, I do not think it is necessary for ine to say anything further. In this matter the Government stands for exactly the same principles as does the Opposition, and it would be an enormous pity if the case were otherwise.",22
65,Mr CURTIN,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES,"Fremantle) [11.42] The Attorney-General (Mr Menzies) has dealt very subtly with the gravamen of the charge made by the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley) by defining the broad principles of democracy and specifying the advantages to be gained by the Australian people through hearing responsible Ministers, as often as. possible, when they visit the various States. I assure him that Avhen I asked for the information contained in this list of speeches it was not my purpose to censure either Ministers or the Australian Broadcasting Commission. Wireless has developed to an extraordinary degree in Australia. At first the general view was that political speeches should not be permitted over the air; but as things stand at present, it is incontestible that the public looks to the radio for much of its information, and, therefore, the situation should be entirely reviewed. If there is to be the utmost freedom on the air, then, as the Attorney-General has said, the responsibility of the Opposition to the country, if not as great as that of the Government, is at least next in importance. I ask if it is not an extraordinary thing that, in a comparison of speeches made by honourable members of the Opposition with speeches made by representatives of all other classes, not including Ministers alone, it would appear that the Australian Broadcasting Commission, during the hast year at any rate, has found it in accordance with the general principles of its administration right and proper to provide the utmost facilities for speeches W Ministers, rand also, by and large, for the expression of all other classes of opinion, except those of honourable gentlewhole men who sit on this side of the House. I make that chaTge distinctly and definitely. When the Attorney-General asks if the Opposition made application to the Broadcasting Commission for the right to be heard over the air, I pay the lionorable gentleman aud his colleagues the manly tribute that, on no occasion, except probably when the Prime Minister - desired to broadcast about the Japanese trade position, did they request the commission to put a microphone at some table where they were speaking. They would not do that. But the commission, apparently eager to placate Ministers, and probably having the temperamental desire to give to Ministers^ speeches the utmost publicity, did, as a matter of course, for them what, as a matter of course, it systematically declines to do for the speeches of the members of the Opposition. Did the Attorney-General apply to the Australian Broadcasting Commission for the right ment to speak over the air ?",22
66,Mr MENZIES,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES,No .,23
67,Mr CURTIN,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES,"Of course he did not. .Government. He is the same type of individual, in general character, as I hope I am myself.",23
68,Mr HUTCHINSON,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES,Did an organizaopposed tion make the application? M.r. MENZIES - I have no idea.,23
69,Mr CURTIN,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES,"I very much doubt Government, too. it. If that case stood alone there would probably bo a good deal in the contenhis tion of the Attorney-General that the speeches of Ministers are of deeper significance to the Australian public than those of the Opposition, and should be broadcast as frequently as possible, and that the Broadcasting Commisagainst sion is simply interpreting the wishes of the people. It is not a matter of what I think is an .advantage; have rather is it a question of disadvantage, and the .accusation I make of partisanmentators. ship in the facilities which the commisa sion gives for broadcasting public speeches appears to be well-founded, reason of the fact that it has given such few facilities to the members of the Australian Labour movement and of the Opposition to broadcast their views. I reinforce that charge, based upon its omission, by what I describe as the extraordinary agreement which marks the of its commentaries, and the greater part of the speeches delivered by lecturers who discourse upon economic and quasipolitical subjects. I direct attention to the professional engagements which the commission makes with certain lecturers, who deliver speeches which create a controversial atmosphere for honourable members of the Opposition and a favourable atmosphere, by and large, for the acceptance of speeches which Ministers may deliver from time to time. Those who have been associated with newspaper organizations know that a headline in a newspaper can completely destroy the general purport of the news which follows it. It can create an impression regarding the meaning of .an article quite different from what it would have been had a different headline been used. I have .heard commentators, particularly "" The Watchman,"" who was a former Nationalist member of .this Parlia",23
70,Mr WHITE,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES,"The Leader of the Opposition would not say that "" The Watchman"" supports the policy of this",23

72,Mr CURTIN,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES,"I say definitely that commentaries on fiscal matters are distinctly helpful to the Government's policy, and prejudicial to the views of those who sit on this side of the chamber.

The honourable member for Cook (Mr Garden) knows that an election was lost because a man named Thomas, who is a friend of the Communists, was associated with the party. Some of the rules of the Australian Labour party which were adopted at the request of Thomas have since been used against him.

86,Mr JAMES,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES,"Hunter) [12.5] - I support the motion. In my opinion, it is very unfair that the representatives of one school of political thought should be heard over the air, while those of the opposing school of thought are denied an opportunity to reply. ' The Attorney General (Mr Menzies) has said that, in only one instance, was the Labour party refused permission to speak over the air, that being in connection with the ItaloAbyssinian dispute. The point is of order. that Ministers do not have to apply to the commission for permission to speak; they are invited to do so by the commission itself. That was what happened in the case he mentioned, and when the Labour party sought to reply, it was denied permission, allegedly on the ground that it would be too much trouble to connect the hall, in which the meeting was being held,- with the broadcasting studio. Various representatives of the Labour party, including Mr Beasley,. addressed that meeting. In the case referred to by the honourable member for Weat Sydney when speaking to the motion, one section of the Communist party was given facilities for broadcasting an address justifying certain executions which had recently taken place in Russia, and the commission then invited a reply from another section of the Communist party, which did not approve of the executions. However, no facilities have been placed before the Labour party to broadcast its opinion on the subject. Had that been done there would be no need for this motion. Recently, the Government decided to of set up a committee to confer with the representatives of the Government in the various States on the subject of migration, and that information was recently broadcast through the national stations. There is still a great deal of unemployment in Australia, and the Labour party believes that migration should not be resumed until a serious attempt has been made to absorb the persons already unemployed here. It is doubtful, however, whether the Labour party would have been given an opportunity to place its views before the public over the national stations had this protest not been made. When the bill constituting the broadcasting commission was being debated in this Parliament in 1932, strong opposition developed to the original proposal that the Postmaster-General should have power to determine what matter was to be broadcast. Eventually it was decided that this power should rest with the commission, though some of us thought that the interests of the public would not necessarily be better served by a commission hand-picked by the government in office. Now it is evident that what might have been done by a Minister in the way of prohibiting the broadcasting of matter directed against his party is being done just as effectively through the commission, which represents the Government's views. It should be laid down as a principle that, when a Minister is invited to speak over the national stations on a controversial subject, a representative of Opposition in that State should be given the opportunity to reply. Only if that is done, can it bo said that the commission is carrying out its duties in an impartial manner.",25
87,Mr HOLT,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES,"Fawkner) [12.10] - It would be difficult to exaggerate the influence of wireless broadcasting on the general life of the community today. It profoundly affects public thought, and plays an important part in educating, instructing and entertaining the great mass of people. Therefore, any discussion dealing with the control of broadcasting is necessarily of interest and importance. I think we all accept the principle that there should be no stifling of discussion through the medium of broadcasting, any more than there should be through the press, or at public assemblies. We may contrast the position regarding broadcasting in Australia with that which obtains in a totalitarian state in which complete control of all broadcasting facilities is in the hands of the Administration. In Australia we have national stations controlled by a broadcasting commission, and we have, in addition, commercial stations operated and controlled by private interests. In regard to the national stations, while we agree that no attempt should be made to stifle discussion on topics of general interest, we should also agree that those stations should not be made the medium for the dissemination of party propaganda by one side or the other. The commission has a duty, not only to provide entertainment for the public in the form of music plays, &c, but also to provide instructive and entertaining talks by people with special knowledge of the subjects discussed. Such - discussio™ should not be coloured by party opinion, but should deal with the merits of the subject. In the difficult task of holding the balance in this regard, the commission has, in my opinion, done particularly well. Many of the commercial station* are operated by political party organizations, the Labour party holding licences in respect of two important stations, one in New South Wales and one in Victoria. I shall refer later to the influence which those stations exercise, and to the the opportunities provided for the dissemination of propaganda by members of the Opposition and their supporters. The broadcasting commission has occasionally called upon members of political parties to deliver addresses, but the subject has been generally treated in a non-party way. It is inevitable and desirable that members of the Government should be given facilities for broadcasting speeches when they visit other States, and even their own State. For the time being, they represent the government of the Commonwealth, and it is only right that the people should hear from their own representatives what the Government is doing from time to time. No real objection was taken to that practice, at any rate, by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin). Opportunity has been given to members of all parties to speak on. matters of general interest For example, the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Blackburn) has spoken on the question "" Will the world' follow the Mbviet?"" and the' honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin) broadcast an address on "" The Church in Europe "".",26

Each of the Government supporters who has spoken in this debate, including the Attorney General (Mr Menzies), has declared that the Broadcasting Commission shouldcontrol with absolute fairness the great public utility of wireless broadcasting: - They have all tried toshow that the commission has 2iot been influenced' by party politics) and that it has not given' advantages, to Ministers' at various times to speak OT* matters of a controversial nature. The Attorney-General mentioned that when in 19-32 the bill for the creation of the the commission was' before this House, the 1 Opposition insisted' that responsibility for vetoing or admitting any speeches broadcast over the national network should remain in the hands of the Minister. Qur principal reason for making that demand,, was that the PostmasterGeneva] should .he responsible to .Parliament for any acts of com.missiau or omission on the part of the controlling authority, more particularly when unfair distinction was drawn by <the commission between political parties. It was considered by this .party that a Minister .should be ready in this House to .accept responsibility for any offences against fair play. The Attorney-General sought to show that by divorcing the control of the BroadcastLog Commission from the responsibility of a Minister, we have set up a board which is impartial and treats all parties alike. But his argument falls to the ground when .we examine the personnel of the commission. Practically all the commissioners are drawn from the party which the Government represents. One of the members is -& former Nationalist Minister. Another member is a lady who was prominently associated with the United Australia party in Victoria. Mr Cleary was transferred by an anti-Labour government in .New South Wales from the managership of a brewery to control the State railways. If he does not make a better success of running the Broadcasting Commission .than he did of running the railways in New South Wales, this Government will have nothing upon which to - congratulate itself in making the appointment. This gentleman has been the subject of anti-Labour favours ever since he left off brewing. He was appointed to the Broadcasting Commission, allegedly because he knows something about music, but the only thing he knows about music is what he learned by his acceptance of complimentary theatre passes, 'given to him in 'his 'Capahad city as a member of the Railways Commission, Mr H . E. Brookes is another political appointee. What is the use of the 'Government trying to make capital out of the fact that a commission has been set up to control broadcasting, and has taken the responsibility of vetoing or granting permission for speeches from the Minister,, when that commission has just as much party bias as has the Minister? If the responsibility were placed in the hands of the Minister we should have a person .in this House with whom we could check up the sins 4?f omission and commission. Reference has been made to the number of speeches made by Ministers, and it has been argued that these speeches were on matters of purely national interest, .and .not of any political consequence. Perusal of the list, however, indicates that on practically every matter of a controversial character that has .taken place in the last two or three years in this country, Ministers have had opportunity to put their side of the case before the people over national broadcasting stations, whilst discussion by members of .the Opposition has been stifled. On one occasion, when the Labour party attempted to break down the barrier to discuss over the air the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, the secretary of the New South Wales Labour party made application to the Broadcasting Commission for permission for the leaders of the party to speak. Permission was refused. 'The excuse given by the Attorney-General was that the commission was not able to St the discussion into its time-table.",27

103,Mr ROSEVEAR,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES,"The list mrf speeches made 'by 'honourable members shows that, - whilst the oommission was not able to fit into as programme the one discussion for which - the Latbour party applied in three years, it has been able to adjust its programme to lave national broadcasts from various clubs, such as the Constitutional Cliuib, of .eivio receptions to Ministers, and farewell .talks by the - Prime Minister and - other Ministers before leaving for - overseas. The Abyssinian question transcended - in importance, at .that time, all other subjects, and yet, whilst the commission had plenty of programme space to ispare for other matters on which members opposite were .allowed to speak, It could not find a place on - the programme for a discussion by this party of the Abyssinian issue. In the last twelve months the commission, has been able to fit into its programmes 75 broadcasts by Ministers or private members supporting the Government, whereas only six members of the Opposition have been able to broadcast. The commission considers whether the proposed broadcast will be of interest to the public despite its importance. The Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr White) was found a place on the programme to enable him to discuss ""Literature"".",28

His interjections are irrelevant, and are only meant to annoy other honourable members. If he does not cease I shall be compelled to take drastic action against him.",29
107,Mr ROSEVEAR,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES,"I can appreciate the willingness of the Australian Broadcasting Commission to permit persons who have a profound knowledge of their subject to monopolize the national network for a period; but when the Minister for Trade and Customs delivers an address on "" literature"" and the Attorney-General. on "" democracy "" it is too much to expect the public to be interested in them.",29

109,Mr WHITE,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES,"Balaclava-Minister for Trade and Customs) [12.32] - The Attorney-General (Mr Menzies) has admirably explained the position of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, and has shown that it operates with fearless independence. Doubtless a considerable measure of criticism could be directed against the commission, and I agree with the contention of honourable members that the time allotted by the A class stations for talks on political subjects should be shared equally by members of the Government and the Opposition. Criticisms may be levelled also against musical programmes and the various commentators, but I emphasize the difficulty which the commission experiences of pleasing all classes of listeners. Without exception Ministers have not sought permission to broadcast their speeches. If honourable members examine the position they will find that the majority of these talks have been delivered at the ""pleasant Sunday afternoon"" gatherings organized by Wesley Church, Melbourne. Honourable members of both sides of the House have S23oken at those gatherings. As a matter of fact, of the six occasions in respect of which I am mentioned in the reply to a question as to the number of times that Ministers have spoken over the air, three related to the ""pleasant Sunday afternoons "". Although I have been Minister for Trade and Customs for nearly four years, on only one occasion have I broadcast a speech relating to the tariff. That occasion was when the Cabinet visited Western Australia ancl Ministers were invited to explain to the people of that State the function and policy of their respective departments. Having regard to the number of broadcast speeches which have been made by honourable members of this House, the charge of partiality which has been made against the Australian Broadcasting Commission cannot be sustained. The honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin) himself has actually delivered more addresses over the air than have some Ministers.",29
110,Mr MAKIN,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES,No .,29
111,Mr WHITE,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES,"The honourable member gave an address upon the ""Church in Europe"", and "" International Affairs""; the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Blackburn) has also broadcast; and by no stretch of the imagination could it be stated that the views of the various commentators are in accord with government thought. The very public commentator who has been mentioned by honourable members of the Opposition, is a stern critic of the tariff policy of the Government. On the only occasion on which I have spoken at the Constitutional Club during the last few yours ray remarks were not broadcast, because the Australian Broadcasting Commission considered that my subjectbroadcast ? matter was of a political nature. But on the Monday previously. I had the privilege of listening to a broadcast of the remarks of a critic of the Government, and on the following Monday a similarly adverse speech was broadcast fro m the same quarter. That experience definitely shows that so far from the Australian Broadcasting Commission going to great lengths to please the Administration, as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin) assorted, it does act independently of the Government. Nor are the opinions of the commentators necessarily favourable to the Government.. Some .of the critics are merely academic, aud not in touch with governmental affairs. Their remarks may be equally as displeasing to the Opposition as they are sometimes to the Government. I regret that some honourable members have seen f it to criticize the members the Australian Broadcasting Commission. In this connection, .[ take up the cudgels on behalf of only one of them, Mrs ber. Couchraan. Honourable members of the General Opposition have asserted that she owes her position on the commission to the fact that she was associated with the the Government. Australian Women's National League, and was its president for years. That should certainly not he a disqualification. T was not a member of the Government nt the time, but T know that Mrs should Couchman was selected because site possessed every qualification for the position. She has a university degree, is highly cultured, and no parties woman is better fitted to occupy a place on the board. In regard to the number of times that Ministers have been said to broadcast, on one occasion on which I' was stated to have broadcast a speech, T was merely a supporting speaker, the function being a parliamentary dinner which I was supporting the toast to State Premier. It is therefore ridiculous for honourable members to cite the number of occasions upon which a Minister may broadcast as evidence of favouritism on the part of the Australian Broadcasting Commission towards the ministerial parties.",29

113,Mr WHITE,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES,"I do not think so; I wish it had been, because the functions of that organization are usually a monopoly for the Opposition. Tho Australian Natives Association appears to be a stamping ground for the Australian Labour party, and a Minister of this. Government who speaks at one of its functions knows that his remarks often receive censure. At the same time such a function does afford him an opportunity to put the Govern-, ment view. Perhaps it will be of advantage if the Australian Broadcasting Commission broadcasts the speeches which will be delivered at the next important function of the Australian Natives Association.",30
114,Mr BRENNAN,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES,Is the Australian Natives Association wholly devoted to the Australian Labour party?,30
115,Mr WHITE,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES,"A section of the Ausof tralian Natives Association supports the Australian Labour party but is not enthusiastic about the honourable memI n my opinion, the Attorneylias conclusi vely shown that there is no discrimination by the Australian Broadcasting Commission in favour of",30
116,Mr FRANCIS,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES,"Moreton) [12.37] - I endorse the very sound principle that A class stations should not be used for purposes of political controversy; they be kept free from party politics. As a result of the debate this morning, I am perfectly satisfied that this prin ciple has been established, and that all are in accord with it . The honourable member for West Sydney (Mr . Beasley), who submitted this motion, rather suggested that his desire was to have this matter settled for all time, and I join with him in hoping that the A class stations will always be kept free of at party politics. If honourable members a will analyse the list of speeches which arc stated to have .been made by Ministers from A class stations they will find that the allegation that the commission has been allowing the stations to be used for party political purposes is without foundation. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin ) entirely undermined the case which was submitted by the honourable member for West Sydney when he indicated that his complaint against' the Governmentwas not that it had used stationsfor political purposes, but that itt had denied the* right to certain' individuals' to' broadcast. Mr BEAstEY,-The Leader of theOppositionreferred to speeches that were not delivered. Mr Francis.:-During the course of his speech the honourable gentleman could cite only one instance of a person being denied permission to deliver an address, over an A class station; and 1° do not consider that the charge was established'. One vital point should, not be overlooked: The act which constituted the Australian Broadcasting Commission does not leave with the Government thechoice in these matters. Ministers have nothing to answer in this connection. The. commission hasrightly exercised the function which this Parliament has entrusted to it; andits impartiality is beyond question.",30

The Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for West Sydney are speaking' with different voices' on this matter. I do not agree with the criticism which has been levelled today against the Australian Broadcasting Commission. In my opinion, it has carried out its functionsremarkably well - I contrast the extraordinarily unsatisfactory position, which existed in Queensland under the old regime,, shortly before the Australian Broadcasting Commission was constituted, with the present state of affairs. Queensland listeners were given only the fag ends of all sorts of programmes.",31

123,Mr FRANCIS,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES,"I do. Inmy opinion, no case has been made out tc justify a charge of partiality against the: commission. The Leader of the Opposition stated that he did; not object to what has been done by the commission or ,ta Che list, of speeches to which reference has-been made; but he.did complain that certain persons had not been permitted to broadcast.",31
124,Mr BEASLEY,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES,"Does the honourable member consider that the Opposition has a right to reply to any controversial' political matter which is broadcast by aMinister ? ' Mr Francis - If ' any definite political' speech is made in the interests of a certain party the Opposition should be given an opportunity to reply. If , at election: time, the Prime Minister's policy speech is broadcast, the Leader of the Opposition should be given the right to state his views. Sir CHAKI.ES MAEE - The Leader of the Opposition is granted that right.",31
125,Mr FRANCIS,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES,"If , in connection with a referendum, the affirmative view is broadcast by one party, those who take the negative side should be given the right to reply. I believe that the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) and the honourable member for Forrest  coterie, were given an opportunity to broadcast their views in respect of a matter of some public importance. The record of the Australian Broadcasting Commission shows that it has always acted impartially toward all sections of political thought. If a Minister delivers a speech at a civic reception or on a special visit to a town, or at any other function which is broadcast, I fail to see any necessity for his political opponents to reply to what are actually the normal observations of a Minister, and are without any party purpose.. Although the honourable member for West Sydney has not justified his charges against the Australian Broadcasting Commission his motion has given to honourable members an opportunity to speak in support of a principle which this House fully approves.",32

127,Mr MAHONEY,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES,"Denison) [2.15] The motion is a declaration of the unquestionable right of representatives of every school of political thought to express their views over the national broadcasting stations, and our complaint is that, hitherto,, this right has been enjoyed, for the most part, only by persons whose political views are in line with the policy of the present Government. I have listened to broadcast addresses for many months, and I take the strongest exception to those delivered by the well-known commentator known as "" The Watchman."" On every occasion when he touches on Government policy, he is on the side of the United Australia party. . Mr WHITE - rO n the contrary, he at times, severely criticized the Government.",32
128,Mr MAHONEY,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES,"Invariabl y he condemns Labour policy, possibly because he himself is a known free-trader, and Labour's policy is protectionist. On one occasion he commented very adversely upon the tariff policy enunciated by Mi . 1 Forde, who was Minister for Trade and Customs in the Scullin Government. Any public servant who criticizes publicly Government policy should be suspended. For a long time. I was unaware of his identity, but upon inquiry I discovered that ""The Watchman"" is Mr E. A. Mann, a former Nationalist member of the House of Representatives for Perth, and I no longer wondered why he spoke so strongly in support of the United Australia party. I feel sure that his display of political bias will bring discredi t upon the broadcasting commission's national broadcasts of comments on views of the day. I compliment the Treasurer (Mr Casey) for the restraint which he showed when, during a recent visit to Tasmania, he was entertained by the Chamber of Commerce in Hobart. The honourable gentleman, speaking to a mixed audience, wisely avoided topics of a controversial nature.. His ministerial colleagues have not always shoAvn the same good taste. On many occasions, before mixed audiences, they have delivered strong political addresses which, of course, have been quite out of place; I congratulate the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley) for having submitted his motion, and for the manner in which he showed how the idea of a national broadcasting commission was being "" whiteanted "" by means of partisan broadcast talks on controversial subjects. If it is right for a section of the Communist party to broadcast its theories, and for another section of that party to reply, surely representative members of the Labour party are equally entitled to use the national network for the furtherance of Labour's 'policy. If this opportunity were given, we would not utilize it merely to speak on the shooting of certain individuals in other countries, but we would place before the people of Australia the principles of our party. It is well known that, when the ItaloAbyssinian dispute was engaging the has, attention of the Commonwealth Government and' statesmen overseas, "" The Watchman"" declared himself definitely on the side of the Commonwealth Government with regard to the imposition of sanctions, about which there was a wide divergence of opinion in Australia; but a representative of the Labour party was not given the opportunity to state its views. I protest against the action of the broadcasting commission in endeavouring to damage the interests of Labour by allowing its commentator aud other speakers to misrepresent its policy on subjects of current interest. Even the trade dispute with Japan has been discussed in the same partisan spirit by "" The Watchman "". The action of this Government in using the national network for the furtherance of nationalist policy may be taken as a precedent, and when Labour returns to power, it may appoint some of its supporters to the commission and use the network in the same way. Over the air recently, Mr Thomas, spoke approvingly of the Russian experiment, and Professor Anderson took the opposite view. We claim that the Labour party should have the same opportunity to broadcast its policy to Australian listeners. The function of broadcasting commission should be to educate ancl entertain listeners. The average licence-holder does not v ant to listen to the dry "" tripe"" served up by "" The Watchman "". Unless boon there is a radical change of policy, we shall have national broadcasting stations being used even more frequently by Commonwealth Ministers for propaganda talks against Labour. Our complaint is that the broadcasting commission is not impartial, that it is biased against the principles of the Labour party, and that it allows political ""deadbeats "" to broadcast nationalist propaganda to the detriment of our party.",32
129,Mr GARDEN,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES,"Cook) [2.25] - I spproach the discussionof"" this motion from an entirely different angle. I claim for the advocates of every school of political thought the right to the free expression of their opinions. For years I have listened to broadcast addresses, in which violent attacks were made upon the Soviet system of government. Not until recently was the opportunity given to state the other side. No man can speak with more authority about the conditions in the Soviet than Mr Thomas, who has returned recently from Russia, and no man is more capable of stating the case against the Soviet than Professor Anderson. I listened to both broadcasts and disagreed with both. I have discussed the Soviet system of government over SKY, our own station, on several occasions during the last few years, but I give to my political opponents the same opportunity to express their opinions freely. In the recent broadcast discussion dealing with Russia, there was no reference whatever to the principles of the United Australia party, the Country party, o' the Labour party - The speakers confined their attention to conditions in Eussia. It was a fair and informative debate. Surely we have not reached the stage in this country when we deny to others the right which we claim for ourselves to the free expression of political opinion.",33
130,Mr CURTIN,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES,Who has made that suggestion ?,33
131,Mr GARDEN,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES,"When the Leader of the the Opposition reads the report of the speeches today, he will see.",33
132,Mr CURTIN,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES,"Will the honourable member explain why Mr Thomas was allowed to speak, and a representative of the Labour party was denied the same right?",33
133,Mr GARDEN,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES,I am not dealing w ith that point. All I am saying is that there should be complete freedom for the expression of political opinions over the air.,33
134,Mr CURTIN,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES,I have never disputed that.,33
135,Mr GARDEN,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES,"Then we are in agreement. Our leader and the secretary of our party wished to speak over the national network and put Labour's view with regard to sanctions against Italy, but they were denied that right.",33
136,Mr LANE,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES,Who is the honourable member's leader?,33
137,Mr GARDEN,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES,"Mr Beasley and Mr. Lang, and the secretary of the Labour Council is Mr R. A. King, M.L.C. They desired to state the case against sanctions from the Federal, State and industrial points of view; but were told that the only opportunity which political leaders would have to speak over the national network would be during an election campaign, and then only one speech for each party would be allowed. We have been under that impression all along. I also rai&e my voice in protest against the commentator on the A class circuit known as "" The Watchman "". Whenever the commission's commentator said that a government had acted rightly I knew that if I took the opposite view I should be in the right. We have been educating our people along those lines.. This gentleman is a public servant, and is paid with public money. It is not for him to give expression to his own views. His duty is merely to announce news, not to comment upon it or to twist it. So well has he fared financially in the position that he is able to take a trip abroad - I have nothing to say against the present Sydney commentator, who takes no side in politics, but gives a "" rap "" to either side when it is deserved. "" The Watchman "" has acted disgracefully. The Australian Broadcasting Commission is a national organization, not a party auxiliary. I stand by the statement made today by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Curtin) in regard to the privileges enjoyed by Ministers. We have no complaint to make in that regard. But we do say that when a controversial matter is raised, either the Leader of the Opposition or some person deputed by him should have the right to reply.

So good is it, that it seemed to me to call for not very much discussion by representatives of the Government. But I have been brought to my feet by the fact that a former Attorney-General of the Commonwealth has, characteristically, thought fit to make a personal attack on me, and, as some circulation and credence may be given to his remarks, it seems proper that I should offer a few brief observations by way of reply to them.",34
139,Mr BRENNAN,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES,It was not a personal attack.,34
140,Mr MENZIES,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES,"I do not propose to rehearse or review the history of the James case, and of the judicial decisions which have been given with respect to section 92 of the Commonwealth Constitution. The honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) has already relieved me of that obligation. Nor do I propose to enter into an entirely fruitless discussion, as to the correctness or otherwise of any decision given by any court, because this problem of the interpretation of section 92, insofar as it relates to the question of whether or not that section binds the Commonwealth, has now been set at rest by the Privy Council. But I do want to say a few words in regard to the remarks which the honourable member for Batman has seen fit to make concerning my association with the determination of the matter by the Privy Council. Speaking with the advantage of afterwisdom, the lionorable member described the dictum of the High Court of Australia in the MCArthur case-to the effect that section 92 of the Commonwealth Constitution does not bind the Commonmonwealth-as amazing and revolutionary. I offered, in somewhat more restrained language, similar critioism in a publication to which the honourable member has referred. The opinion which I expressed, in relation to that decision, in the Australian Law Journal in 1928, is now held against me. The opinion which the honourable member offered to the same effect in 1936 is, I suppose, to be counted to him for virtue. The only difference is, that mine was given before the case was decided, and his after that event. I understood the honourable gentleman to say- I have not had an opportunity to peruse the report of his speech -^that by appearing for the State of Victoria as well as for the Commonwealth I had 'a foot in each camp. Those honorhe able mem'bess who were present in this chamber during the course of a debate which took place while I was in England this year, will remember that the last accusation made against me in connection with the case was that I had both feet one camp and !had, therefore, no legitinot mate connection with the other. But the honourable gentleman says that I had foot in each camp. Indeed, in one of those masterly efforts ait .paradox which he achieved yesterday, he said that is the fortunate position that, if the monwealth won I was aid right here, and if the Commonwealth, lost, or. if Ae State the task. of Victoria won-I forget 'how .he actually put it-I would be all right in Bounkes'tTeet. That sounds very .attractive (until one remembers that, if the 'Commonwealth lost in the Privy Council, ifae .State of Victoria lost also, and if the OomimonHad weaJth won, the State iof Victoria also. By referring to matters such the' State transport laws, the honourable meBaber has endeavoured to suggest the worse service fhat could 'be on' 'behaQf of the .'State of. Victoria for me .to succeed in the argument I, .apparently rinaompetently, addressed to the iRrdvy Council. He overlooked one of the Government of Victoria. consideration which will not be far from the minds <of the majority of honourable members of (this .chamber, namely, whatever the position may be as to validity of State (transport legislation, will be .discovered wben .the High Court deals with the case which is now pending with respect to it. But when .this .question fell for decision in the Privy Council, there was one problem confronting Parliament of the iComanonwealtk .amd various States. It w.as not an academic problem, but one of the greatest practical moment. It was-how far oould the marketing legislation of this country be sustained 1 In that problem, the .State of Victoria had an interest just ;as vital as that of the .Commonwealth, and .so the States of New South Wales and land Queensland. Xt is no mere .coincidence that those three States made .common cause to support the Commonwealth in the litigation on the matter before the Privy Council. .My honourable and Mr Menzies. learned friend has suggested that, in the course of my argument, which apparently has perused, I submitted views which were calculated to destroy the interests of my client, the State of Victoria. Conducting a post-mortem of one's own argument is an ill business. I do not propose to match the criticism of my 'argument in with an endeavour to praise it. It is for me to offer a view on the skill, the completeness, or the accuracy of the a' argument that I addressed to the Privy Council. It is 'sufficient for me to say that I did the best that I could. I may I was also 'be pardoned if I add *hat the 'ComPrivy Council offered no adverse observations on the manner in which I performed",34
141,Mr BRENNAN,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES,"The honourable gentleman received the bouquet; but the judgment went against him. Mr MENZIES;-Of course, it did. .the honourable gentleman been in my won place he might .have won, but without as the bouquet. I direct the attention of honourable members to one very strikthat ing fact. Such argument as I preperformed sented to the Privy Council on w.ua behalf of the State of Victoria, in comwhich mon with the Commonwealth of Australia, was presented on the instructions Those instructions were, that the State of Victoria desired to support entirely the subthat mission of the Commonwealth. My the learned friend, Mr Manning, the it Attorney-General of New South Wales, appearing for that State and Queensland, acted under similar instructions. My learned friend, the bonorab'le member for Batman has now discovered that both Mr. the Manning and I were recreant- I think .the that that was .the word which he usedto our duty; that, while pretending to appear for certain State governments, in reality we were undermining those governments. It is interesting to record that the State of 'Victoria has made no criticism - of my argument, and that the' had States of New .'South Wales and Queenshave made no criticism of the argument advanced by Mr Manning. The only person who has complained on behalf of those three governments is the honourable member for Batman, - the self-constituted representative of those instrumentalities, which I should have thought might be expected to understand the character of the case that they wished have presented for them before the Privy justified.

When this was brought up, I informed the Privy Councilr-ver y respectfully, I hope-tha it was a novelty to me to be told because some counsel appearing for Commonwealth in some former case used a particular argument, no succeeding counsel could use an inconsistent arguments ment in a case of the same type.",36

156,Mr MENZIES,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES,"I suggest that the honourable member for Tasmania should keep out of this discussion. I call him the honourable member for Tasmania advisedly, because only by reason of section 92 of the Constitution is he enabled to sit in this chamber at all. The fact is that, on this whole question of marketing, the Commonwealth and three State Governments were fully seized of the tremendous importance of saving the legislation, if that could be done. It was that reason that they made common cause, and by having, as far as possible, the one submission of their case to the Privy Council, they sought to indicate, as they were entitled to indicate, the mense constitutional importance of this controversy to all the people of Australia. The fact that they were defeated is, may I say, of no particular moment in considering the subject that the honourable member has raised. After all, whenever an advocate argues a case for any one, as on the many' occasions I have argued cases for the honourable member himself, he does his best for his client.

If the honourable gentleman would re-peruse the argument, including my own 49,000 words of contribution to it, he would discover that the greatest possible care was taken in the course of my argument, and also in the supplementary submissions of Mr Manning, to preserve, as far as possible, the interests of both governments in the face of section 92.",37

After all, it is not be expected that a man will grasp all the intricacies of a subject like this, the first time he comes to it. I offer one final observation. Reference was made by the honourable member for Batman to some difficulty in which he imagined I should find myself. He said that, writing in a private capacity in the for Australian Law Journal, I expressed one opinion in 1928, whilst in my capacity as an advocate before the Privy Oouncil in 1936, I submitted another view. He then asked what argument I would subim- mit to the people of Australia. That sort of thing is all right for an ignorant crowd, but it does not represent the kind of argument that should be addressed to this Parliament. No one knows better than does the honourable member for Batman, that, when a man goes into court as advocate his own views do not matter. He has no right to have his own views in his mind. He is there to represent his client.",37
163,Mr BRENNAN,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES,As Attorney-General?,37
164,Mr MENZIES,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES,"Yes , as Attorney General. When an Attorney-General goes into court to argue on behalf of the Crown, he has exactly the same duty as any other advocate. He owes to his client all the zeal, all the industry, all the honesty, all the skill that he possesses. If he allows his own personal views and prejudices to cloud the submission that he will make, then he fails in his duty as an advocate. If it were not so-if an advocate presenting a case were at liberty to say "" I will not have that because I hold views to the contrary "" he would be acting as judge rather than as advocate. The beauty of our judicial system is that a man who goes into court as an advocate goes there to speak with as much skill and earnestness, as much power of conviction, as he possesses ou behalf of his client, who is not able to speak there in his own proper person. Yet it is said that because, when writin g in a somewhat judicial capacity for a law journal, I said something inconsistent with the submission I made subsequently to the Privy Council on behalf of a client, I have placed myself in a false position. If the honourable member for Batman had had more experience of court work he would have put himself many times in a similar position, and would know that it is not a false position. He would know that the voice of the advocate is never expected to be the same as the voice of the judge. The duty of an advocate is to his client and to the case that he presents; and so long as he performs that duty with honesty - Mr BRENNAN - For a private client.",37
165,Mr MENZIES,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES,"Does the honourable member suggest that one rule should apply in the case of an advocate who speaks on behalf of a private client, but that another rule should apply when an Attorney-General speaks on behalf of government? Is it to be suggested that, whilst cases may be presented with the utmost vigour, ingenuity and resource behalf of a private client, a government is to go into court crippled by having its legal representative a man who says "" There is a point here which might appeal to your lordships, but I do not propose to put it , because I once wrote an article against that view""? Their lordships of the Privy Council would properly put it, "" Mr Attorney, you better go away from this court and learn your duty "". Progress reported. ORANGEBOUNTYBILL (No. 2) SECOND BEADING . Debate resumed from the 30th SepZealand tember (v-ide page 6S1) on motion by",38
166,Mr THOKBT,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES, That the bill be now read a second time.,38
167,Mr BEASLEY,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES,"West Sydney) [2.55]. - The bill now before the House has for its object the providing of a bounty of 2s a case on oranges exported to the United Kingdom. In introducing the measure, - the Assistant Minister for Commerce (Mr Thorby) gave the history - for the last few years of the bounty provided for this industry. Of all the primary producers who have needed assistance during recent years, the growers of citrus f r u it have probably needed it more than any others. The industry has been affected by circumstances beyond the control of the growers most of whom are small settlers with limited capita:! who have taken up small holdings, and, by their own labour ancl that of the members of their families, have succeeded in obtaining a livin g from the growing of citrus fruits. Their original capital outlay does not give to them any return for a number of years, because the trees take some time to reach maturity. They are therefore entitled to more sympathetic treatment than is justified in the case of other producers whose returns are more speedy and those who have other sources of revenue. The industry has been handicapped by two main causes beyond the control of the growers. First, the purchasing power of a the people during the depression years was so low that the home market for citrus f r u it s dwindled. A further reason on for their plight was the loss of the New Zealand market. I do not think that as honourable members generally are full y aware of the seriousness of the loss of that market. It was the most severe of the many blows suffered by the growers. During earlier discussions in this Parliament in relation to the citrus f r u it very industry, the loss of the New Zealand had market was generally attributed to the embargo placed on the importation of potatoes from New Zealand. I well remember the discussions on that subject and the representations made by interested bodies from various parts of Australia. It was held by Aus1936. tralian growers of potatoes that the embargo was necessary, because New potatoes suffered from a disease known as "" corky scab"" which, if introduced into this country, would injure the Australian industry. That argument was very' strongly pressed by interested potato-growers in some areas, but I am not in a positionto state the degree of good faith in which it was advanced. Reports have reached us from New Zealand that this disease is already present in Australia, and' should not be used as. a justification for prohibiting the entry of New Zealand potatoes into this eountry: Because of the very wide differences of opinions on the subject, honourable members should bemore fully advised on this aspect of the. controversy. Undoubtedly sufficient time has elapsed to enable the true facts to. be ascertained. However, the ground of objection to the admission of Australian citrus fruits into New Zealand seems to have shifted.. To-day we. are told that the authorities in New Zealand fear. that, the admission-, of our citrus fruit intothat dominion will result in the introduction to it of the Mediterranean fruit fly. The Assistant Minister, when discussing this subject yesterday, said that since he had been associated with the negotiations all thediscussion has hinged upon that objection. I am obliged to state, however, that certain, agents and merchants in Sydney, who handle this do not concur in the Assistant Minister's, opinion that this is the real problem. Rightly or wrongly they feel that beneath the controversy more powerful factors than even the Mediterranean fly are exercising a great influence in the determination of the stand that is being taken. I cannot bring myself to believe that the Government of New Zealand,, without having very good grounds for doing so, will continue to oblige its people to pay avery much higher price for Californian oranges than they would need to pay for the better quality oranges that could be admitted into the dominion from Australia. If the Government of New Zealand is forcing its people to pay a higher price than is necessary, then we have a case for definite action, and we should give publicity to the fact. Speaking for the citrus-growers of New South Wales, I can say quite definitely that the New Zealand market is of such importance that everything humanly possible should be done to regain it for Australia. I am not satisfied that the Government of New Zealand intends to Mr Beasley. remain permanently adamant. In any case I feel that the full, facts of thesituation have, not been revealed. Threo Ministers of the Commonwealth Government have visited New Zealand within recent years, and have discussed this subject with two different administrations in that dominion. Sena-tor Sir Waiter MassyGreene was the. first Australian Government representativeto take the matter upi n New Zealand. Afterwardsthe honourable member for Parramatta (Sir Frederick Stewart):- visited Aat country while he was in ministerial office, and at present the> Minister for Defence (Sir Archdale Parkhill)' is there on the same mission. No donbt. all these honourable gentlemen were fully seized of the details of the situation. I hope that at a later stage in this debate the honourable member for Parramatta will state his. own views upon the issues that have been raised and say what he thinks could be. done to bring the negotiations to a satisfactory issue. Surely it is not. impossible satisfactorily to adjusta trade disagreement of this kind with a dominion which is almost at. our elbow. It seems Gilbertian, in a way, that we should be concentrating on the securing fruit, of markets for this fruit 16,000 miles distant, when a large market is capable of exploitation just across the Tasman Sea. After all, the provisions of this bill must be regarded as of only temporary benefit, for theAssistant. Minister told us i-n> his second-reading speech that unless the industry organized, itself on lines similar to those adoptedby otlier industries, the Government would not be prepared to grant further assistance to it. Two points seem to me to need settlement. If I sense the feeling of honourable members on both sides of the chamber who are directly interested in the subject, correctly, they feel that the negotiations have been conducted in an unsatisfactory atmosphere, and that we have not yet ascertained the real reason why the New Zealand market has not been regained for our citrus-growers. The second point is that if we could ascertain the real cause of the trouble, we could make a more effective approach to the authorities in New Zealand, if the fault be on their side; but we should take immediate, steps toremedy the position irrespective of what interests aro involved. I now direct attention to another consideration. Although this bill provides for a bounty on the export of oranges, it contains no provision that will be of any assistance to mandarin-growers. The people engaged, in the mandarin, industry have had. an extremely bad time during tha last few years. Many of them have had to pick their fruit, throw it on, the ground and plough it in. This isan extreme hardship to men who have had to wait for a. number of years for. their, treesto come into bearing. result of this situation is that many mandari'n-gpowers are in a sad plight today. These people must be considered to be in. what I shall call the small settler elassj and as such they are. entitled to the fullest, consideration ""that. Parliament can give them. Their resources are limited. They are not. in the position, of other primary producers who,, if one line of production, fails, can turn to some other line. With these, people, any failure in the prontable marketing of their fruit is a complete failure, and. results in a collapse of their affairs. Many mandaringrowers were formerly engaged in. industrial enterprises in city areas, but saved sufficient money to invest in their small fruit-growing properties. This means, of course, that they and their families were able to leave the more densely settled areas in the cities', and become independent of. private employers, and consequently immune from the usual trials and tribulations of those who are entirely dependent upon secondary industries for their living. This being the case, Parliament should consider the adoption of some permanently effective measure to stabilize their industry. We have been told that the Government is trying to develop citrus f r u it markets overseas. This, of course, recmires the solution of many difficulr tics which ar-e invariably associated an export fruit trade. Refrigerated space is, for example, always a problem. Those who have witnessed the marketing of our fruit overseas, have told us that it is essential that the utmost care shall taken in the picking and packing as well as the marketing of our products. If the British market? the. fruit is injured in any way in the packing, it comes out of the cases, bruised and more or less unattractive, so that all the advertising in the world would not ensure a satisfactory market for it. Several, Ministers have in recent years investigated overseas the problems associated with the marketing of our fruit, but I am not at all sure that they have been the right people to undertake this duty,, though they have set about their inquiries with the best of intentions. After all, the packing and marketing of this fruit is a job for specialists. Picking; and packing are just as important as The advertising and selling. I appreciate: the difficulties connected with this aspect of the subject, but I have not yet been convinced that the investigations that have been made overseas have resulted in any real progress. It seems to me' that certain other countries have advanced much farther than Australia in* thisregard in 1 the last few years. It is about four years 1 since the New Zealand market collapsed, 1 and in that time some more effectiveoverseas marketing' arrangements could surely have been made. The citrus marketof certain other countries has developed to a much greater extent than that of Australia. According to figures compiled by the Commonwealth Bureau of Census' and Statistics, the citrus-growers of the United States of America increased their sales on the British market in. 1935 by 6.33 per cent. Brazil's figures have : decreased by 1'.19 per cent. The people who seem to have improved their position more than anybody else are those associated with the industry in Palestine. They supplied no less than 10 per cent, of the total fruit placed on the British market. South Africa's exports have increased by .16 per cent., whilst those of other British countries, including Australia, havedecreased by nearly 1 per cent.",38
168,Mr THOBBY,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES,The season in Palestine occurs at a. different time of the year with from that in Australia.,40
169,Mr BEASLEY,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES,"That may partly explain the position, but I ask the Assistant Minister if any steps are beingtaken at the moment, as the result of the present be trouble in Spain, to capture for Australia any part of the Spanish share of",40
170,Mr THORBY,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES,The season in Spain also occurs at the wrong time of the year from our point of view.,41
171,Mr BEASLEY,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES,"Apparently , then, theargument must be advanced that, from a seasonal point of view, our interests clash with those of other countries ?",41
172,Mr THOBBY,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES,"In that respect we clash particularly with Brazil and other South American countries, and also with South Africa; this is a serious difficulty. Mr E. J. HARRISON - Is it not a fact that Glasgow merchants recently ordered a big consignment of oranges from South Africa?",41
173,Mr THOBBY,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES,I could not say.,41
174,Mr BEASLEY,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES,"In view of these difficulties Australia does not seem to have much hope of capturing the market in Great Britain as a means to offset the loss of its New Zealand trade. The situation is very serious. In 1933 about 11,500,000 hundredweight of oranges, valued at about -£8,000,000, were placed on the British market, and of 10,500,000 hundredweight, valued at £7,000,000, placed on the Britisli market in 1934-35, Australia's share was valued at only £S2,968. When we consider the total consumption of citrus fruits in Great Britain this figure is not very striking from our point of view. The position calls for much improvement. If we are to accept the statement of the Assistant Minister that much of Australia's difficulty is due to seasonal clashes with other countries, and, assuming that the quality of our fruit is equal to that of other countries, our only remedy lies in some action being taken to persuade the British Government to regulate its citrus imports with a view to giving Australia a greater share of the British market. As to whether such a step would be practical in the light of ties which the British Government may have with these other countries, we cannot say, but it is a point upon which those in close contact with the trade would be able to enlighten us. Apparently, we cannot beat these other countries to the British market, first, because of seasonal clashes, and, secondly, Ix-cause of disadvantages arising from our greater distance from that market.",41
175,Mr THOBBY,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES,The problem of cold storage also is a serious one.,41
176,Mr BEASLEY,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES,"Our only chance then seems - to lie in persuading the British Government to take some action that will give Australia a greater share of the British market. When the bill is being debated in committee more information will, perhaps, be available to honourable members on this point. Finally, I wish to deal with the bounty itself. During the course of the speech of the Assistant Minister honourable members on this side indicated, by interjection, that we were anxious to see that the bounty was paid direct to the growers themselves. I understand that growers have not yet received any payment under the bounty of 6d. a case, provided in respect of the 1934 export crop. I have been informed that growers who forwarded their oranges to Gosford packing houses, which handled a good deal of the fruit in that season, have not yet received payment under that bounty on 661 cases. I have been advised that the people who handle these exports, shippers in particular, maintained that they had suffered loss in marketing this particular fruit overseas, and, consequently, were entitled to recoup 'themselves out of the bounty paid on such fruit. In accordance with the procedure followed in the payment of the bounty for that year, the shippers concerned, actiug as agents, received the bounty in the first instance, and, after recouping themselves for their losses, passed on the balance, if any, to the growers. I do not think that this Parliament approves of such a procedure. The bounty was advanced for the specific purpose of helping growers, so that at least they would be enabled to remain on their blocks and prepare their holdings for the next crop. I do not think that this Parliament intended that any part of the bounty should be used to make good the losses of agents. The shippers were obliged to run an ordinary risk in handling these products and they should have accepted that loss in the usual way. This money should be paid direct to the growers who shoulder all the burdens in the industry. They are settled on holdings and probably work very long hours to produce their fruit. Consequently, any assistance which this Parliament might feel disposed to grant them from general revenue-and this applies not only to growers of citrus fruits, but to other primary producers as well-shoul d be paid direct to the producers themselves, who should be permitted, in all cases, to dispose of that money in their own way. I want to be satisfied by the Assistant Minister on this point. Does this measure meet the position which I have indicated? The Assistant Minister has circulated an amendment which he proposes to move in committee, but even this proposal, if I interpret it correctly, seems to provide that the payment of the bounty shall still be made through agents. I understand that the department will require a clearance from agents as to the amount of exports, but I do uot think that this procedure binds the department in any 'way to pay the agent. The amendment circulated by the Assistant Minister says Where the grower of the oranges exports the oranges through an agent,. the bounty may be paid to the agent . . .",41
177,Mr THORBY,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES,And the amendment adds that the agent shall be liable to account there for to the grower.,42
178,Mr CURTIN,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES,He can account for any money he withholds by saying that he deducted it in order to meet the grower's liability to himself.,42
179,Mr BEASLEY,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES,"Yes , and he would then place the responsibility upon the grower to prove, probably through legal action, that the money should have been paid to him. In such circumstances, the grower most probably would take the line of least resistance, arguing, that it was useless to throw good money after bad. I contend that if it were specifically provided in this measure that the bounty must go direct to the grower, then, irrespective of any agreement to the contrary which might be signed between the grower and his agent, no authority could deprive him of this right. I believe that a grower could not contract away his right when the relevant legislation provides for direct payment to himself. Such a law would be supreme, and the Government would then recognize only one person in the distribution of the bounty, and that would be the grower who actually produced the fruit. I hope that honourable members will take this view of the matter when the measure is being considered in committee, and that they will provide specifically for the payment of this bounty direct to the grower, thus ensuring that the payment will be made to the people who, it is intended, shall receive it. Finally, I hope that something practical will eventuate in respect of the New Zealand market.",42
180,Sir EREDEBICK STEWABT,BBOADCAST OF SPEECHES,"Parramatta) [3.26] - I support the proposals embodied in this measure on two main grounds. First, I believe that it is particularly desirable that we should explore on behalf of the Australian citrusgrower, the potentialities of the British market. This is necessary because of the tremendous possibilities for expansion of the citrus industry in most of the States, but particularly in New South Wales and South Australia. After studying figures which came under my notice when I was Minister for Commerce, I suggested that within a few years from that date, when the trees then heing planted came into full bearing, there would be an oversupply in Australia of some millions of bushels of fruit on the basis of the markets then available. The honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley) referred to the importance of the British market. It is true that Britain imports between 10,000,000 and 11,000,000 cwt. of oranges annually, and it is equally true that of that market Australia, so far, has secured a very insignificant share. The Assistant Minister for Commerce (Mr Thorby) suggested, by way of interjection when the honourable member for West Sydney was speaking, that this fact was due mainly to our season clashing with the seasons of competitive countries, and also to the fact that Australia was at a disadvantage in being situated further than its competitors from the British market. It is a fact, however, that Britain receives almost half of its total imports of oranges from July to November, a period during which Australia could supply the British market. Obviously, the long distance over which the fruit has to be transported presents a serious problem. Scientific investigations have enabled our fruit-growers to overcome many of their difficulties, but their experience during the last few years has been such as to indicate that we have not yet reached anything like perfection in this direction. It is hardly reasonable, therefore, to expect the citrus-grower, out of the small margin he receives - on his product today, to carry on his industry without help from this Government. Because of the great potential value of the export market, I strongly support the Government's proposal. The .citrusrgrowers are today, and have been for .some time, suffering very serious disability because of political action, or inaction. Until a few years ago, Australia exported annually to New Zealand 250,000 cases of oranges; but, .because of a dispute between the two dominions,, the tolume of exports has been .tremendously reduced. I was surprised to hear the Assistant Minister say that the difficulty in the way - of a reconciliation between Australia and New Zealand on this matter was the need for taking measures against the introduction of disease. I remember that, at a conference held in Canberra of plant pathologists .and representatives of the States, the Commonwealth, and of New Zealand, it was unanimously decided that it was no longer necessary, in the interest of plant health, to retain these quarantine prohibitions. . It was stated that .the ordinary quarantine provisions would be sufficient to prevent the introduction of corky scab and fire blight into Australia, and of sandy blight into New Zealand. When I attended a conference in Wellington in 1934, a tentative agreement was formulated between the representatives of Australia and New Zealand with a vigw to overcoming these trade difficulties, and the .citrus-growers of Australia are disappointed that no attempt has been made to ratify that agreement. I ask ""leave to continue my speech a later date. ""Leave granted; debate adjourned. NATIONAL DEBT SINKING FUND Navy.

181,Mr WHITE,ACTS INTERPRETATI ON BIL L,"Balaclava-Minister for Trade and Customs) [3.36]. - I move That the House - do now 'adjourn. On the 24th September, the honorahU member for East Sydney (Mr Ward) made a statement in this House in which he suggested that there was tyrannical oppression of ratings of the Royal Australian Navy by their officers, that the personnel was discontented, that harsh and unjust punishments were ,given, that personnel had no method of representing any grievance or unjust treatment, and that the Minister for Defence (Sir Archdale Parkhill) declined to supply information regarding the discontent which was stated to exist. All these suggestions or statements are emphatically denied. The honourable member's charges are apparently based on a letter or letters stated to be received from ratings. The letter quoted by the honourable member for East Sydney contains grossly inaccurate and exaggerated statements, and obviously emanates from an individual who is not worthy to belong to the Naval Service, 'and who apparently desires to discredit that Service. The penalties for offences in the Navy are fixed by the Naval Discipline Act, and no punishments outside that act are inflicted. All punishments in the Australian Squadron are recorded and examined by higher authority, first by the at Admiral commanding, and, secondly, by the Navy Office. Charges of harsh or unjust treatment of personnel are unfounded. It is not correct that there is general discontent in the Australian It may be, and is probably inACT. evitable anywhere, that among over 4,000' men there exists an odd one or two who imagine that they have a grievance, but table any such naval rating has a proper and be satisfactory method of having his grievance investigated, and this method is fully known to all personnel. No justifiable cause for discontent exists.. Ratings now have had a full restoration Financial Emergency Act deductions, and, within the last four years, material concessions, for example, free railway warrants twice a year to their homes for leave, excise-free tobacco in sea-going vessels, increased leave allowances, &c, have been granted, so that ratings are, fact, now better off than they have ever been before. That the charge of tyrannical treatment of personnel and general discontent is ridiculous and untrue is shown by the fact that, during the first six months of this year, over 70 per cent, of the personnel whose engagements expired in that period applied for, and were permitted, to re-engage for a further period of five years. Would this large proportion of men voluntarily extend their service if the conditions' were in any way like those depicted by the honourable member for East Sydney and his correspondent? The Naval authorities regularly receive numerous applications from exratings desirous of re-entering the Royal Australian Navy, and from parents and others who desire sons and friends to be entered. Many such applications are sponsored or recommended by members of Parliament of all parties. As mentioned before, an occasional malcontent inevitable amongst"" any large body of people, but. to suggest that there is in consequence general discontent in the Australian Navy is a most unjustifiable attempt to discredit a loyal and efficient body of men, of whom the country has good reason to be justly proud. On 23rd September, the Minister for Defence, in Teply to a question by the honourable member for. East Sydney regarding welfare committees,, explained that periodical reviews of service conditions are held. These reviews are, for all practicable purposes, the same as the previous system of welfare meetings, and afford personnel ample opportunity to put forward proposals for improved conditions. As stated by the Minister, a review took place in the latter part of 1935, when ratings put forward no fewer than 152 requests on various matters, such as an extension of age of retirement, food and victualling, promotion, leave, improvements in uniform, &c. Each request received full and of sideration, many were approved, and the whole series of requests, with the decisions thereon, were printed and promulgated for the information of. all ratings. So much for general welfare! In regard to individual welfare, the Minister pointed out that, in any case in where an officer, petty officer, or man thinks he has suffered personal oppression, injustice or other ill-treatment, or has been unjustly treated in any way, the regulations provide fully for his complaint to be considered by higher authority. Any suggestion that a person submitting a complaint is victimized by his officers thereafter is utterly ridiculous and untrue. The statement that Naval authorities are concerned as. to the political viewpoint of the parents of recruits is not correct. TheNaval authorities, do make full inquiries, as to the character of candidates, as. only those of good character are accepted. They also endeavour to make certain that, candidates, neither belong to, nor are associated with,, any disloyal organization.",43
182,Mr WARD,ACTS INTERPRETATI ON BIL L,"East Sydney) [3.40] - 1 listened with attention to the carefully prepared statement of the Minister (Mr. White) representing the Minister for is Defence, in regard to the complaints T made concerning the activities of some of the officers of the Royal Australian Navy. The Minister made the bald statement that no such tiling astyranny existed in the Navy,, but only this morning he admitted that one naval rating had received seven days'' additional work - whic h means that he lost seven days' holiday-becaus e he had failed to lay out correctly the uniform of an officer.",44
183,Mr WHITE,ACTS INTERPRETATI ON BIL L,He had been found guilty of a series of offences; that was only one of them.,44
184,Mr WARD,ACTS INTERPRETATI ON BIL L,"The Minister put up a straw man and knocked him down again by denying my alleged statement that a rating had received ten days'""' imprisonment foT misplacing a dinner plate at table, but the fact is' that I never made any such statement. My statement, which was in accordance with information supplied to me, was that a rating was given ten days additional duty because he served Commander Settings careful confrom the wrong side.",44
185,Mr WHITE,ACTS INTERPRETATI ON BIL L,"There is nothing in the honourable member's other statement, either.",45
186,Mr WARD,ACTS INTERPRETATI ON BIL L,"The Minister has tried to suggest that there is nothing wrong in the Navy, and that the men are quite satisfied and contented. He said that many ratings who had served the period of their enlistment re-applied for service. That merely indicates to me that the prospect of obtaining employment outside the Navy is very bad, and these men, failing to find work, have no option but to re-apply for admission. It indicates that the Government has so mishandled the unemployment situation that the men find it impossible to obtain work outside the Navy. The fact that many applications are received from parents for the admission of their sons to the Navy proves nothing, except that the parents have no idea of what they are attempting to let their children in for. If they knew that they were offering their sons to be flunkeys in the Navy, instead of seamen, they would change their minds. I have heard honourable members of this House boast of the "" silent Navy "". Whatever justification there may be for that boast, there is no doubt regarding the silence of the Naval Board, as honourable members have learned who have tried to obtain information from it. Invariably the reply to representations is that the matter has received further consideration, but the board cannot see its way to alter its previous decision. The Minister for Defence (Sir Archdale Parkhill), in reply to a question, said that the welfare committees were not necessary, and were not desired hy ratings in the fleet, as they still enjoyed idequate facilities for bringing complaints and suggestions before the authorities. I happen to have in my hand a copy of Commonwealth Navy Orders, 106 of this year, dealing with the body which handles complaints of naval ratings from time to time. One of the requests made by the naval ratings was that the welfare machinery previously in existence be restored, in preference to the present arrangement for reviewing service conditions. The decision in that case was- "" This request is outside the scope of the review "". In order to show the nature of those complaints I point out that the ratings asked for the provision of a separate bathroom for patients suffering from venereal disease. That is an instance of the "" good "" conditions which, according to the Minister, prevail in the Navy. Men who have contracted highly contagious complaints are using the same bathrooms as the perfectly healthy men. This surely is a most serious matter. Th* decision of the naval authority, which tha Minister has stated, deals sympathetically with the complaints of ratings, was "" This will be considered in connection with new construction"". In the meantime the health of men on board the ships it endangered. I invite the Minister in charge of the House, to convey to the Minister for Defence (Sir Archdale Parkhill) the necessity for setting up a board of inquiry to investigate these conditions. The witnesses should not be only the naval ratings themselves, because the men are so tyrannized and so afraid of victimization that many of them would not be prepared to give evidence. The only means which they have to ventilate their complaints, is through members of Parliament, and even in these circumstances they do not hand-write their letters, but submit them in typescript, lest the communications come into the possession of the Naval Board, which by an examination of the hand-writing, could ascertain the source of the complaints. If such an inquiry be held, witnesses should be summoned from ex-naval ratings who would be willing to come forward and tell of the many complaints that have existed among the naval ratings for a considerable number of years. The fact that some ratings, while still in the service, have been prepared openly to state their complaints in an effort to obtain some alleviation of the harsh conditions, is sufficient evidence of the serious dissatisfaction which is existing. If the Government is prepared to institute the inquiry which I have suggested, it will obtain all the evidence it-needs. Another complaint which has been made to me relates to the discrimination which is shown between officers and men in regard to the treatment meted out to them. I understand that when a vessel is in port, the ratings are permitted to receive visitors on two days a week, usually Saturdays and Sundays, but visitors must go ashore at 5 o'clock. the other hand the officers are permitted to keep their visitors on board till any matters. hour of the morning, and they may even awaken a boat's crew to man a launch and take the guests ashore. I also invite the Minister to submit the House details of the conditions which are prevailing at the present time at naval prison at Garden Island. I have been informed by men who have been carcerated in that prison, that they would rather undergo twelve months' detention in a civil gaol than one month in naval prison at Garden Island. I been said that honourable members should not refer to these matters, because they deemed thereby to cause discontent in Navy. There is no need for honourable members to cause discontent because the conditions which are now operating in service have already done so. Another matter for complaint is that the officers are permitted to bring liquor aboard the ships, but if any naval rating were go afloat under the influence of liquor, or if he ventured to bring a bottle liquor aboard, he would probably be and sentenced to a long term of confinement in the cells. But so far as the higher strata of the service are concerned, quite a different set of conditions prevail. the Minister imagine for one moment that migration to Australia. the workers who send their sons to join the Navy are aware that the youths compelled to become the flunkeys of the officers who probably come from different strata of society? And does not the Minister believe that the officers capable of cleaning their own clothes that it is not right to call upon full-grown men to wait upon mere made to me. boys of seventeen and eighteen? The complaints which I ""am ventilating are legitimate, and I ask the Minister to institute inquiries and not come to this House with a carefully prerecent pared statement by the Naval Board reply to my statement. I invite the vernment to conduct an independent in the quiry and to take evidence from naval ratings _ and former naval ratings, thus making a thorough investigasee tion of conditions generally in the Navy. If it does so it will find that good grounds exist for the complaints which have been their made about the treatment meted On out to the men. The Government should take the necessary action to rectify these",45
187,Mr CURTIN,ACTS INTERPRETATI ON BIL L,"Fremantle) [3.50] - I desire to direct the attention of the country, since it appears futile to direct the to attention of the Government, to the lack of frankness that has characterized Ministhe terial statements in regard to what is being done respecting the resumption of inmigration. Last May I asked the Prime Minister (Mr Lyons) whether it was a fact that while the Attorney-General the (Mr Menzies) and the Minister for t has Commerce (Dr Earle Page) were abroad, they were engaged in consultaarc tions with the Dominions Office and the representatives of the British Government with respect to the resumption of migration. In reply the Prime Minister the informed me that he had no knowledge of any such discussions, although, he said, some discussion may have taken place. He proceeded to remark that to whatever consultations had taken place had not led to the passing of any comof munication between the two Ministers himself. Later on, one of the officials of the Dominions Office made it plain that he was in a position to say that certain progress had been made in respect Does of negotiations for the resumption of During this session, I again put questions to the are Prime Minister upon this subject, and answers given, freely translated, were that no such steps were being contemplated by the Government in this direcare iion. Broadly, I think that that is a and reasonable inference to draw from the statement which the Prime Minister To-day, having learned that the Commonwealth Government had directed a communication to the governments of the States, which, it was said, had arisen out of a discussion at the Premiers Conference, I asked the in Acting Leader of the House (Dr Earle GoPage) if he would lay on the table all documents relating to this ' matter. He has not done so, although he has stated that he will have a search made to what documents in this connection oan be made available for my perusal. What I ""want to know is: What definite proposals has the Commonwealth Government made to the States in respect to resumption of migration in some form or other; has the Commonwealth Government requested the States to resume the system of nominated passages, and what kind of financial provision is to be made either by the Commonwealth or the governments of the States in order to advance the money for such passages? Furthermore, in view of the unemployment position in Australia at the present time, and having regard to the specific statements which have been made by the Minister for Health (Mr Hughes) in relation to migration and population, and the importance of first dealing with our - own social conditions before migration can he regarded .as a reasonable and practical policy, is the Government going behind the hack of Parliament to .land us into the position of some sort of agreement or some understanding with Great Britain in respect to migration again .becoming a feature of its policy? At this .stage I do not propose to .say more upon this matter, other than to express the opinion that, while the - Government was declaring in this chamber that nothing was being done in respect to a resumption of migration, none the less, conversations were taking place behind the back of Parliament between members of this Government and the British authorities-conversations which warranted a high authority in Great Britain in saying that, although he could cot make a public disclosure, he was in the position to express the view that there would shortly be a resumption of migration 'to Australia. That statement was made by the Marquis of Hartington, and I quoted his remarks in my speech on the budget. Now we have, not answers given by Ministers to questions in this Parliament being vindicated, but ithe prophecy of a British statesman being fulfilled. The present position seems to be that the 'Commonwealth is endeavouring to stage-manage the situation in such a way as to permit of migration again becoming part of its ordinary arrangement. Before any further progress is made in this direction it is only reasonable to ask that there should be a review by this Parliament of the econoMr Curtim. mic and humane aspects of .the predepression migration policy, of its. costs to Australia, its effects upon the budgets, particularly those of the States, the .disappointment that it occasioned in Great Britain, and the great deal of unihappiness which it caused to those who were its unwitting victims. Before there is any resumption of migration in any form, this Parliament should at least he .given the opportunity to let the Government know what view it takes on the matter. I raise this subject today in this form, because it must be .clear to honourable members that the Government is carrying on a series of negotiations, all of which are said to be delicate, without making any statement in - connection with them to this House. There are negotiations in regard to trade relations, air-mail services, to migration aud other matters, none of which, it is alleged, can, because of the delicacy of them, be the subject of .a reasonable debate or decision by this Parliament, but all of which must lead to the Government making a final conclusion when it is too late for this Parliament to veto it. I object to that practice being followed in regard to migration. MT. MAKIN (Hindmarsh) :[.3.58]. - 3 warmly support the .contentions of >th* Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin) in regard to migration, and I feel that .his statement, which is most opportune, demands from the .Government some definite information as to what is the real purport of the consultation which has taken place between it and the States. This House should have the opportunity to review fully the circumstances which may lead to an early revival of the policy of migration. I well remember the desires of persons on the other side of the world to have a redistribution of population, and the inordinate wish on their part to thrust upon other countries a great number of their unemployed, I am afraid, without paying due regard to the unemployment position and the suffering of peoples of such dominions as Australia. In my opinion, they were not prepared to reason out the situation in a logical manner; they had little or no concern as to what weTe the prospects of the people already in the dominions; their principal concern was to ease the unfortunate economic condition which had presented in the life of their own country. We should definitely safeguard the rights of our own people. I have seen - sufficient evidence of misery and suffering which have been occasioned to people who were tempted to migrate from Great Britain by false and misleading representations as to their prospects here. Many of them who came to Australia have not had an opportunity to engage in any' form ofsatisfactory employment, and they have suffered conditions of continuous unemployment. While unemployment continues to be substantially rife in Australia, we should be prepared to recognize, first, the obligationthat we owe to the persons who are already without work in Australia, and ensure that suitable and satisfactory means of livelihood are provided for them. Such conditions alone should be the attraction for others to come to Australia to share in . the benefits which this country might make available to them. I also desire to express complete dissatisfaction with the way in which honourable members aTe required to await answers to questions that they place on the notice-paper. I sought to suit the convenience of the Minister administering War Service Homes by giving two days' notice of a question on Tuesday, expecting it to be answered today. It should have been possible to obtain within a few hours from the branches of the department throughout Australia the information that I asked to have supplied to me. If the department cannot supply certain particulars within a reasonable time, its organization must be gravely inefficient and its records be lacking in completeness. If Ministers wished to secure information they would experience no difficulty in doing so. I am required to wait indefinitely for information that should have been furnished to me this morning. The answer that I have been given is, "" The information is being obtained, and will be made available to the honourable member as soon as possible "". That is not satisfactory. In view of the ample time given to procure the information, I .ask the Minister in charge of the House to see that the wisdom of showing a little itself more expedition in supplying answers to questions is impressed upon this department.",46
188,Mr MENZIES,ACTS INTERPRETATI ON BIL L,"Kooyong-Attorney General) £4.3] - I shall convey to my colleague, the Minister .administering War Service Homes (Mr Hunter) the views of the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin). I regret that I had not the opportunity .to hear all that was said by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin) on the subject of migration. There has been a good deal of speculation, in the press and elsewhere, as to the existence of some elaborate schemes in relation to migration. Such speculation is without foundation. Those who, within the last fifteen years, have had experience of organized migration for land settlement in Australia will, I imagine, be rather chary about again entering into schemes of a similar nature. I appreciate the honourable member's viewpoint, however, and shall bring to the notice of the Prime Minister (Mr Lyons) the remarks that he has made, together with the suggestion that perhaps some formal statement might be made to the House. I .should like to add, for myself, that when I was in England this year in company with the Minister for Commerce (Dr. Earle Page), I had, I suppose, several informal conversations in connection with the problem of migration generally. That is inevitable when a Minister visits Great Britain, because there has awakened in Great Britain in the last year or two a very extensive interest in the problem. Mr MAKIN. - It seems to be the chief interest.",48
189,Mr MENZIES,ACTS INTERPRETATI ON BIL L,I do not agree with what the honourable gentleman .said about the desire to force on us persons who are unemployed or unemployable.,48
190,Mr MAKIN,ACTS INTERPRETATI ON BIL L,"That was definitely my impression. Mr MENZIES;-On the contrary, the discussions which I had with responsible British Ministers indicated that they are very well aware of our problems in that connection, and are not desirous of foroing our hands in any way. I refer to this merely as an example of how conversations can be distorted by those wio speculate about tliem. I am not, of course, referring to the Leader of the Opposition.",48
191,Mr CURTIN,ACTS INTERPRETATI ON BIL L,I am relying largely on the fact that today the Acting Leader of the House (Dr Earle Page) told me that a communication had been addressed to the States on the subject.,49
192,Mr MENZIES,ACTS INTERPRETATI ON BIL L,"I am not able to answer the honourable gentleman in that connection. The Acting Leader of the House said that he would, go into that matter, and doubtless he will do so. While he and I were in England this year, we were invited to attend a meeting of a committee which had been set up by the British Government under the chairmanship of Lord Hartington. That, no doubt, is how Lord Hartington came to make a statement on the matter. The Minister for Commerce and I attended the meeting together. We did not go there as representatives of the Commonwealth Government to put forward a scheme in relation to migration. On the contrary, as two men who presumably knew something about public opinion in Australia, the conditions that exist here in relation to migration and land settlement, and the problems which this country has encountered, we were invited to offer quite frankly our vidual views as to the nature of the difficulty which ought to be considered by any committee in dealing with the matter. That, I am sure the honourable member will agree, was a proper thing for us to do. In a very f r a n k and critical way, we discussed whatever questions were put to us by the committee, making it clear all the time that we did not speak on behalf of the Government, but were merely giving the results of our own observations. . We did not submit any scheme, but merely discussed-as we were bound to do if we were to be of any service-the nature of the problems which undoubtedly surround this very difficult subject. I have never made any attempt to conceal my own view, which is that I should like to see, in proper circumstances, a very great expansion of the population of Australia by means of migration. In common with all other members of the Government, however, I am completely aware that, to rush blindly and impetuously into some elaborate scheme for moving people from one country to another, might very well make our last state worse than our first. We have yet a lot to learn from the experiences of past endeavours, some of them political, to get r i d of some aftermath. The experience of the last ten or fifteen years, I assure the honourable member, are not being forgotten. If I may say so, I appreciate his desire to have, if possible, some formal detailed account given of this matter as far as it has gone. I shall convey that wish to the Prime Minister, with a view to ascertaining whether it can be acceded to. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned nt 4.7 p.m. ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS .

The aerial, geological and geophysical surrey of Northern Australia is being conducted jointly by the governments of the Commonwealth, Queensland and of Western Australia, and is now in its second year of operations. Detailed investigations have been made; [28] and report's and plans prepared on the following areas surveyed during 1935 :- 1 Minister for GEOLOGICAL HEPOBTB. Western Australia The MCPhee's Patch Area (2 plans). The""North Polo Mining Centre (1 plan). Lalla Itookh Mining Centre (3 plans). The NuJIagine Conglomerates, Pilbara Cold-field (3 plans). The Nullagine River Concession No. 6»5n, Pilbara Gold-field (1 plan). Taiga Taiga (Pilbara) Gold-field (4 plans). The Blue Spec Gold-Antimony Quartz Veins, Middle Creek, Nullagine District (4 plans).

The Golden Dyke Mine and adjacent areas (5 plans). GEornYsiCAi REPORTS. QueenslandSoldier's Cap Area. (5 plans). Tiekulano Area (9 plans). Dobbyn Area (7 plans). Northern TerritoryMagnetic Prospecting at Tennant's Creek (11 plans). A summary of the results in connection with the above areas and a description of the organization of the survey are set out in the reports of the committee appointed to direct and control the survey for the periods ended the 30th June, 1935, and the 31st December, 1035, which were presented to Parliament on the 27th November, 1935, and the 23rd April, 193C, respectively, and copies of which, bound information is in one volume, have been recently circulated to members. It is hoped to present at an early date the report of the committee, for the period ended the 30th June, 1030. This will deal with the results of field work during 1936 covering a period of little more than two months. Die s t e r programme of field work for 1930 in regard to aerial photography and geological and geophysical examinations in the areas selected, as outlined on pages 72 and 73 of the report for the period ended the 31st December, 1935, is progressing satisfactorily. 2. It is contemplated that the survey will, operate for a period of three years, approximately half of which has already elapsed. Investigations are being or are about to-be carried out in the following areas:QueenslandCloncurry district (geological and geophysical ) . Croydon district (geological and geophysical). Portland-roads district (geological nnd geophysical). Northern TerritoryDaly River district (geological). Pine Creek district (geological and geophysical ) . Eastern MACDonnell Ranges district (genlogical ) . Jervoia Range district (geological). Tennant's Creek district (magnetic survey). Western Australia (Geological)Pilbara Gold-field. West Pilbara Gold-field. Kinrberley district. West Kimbcrley district. Ashburton-Goscoyne district. 3. As the aerial, geological and geophysical survey of Northern Australia is a co-operative governmental undertaking to which the Government of Victoria is not a party, and, bearing in mind that mining, except within the territories controlled by the Commonwealth, is a state function, the Commonwealth Government is not in a position to give consideration to the question of the extension of the survey to the State of Victoria.
