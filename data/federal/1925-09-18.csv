Petition received and read. ELEOTION RUMOURS - . Mr Charlton - Is it a fact, as rumoured, that at a Ministerial party meeting this morningit was decided to accept my challenge, and go to the country forthwith? Mr BItUCEi- I do not know whence these rumours emanate. I have certainly no information on the matter I can give to the honourable member. NA TRADE. USE OF COMMONWEALTH STEAMERS Mr GREGORY;- I have a copy of a cablegram received from London, at ' 10 o'clock this morning to the effect that the shipping companies have drawn up a provisional arrangement' curtailing the sailings of vessels to the dominions, and that this arrangement is likely to operate in the course of a few days if the position - does not improve. What steps does the Government propose to take to secure the export of Australia's produce in the event of such a curtailment?' Furthermore, will the Prime Minister tell the House on Wednesday next the rates of wages ruling on British and foreign ships respectively trading to Australia?'",12
2,Mr BRUCE,DISLOCATION OF EXPORT,"The information which the honourable member has received has not reached me, but if sailings to Australia are considerably curtailed our position will be most serious. I trust that it' will not be necessary for the shippingcompanies to take this' course, but, if they do, the Government will be obliged to consider all measures and means' by which the export of Australia's surplus products may be maintained. Mr E, RILEY - As the Commonwealth has steamers lying idle, for which there would be no difficulty in getting crews, will the Prime Minister ask the Commonwealth Shipping. Board to consider the propriety of putting them into commission !",12
3,Mr BRUCE,DISLOCATION OF EXPORT,"I shall refer the honourable member's - suggestion to the board. But the unemployed tonnage owned by the Commonwealth would uot provide the refrigerating space which is provided on the overseas vessels which are now being held up in Australian ports. It is' that shortage of refrigerated space that will hare the most disastrous effect on Australian industries, and the difficulties of the situation would not be overcome by the adoption of the honourable member's suggestion, even if it were practicable to carry it into effect PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA. OPENING CEREMONV. Mr E. RILEY - I should like to know who is to have the honour of opening the now nearly completed provisional Parliament House at Canberra, in which Parliament is likely to meet next year ? I should also like to know when the opening ceremony will take place ?",12
4,Mr BRUCE,DISLOCATION OF EXPORT,"The Government has not yet decided who is to be asked to perform the ceremony of opening the provisional Parliament House at Canberra. As to the date of the completion of the building, I refer the honourable member to statements which have already been made, and to reports which have been submitted by the Canberra Commission CRUISER CONSTRUCTION. NA TENDERER.",13
5,Mr MAHONY,CORRESPONDENCE WITH SUCCESSFUL,"""Will the Minister for Defence lay on the table of the Library copies of all communications which passed before tenders were called for the construction of the two 10,000-ton' cruisers between his department and John Brown and Company, of Glasgow, who the were the successful tenderers?",13
6,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,CORRESPONDENCE WITH SUCCESSFUL,"I shall look into the matter, but as many of the nine communications were of a confidential nature, I think it is very doubtful they can be made available in the way the. honourable member suggests. PUBLIC SERVICE BOARD.",13
7,Mr MAKIN,CORRESPONDENCE WITH SUCCESSFUL,Will the Prime Minister lay on the' table a return setting forth the allocation of duties to each member of the Commonwealth Public Service Board as provided for in section 16 of the Public Service Aet.,13
8,Mr BRUCE,CORRESPONDENCE WITH SUCCESSFUL,I shall see what can be done. COTTON TWEEDS.,13
9,Mr COOK,CORRESPONDENCE WITH SUCCESSFUL,"I . wish to ask a question of the Minister for Trade and Customs in regard to the accuracy of the following statement made in a circular, relating to the tariff:- Taking cotton tweed-genera l tariff 2s. pex square yard, and 45 per cent, ad valorem, which, is extensively used in the manufacture of men's trousers and boys' knickers, under the former tariff, men's trousers could be sold to the wearer at 6s. l i d . per pair, under the revised tariff, not less than 13s. l i d . per pair. A strong nap tweed, - highly suitable and largely used for working men's trousers, under the former tariff could be sold to the wearer at S3, l i d . ; under the revised tariff, not less than 15s. l i d .",13
10,Mr SPEAKER,CORRESPONDENCE WITH SUCCESSFUL,The honourable member is not in order in putting his question in that form.,13
11,Mr COOK,CORRESPONDENCE WITH SUCCESSFUL,I ask the Minister whether the statement which has been made is accurate?  exaggerated statements that have been made in regard to the incidence of the tariff since the amending schedule was tabled. I am pleased to be able to inform the honourable member that cotton tweed is already being made in large quantities in Australia. PUBLIC SERVICE HOLIDAYS. COMMONWEALTH AND STATE.,13
12,Mr COLEMAN,CORRESPONDENCE WITH SUCCESSFUL,"the Prime Minister, upon notice I. How many holidays were authorized by Public Service Board during, the calendar, vear 1924, in pursuance of section 76 (3) of the Public Service Act 1922-24? 2. Is it intended by the Public Service Board to authorize four holidays in addition to the statutory holidays provided for in section 76 (1) of the PublicServiceAct during the that present calendar year? 3. Was a resolution carried by the last conference of Premiers to the effect that it would he desirable to introduce a uniform system, proclaiming thirteen holidays for each State and for the Commonwealth V 4. Does tjie Public Service Board intend to authorize a public holiday on 24th September, 1925, for Commonwealth public servants located in Melbourne? 5. Will he recommend to the Public Service Board that four authorized public holidays should be granted to all public servants in the Coin mon wealth ? 6. Is it intended that any corresponding privilege should be granted to public servants employed outside the metropolitan area of Sydney, in lieu of the holiday granted to the latter class of officer on' the occasion of the visit of the American Fleet?",13
13,Mr BRUOE,CORRESPONDENCE WITH SUCCESSFUL,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :1. The regulations in regard to holidays consequent upon the amending Public Service Act 1924 operated from 15th November, 1924, lienee the only holiday authorized during 1924 was the day following Boxing Day in all States, and Proclamation Day in South Australia. -. No; the authorization of holidays is discretionary, and the grant is dependent upon the justification 'there for' and public convenience. 3. The resolution recommended the observance of ten uniform holidays in the Commonwealth and States, with two further discretionary holidays for local observance. 4. The Board has authorized a half-holiday to be observed in the metropolitan area of Melbourne on the date mentioned. 5. The matter is one entirely for the discretion of the Public Service Board. 0. No; the grant of discretionary public holidays is dependent upon local circumstances, which are accorded full consideration. The statutory holidays (nine in number) are uniformly observed throughout the Commonwealth. SEAMEN'S WAGES RATES. BRITISH AND AUSTRALIAN: RATIONS.",14

16,Mr BLAKEL EY,AUSTRALIAN LOAN FLOATED,"the Treasurer, upon noticeIs it a fact that, in connection with the recent loan of Â£15,000,000 raised in America, a financial group offered to underwrite the loan on 10s. per cent, better terms than those accepted by the Commonwealth Government. If so, why was the higher rate accepted?",14
17,Dr EARLE PAGE,AUSTRALIAN LOAN FLOATED,"It is not in the public interest to give details of loan negotiations. Of the various terms and conditions offered, those which were most advantageous to the Commonwealth were accepted. NA EX-SOLDIERS.",14
18,Mr BRENNAN,MENTAL HOSPITALS FOR,", the Minister for Defence, upon notice I. How many, if anj', mental hospitals are now in use for ex-soldier catees exclusively? 2. Have such hospitals, it any, been found necessary and practicable in operation?",14
19,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,MENTAL HOSPITALS FOR,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:- 1. Three hospitals are used exclusivelj' for ex-soldier mental patients in Australia. These are administered by the State authorities for the Eepatriation Commission. Arrangements have been made for the establishment of two other hospitals on similar lines, one of which will absorb an existing institution. Negotiations are in train for the establishment of another such hospital. 2. Such separate provision is not regarded as at all necessary, but is practicable where the number of patients warrants it and where, as at present, the specialist and trained staffs of the authorities controlling the State mental hospitals are available. NA BOAT. Mr R, GREEN asked the Minister for Defence, upon noticeWhen is it expected that the Wackett "" Widgeon flying boat."" will be officially tested? ",14

In view of the proceedings of the Deportation Board in Sydney, and the refusal of tha Overseas Steamship Owners Association to produce the books and documents of that association before the board, will he (a) issue instructions to the chairman of the board to discontinue the inquiry, and (6) take the necessary steps to repeal the deportation clauses of the Immigration Act?",14

Is the service subsidized by the Government? If so, to what extent? 4. Did Captain G. C. Matthews first suggest this route to the Government? If not, who did? 5. Were tenders called for this service?

If so, what services are rendered by the company in return for the subsidy, and what is the amount of the subsidy? 3. Was this company given a contract to supply an aeroplane service between Sydney and Brisbane? 4. If so, why is this service not in operation ?",15
24,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,"I regret that the information is not yet available. The following paper was presented: Northern Territory - Repor t by the Secretary, Home and Territories Department, on suggested re-organization of the Public Service of the Northern Territory. TARIF F BOARD REPORTS.  for Trade and Customs) [11.16] - I lay upon the table of the House the following reports of the Tariff Board:57, Glass bottles up to 1 ounce; 5S, glazed ceramic tiles; 59, petroleum pitch or asphalt; 60, special machinery for primary and secondary industries; 61, flexible shafting for sheepshearing machines; 62, steel wire winding ropes; 63, shovels; 64, iron and steel tubes or pipes; 65, timber; 66, cork boards; 67, vessels (ships, & c ) ; 68, X-ray apparatus. I move That the report on timber be printed.",15
25,Mr MAHONY,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,"Dalley) [11.17] - I ask the Minister whether he will permit some of the other reports to be printed. The proposed reduction in the duty on shovels will very seriously affect, a large and growing industry in this country, and, in consequence, hundreds of men will be thrown out of employment. Such a happening would seriously affect a large AIRCRAFT industry in the Minister's own constituency, and because of this I am sure that he will give the matter further consideration.",15
26,Mr MAKIN,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,We should also have printed the report on special machinery for primary and secondary industries.,15
27,Mr MAHONY,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,That is so. Surely honourable members who claim to represent the primary producers should be prepared to support my request that the report on shovels be printed.  and three factories engaged in making shovels in Australia.,15
28,Mr MAHONY,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,The honourable member is talking utter nonsense.,15
29,Mr SPEAKER,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,Rt.Hon. W. A. Watt). Co. Ltd - The honourable member must not be lured into a discussion on the tariff.,15
30,Mr MAHONY,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,"I do not propose te be so. I wish to be able to read the report of the Tariff Board upon the shovelmaking industry. We know that the industry is established here, and that a reduction in duty will ruin it. I wish to know upon what grounds the Tariff Board based its recommendation respecting shovels. As the Minister is appaPAPER. rently not prepared to consider my request, I move That, after the word ""timber,"" the words ""and shovels"" be inserted.  for Trade and Customs) [11.20] - The attitude that I have adopted towards the printing of the reports of the Tariff Board has depended upon their relative importance. When important reports, copies of which may be asked for by a number of interests concerned have been tabled, I have moved without discrimination that they be printed. I have purposely, omitted to move for the printing of minor reports, because the expense of printing them would not be justified. One copy of every report is placed upon the table of this House, and another upon the table in another place. Only three or four firms are interested in the shovelmaking industry. If it is the general wish of honourable members that any particular report should be printed, I am quite willing to move to that effect. I gave that intimation to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) when I placed the first batch of Tariff Board reports on the table. It is hardly worthwhile printing a report such as this, when two copies are available to honourable members and to the press. However, I am entirely in the hands of the House in this matter.",15
31,Mr FENTON,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,"Maribyrnong) [11.22.]. - I support the amendment of the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony). I am confident that if we are to have a proper and f u ll discussion upon the tariff proposals, there will be such a demand for the Tariff Board's reports on certain items that one type-written copy will not be sufficient. I am speaking with the experience of past tariffs. I know with what avidity honourable members peruse these reports to find out why certain items have been included in the tariff schedule and others excluded. If these reports are not printed, much confusion will be caused when there is an insistent demand for this information, and the Minister will consequently have to hurry the Government Printer in order to obtain information for honourable members. Of course, in the case of requests for further consideration by the Tariff Board on certain items, later reports may be submitted to the House. H this is likely, it would be preferable to print the f u ll report later rather than a partial report now. The Minister will find that, if we are to have a full debate on the tariff items, there will be a demand made for further information.",16
32,Mr BBTJCE,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,"Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs) [11.25],-The Government is, of course, only too willing to meet the wishes of honourable members respecting the printing of the reports of the Tariff Board, but these are very numerous, and it is not desirable that considerable expense should be incurred in printing all of them. It is proposed to print those reports for which there is a pressing demand. Of course, it is difficult for honourable members who are interested in the tariff to know whether the list of reports read out by the Minister embraces every one that they regard as valuable. Might I suggest, therefore, that after the reports have been tabled honourable members should peruse them to ascertain which should be printed. They could then make representations to the Minister, who, I am sure, would be only too pleased to meet their wishes as far as possible by moving for the printing of those it was desired to print. The Printing Committee will also consider these reports, and, if it selects any that it thinks should be printed, will order the printing of them.",16
33,Mr MAHONY,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,Can I obtain a copy of the report on shovels ?,16
34,Mr BRUCE,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,"Certainly . If what I suggest meets the convenience of honourable members, a great deal of unnecessary expenditure will be obviated.",16
35,Mr MAHONY,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,"In view of the Prime Minister's promise, I ask the permission of the House to withdraw the amendment. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. Question resolved in the affirmative. NORTHERN TERRITORY.",16
36,Mr MARR,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,"On the 16th September, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) asked whether I would make available the report of Mr MCLaren, Secretary of the Home and Territories Department, on the Public Service of the Northern Territory. I now lay on the table of the House a copy of his report. INFANTILE PARALYSIS.",16
37,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,"On the 16th September, the honourable member  tain questions relative to the preparation of poliomyelitis serum. For his information, and that of the House, I should like to point out that this is not a serum derived from the inferior animals, and, therefore, a large quantity of it cannot readily be prepared in a laboratory. It has to be obtained from the blood of convalescents from the disease, who are mostly children. Before this blood can be taken, the consent, not only of the patients, but also of the parents, must be obtained, and a number of children are not suitable for bleeding. The number of donors up to the present time has been 50, and their blood is being dealt with by a committee of medical men in Melbourne. The Federal Government has no control of the matter, except in regard to the'work of separating the serum. The Department is prepared to assist in every possible way when the number of donors becomes greater. The number of cases of the disease occurring in Australia in 1924 was 238, and in 1925, to date, 210. This disease has heen extremely prevalent in New Zealand, but this year there has not been an epidemic of it in Australia. DRIED FRUITS ADVANCES BILL. Motion (by Mr Bruce) agreed toThat lie have leave to bring in a bill for an Act to Amend the Dried Fruits Advances Act 1024. That in lieu of the rates of tax imposed payments for admission to entertainments, a date to be fixed by Proclamation Payment for Admission (excluding the Two shillings and sixpence . . Exceeding Two shillings and sixpence This bill will give effect to the intention of the Government, announced in my budget speech, to widen the field of exemption from the entertainments tax. It is the policy of the Government to distribute, as widely as possible, reductions in direct taxation. At present the entertainment tax applies to all payments of Is. arid upwards for admission to taxable entertainments, the rate being I d . on rhe first Is. and ^d. for each additional 6d. No tax is collected upon any payment of less, than Is. The bill wil l merely substitute, in the verbiage of the schedule of the act, "" two shillings and sixpence"" for "" one shilling,"" and "" twopence and one h a l f p e n n y "" for ""one penny,""' and will provide for the collection of i d . for each 6d. or part of 69. in excess of the 2s. 6d. Thus, the present rate of progression will be maintained,, but the general exemption will be raised from Is. to 2s. 6d. The Government believes that this increase in the general exemption will not only give relief to the poorer sections of the community, but will also obviate the i r r it a tion now caused by the fact that in connection with entertainments for social purposes,, for admission to which a charge of Is. or or Is; 6d. is made, returns must be furnished: to the department and taxaADVANCES TO SETTLERS BILL .

38,Dr EARLE PAGE,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,"Cowper-Trea surer) [11.32] - I moveby the Entertainments Tax Act 1916-1922 upon there he imposed upon such payments as from a tax at the following rates, namely:amount of tax). ..

Twopence and one half-penny for the first Two shillings and sixpence,, and one half-penny for every sixpence or part of sixpence by which the payment exceeds two shillings and sixpence. tion paid thereon. Of course, the tax was never intended to apply to such entertainments. Question resolved in the affirmative. Resolution reported. Standing Orders suspended; resolution adopted. Ordered That Dr Earle Page and Sir Littleton Groom do prepare and bring in a bill to carry out the foregoing resolution. Bill presented by Dr EARLE PAGE:, and read a first time. SECOND READING. Motion (by D f . EARLE PAGE) proposed - That this bill be now read a second time.",17
39,Mr CHARLTON,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,"Hunter ) [11.37] - I approve of the measure because it will grant relief to people who with their families patronize the cheaper forms of entertainment. This tax was imposed for war purposes, and as this Parliament has in the last few years made remissions, in both income and land taxation, it is only fair that the poorer people also should be. granted relief. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a. second time, and passed through its remaining stages without amendment or debate.. INVALID AND OLD-AGE ' PENSIONS BILL. In committee (Consideration resumed from 17th September, vide page 2552): Clauses 1 to 3 agreed' to. Clause 4Section 31 of the principal act is amended by omitting from sub-section (2) thereof the ""three"" and inserting in its stead "" four "". Section proposed to be amended(2) If it appears to the magistrate that the claimant although otheritrise qualified for, is unfit to be entrusted with, a pension, a pension at the rate of three shillings per week may be granted to the claimant, and payment of the - pension may be suspended until the claimant has become an inmate of a benevolent asylum.",17
40,Mr CHARLTON,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,"Hunter) [11.42] - I wish to move to amend the section in the direction of omitting the word ""four"" with a view to the substitution of the words ""nine shillings and sixpence."" To-day the Commonwealth pays to institutions 10s. 6d. per week in respect of each pensioner inmate, and the pensioner receives 3s. per week, which the bill proposes to increase to 4s. My amendment will mean that each pensioner will receive 9s. 6d. per week, the Commonwealth thus paying the full amount of f l in respect of each person qualified to receive the pension. The present practice is not based upon equity. The Commonwealth should pay the full pension in respect of each pensioner, irrespective of whether he lives in his own home or in an institution. person is entitled to a pension of 20s. per week, why should he, because of an infirmity which compels him to go to a hospital, receive less than is paid to other pensioners? When aged persons enter hospitals they frequently require additional money to purchase delicacies that are needed. As honourable members are aware, the hospitals do not supply patients with everything required in the way of comforts and stimulants. In the circumstances, I think it would be fair if the committee decided that, instead of the pensioner inmates of hospitals receiving only 4s. per week, they should be paid at least the difference between what is given the institution itself and the full amount of the pension. I do not deny that the present practice has been followed by several administrations, but as we know that there are anomalies, and that some pensioners are not being dealt with equitably, we should rectify matters by making a necessary amendment of the law. I .do not think a very large sum would be involved. I believe the Treaword surer stated that it would be approxithe word mately Â£40,000 per annum.",18
41,Dr EAULE PAGE,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,That was the amount when the rate was 2s. per week.,18
42,Mr CHARLTON,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,"Then , of course, it would cost much more now to do what I propose. Pensioners will now be entitled to 20s. per week; but they should not be compelled to submit to any reduction while they are inmates of public institutions. There are at least four or five hospitals in my district maintained by the contributions of the workers and subsidies from the Government. It is not the wealthy people in my district who subscribe to the funds of these institutions, but the working men, by their weekly levies. The pensioners in these institutions, when they were working, paid their contributions towards the upkeep of them, and now, as inmates, they should not be compelled to accept'a reduced pension. Irrespective of the amount involved, we should do what is just.",18
43,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D," Before accepting the amendment submitted by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton), I should like an assurance from the Treasurer If a (Dr Earle Page) that if the amendment is agreed to the amount to be appropriated will not be increased.",18
44,Dr EARLE PAGE,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,I am afraid that I am unable to give such an assurance. The payment of the additional amount to the inmates of public institutions must increase the appropriation. But I should also like to point out,18
45,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,"Unless I can receive such an assurance from the Treasurer, I have no option but to rule the amendment out of order.",18
46,Mr CHARLTON,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,"Hunter) [11.50] I understand that you have ruled the amendment out of order on the grounds that it will increase the amount to be appropriated under the bill, but it is not certain that it will. This bill provides that pensioners shall receive 20s. per week. Ifc has been the practice of Governments to reduce the amountpaid to pensioners who are inmates of institutions. But we are not in a position to know what number of pensioners are likely to receive treatment in the public institutions-, and, therefore, it is impossible to say if the amount of appropriation would be increased if the amendment were agreed to. Some invalid pensioners - may decide to be treated in their own homes, and it is, therefore, very difficult for you, sir, to rule that my amendment would mean an increase in the amount to be appropriated.  member's opinion?",18
47,Mr CHARLTON,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,"I have already expressed my opinion. I have said that, - on the ground of equity, a higher rate should be paid to the inmates of public hospitals.  member think that the amount to be appropriated would be increased?",19
48,Mr CHARLTON,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,"I shall be very sorry if we are to be prevented from acting fairly in the interests of these people on what may be regarded as a technical point. If the Temporary Chairman rules that my amendment, if adopted, would be the means of increasing the appropriation, the Treasurer should arrange for a further message to cover it, or introduce another bill. It is hardly fair of the honourable member for Porrest (Mr. Prowse) to endeavour to take advantage of the point raised by the Temporary Chairman to prevent justice being done.  of the Opposition if he thought that the increased rate which he suggests would involve an increase in the amount to be appropriated. . Mr Charlton - I am glad to have the honourable member's interjection. I believe I am voicing the opinion of a majority of honourable members when I say that the bill should be withdrawn and another message brought down. If that were done, honourable members on this side of the chamber wotild endeavour to facilitate the passage of the new bill, and would not have another second-reading debate on it. It cannot be said that we are endeavouring to obstruct business. The Entertainments Tax Amendment Bil l introduced by the Treasurer this morning passed through all its stages in a very short time. The object of this bill is to increase the rate of pension from 17s. 6d. to 20s. per week, and it is for the committee to decide how pensioner inmates of public institutions should be treated. Evidence could easily be adduced to show that the Commonwealth's liability might not be increased by what I proposed. To prove that increased expenditure would be caused by it, the Government would have to show the number of pensioners who would go to public institutions.",19
49,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,". - I have no desire to curtail discussion on the amendment submitted by the Leader of the Opposition, but it appears to the Chair that if such an amendment were accepted it would have the effect of increasing the appropriation. Unless the Chair receives a definite assurance from the Treasurer that the amount to be appropriated will not be increased if the amendment is adopted, I have no option but to i eject the amendment.",19
50,Mr COLEMAN,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,"Reid) [11.55] - I regret that the Treasurer has refused to further liberalize the provisions in this clause. The sub-section proposed to be amended gives the magistrate power to commit any applicant for a pension to a benevolent asylum or similar institution. If we are to deprive a pensioner of his liberty by saying that he is not fitted to be entrusted with his pension, and must go to an asylum for the aged, which, in a sense, is a form of punishment, he should receive the increase proposed in the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition. The Government has no right to withhold a portion of the pension from such a .person. The State institutions receive 10s. 6d. per week for Commonwealth pensioners, and under the proposal of the Treasurer the pensioner inmates themselves are to receive 4s. per week, the Government wrongfully retaining 5s. 6d. per week. If the Treasurer will not accept the proposal of the Leader of the Opposition that the difference between the. amount paid to the institution and the full pension be paid to these pensioners, he should pay to the institution responsible for the maintenance of the pensioner the difference between 4s. and the full pension. The Government is not, in any circumstances, justified in keeping back !5s. 6d. of the pension - I think that is the view generally accepted by honourable members. If the Treasurer would allow the committee to freely discuss this matter, I think it would be - easily disposed of. I do not wish to repeat the statements I made last night, but seeing that the Government exercises power under this sub-section to compel pensioners to enter State controlled institutions, it should pay these institutions the difference between the amount paid to the pensioner inmate and the balance of the full .pension, or give that difference .to the pensioner. Mr F. MCDONALD (Barton) [11.57]. - I trust that the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) will accept the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition. Its acceptance may not mean an increase in appropriation. It may be argued that if this scheme which has been in operation for some time is extended a decreased amount may have to be paid in the form orf old-age and invalid pensions. The saving effected at present is contrary to the spirit of the act. The people have decided in favour of the payment of old age audi invalid pensions, and if the Government is prepared to pay pensioners 20s. per week, they should receive the full sum, or where they are inmates of institutes, its equivalent. Under the past arrangement certain pensioners have not been receiving the full amount to which they are entitled ; they .are receiving only a portion of it , and the Treasurer is retaining - a portion, which is contrary to the spirit of the act. Pensioners are entitled to the amount voted by Parliament, and the people wish them to receive it. . The sum of 4s. per week is insufficient to keep them in comfort while they are in public institutions. The hospitals get 10s. a week, while 4s. a week is to be paid to the pensioners. That means that 5s. 6d. a week is to be retained in the Treasury. There is no warrant for that. These people, who are doubly unfortunate, should not be penalized in this manner.",19
51,Mr COLEMAN,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,"In many instances, they are committed to the institutions by magistrates. Mr F. MCDONALD - That is so; but that is no reason why they should be penalized. Many of them were pioneers in this country, and did much to bring it to its present stage of development. The present condition of many of them is due to the effects of droughts, floods, or fires. The Australian people, as a whole, aTe prepared to maintain them for the remainder of their days, and do not regard the pension as a charitable dole, as was suggested last night by 'the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory), who stated that he hoped that the Government would introduce a scheme of national insurance, so that the persons who received a pension could regard it as a return of money which they themselves had contributed. These unfortunate people in ' our midst have made their contribution by assisting in the development of this new country, and making it possible for us to enjoy the comfort which today surrounds us. Rather than let these people suffer, we should regard them as our special care. It would probably be better to pay them the whole of the pension and allow them to make their own arrangements with the hospitals. If they are fortunate enough to receive treatment for 10s. 6d. a week, we should be glad that they will be able to retain the remaining 9s. 6d. a week for themselves.",20
52,Mr MAXWELL,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,"The amendment, if carried, would increase the cost without increasing the appropriation. Mr F. MCDONALD - If payment of pensions is made on the scale desired by the people of Australia, the appropriation would necessarily have to be increased. I do not know the amount of the present appropriation, but I do know that when this legislation was passed it was intended that a sufficient sum should be appropriated to pay an adequate pension to every person qualified to receive it. Any scheme which decreases the amount of the appropriation is against the spirit of the act, and is therefore not acceptable to the people of Australia. Generally speaking, the Australian public will not countenance any scheme to deprive pensioners of part of their pension. That it has been done in the past does not necessarily mean that the action taken has been right. The people generally are of the opinion that pensioners, whether inmates of institutions or not, snould be paid a certain sum weekly. I hope that the Treasurer will accept the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition, and allow pensioners who are inmates of institutions, some voluntarily and some by order of the court, to retain 9s. 6d. a week for themselves. As a matter of equity, it should be done.",20
53,Dr EARLE PAGE,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,"Cowper-Trea surer) [12.7] - I desire to supplement my remarks of last night. The right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes) placed the position plainly - before honourable members last night when he said that the present condition has obtained ever since the Federal Parliament introduced a scheme for the payment of old-age pensions. The question to be decided is, not whether the old-age pensioners shall obtain more, but whether the Commonwealth or the State shall be responsible for the care of pensioner inmates of hospitals and other institutions. Because of representations which were made to me, I went into this matter very carefully. The payment ofold-age pensions was intended to supplement the action taken by the States in caring for aged and infirm people in the community. Pensions were' given primarily to enable old folk to live in their own homes. When they found it necessary to enter public institutions for medical treatment, they came under the care of the States. If we study the wording of the principal act. we shall see that it would be wrong to accept the amendment. Section 31 of the principal act, as subsequently amended, readsIf it appears to the magistrate that the claimant although otherwise qualified for, is unfit .to be entrusted with, a pension, a pension at the rate of 3s. per week may lie granted to the claimant, and payment of the pension may .be suspended until the claimant has become an inmate of a benevolent asylum. That section deals with those cases in which, in the judgment of the magistrate, the old-age pensioner is unfit to be entrusted with the pension. I am .glad that honourable members on both sides have spoken favourably of the sympathetic manner in which the act is administered. The officers of the department think that the present arrangement is a satisfactory one from the point of view of the pensioner. They inform me that only 1 per cent, of the old-age pensioners who are inmates of hospitals come under this heading, and they point out that, instead of its being a kindness to grant them the comparatively large sum of 9s. 6d. a week, it would be detrimental to their best interests to pay them that sum. After careful consideration of the whole position, the Government decided, two years ago, to make a payment of 3s. a week to those pensioners who are inmates of hospitals. Although I have received hundreds of letters from old-age pensioners throughout Australia, I have not received one containing a request that the amount paid to pensioners who are inmates of hospitals should be increased to a sum approaching that mentioned in the amendment. On the contrary, I have received numbers of letters thanking the Government for the action taken two years ago, and expressing the satisfaction of the writers with the present proposal.",21
54,Mr CHARLTON,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,"I have received many such, requests.",21
55,Dr EARLE PAGE,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,"I am satisfied that it would not be a kindness to grant this class of old-age pensioner more than 4s. a week. I am quite prepared to discuss with the authorities controlling those institutions which are financed or subsidized by the States the question of increasing the payment to them on behalf of pensioner inmates. Whatever honourable members may think regarding subsequent amendments, I hope that they will not press this one, as it applies to those pensioners whom the magistrates regard as being unfit to be entrusted with a pension. There is also the fact that the amendment is out of order, because it would mean an increase of the appropriation.",21
56,Mr WATKINS,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,"Newcastle) [12.12]. - I have listened attentively to the explanation of the Treasurer, and, while I admit that the officers of the department are generally sympathetic in their administration of the act, I want honourable members to understand that the reduction of the pension applies in the case of every pensioner who goes into a hospital for treatment, even temporarily.",21
57,Dr EARLE PAGE,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,The honourable member is referring to another clause.,21
58,Mr WATKINS,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,"I now see that that is so. The rate of pension was first fixed at 10s. a week. That amount has been increased from time to time, until today it is 17s. 6d. a week. Notwithstanding the amount paid, I have always held that it was wrong that, when a pensioner became so infirm as to require treatment in an institution, he should suffer by having his pension reduced, the Commonwealth benefiting because of his misfortune. Some of these old-age pensioners have been miners and bushmen, who, although not confined to their beds, are inmates of stitutions. The amount granted to them is scarcely sufficient to supply them with tobacco. Either the pensioner or the institution should receive the difference.  under any circumstances!",22
59,Mr WATKINS,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,"I am sorry to hear that remark from the honourable memberamount for Forrest. The Government money freely in other directions, but when it is a question of studying the needs of the old-aged, we who advocate are told that we favour getting rid money under any circumstances. consider that this will add to the comfort of the old people. The expenditure on this proposal will, of necessity, vary, unless the Treasurer can state definitely that the acceptance of the amendment 33J 2 ' cent. will have the effect of increasing the propriation it should be agreed to.",22

66,Dr EARLE PAGE,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,"Eight hundred thousand pounds. MT. CHARLTON - The honourable gentleman does not deny that the payment of the additional amount at an earlier date than was at first anticipated will increase the appropriation. There is no provision in the bill to cover the expenditure. Although I dp not intend to appeal against your ruling, sir, I doubt in- very much Avhether the Treasurer's assurance is well founded. Did the honourable gentleman say that he will get in touch with those who are inmates of institutions, to ascertain their wishes?",22
67,Dr EARLE PAGE,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,I said that I am prepared to discuss with those who control the institutions the question of the that ought to be paid for the spends maintenance of pensioners.,22
68,Mr CHARLTON,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,"Many of those authorities will ask that they, and not the it pensioner, be given an additional amount.  We support, the clause as it stands. The Government proposes to increase the rate to old-age pensioners by 25 per cent. Those and who are unfortunate enough to be in.institutions will really receive an increase of Under this clause it is er apthe duty of a magistrate to determine whether a pensioner is a fit subject to receive a pension or whether said he should enter an institution. It must be manifest to honourable members that the comforts provided by an institution which is maintained largely by State and Commonwealth funds are greater than a pensioner could the provide for himself out of Â£ 1 a week. This 4s. is really pocket money to enable pensioner inmates of hospitals to purchase tobacco and other comforts that are not provided by the institution. I whilst the honourable member the for Newcastle (Mr Watkins) was speakthe ing, that there seemed to be a desire canto have the expenditure incurred in any circumstances. The Commonwealth pension is on a fairly liberal scale compared with what other countries are paying. We are a mere handful of people, but we are . able to provide reasonable comforts for our aged people. Every one has it in his to do as much as possible. The institutions have-not complained unduly of the adequacy of the payment that is made to them. Many old people are unfortunately addicted to drink, and it would be a mistake to give them greater opportunities to satisfy their craving.",22
69,Mr SCULLIN,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,"Yarra) [12.23] - I agree to a certain extent with the statement of the Treasurer that some old people are better off in an institution.

70,Dr EARLE PAOE,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,"Ninety-nin e per cent, are voluntary inmates of those institutions. This clause, however, relates only to those who are ordered by a magistrate to be sent to an institution.",23
71,Mr SCULLIN,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,"That is quite true. ""We are endeavouring to impress upon the Minister the desirability of considering the claims of every pensioner who is an inmate of an institution, whether he is there voluntarily or compulsorily.",23

The Pensions Department is administered very sympathetically, and I cannot do other than praise every officer in it.",23
74,Mr COLEMAN,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,"They set an example - to"" every one.",23
75,Mr SCULLIN,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,"The pension is given as a right, not as a charity. If pensioners were in receipt of an annuity from some estate, the manner in which they spent it would not be inquired into. We propose to interfere with an equally strong right when we say that they shall not receive a pension unless they enter an institution. I am not quarrelling with that interference, although I regret that it is necessary to exercise it . What I do say is that, having interfered, we - should, either directly or indirectly, provide the pensioners with as many comforts as they would receive if they spent the pension in their own homes. I do not think the Government has gone far enough. There may be every justification for declining to give the whole amount to either the individual or the institution. It might be possible to show that the cost of maintaining a pensioner in an institution is not as great as it would be in his own home, and that the authorities should receive only the actual cost of maintenance.",23
76,Mr COLEMAN,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,That cost exceeds 10s.,23
77,Mr SCULLIN,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,I believe that it does. It is a matter for adjustment.,23
78,Mr LISTER,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,"The cost varies according to the institution. Mr SCULLIN1 - I do not suggest that the Commonwealth should pay more than the cost of maintenance, or give the pensioner the. difference if that cost is greater than it would cost him to live in his own home. I do, however, suggest that 4s. is a very small sum for a pensioner to receive.",23
79,Mr MAXWELL,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,"Does the honourable member think that a pensioner outside an institution who receives Â£1 a week can, after purchasing necessaries, still have 4s. in hand?",23

I do not think that we should introduce percentages into this matter, and refer to a "" 33Â£ per cent, increase"" when it represents only an additional Is. a week. I hope the Treasurer will reconsider his decision concerning the allowance to be made to pensioners in institutions. - Mr Foster- (Wakefield) [12.31] The honourable member for Yarra (Mr. Scullin) has stated that the allowance made toinstitutions in which invalid and old-age pensioners are accommodated represents the full cost of the services rendered'. That is hardly true of the Home for Incurables, and ""Minda,"" two institutions in Adelaide. The Home for In curables is one of the finest institutions of its kind in Australia. It ' has been established for very many years and is admirably controlled by a committee of devoted men and women. There are about 150 patients, all of whom are very well cared for. The allowance for each patient is 10s. 6d., but I believe the cost per patient to the institution is quite Â£1. Mr Sen LUX - That is very high.",23
85,Mr FOSTER,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,"But it is an excellent home. The inmates are supplied with all sorts of luxuries not provided in other institutions. I know of no place where patients receive better treatment. "" Minda,"" a home for weak-minded children, was, I believe, established at the instance of Sir Josiah Symon. doing a wonderful work. Both institutions feel that they should receive the full amount of the pensions paid by the Commonwealth under the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act.",24
86,Mr YATES,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,Are they allowed anything?,24
87,Mr FOSTER,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,"Yes , but the amount ought to be larger. When the Treasurer was in Adelaide not long ago I introduced a deputation to him on the subject, and hestated that the provision asked for could probably better be made by the legislation which' might be recommended by the Health Committee than under the pensions scheme.",24
88,Dr EAKLE PAGE,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,I also said last night that I am prepared to discuss the subject with the people interested - I,24
89,Mr FOSTER,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,"Nevertheless, thought it my duty to bring this matter before, the committee, and I hope that, before long, arrangements will be made to give both institutions further assistance.",24

91,Mr FOSTER,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,"The inmates of the Home for Incurables do not ask for an increase of pension, because they get every comfort that can possibly be obtained in home.",24

93,Mr FOSTER,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,"The institution should get every penny of it. Mr E. RILEY (South Sydney), [12.37}. - I direct the attention of the Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page)- to the powers given, under section 31 to magistrates. Frequently, when, a blind person makes applieation for a pension, a magistrateexerts undue influence upon theapplicant to cause him to enter a blind, institution. Many prefer to remain in their own homes, but if they decline to go to an institution the pension may be withheld from them. If they attempt to supplement their income by selling articles in the streets they are denied pension rights, and, consequently, there is a good deal of discontent. They should have the right to supplement their .income without being penalized. No one likes to see them vending articles in the streets of our cities, but magistratesshould be restrained from putting presI t is sure on them to become inmates of blind institutions. As many blind men have family obligations it is essential that they should have the right to earn money with; out interference with their pension rights. Mr A. GEEEN - Do not they get the pension irrespective of their earnings?' Mr E. RILEY - No ; that is their grievance. I trust that the Treasurer will take some action to prevent magistratesfrom unnecessarily interfering with the liberty of blind persons who apply for a pension by urging them toenter institutions for the blind. Persons so afflicted, are entitled to every consideration'. They should be allowed to earn as much as they can.  t has been suggested by some honorI able members that because persons who are inmates of an institution will be paid 4s. a week pocket money and the institution will get 10s. 6d. for their maintenance, the pensioners will be defrauded a of the difference between Â£1, the amount' of the full pension, and the sum total of the two payments. It seems to me that the question is whether the Commonwealth is to accept complete responsia bility for invalid pensioners, or whether the State in which they live is expected toaccept its share of this obligation. In the case of many institutions it would not too much to say that thepensioner receives at least 16s. worth of service in the terms of food, accommodation, and attention for the 10s. 6d. paid by the Commonwealth, and that the State Governments, by maintaining such institutions, are bearing the cost of the difference between the 10s. 6d. paid by the Commonwealth and. the value of services rendered to the inmate. I think there is a good deal in the interjection made by the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr . Maxwell), that it is highly improbable that many of our invalid pensioners would, have 4s. a week pocket-money if they had to maintain, themselves in their own homes on the f l a week to be paid by the Commonwealth Government.",24
94,Mr COLEMAN,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,"Eeid) [12.42] - I moveTliat the word "" f o u r "" be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the word "" five."" The effect of this amendment w i l t be to increase the allowance to5s. a week. I am aware, of courses, that it will be ruled out of order, but I submit it as a protest against the action of the Government. If alt instilmtions were conducted on lines similar to those of the South Australian institutions just referred to, possibly everything would be right. unfortunately, some of them are of a very rough character. The Lidcombe institution, in m y electorate, iis controlled by the State, and there the accommodation is not of the best, and the food, although good, is rough. I claim, therefore, that a larger allowance should be paid to the inmates to enable them to procure more personal comforts. At Newington, also, the position is far from satisfactory. Hundreds of ' poor old women, many of whom are in an advanced stage of senility, aud others who have been turned out of their own homes by their children, are accommodated there. A visit to that institution is very depressing. I have been there several times, and I do not like going... I only visit it in the course of my duty as a representative of those people. The inmates are clad in cheap p r in t dresses - very suggestive of prison garb. Certainly they should have a larger margin for the purchase of ordinary comforts.. It has been said by some honourable members opposite that in most cases persons are committed to the care of such institutions because of inebriety. That is not true. Very many are obliged to go to them> because they have no homes of theirown-, andy as I have said, some are in an enfeebled state of health or in au advanced state of senility. They are 1 sent to the homes by magistrates, not because of misconduct, but for their own protection. In the circumstances, the Treasurer should agree to increase the amount they receive to 5s., so that they may procure ordinary comforts for themselves. The TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN. The Chair has no option but to rule the amendment out of order. Mr E. MCDONALD (Barton) [12.45]. - The Treasurer (JDr Earle Page)- has stated why it is not proposed to give mo-re than 4s. a week to the unfortunate people who have to seek accommodation in in stitutions or asylums. I should like' him to consider for a moment the purpose of the original act, andi to observe the difference between the procedure then laid down and that now contemplated. Under the original act 3s. was set aside as the personal property of every old-age pensioner in an. institution..",25
95,Dr EAELE PAOE,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,"That is not so. The provision' with which the committee is. now dealing was inserted in the aet in 1916, Bnt, and the amount then allowed to thepensioner was 2s. The increase to 3s. was made two years ago. Mr F . MCDONALD - That payment was looked upon as a meagre allowance, intended! to provide the old-age pensioners with a few of the comforts of life. The payment to the pensioners was restricted so as to leave more for the in stitutions. Dr EAEL E. PAGE.:-The payment to the institutions has never been enough.. Mr W. M .

We have to consider what is the wisest way to give the money. Mr F . MCDONALD - It seems to me ' that the Government is trying to> find a way to avoid expenditure.",25
97,Dr EARLE PAGE,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,"It is ridiculous for the honourable member to talk like that, when the' Government is proposing to inincrease the pensions expenditure by Â£1,600,000 a year. Mr F. MCDONALD - The spirit of the proposal is that every old-age pensioner shall have Â£1 a week expended on him by the Government. The people in institutions are doubly unfortunate, but that is not a valid reason for saving money at their expense. If the Government pays 10s. 6d. to the institutions and 4s. to the old-age pensioners, there. will be a clear saving of 5s. 6d. a week on the full pension. Under the act the pensioners are entitled to this increase. Dr EARLE PAGE,-They are not entitled to it under the act. There specific provisions relating to it. Mr F. MCDONALD - If we can crease the payments to the old-age pento the pensioners. sioners, we ought to do it. Mr W. M.

I would urge that the old-age pensioners should get. the f benefit of the increase, and I should like the Treasurer to explain why the proposal to pay 5s. instead of 4s., is not acceptable. Honourable members opposite appear to me to have stated a prima facie case support of the payment of 5s.",26
99,Dr EARLE PAGE,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,"Cowper-Trea surer) [12.52] - I regret that when was dealing with this matter the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes) was not present. I then pointed out that the disparity to which attention has been drawn has existed since payments were first made in respect of pensioners in institutions. In the first place, 5s. was paid to the Statesj and nothing to the old-age pensioners. 1916, the Government of which the right honourable member was the Leader decided to make a payment of 2s. a week to pensioners who became inmates of State institutions; but payment was not made to those who had been in institutions before they became old-age pensioners. In 1923, when the present Government increased the rate of pension, it considered .how much should be given to the pensioners as pocket money. The general opinion of the authorities concerned was that 3s. would be a proper .amount, and accordingly the previous payment of 2s.' was increased to 3s., and was extended to those who entered institutions before they became eligible for an old-age pension. It is now proposed to increase the amount to 4s., which, we' are assured, will provide the extra comare forts required by the old people. If we desired to spend the remaining 16s., we should consider whether we should ingive it to the States rather than There were two courses the Government could take. It could. give Â£1 a week to the pensioners, Treaand allow them to make their own arrangements with the institutions, in now which case the institutions might not the allow them even 4s. a week; or it could a certain amount to the pensioners and discuss with the States the amount to be paid to the institutions. I have as a had representations made to me on behalf of the Home for Incurables, e in South Australia, and the honorof the able member for ""Wakefield (Mr. each Foster) introduced a deputation to me on the subject a fortnight ago. Memthe bers of the deputation pointed out to. me that towards a total expenditure by the u l l institution of Â£12,000, the State contributed only Â£2,000! The institution receives from the Commonwealth Government 10s. 6d. a week for each old-age pensioner, but it costs 25s. a week to keep in an inmate of the institution. I told the deputation that I was prepared to discuss the matter with the representatives of I that institution when the national insurance proposals were brought forward. The honourable member for Wakefield said that the condition of the inmates of that institution was so good that they scarcely needed any pocket money. There has never been any suggestion by this Government that the payments to the institutions and the pensioners should agree. Mr Speaker. In was Treasurer of the State of Victoria when old-age pensions were first paid by the Commonwealth, and it was then considered fair that the State should bear half the cost of the maintenance of pensioners in institutions. The payments made by the Commonwealth to. the States, and to institutions subsidized by the States for pension inmates, is essentially an act of grace. The Government is prepared to discuss the matter with the State Governments and the institutions concerned, and to deal with it at its discretion.",26
100,Mr YATES,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,"Adelaide) [18.66] - I hardly think that there ought to he so much debate about the payment of an extra 2s. 6d. a week to old-age pensioners increasing the appropriation. The honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) suggested that the 2s. 6d. a week should be paid to all persons who are entitled to it. If the total amount paid for inmates of institutions is less than f l a week, the appropriation is, to that extent, reduced. If it is intended that the appropriation shall provide for increasing all pensions to f 1 a week, I cannot see that it will be increased by making all the pensions f l a week. I frequently visit the Home for Incurables at Fullarton. When I was there three weeks ago, I purchased two tickets that were being sold to provide comforts for the inmates. It is. therefore, not correct to assume that the inmates have all the-comforts they require. The institution is an admirable one, ancl the patients are very comfortable in comparison with those in other institu-. tions, but they require many things in addition to those supplied to them. I am also closely in touch with the consumptive home at Xorth Terrace, Adelaide. There is a different story to tell there. The place was at one time a mental hospital, and the couditions in it are far from what one would like to submit the members of one's family to. Many of the relatives of iumates refrain from visiting the institution for fear of infection, and personally I do not blame them. The inmates, many of whom, are in early middle life, have for a long time had a comforts fund, and are dependent on racing clubs and charitably minded people for such succour as they obtain outside their keep in the institution. ""With the proceeds of this fund they are able to buy fruit, biscuits, underclothing, paper, books, tobacco, dental requisites. and other things that they need. An extra 2s. 6d. a week would be invaluable to them. I believe that similar conditions apply in the Old Folks' Home in the electorate of the honourable member for Angas (Mr Gabb). In that institution, there are many old pioneers of this country, who have been reduced to their present circumstances, not by their own fault, but by ill-luck. We ought not to be debating this question from the standpoint of cost. The speeches on this bill have been in striking contrast with those that we hear from honourable members opposite when taxation measures are being discussed-measure s which affect not those who are short of the necessaries of life, but those who are concerned only with getting more than they already enjoy of the good things of life. Many of the old men, if they thought that the money was given, in the spirit indicated by the remarks of some honourable members, would say,' "" Go to the devil! Keep your 2s. 6d."" I hope that the Treasurer will take an Australian view of this matter. I believe that generosity is an outstanding trait of the Australian character. Pensioners who are inmates of institutions need this payment more than those who are succoured by their own families. Clause agreed to.",27

102,Mr GABB,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,"Angas) [2.15] - I do not intend to move an amendment upon this clause, not because I think it should not be moved, but because I know-from the rulings given on previous amendments submitted that it would not be accepted. If I were to propose, as I should like to do, that the allowance to pensioner inmates of benevolent institutions should be increased to 5s. 6d. instead of 4s., as proposed by the clause, the amendment would be regarded as increasing the appropriation, and so would meet the fate of amendments which have already been submitted. One or two statements have been made in connection with this subject to which I should like to reply. The inmates of these benevolent homes may be divided into three classes. The first class includes those committed to the homes under the order of a magistrate because of their habits, their increasing senility, or other reasons of the kind. Their number is comparatively small; I think the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) has said that they do not represent more than 1 per cent, of the total pensioner inmates of these institutions. The second class includes those old folk - who have no homes of their own, are without friends, and of their own volition have entered these asylums. When the allowance to pensioner inmates of these homes was increased to 3s. per week, I visited the Old Eolks Home in my district, and put in some time in filling in forms for the inmates. I then gained a very good idea of the class of men and women who are to be found in these homes. I found that many of the men wer.e single men. They had borne the heat and burden of the day, and done pioneering work in out-back parts of the country, - and in their declining years Came or were brought from the stations out back to enter one of these homes. When I heard the Treasurer say that the increase of the. allowance would be no kindness to men of this type",27
103,Dr EARLE PAGE,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,No; ' I did not refer to such pensioners. I specially quoted section 31 of the principal act to make my meaning clear.,28
104,Mr GABB,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,"I am glad to have the correction, because, under the impression that the honourable gentleman was referring to pensioners of this type, I was disposed to say something to him which would not be parliamentary. If the honourable gentleman has ever visited one of these homes, he must have been struck by the row of bald heads to be seen in the dormitories. Many of these poor old fellows are absolutely infirm, and are confined to their beds. If an allowance of 5s. 6d. per week were given to such people it would be expended by the nurses and wardsmen, who have to take charge of them, in the purchase of many items of food which do not find a place in the dietary scaleof these institutions. The money would not be wasted, because it would provide the pensioners with a variety of diet which they could not otherwise enjoy. Many of the pensioners are, of course, able to walk about. I was present on one occasion when a fruit cart came into the grounds of the institution to which I have referred, and it was a pleasure to see the old people spending their allowance in the purchase of the frui t they needed. Whilst I am willing to admit that some waste their allowance, the great majority spend it wisely. It is a common thing in the winter time for the authorities of institutions of this kind to make appeals to people who have old overcoats which they can spare for the benefit of these old men. Some of them save up their allowance to enable them to purchase warm clothing for the winter. The third class of pensioner inmates of these benevolent institutions are those who have friends and relatives who are not in a nnancial position to take care of them in their own homes, and give them the oversight they require. It has to be borne in mind also that old people become irritated by children, and where there are young children in a family dependent old people are better in these institutions. In the case of pensioners of this class, the increased allowance would be very acceptable. The honourable member for Porrest (Mr.. Prowse) has said that some of these old people are addicted to drink. I have to admit that some of them do drink more than they ought, but I remind the honourable member that when one of these old men goes out of an institution, gets drunk, and comes in after hours, he may be disqualified from receiving even the present allowance of 3s. per week for a period of three months. I know that that ' is the case, because I have tried on behalf of some of these old people to secure a restoration of the allowance before the three months has expired. 'The next statement which I challenge is that made by the honourable member for Gippsland  sioner inmates of these benevolent institutions receive in the form of keep the equivalent of 16s. per week, and if they are also given an allowance of 4s. per week in cash they will be placed on an equal footing with pensioners outside such institutions. I absolutely deny that. If the honourable member made that statement to an old man in one of these homes, who can get out only for half a day in each week, and must put up with the fare provided day after day, it would 'be received with scorn.  this would be true of the pensioner inmates of many institutions.",28
105,Mr GABB,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,I am speaking of the institution I know. If the honourable member were referring to some private institution the position might be different.,29
106,Mr WATSON,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,If the statement does not apply to the institution to which the honourable member refers that may be the fault of the management.,29
107,Mr GABB,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,"No , it is not. The management is all right. I am thankful that there are such asylums as the State Benevolent institution at Magill, in which these old people can be received, but to argue in view of the environment of inmates of these institutions, and the restrictions imposed upon their liberties, that with the payment of the allowance of 4s. per week they would be placed on an equal footing with pensioners living in their own homes or with their relatives is absolute nonsense. I ain hoping that in future greater liberality will be extended to these old people. I would have been ashamed of myself if , having listened to what has been said about some of them, I had not voiced a protest on their behalf.  If there is one class of persons to whom all the people of Australia are prepared to be not only just, but generous to a fault, it is the old-age pensioners, and particularly those who are so unfortunate as to be forced, through circumstances over which they have had no control, to enter one of these benevolent asylums and spend in it the twilight of their lives. As a rule they are persons who during the greater part of their lives were accustomed to the free and open life of Australia whilst they were carrying out the pioneering work from which we benefit so much today. It will give them great pleasure to know that the - Government is increasing the old-age pension by 2s. 6d. per week, but it will be no pleasure to them to learn that the increase in their allowance is to be only Is. per week. I think the Government might well have proposed to increase their allowance by 2s. 6d. In .my opinion it might have gone further, and, departing from the practice of the past, might have made the allowance to pensioner inmates of benevolent institutions 9s. 6d. per week. I move That the word ""four"" be omitted with a - view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" nine shillings and sixpence."" I do not know whether this amendment will come under the ban of the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page). I hope he will not contend that it will involve an increase of the appropriation. The increased allowance which I propose would enable these old people to purchase a few more of the comforts which mean so much to people in their declining years. The TEMPOEABY CHAIEM AN (Mr Bayley) - I am unable to accept the amendment for the reason stated in refusing to accept similar amendments previously moved. Clause agreed to. Title agreed to.

In committee (Consideration of Governor General's message): Motion (by Dr EARLE PAGE) agreed toThat it is expedient that an appropriation of revenue be made for the purposes of a bill for an act to grant and apply out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund a sum for war pensions. Resolution reported. Standing Orders suspended; resolution adopted. Ordered That. Dr Earle Page and Sir Littleton Groom do prepare and bring in a bill to carry out the foregoing resolution. Bill presented by Dr EARLE PAGE, and read a first time. SECOND READING. Dr. EARLE PAGE (Cowper-Trea surer) [2.33] - I move That the bill be now read a second time. This measure is to provide a further Â£10,000,000 for the payment of war pensions. It deals in no way with the rates and conditions of pensions, but merely makes provision for the money with which to pay the pensions which have been or will be granted in accordance with the conditions set out in the war pensions section of the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act.",29
108,Mr CHARLTON,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,Will it be sufficient to meet requirements in regard to pensions for the whole financial year?,29
109,Dr EARLE PAGE,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,"Yes. It is some years since the war ended, but the pensions bill of the Commonwealth is still well over Â£7,000,000 per annum. The amount remains practically stationary, or is slightly increasing, by reason of the fact that a certain number of new dependants of soldiers keep coming on the pension list. Included in the amount required is a small sum for the payment of pensions granted by the Mother Country and for dominions, which will be subsequently recovered. The total number of pensions being paid on the inst. was 246,152, and the annual liabilit y was, roughly, Â£7,100,000. A considerable number of new claims are still being received, the majority of which are in respect of new dependants, such as newly-born children and recently-married wivesof ex-soldiers who are pensioners. Up to the close of the last financial year the total expenditure on war pensions was Â£50,S10,959. The last ""War PensionsAppropriation Act was passed in August,1924, the amount of the appropriation then being Â£10,000,000. The balance of that appropriation which remained unexpended on the 30th June last was Â£3,689,765. This will barely suffice for the first six months of the current financial year, and, therefore, the present appropriation is required to meet the needs of the year. This will enable the department to set aside for future payments ' any surplus revenue which may become available as a result of the year's transactions. The procedure now being adopted is that usually followed in this matter. The money will be paid into a' trust f u n d . Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time, and passed through its remaining stages without amendment or debate. NAVAL CONSTRUCTION BILL. In committee (Consideration vernor-General's message) : Motion (by Sir NEVILLE HOWSE) agreed toTliat it is expedient that an appropriation of revenue he made for the purposes of a bill for an aot to .grant and applj' out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund a sum for naval construction.

110,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,"Calare-Minister for Defence) [ 2 . 4 0 ] - I move That the bill be now read a second time. llth The appropriation of Â£1,500,000 provided for under this bill for naval construction purposes is required to meet the obligations that have been entered into in connection with the construction of cruisers and submarines, and also to commence at an early date the construction of a seaplane carrier at Cockatoo Island. The order for a large quantity of material for the construction of the seaplane carrier has already been placed, and it is hoped that the building of this very necessary adjunct to the Naval Service will be commenced at Cockatoo Island at an early date, and completed within two years.",30
111,Mr CHARLTON,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,"Hunter) [ 2 . 4 1 ] - I have no desire to delay the business brought forward, because I understand that the session will close shortly. I wish to facilitate the transaction of business so that honourable members may go to the electors. But, while I am not opposed to the expenditure on a seaplane carrier, I wish to enter an emphatic protest for the last - time against orders being sent overseas for cruisers which could be built in Australia. We have shipbuilding yards suitable for the construction of war vessels, and Australian workmen have proved their capacity to build them. In the circumstances, I shall content myself at this juncture by simply placing on record my party's protest against spending money of Gooverseas which should be used in providing employment for Australians. Mr C. RILEY (Cook) [ 2 . 4 3 ] - I wish to enter a protest against the policy of the Cockatoo Island Dockyard authorities of importing rivets for the construction of the seaplane carrier. A wellequipped bolt and rivet shop exists at the present time at this dockyard, and it proved during the war years that it was capable of turning out splendid rivets. This plant produced all the rivets required i u the construction of cruiser Brisbane, as well steamers Fordsdale and Ferndale. large number of the men employed at the dockyard have given many years of service there, but I am informed that ou the 14th of this month four or five employees received seven days' notice that their services would be dispensed with. entirely due to the policy of the department in using imported rivets. Since the dockyard has been fortunate enough to secure the order for the seaplane carrier, every effort should be made to complete the work with Australian materials. utilizing the riveting plant available afc Cockatoo Island employment would be given to Australian workmen. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time, and passed through its remainingstages without amendment or debate.

112,Mr FENTON,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,"Maribyrnong) [2.45]. - Like my Leader (Mr Charlton), I have no desire to delay matters. Nor am I anxious to use my voice in this chamber. At this juncture I prefer to reserve my vocal powers for outside use. Treasurers have always found themselves up against the fact that regulations and even acts of this Parliament have been declared invalid by the High Court. Section 88 of the Judiciary Act 1910 reads as follows: Whenever the Governor General refers to the High Court for hearing and determination any question of law as to the validity of any act or enactment of the Parliament the High Court shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine the matter. I do not know that any Government has yet requested the Governor General to ask the High Court to determine the validity of any act of this Parliament. If use were made of this provision in the Judiciary Act I am sure considerable litigation, expense, and time of Parliament would be saved. Furthermore, we should not have so much amending legislation before us to validate other legislation declared by the High Court to be invalid. the Clause agreed to. as the Clause 3A Section 20 of the principal act is amended . by inserting therein, before sub-section (2), the following sub-sections: ""' (IA ) For the purposes of the last preceding sub-section co-operative company' means 1 a company, the rules of which limit the numThis is ber of shares which may be held by, or by and on behalf of, any one member to a number not exceeding ten of a total paid-up value not exceeding Â£10, and prohibit the quotation of the shares for sale 'or purchase at any stock exchange or in any other public manner whatever, and which is established for the purpose By of carrying on any industry, trade, or business having as its primary object or objects one or both of the following:(1>) The acquisition of commodities or animals from its members for disposal or distribution in the ordinary course of the industry, trade, or business: Provided that if, in any nnancial year, the value of the commpdities or animals acquired from, or disposed of among, the members of a (as the case may be) does not represent at least 90 per centum of the total value the commodities or animals acquired or disposed of (as the case may be) by that company during that year, that company shall not, in respect of that year, be deemed to be a cooperative company.""",31
113,Mr CHARLTON,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,"Hunter ) [ 2 . 5 0 ] - I move That the words "" to a number not exceeding ten of a total paid-up value not exceeding Â£10,"" proposed new sub-section IA, be omitted. On the second reading I pointed out the necessity for this amendment, the object of which is to put co-operative societies in the position they were supposed to occupy after the passing of the last act. The shares of co-operative societies are not quoted on any stock exchange, because there is no dealing inthem. Taxation should not be imposed on the amount that is received as interest on capital invested in these concerns. When the previous assessment bil l was under consideration I was informed that the liability to pay companies' taxation would not f all upon these co-operative concerns, but, subsequently, the Commission of Taxation found that the act, as it then stood, compelled him to impose taxation upon them. What I propose now is merely to bring about what Parliament intended should be done:",31
114,Dr EARLE PAGE,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,"Cowper-Trea surer) [2.54] - 1 remember the discussion between the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) and the present Prime Minister (Mr Bruce), when this matter was previously considered, and it was entirely owing to misadventure that the position which was sought to be arrived at was not attained. In the circumstances, therefore, the Government is prepared to accept the amendment in the form suggested by the honourable member,, which form will also,. I understand, suit the desire of the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Hunter) to exempt co-operative butter factories. No honourable member wants to see factories or companies of this description unduly penalized. The other amendments to this clause, standing in my name, are designed to include among the co-operative companies specified those that provide for the storage of commodities of their members, and those pools and co-operative concerns which will probably spring into greater activity now that'the Rural Credits Department has been added to the Commonwealth Bank.

More than wire netting is necessary to make a vermin-proof fence. If dingoes are to he kept out, barbed wire is frequently used, i u addition to the ordinary fence, even if it be rabbit-proof. I think the Treasurer understands the position, and T shall be glad if he will accept my amendment.",32

This new clause is inserted to provide for a type of case that is becoming increasingly frequent, as illustrated by the seven be left years' contract for the Sydney Harbour bridge.

In Committee of Ways and M e a n s : Motion (by Dr EARLE toThat a tax be imposed on income derived from sources in Australia at the following amounts and rates, namely:A - Rate of Tax upon Income Dei-wed from Personal Exertion. For so* much of the whole taxable income as does not exceed Â£7,600 the average rate of tax per pound sterling shall be Threepence and three eight-hundredths of one penny where the taxable income is One pound sterling, and shall increase uniformly with each increase of One pound sterling of the taxable income by three eight-hundredths of one penny. The average rate of tax per pound sterling for so much of the taxable income as does not exceed Â£7,600 may be calculated from the following formula:R = average rate of tax in pence per pound sterling. I = taxable income in pounds sterling. R = (3 H 1 ) pence. N For every pound sterling of taxable income in excess of Â£7,600 the rate of tax shall be Sixty pence. B - Rate of Tax upon Income Dericed from (a) . For such part of the taxable income as docs not exceed Â£546 the average rate of tax per pound sterling shall be that given by the following formula,:R = average rate of tax in pence per pound sterling.

I find that the recommendation is that a duty of Â£d. per gallon shall be inserted in each of the three columns of the tariff. Obviously, neither I nor the Government has had an opportunity to consider the recommendation. Meanwhile, unless something is done, a duty of 3Â£d. per gallon must be collected. That was not intended by the Government, nor do I think it would be approved by this Parliament. This SECOND READIK G. motion will restore the item to the posi- tion it occupied under the existing tariff before it was amended.

The right honourable gentleman took some time to pluck up sufficient courage to resolve to go to the people, but I think there was no alternative open to him. The farcical proceedings before the Deportation Board, and the legislation reme cently passed by this Parliament, justified the Opposition in assenting to the speedy passage of certain Government measures this afternoon in order that we might facilitate an appeal to the country. Tht House will meet next week, I assume, to grant Supply; if the bill were ready now I should consent to its immediate passage.

125,Mr MAHONY,REFUSAL TO PRODUCE BOOKS AN D,"Dalley) [3.24] - I rise to direct attention to the manner in which this Government loaded the dice against Australian tenderers in connection with the contract for the construction of two 10,000-ton cruisers. When I first opposed the Government's proposal to let the contract overseas, I stated that the dice had been loaded against Australian builders. I am now in possession of definite proof of that allegation, and I propose to make it .public in order to reveal the manner in which this Government has, in pursuance of its anti-Australian policy, deprived local people of the opportunity of obtaining work so that money might be sent overseas to give work to people in another land. This morning I asked the Minister for Defence (Sir Neville Howse) if he was prepared to lay upon the Library table the communications which had passed between the Navy Ofiice and the firm of John Brown and Company, which was the successful tenderer for the two cruisers. Of course, the Minister was yery cautious; he knew that, the Government had been in communication with John Brown and Company months before tenders were invited in Australia for the construction of the cruisers. proved by the following cablegram, sent from the manager of John Brown and Company, of Clydebank, to the Navy Office, early in July, 1924 :Reply your - wire approximate average percentage cost in Great Britain for labour, material, and overhead would be 41, 51, and 8 per cent, respectively. From this you will see that only half charges are being included in present-day prices, and no profits at That message was sent months before an opportunity was given to Australian builders to> tender for the construction of the cruisers. The dice were loaded against them..",37

The wording of that cable indicates clearly that it was sent in reply to a communication from the Navy Ofiice, giving John Brown and Company a hint as to how they should tender in order to be sure of getting the contract, and John Brown and Company pointed out that the contract price included only half overhead charges, and no profits at all. When Australians were asked to tender they were compelled to include the whole of the overhead charges, plus profits and also interest upon the debentures held by the Government from the Commonwealth Shipping Board. I leave this message to carry its own tale to the people of Australia of the scandalous manner in which this Government loaded the dice against Australian firms, and I feel sure that the electors wiU welcome an early opportunity of applying the axe to the parties now in power.",37

139,Mr NELSON,FOR TWO YEARS FOR STEALING,"I am quoting only That is all the In regard to the second case. I wish to illustrate the under which the people on the Daly River are living. The letter readsSomething worse than a Citrus Canker Ordiunder the nance has happened now. That was an ordinance under which an unqualified officer in the department destroyed the whole of the citrus trees in the Northern Territory, and also the peanut crop which the settlers had produced. The letter continuesBAG OF FLOUR. You know that the Administrator, Mr. Urquhart, promised us that he would recommend the Minister to compensate us for being . at the time, prevented by the ordinance from shipping peanuts south. We got a letter from Mr MCLaren, of the Home and Territories, from that our request for compensation would not be entertained, on the advice of the AdminisProtrator. Consequently, we are not troubling bag of flour Mr Urquhart this time. In June, we shipped a mixed lot of peanuts Dalgety's. The nuts in the shell brought 7d.. lb.; the shelled nuts brought 8Jd. a lb. We set to work to gist the remainderof the nuts on hand shelled. We finished the job, and 45 bags of 70 lb. each to the landing here. They had to remain there for 'about weeks awaiting shipment, the boat being just seven weeks behind time. Owing to He this long wait, the peanuts were totally destroyed by weevils. We got the policeman to and have a look at them, and he was of same opinion as us-that it would be ; useless to ship them. The letter states that Dalgety and Com- ; pany offered to purchase the peanuts at 8^d. per lb. This is merely a repetition I of treatment that has been meted out to I I can these settlers since they have been on the I Daly River. I know of many instances I on where produce has heen waiting on the I banks for Government boats for a con-1 siderable time, and in the absence of any! Goshelter, the whole of the crop has been! destroyed. In view of these conditions, is it any wonder that a settler's mentality becomes abnormal, and that men in need of the common necessities of life, such as flour, feel compelled to take what they require from a Government .store? appeal to the Attorney-General to look into this case, and, as an act of grace*, arrange that this man is immediately released on parole. i Sir LITTLETON GBOOM (Darling Downs-Attorney-General ) [3.36] is quite impossible for me to express an opinion in the absence of the full of the case.

140,Mr OKEEFE,FOR TWO YEARS FOR STEALING,"Denison) [3.37] - As the Minister for Trade ancl Customs (Mr. Pratten) has announced to the House that a bill to validate the tariff schedule which has been tabled will be brought down some time next week, I ask if he cannot include an item under which increased protection will be given to the Australian timber industry? I do so because the Minister twelve months ago promised that increased protection, which, is so necessary to preserve the industry and to prevent it from being entirely wiped out, would be given this year, as soon as he was in possession of all the necessary information to enable him to say what additional protection was required. So far as I have been able to learn, the recommendation of the Tariff Board is not against increased protection; but I have not as yet had an opportunity of perusing the report. It was hoped that the report would have been available earlier, and, although a motion was carried this morning authorizing the printing of it, honourable members have not yet had time to peruse it. The Minister will have ample time to give the matter further attention before we meet next week. The timber industry is one in which thousands of men should be employed; but, owing to the inadequate protection, and the importations of timber from cheap-labour countries, many are now out of work. I should also like to know if it is not sible to include paper pulp in the tariff schedule, the production of which is of vital importance to Tasmania. Perhaps the Minister will be able to give consideration to these two questions, and make some definite announcement next week concerning the intentions of the Government.",39
141,Mr YATES,FOR TWO YEARS FOR STEALING,"Adelaide) [3.40] - I have only one request to make before we seek the suffrages of our constituents, and I that is to ask the Prime Minister (Mr. Bruce) if he can inform the House as to to the intention of the Government in. regard to the north-south railway? We were definitely assured by the right honourable gentleman that he would be faithful to - It the South Australian people, and would introduce a bill providing for the confacts struction of the north-south line. An agreement has been entered into between the Commonwealth Government and the South Australian Government, and we look to the Prime Minister to honour his promise. The only point in dispute appears to be whether the line shall be constructed from Kingoonyah to Oodnadatta or from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs. Personally, I do not care which route is selected; but, after all that has been said and written and promised concerning the development of this vast tract of country by. a railway to the north, it is to be hoped that the proposal is a little nearer fruition. If the Prime Minister has"" to his credit the passing of such a bill when he goes to the electors, his party may be able to obtain a seat or two more in South Australia.  Trade and Customs) [3.43] - In reply to the request of the honourable member for Denison (Mr O'Keefe), I desire to say that, in consequence of the announcement of the Prime Minister, it is obvious that no further legislation can be introduced. I have spent considerable time this week with those interested in the timber industry, and as further inquiries will be conducted by the Tariff Board, the matter will be dealt with at some future date. I was rather interested in the remarks of the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Forde) concerning the Power Alcohol Bill, which was introvast- duced some time ago. The Government was ready and eager to pass the bill in order to establish the power-alcohol inpos- dustry; but, owing to the numerous impossible propositions put forward by the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr. Forde), and others who supported him, the passage of the bill was delayed until the report of the Public Accounts Committee had been received.

I would have voted for it as it was presented; but I desired the Government to widen its scope so that bounties would be paid on power alcohol manufactured from molasses, inferior sugars, and syrups obtained from sugar, and thus solve the problem of the over-production of sugar in Queensland. The Government had the support of a majority of honourable members of this House, and it could have passed the bill if it desired to do so. The Opposition was not of sufficient strength to defeat the Government's proposals, even if it intended to do so, as was shown by the way in which the measure providing for the deportation of certain individuals was passed through Parliament.

157,Dr MALONEY,FOR TWO YEARS FOR STEALING,"Melbourne) [3.47] It was my intention to bring before the House the question of the sentence imposed on a person in the Northern Territory for the larceny of a small bag of flour from a government store, but the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Nelson) has already done so. In this connection, I desire to repeat some words of Cardinal Manning, which are equal to anything that Shakespeare ever wrote, i Cardinal Manning once said: "" Necessity knows no law, and a starving man has a right to his brother's bread."" I grant that the man was guilty of larceny, but for a judge to sentence a hungry man to r two years' imprisonment for stealing a small bag of flour is monstrous. I hope that he will not get the same treatment . when he faces his Maker. .j I desire to appeal to the Prime Minis- ' ter to grant the House an opportunity ,' to come to a decision in regard to certain ' notices of motion standing in the names j of various private members. I , myself, have four important motions on the j notice-paper. I should like the Prime Minister, by. permission of the House, to grant half an hour for a division without/ I debate, to be taken on each of those questions. I should then be supplied with data to enable me to determine whether or not, in the new Parliament, I should again move those four motions. ' Two of them are not party questions, but they are very important to a large body of people outside, especinly the "" diggers."" I name, I ask the Prime Minister to grant au opportunity for a vote to be taken on these motions. Sir KEVI1IE HOWSE (CalareMinister for Defence) [3.50] - The honourable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony) has used an answer which I gave to a question this morning as the basis of a very interesting platform speech, but his arguments couid not possibly carry any weight with honourable members on either Bide of the House. The honourable member waved in his hand a telegram which he stated had been received by the Navy Office from John Brown and Company, in August of last year. I have not the slightest doubt that such a telegram was sent, as well as hundreds of others. The honourable member implied that the telegram had been sent with a sinister motive. If he continues in the same strain, and displays the same amount of vigour during the seven or eight weeks that remain before the date of the election, I shall fear very gravely for his health.

I deeply regret that it will be impossible to accede to the request of the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney) that an opportunity be given for a vote to be taken [105] on the several motions on ' the notice paper in the names of private members. I remind him that once a dissolution has been announced, no business of any kind, other than the measures indicated in making the announcement, can be taken. I desire now to refer .lo the staten their ment by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton). In making my announcement to the House, I said nothing, beyond the actual facts, and did not attempt to make any reference of a political nature. I regret that in commenting on my statement, the Leader of the Opposition should have done so. I can only say that I am, indeed, glad, but very much surprised, that he welcomes an election with the enthusiasm which his remarks suggest. The next few weeks will prove whether he is really as enthusiastic as he appears to be today. I can assure the honourable gentleman that the course which I have taken has been definitely and clearly before me. It has not been dictated, as he suggested, by any desire to try to gain an advantage for the party which. I have the honour to lead in this House. I have taken it only because I have a very deep conviction that it is desirable at this time that the people of Australia shall express their opinion' whether the Commonwealth is to be governed by its duly elected Parliament or by outside extremists, and whether they wish to see law and order maintained in this Question resolved in the affirmative.
