Your petitioners therefore humbly pray: That appropriate laws be formulated and passed to outlaw discrimination in Commonwealth employment, in employment of individuals under federal awards, in employment of persons by statutory bodies and quasi-governmental organisations, and in employment of all persons in areas over which Commonwealth and Australian Capital Territory equal opportunity legislation should have jurisdiction; and That appropriate laws be formulated and passed to outlaw discrimination in the provision of unemployment benefits to all persons without regard to sex and/or marital status. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Dr Blewett, Mr Burns and Mr Ellicott. Petitions received. Anti-discrimination Legislation To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives of the Australian Parliament in Canberra assembled. The petition of certain citizens respectfully showethThat the right to work without discrimination on any ground including, inter alia, discrimination on grounds of race, ethnic origin, pregnancy, marital ual preference, is a fundamental human right; and That it is both the duty and fully support those denied work, and therefore those who are unemployed as a result of society's inability to provide full paid employment should be guaranteed an adequate income without discrimination on any ground, including inter alia discrimination on grounds of race, ethnic origin, marital status, sex and/or sexual preference, or pregnancy.

Taxation To the Right Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the proportion of pensionable people within our community is increasing at a significant rate. The number of people over 65 years old will rise from approximately 8.5 per cent of the population as it was in 1970 to over 10 percent by 1990 and about 16 per cent by the year 2020. That technological change is accelerating the trend towards earlier reurement from the workforce. That the above factors make incentives for self-provision in retirement years a matter of great urgency if future generations of Australians are to be spared the crippling taxation which would be necessary to fund such provisions from social welfare. That Australia is in urgent need of locally raised investment capital for national development and that life insurance and superannuation funds are important mobilisers of such capital. Your petitioners therefore most humbly pray that the Government will forthwith take the steps necessary to: (a) Remove contributions paid by the taxpayer to superannuation funds from the rebate system and make them a separate deduction from assessable income. (b) Allow as such deduction amounts necessary to provide the individual with a reasonable retirement benefit as defined from time to time by the Commissioner for Taxation. (d) Remove life insurance premiums paid from the rebate system and make them a separate deduction from assessable income also. (d) Allow such a deduction to take the form of a flat rebate of 20 per cent of life Insurance premiums up to a limit of $2,500.

That there is no certainty that any significant benefits or indeed any benefits at all will follow the use of the new weights and measures. That the traditional weights and measures are eminently satisfactory. Your petitioners therefore pray: That the Metric Conversion Act be repealed, and that the Australian Government take urgent steps to cause the traditional and familiar units to be restored to those areas where the greatest inconvenience and distress are occurring, that is to say, in meteorology, in road distances, in sport, in the building and allied trades, in the printing trade, and in retail trade. That the Australian Government request the State Governments to procure that the imperial and metric systems be taught together in schools.

(b) All marriages should be recognized as partnerships by allowing partners to divide their joint income for tax purposes. (c) The family, which is the natural and fundamental group unit of society, should be an economic unit in tax laws. (d) Children are Australia's future and their individual care by a parent at home should not be discouraged by extra tax. Your pedtioners therefore humbly pray that Parliament will reform income tax laws to allow the joint income of husband and wife to be equally divided between them for taxation purposes. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Baume, Mr West and Mr Wilson. Petitions received. Labelling of Cosmetics To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That continued use of animal ingredients in cosmetic products, and the inhumane use of animals in scientific research for cosmetic products, is abhorrent and barbaric. That the Industries Assistance Commission, because of the Commission's terms of reference, seems unable to impose any regulation or recommend any regulation which might restrict the activities of Cosmetic Companies which produce cosmetics in which animal ingredients which animals were subjected to research. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House of Representatives will: Legislate to require comprehensive labelling of perfumes, cosmetics and toilet preparations to indicate: (1) whether a product contains any animal derivative. If so, the ingredient and source should be indicated. (2) whether the research and development of that product or any of its ingredients involved experimentation on animals. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Bourchier and Mr Humphreys. Petitions received. Taxation To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of Parliament assembled in the House of Representatives. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that: Taxpayers who incur child-care expenses in order to earn income should be able to have those expenses exempt from income taxation in the same way as other taxpayers can deduct business expenses from their assessable income. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, Taxation by Mr Ellicott and Mr Roger Johnston. Petitions received. Taxation To the honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia showeth that despite repeated calls for taxation relief, charities which give expressly foreign aid are still not tax deductible, while donations to the National Party in Queensland through advertising in its magazine ""Outlook"" are an allowable tax deduction. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that this House will see fit to amend the Income Tax Assessment Act by extending the number of charities, donations to which are allowable tax deductions, to include World Vision, UNICEF, Save the Children, Austcare, Foster Parents Plan of Australia, and other foreign aid charities in order to achieve taxation justice for these charities and assist them in their fund raising campaigns. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Humphreys and Mr Leo MCLeay. Petitions received.

Export of Live Animals To the honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that: There is an urgent need that the Australian Government immediately upgrade the regulations concerning exportation of animals overseas for slaughter and that there is unnecessary suffering caused to the animals under the present system. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Parliament of Australia will amend the legislation to ensure that animals being exported be done so humanely and that until this is achieved a total ban be placed on the export of animals for slaughter. Further it is requested that the export of horses be stopped. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Jull. Petition received. To the Right Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That contributions to Health Insurance Funds should be tax deductible as it is inequitable for some members of the community to be able to claim taxation relief for health care costs, whereas other taxpayers are denied the right to claim relief for the expenditure of surance against similar costs. It is contended that it is imperative for incentive to be given by way of taxation deductibility to encourage membership of Health Insurance Funds on a long term basis or both they and the Public Health Sector will become subject to abuses which could seriously affect their ability to provide an economic and efficient service to the community. We, as members of the Queensland Teachers' Union Health Society, therefore seek early action by the Government to restore income tax deductions Health Insurance Funds. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Jull. Petition received.

We urge you to implement this request through your Minister for Social Security. The signatories to this petition are pleased to acknowledge the action your Government has taken to reverse the Budget announcement and therefore exclude the invalid pension from taxable income. We now urge you to act in another area of discrimination to handicapped persons byIncreasing the $20.00 per week income allowed in a sheltered workshop to $40.00 per week, before that income begins to reduce pension benefits; and then tie the $40.00 per week level with CPI/pension adjustments in the future. Your petitioners therefore area of discrimination to handicapped persons by increasing the $20.00 per week income allowed in a sheltered workshop to $40.00 per week, before that income begins to reduce pension benefits; and then tie the $40.00 per week level with CPI/pension adjustments in the future.

Has the Minister now conadded. sulted the records to which he referred? Will he table the letter and inform the House of any action that he took as a result of receiving it? Will he also inform the House whether or not he reboycott plied to Sir Reginald and, if he did, in what terms?",19

I hope to do so a little later today; if not, certainly by tomorrow. My communication will include both an account of the letter that I received and my reply to it. OLYMPIC GAMES: PROPOSED",19
5,Mr JARMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Can the Minister for Home Affairs inform the House which countries propose to boycott the Olympic Games in Moscow? Does the Minister regard this as representing an effective boycott of those Games?,19
6,Mr ELLICOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Accordin g to the information that the Government has, at the moment at least 41 countries have either boycotted or are almost certain to boycott the Olympic Games. It is expected that the list will be added to. For the information of honourable members, I would be or the more recent cruelty to happy to include in Hansard a copy of the list. Admittedly, some of those countries are small in terms of athletic prowess, but others are very substantial. They include the United States of America, West Germany and Canada. That represents a very significant part of the Olympic movement and of the competitive caof pacity in the world in many of the sports at the Olympic Games. That in itself makes the competition in Moscow much less effective. In fact, in Olympic terms, it makes that meeting a nonOlympics. It means that top athletes of the world will not be participating. Such participation was interests of the purpose of the Olympics and still is. Your petitioners therefore Of particular relevance to Australia is not only that fact but also the fact that included amongst those countries are countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines, PapuaNew Guinea, Thailand, China and Fiji, which are within our region. I beheve they are countries alongside which Australia would want to stand in relation to a boycott of the Olympic Games. Some 21 other countries will not be attending the Olympics for reasons other than poltiical reasons. I will be happy to include in Hansard a of those countries also.

8,Mr HAYDEN,THAN POLITICAL REASONS,"I ask a question of the Minister for Post and Telecommunications. It is supplementary to that which I asked him a few minutes ago. Is it a fact that Sir Reginald Ansett's letter of 5 December 1979 to the Minister referred the Mmister to facts which, Sir Reginald said, if they proved to be correct, would amount to a 'flat contravention of the Broadcasting and Television Act'? Did the letter also caU upon the Minister to 'investigate this matter immediately and to enforce the law of the Commonwealth'? I ask the Minister what action he, as the Minister responsible for the administration of the provisions of the Broadcasting and Television Act, took as a result of having his attention drawn to these matters by Sir Reginald, and whether he repUed to Sir Reginald and, if so, in what terms.",20
9,Mr STALEY,THAN POLITICAL REASONS,"As I have indicated, I will be answering the Leader of the Opposition. I will deal with that matter. Nothing will be held back. A reply is being prepared at the moment. NA",20
10,Mr MCVEIGH,NATURAL DISASTERS,"I direct a question to the Prime Minister. Do the present Commonwealth State arrangements under the natural disaster guidelines extend to the provision of emergency town water supplies from underground bores which have decUned because of falUng water tables in drought areas? If not, will the Commonwealth Government agree to any such proposals submitted by a State in order to ensure that local authorities have adequate town water suppUes through sinking, developing and equipping new bores?",20
11,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,NATURAL DISASTERS,"The aspects which the honourable gentleman has mentioned are not included in the core group of measures which are agreed as a matter of course between the Commonwealth and the States. On the core group of measures the States know that they can go ahead and commit expenditure with the complete understanding that the joint arrangements will operate. So that honourable gentlemen may be reminded of those measures, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard one page of last year's MalBudget Papers. It describes the core measures. They are extensive and instructive. Leave granted. The document read asfollowsExtract from 'Payments to or for the States, the Northern and Local Government Authorities 1978-79', 1978-79 Budget Paper No. 7; pp 84,85 NA When natural disasters causing damage and destruction occur in a State, the Commonwealth stands ready to join with the State Government concerned on a $ 1 for $ 1 basis in meeting expenditure on the immediate relief of personal hardship and distress, except where such expenditure is of a very minor nature. Such expenditures may cover provision of food, clothing, shelter and repair of homes to make them habitable and secure. In respect of'major' disasters, the Commonwealth also assists with expenditures on other agreed relief and restoration measures when it is considered beyond the capacity of the State concerned to meet these expenditures from its own resources. In 1977 arrangements were made to enable the States to assume automatic Commonwealth agreement to inclusion of certain 'standard' measures under the arrangements following specified major disasters. The States are required to seek Commonwealth approval if they wish to change the terms of previously applied standard measures (e.g. the size of concessional loans). It remains open to a State to request Commonwealth support for non-standard measures which it might wish to implement for a given disaster. The standard measures are as follows: (a) grants for relief of personal hardship and distress (cyclones, floods, storms, bushfires); (b) grants for restoration of public assets and emergency protection and repair works by State, local and semi-government authorities (disasters as in (a)); (c) concessional loans to small businesses (cyclones and floods); (d) concessional loans to churches, sporting associations and other voluntary non-profit organisations (disasters as in (c)); (e) concessional loans to primary producers for carry-on, restocking and restoration etc. purposes (cyclones, floods, storms, bushfires and droughts); (f) freight subsidies for primary producers (disasters as in(e)); (g) subsidies for carriage of water to central dispersal points for primary producers (drought); and (h) assistance to State, local and semi-government authorities for the disposal of helpless and unsaleable stock (floods, bushfires and droughts). The financial arrangements which had applied since 1971 were modified in 1978-79. The Commonwealth previously met all expenditures by a State in a year on agreed measures necessitated by major disasters in excess of a base amount set for the State. Under the current arrangements above-base expenditures are financed on a $3 Commonwealth: $ 1 State basis. The State base contributions, which were doubled in 1978-79, are: New South Wales Victoria Queensland South Australia Western Australia Tasmania Major disasters are denned as those necessitating tures on agreed relief and restoration measures in excess of one tenth of a State's base annual expenditure.",20
12,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,ASSISTANCE FOR NATURAL DISASTER RELIEF,"If any State wishes to propose measures additional to those which are accepted as a matter of course, it may do so. In Western Australia, where some wheat producing areas were in the fourth year of drought, the Premier proposed certain specific and special measures. They have been substantially accepted. In addition, in New South Wales some additional measures have been agreed upon between the Commonwealth and the New South Wales Government, to include the provision of subsidies to councils and other organisations which are approved by the State and which are able to provide emergency water supplies, but such subsidies are to be based on existing facilities and on reasonable additional special costs incurred in providing emergency supplies to primary producers. Some additional support also will be given to primary producers to assist them in meeting special costs incurred in the transport of emergency water supplies to their properties. I mention those two matters because one is quite specifically related to provisions which could be made by local government, and which have been approved in recent weeks, in the drought areas in New South Wales. If the honourable gendeman believes that particular circumstances in relation to local government town water supplies arise out of the drought, that would be a matter for the Premier to put to us. The Premier has, in fact, proposed some additional measures which are now receiving urgent examination, but the matters raised by the honourable gentleman are not included in the matters about which the Premier wrote to me. TELEVISION STATIONS: OWNERSHIP",21
13,Mr BARRY JONES,ASSISTANCE FOR NATURAL DISASTER RELIEF,"I direct my question to the Minister for Post and Telecommunications. Is it a fact that by a letter dated 5 December 1979 Mr W. Franklin, Secretary of Ansett Transport Industries Ltd, wrote on behalf of that company to the Secretary of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal to advise him of facts which he alleged showed that Mr Rupert Murdoch and/or the News group of companies were purchasing shares in Ansett Transport Industries Ltd in breach of the various offence provisions of the $m Broadcasting and Television Act relating to limi10.0 tation of ownership of television stations? Is it a 7.0 fact that in this letter Mr Franklin said that no 4.0 3.0 doubt the Tribunal would initiate its own inquiry 3.0 and would use its powers to prevent any contra1.2 vention of the Act or other offences? Is it a fact expendithat the Secretary of the Tribunal did not even reply to Mr Franklin's letter? Will the Minister table the letter to the Tribunal from Mr FrankUn?",21
14,Mr STALEY,ASSISTANCE FOR NATURAL DISASTER RELIEF,I will make inquiries about the matter raised by the honourable gentleman and give him an answer as soon as possible. NA,21
15,Mr CHAPMAN,CHRYSLER AUSTRALIA LTD,"My question, which I direct to the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, concerns the South Australian based company Chrysler Australia Ltd, which is located in my electorate. Can the Mmister advise the House about Chrysler's local content performance under the Passenger Motor Vehicle Manufacturing Plan? Furthermore, was Chrysler successful at the recent tender of passenger motor vehicle quotas? Will Chrysler have a further opportunity to secure additional passenger motor vehicle quota?",21
16,Mr GARLAND,CHRYSLER AUSTRALIA LTD,"I am aware of the interest that the honourable member has in the motor vehicle industry, in particular as it applies to South Australia. I will be announcing today the local content performance for 1979 of all five participants in the Passenger Motor Vehicle Manufacturing Plan. I am pleased to say that the recent local content performance of Chrysler Australia Ltd under the Plan has greatly improved. Chrysler, and some other companies, previously did experience difficulty in meeting local content commitments, mainly because of the appreciation of the yen up to the end of 1978. But in Chrysler's case the problems were greater because it was required to achieve a relatively higher content in 1978 and 1979 and the yen's appreciation was accompanied by a decUne in the sales of Chrysler's high content Valiant. I understand that Chrysler is continuing to achieve in excess of its commitment under the Plan and is confident of meeting its obligations in 1980. Chrysler was successful in gaining a proportion of the 5,000 units of passenger motor vehicle quota allocated in March of this year. The Industries Assistance Commission, as the House has been advised, is presently inquiring into the quota aUocation system to apply to passenger motor vehicles in 1981.1 understand that the report will be received by 21 September this year.

17,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,CHRYSLER AUSTRALIA LTD,"I ask the Minister for Post and Telecommunications whether the Secretary of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal wrote to Senator Button on 8 February 1980 saying, inter alia: ATIThat is, Ansett Transport Industries Ltdwrote to the Tribunal on 5.12.79 stating that News Ltd and/or its associated companies to more than 15 per cent of the share capital in ATI. At page 37 of the transcript of the proceedings of the Tribunal's inquiry into an apphcation by Control Investments Pty Ltd to purchase up to 50 per cent of the paid capital of Ansett Transport Industries Ltd, did Mr Nicholson, QC, call upon the Tribunal to produce the ATI letter referred to by the Tribunal's Secretary? Is it not a fact that the Chairman of the Broadcasting Tribunal misled counsel by stating that the ATI letter referred to was not a letter directed to the Tribunal but rather one directed to the Minister, and therefore did not form part of the Tribunal's files?",22
18,Mr SPEAKER,CHRYSLER AUSTRALIA LTD,"Order! Included in the question was a reflection upon an identified person; that is, the Chairman of the Tribunal. It is the practice of the House, when a question reflects upon a named or identifiable individual, that the question be treated as on notice.",22
19,Mr HAYDEN ,CHRYSLER AUSTRALIA LTD,"I raise a point of order. This is an extraordinarily important matter. I do not believe it should be buried on the Notice Paper. It seems to me that, with suitable adjustment of one or two words, the question would be in order. Mr Speaker, I ask you to extend your indulgence to allow the honourable member for Burke to make that adjustment to the latter part ofhis question so that it can go to the Minister.",22
20,Mr SPEAKER,CHRYSLER AUSTRALIA LTD,"The honourable member for Burke will be entitled to the call if he stands later, although, as he has had one call today, he may not receive it today. It is a matter for the honourable gentleman himself to put his question in order. I call the honourable member for La Trobe. NA",22

The may be beneficially entitled convention itself will be formally open for signature in Canberra on 1 August 1980. It is fair to say that the signing of the Final Act marks the culmination of over three years of extremely intensive negotiations to develop a regime for the conservation of the marine ecosystem of the entire area south of the Antarctic convergence. From the outset Australia has played a leading role in the negotiations. Australia acted as host at a special consultative meeting in 1978 which drew up the text which formed the basis for later negotiation. The honourable member for Hawker, from the moment of the convening of this Conference, played a leading role, together with the honourable member for La Trobe, who participated throughout in the delegation from this side, and other members of the Senate and of this place on both sides of the Parliament. I would like to say how much my officials appreciated the work that was done consistently by members on both sides. Mr Jacobi-They did afirstclass job. EmptyHere very persistently with one aim in mind, namely, to bring about the convention which was signed today. That is a tribute to the work not only of my departmental officers but also of parliamentarians on both sides of the House, for the successful conclusion represents a very significant new direction for the Antarctic Treaty system and its significance should not be underestimated. I well recall, in the weeks after I opened the Conference in 1978, reading review articles about how fruitless the endeavour would be. It has been proven to be quite the contrary. It demonstrates that the system is capable of adaptation to respond to increased international interest in resource issues. This has been achieved in a manner which is consistent with the responsibilities which the Antarctic Treaty partners have assumed for the protection of the Antarctic environment. Finally, if there was a plethora of assistance so far as the convention itself was concerned, we can reduce that degree of assistance to a number of Tasmanian members and senators who worked so hard with me to convince other delegates that Hobart ought to be the site of the headquarters of the international commission. The decision to select Hobart, I think, is signal recognition of the role that Australia has played in these negotiations and will certainly focus for continued Australian involvement in an important area of international activity affecting Antarctica.

Is he aware that in 1936 the French Cabinet, under Leon Blum, allocated one million French francs to go to the Berlin Olympic Games and 600,000 French francs to go to the Russian backed Barcelona Games? Does the Minister consider that this ability to look both ways at once helped the French national security and defence effort? If so, how? Does he consider that Australia's defence and national security effort should receive similar leadership in 1980 to that proposed by France for itself in 1936 and 1980?",24
37,Mr KILLEN,OLYMPIC GAMES,"The House and the country are, or should be, indebted to the honourable member for Lilley for drawing on history in this very sad and solemn business. History can be a good tutor, provided people will take notice of it. The fact is, as the honourable gentleman has stated, that Hitler used the Olympic Games for his own evil ends. Today, with the ugly apparatus of aggression by the Soviets in Afghanistan the world is being persuaded that there is something thoroughly respectable about the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union today, in the conduct of international affairs, is desperately seeking respectability. As the Prime Minister and my colleague the Minister for Home Affairs have said, there is slowly coming into existence a more emancipated view of what the Soviet Union is about. I am wondering whether it would be an intolerable imposition upon the House if I were to read just one short paragraph from a recent de92 provisions of the Act as shares have bate in the House of Lords. The paragraph reads: I do not know whether other noble Lords saw as I did... a letter in The Times a week or so ago from a Jewish German lady who was treated extremely harshly in one of Hitler's prisons in 1936. She recorded very graphically and movingly in a few lines the impact made on her and those with her when they were told that the Olympics were being held in Berlin and that aU of the Western countries were going there. The paragraph goes on to state that to take part in the Games: would be to take part in an obscene farce. The speaker was a former British Labour Foreign Secretary, Lord George-Brown. NA NA",24
38,Dr JENKINS,TRIBUNAL,"Bein g an optimist, I address my question to the Minister for Post and Telecommunications. I refer the Minister to the penultimate paragraph of the High Court's decision in the case of Hardiman and others against the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, where the judges of the Court expressed their disapproval of the Tribunal's somewhat unusual action-to use the words of the judges-in appearing to put substantive arguments in relation to the matters before it. Is it a fact that the advice from the Attorney-General's Department to the Tribunal initially was that the Tribunal should not appear in this case to put substantive arguments. In reliance on this advice, was it the Tribunal's initial inclination not to appear to put substantive arguments? Was the decision to reverse the Tribunal's initial stance taken after consultation between the Attorney-General and/or the Minister for Post and Telecommunications and Tribunal members? Did the Attorney-General and/or the Minister argue in favour of the Tribunal appearing to put substantive arguments? If so, what were the reasons for the Minister and/or the Attorney-General commending this unusual course of action to the Tribunal? Did the Attorney-General and/or the Minister direct the Tribunal to appear to put substantive arguments?",24
39,Mr STALEY,TRIBUNAL,"The Tribunal is not subject to direction by Ministers in these sorts of matters. The Tribunal made its own decision-it was not a decision which was based on particular advice-to appear before the High Court in its own way. I can assure honourable members that the Broadcasting Tribunal is very familiar with all that the High Court said in its judgment and will, of course, incorporate in its procedures and approaches all that flows out of the High Court decision.

80,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,The honourable gentleman,28
81,Mr HAYDEN,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"On 12 May 1980 I spoke in Brisbane to the Australian Colleges of Advanced Education Computing Science Conference. Among the things that I said was: I notice that another distinguished Australian, the Governor General, Sir Zelman Cowen, was reported in the Press last week as saying that fears about the loss of employ the introduction of new technology have been to section 22 shown to be unfounded. National Director I continued: I am not sure why Sir Zelman has chosen to enter this particular argument or what is the basis for his assertion. I concluded in this regard, by saying: Not even the silicon chip could have any impact on the traditional duties of the Governor General, but I wish I share Sir Zelman's confidence about the impact of technology on the general work force. That statement was based on an article in the the Melbourne Age of Thursday 8 May which, inter alia, under a photograph of the Governor General, attributed to him the following comment: . . . fears about the loss of employment through introduction of new technology had been demonstrated unfounded. My attention has been drawn to the actual speech that was delivered by Sir Zelman up-to-date Cowen-the 1980 Meredith Memorial resources lecture-at La Trobe University on Wednesday May. The relevant part of which-it is relatively short-reads : In the past, apprehensions of loss of employment in the face of technical progress and what for long was called mation have been demonstrated to be unfounded. I do not have time to explore the reasons for this; and the whether it is likely to be the same with the new technology with its applications in computer control and robotics. The further question is whether such employment problems are likely to be long term. I don't know how broad the terms of today's subject are, but it seems to me that such issues are central to a consideration of Australian science and technology in the decades ahead. At the time. I delivered my address, on Friday, May, I was not aware of a correction or report the Age on that date headed: 'Computers a worry says Cowen'. It included which I have just given. To the extent that there has been a misrepresentation, I apologise. SCIENCE STATEMENT 1979-80 Ministerial Statement",28
82,Mr THOMSON ,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Leichhardt-Minister for That, Science and the Environment)- I have pleasure in presenting the Science Statement for 1979-80 and seek leave to make certain remarks relating statement thereto. Leave granted. Mr THOMSONThis statement is a report 1977-78 on Commonwealth funding of research and deabout velopment over the past four years. It is the first such statement. It is a pilot document which hope will be repeated and expanded annually. It is in accordance with the Government's stated policy of advising Parliament and Australia on trends in the nation's research and development. It is a step towards what I hope will be a wideranging discussion, perhaps leading to changes in the future. The statement could not have been produced without the co-operation of my terial colleagues and their officers. To all these, I express my appreciation. The statement is a post-Budget analysis of search expenditure of all Government department ments and provides information is essential for those inside and outside government who are concerned that research activities should be linked to national needs. Research priorities need to be adjusted from time to time to meet new demands brought about by such realities as changing population patterns, changing comthe munity expectations, changing world industrial to be and trade patterns and changing energy requirements. It is of critical importance that the policy makers, responsible for the adjustments, have information on the allocation of the of both the Government and the com7 munity. We should all be concerned about research priorities because research today is the basis of the science and technology that affect the community tomorrow. The Government sees sciautoence and technology playing a central role in contributing to national economic health. It is a question is key to the solution of many of the problems confronting our society. Science and technology now pervade all aspects of our lives. They enhance our lifestyles and provide employment and investment opportunities. In Australia, more than 70 per cent of research expenditure is provided by governments. The effective and efficient 9 utilisation of science and technology resources is in therefore a major responsibility of government. This Government has consistently accepted that the full quotation responsibility. Some points should be borne in mind when interpreting the statement. It is in part an experiment. The treatment of data has naturally varied according to the source of information. however, does not detract from its usefulness. The basic aim has been to present total Commonwealth payments for research. The shows that Commonwealth funding of research rose substantially between 1968-69 and 1973-74 and was then maintained in real terms until 1976-77. There was a slight drop in and since then it has been increased to the previous level in real terms. The statement also shows that private enterprise research I and development declined substantially between 1974 and 1977. Preliminary results of the latest survey by the Austrahan Bureau of Statistics show that this decline has been arrested, and indicate an upturn of 6 per cent in real terms. Government priorities for energy and manufacturing industry have been reflected in substantialrisesin research and development fundminising. For example, expenditure on energy of research and development rose from $ 12.9m in 1976-77 to an estimated $30m this financial year. reManufacturing industry research and developsupport rose from $39. lm in 1976-77 to an estimated $66.8m. Theserisesare reflected in the trends in research and development funded by my colleagues the Minister for National Development and Energy (Senator Carrick) and the Minister for Productivity ( Mr Newman). Research and development in the areas of health and environment have been well supported in real terms. In welfare research there has been a large relative increase from a low base. Over the four years covered by the statement, the total of capital and other funds available to the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation has not been reduced in real terms but in fact has been slighdy increased. Some activities have been reduced and new ones commenced. In particular the construction of the new Australian National Animal Health Laboratory is now progressing rapidly. In the same period, support for university research provided through the Australian Research Grants Committee has been maintained substantially at a uniform level in real terms. In supporting research we must ensure that the work is directed towards national economic and social goals. We must also ensure that resources are used efficiently. In Australia we believe that these requirements can be best achieved through a pluralist pattern which facUitates different approaches for different sectors. Only CSIRO has a wide charter for its research and development interests. This pluralist system has worked well. It works, I believe, much better than a centralised, bureaucratic approach. Our system must place special emphasis on co-ordination and on assigning priorities among sectors. This is a basic tenet of our science and technology policy. We have mechanisms to provide co-ordination, to identify gaps and to recommend on priorities. A wide range of bodies provide scientific and technological pohcy advice to the Government. The principal independent advisory body is the Australian Science and Technology Council. The Parliament itself has a significant role in this process. The Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment and other committees are important sources of advice. Given this pluralistic approach, information on resources devoted to research in each sector is critical. I see that as the value of this statement. informs the Parliament on the allocation of public funds. It provides the various advisory and coordinating bodies with information necessary for their deliberations. Above all, it informs members of the pubUc of the nature and extent of the research and development they are supporting. Having compUed the information, we must look at the effectiveness of our use of the resources. A fundamental four-fold plan is required, firstly, to develop our capabUity in basic research to provide a store of knowledge and expertise for the future; secondly, to develop our capabUity in applied research; thirdly, to transfer research achievements, through development, into the market place; and fourthly, to ensure that any undesirable social and environmental impacts of technology are minimised. It seems to me that insufficient attention is being paid at present to the fourth element of the plan-the assessment of the possible impacts of science and its applications. I believe that, if this situation is to be corrected, governments should give a lead. They should have a greater involvement in the transfer of research achievements, through development, into the market place. In my view, the promotion of appUed science would include assessment and the solution of social as well as scientific and technological problems. CSIRO is already heavUy involved in the business of getting research results into the market place. I also intend that my Department shall examine what contribution it can make in this area. Those concerned with science and technology should have a pre-occupation with the future and a concern not only for what is, but also for what can be. The aim is to harness professional skUls of prediction to the goals and aspirations of the people in the society in which scientists work and live. Thus we can combine what is and what can be with what our society considers ought to be. The public expects science and technology to improve the future. We are experiencing the benefits of space research in new materials and in applications to meteorology, communications and earth resources management. In the not too distant future we may see the use of space's low gravity extreme vacuum environment to enable us to produce new alloys and other materials. We may see energy beamed from space. Biotechnology, the science of creating new organisms to perform industrial processes, offers exciting prospects. The public also expects science and technology to contribute to the solution of our problems. I am concerned about our changing popuIt lation distribution and the decline in some centres west of the Great Dividing Range. I was therefore impressed to learn of research in the United States into small scale industrial technology and rural revitalisation. Such projects could be of great value to a country such as Australia. We are already beginning to see the usefulness of solar energy in remote locations. The growing technological complexity, indicated in my previous remarks, does bring with it the danger of polarisation and conflict. Society is already dividing into those who are familiar with science and those who are fearful of it. There is a rising disquiet in the community about some aspects of science. The possible effect technologies on employment is one such issue. There are others. We need to explain the benefits ties of science. We need to lessen misunderstandings which can arise all too easily. Greater understanding will lessen the potential for conflict over subject the application of science. Science policy should emphasise public education to ensure effective public participation in versity debate on issues which have profound social the low effects. I believe this science statement tribute to this public understanding and improve the capacity of people to make informed judgopment ments about science and technology. I commend it as one step in a continuing effort to make the best use of science and technology for the benefit than of Australia and Australians. I present the following paper: Science Statement 1979-80-Ministeria l Statement, May 1980. Motion (by Mr Street) proposed: That the House take note of the papers.",29
83,Dr KLUGMAN ,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Prospect) (3.26)-It is not easy for me to reply quickly to a science statemore ment which contains nearly 70 pages of figures and which was given to the Opposition only in the last couple of hours. I am not complaining about that. I am just explaining why I will not into detaU to any large extent in respect of the actual scientific content of the paper. It is imposshis ible to deal with such a statement in detaU now. hope that when honourable members have had chance to have a good look at the paper they will be given an opportunity of dealing with it greater detail. I think it would be fair to say-and I do not want to be too aggressive about this-that the statement of the Minister for Science and the Environment ( Mr Thomson) is a complacent rescience. view of the state of scientific research in Australia. The Minister is quite happy with way things are going. I refer to an article which appeared in the Australian Financial Review ot May 1980 which quotes Sir Geoffrey Badger, the Chairman of the Australian Science and Technew nology Council. It states: Australian reliance on imported technology will make it more difficult for governments to regulate the pace at and extent to which it is introduced, according to a leading technologist. Sir Geoffrey Badger, chairman of the Austrahan and Technology Council, called for a Government science policy to oversee technological change. 'We perform about 2 per cent of the world's research development as measured by the number of scientific publications, ' Sir Geoffrey said. 'On the other hand we have a substantial deficit in our of new technological balance of payments. 'Our receipts from overseas for patents, licences and royalamount to only 11 per cent of the payments we have to make to overseas companies. 'The technology we use is mainly imported and cannot be to regulation by governments in terms of the pace and extent of its introduction, at least in business enterprises.' Delivering a keynote paper at Melbourne's La Trobe UniMeridith Memorial Lectures this week, he described level of industrial research in Australia compared will conwith other developed countries. Figures for 1973-74 showed industrial research and develwas 37 per cent of all R and D but by 1976-77 it had fallen to 2 9 per cent of the total. Compared with other OECD countries, that figure was less half the level for every other member country with the exception of Canada. Surely that is depressing. If we look at the 20 figures-and as I mentioned earlier I have looked at only the first few pages-w e see that estimated Commonwealth Government funds expended on research and development in 1978-79 as compared with 1973-74 have decreased in real terms by 18 per cent. Secondly, and in some ways even depressingly-it ought to be more depressing for honourable members opposite-althoug h private enterprise contributed some 33 per cent of total expenditure on research and developgo ment in 1968-69, its contribution was down to 18 per cent by 1976-77. The Minister said today in ministerial statement on science that there I has been a slight upturn- I think a 6 per cent a upturn-in private business expenditure. However, it is important to remember that this contriin bution has reached a very, very low level- a depressingly low level. Let us look at the research position in Australia. I speak with some feeling on this because I started off my adult Ufe as a researcher in I graduated with honours in physical chemistry at the University of Sydney in the year the that the atomic bomb was dropped. I was then on the staff of the Department of Chemistry at 9 the University for two years before I decided to change over to medicine and start a completely career. The situation even then was depressing in terms of the sort of research facilities which were provided in universities. I was involved in work on spectrophotometers. I knew that it took some two or three months to get a number offiguresand a number of results that Science people in the United States could get within hours with better equipment. I could not see any future in continuing that work. Maybe I was easand Uy dissuaded from doing my work, but I think this is probably an indication of the sort of thing which faced other people interested in scientific research in Australia. I think it is true to say that Australia's research effort in our academic institutions is very small in terms of international comparison. Under the present Government it has declined to dangerously restricted levels. Considering our long term national interests, it should be much higher. I know that pleas are made by people who are involved in research just as pleas are made by people who are involved in anything else. This applies to politicians when they go before the Remuneration Tribunal and to people who come to Canberra for Budget discussions. Farmers might speak to the Minister for Science and the Environment, who is at the table, in his capacity as their local member. A lot of special pleading goes on and as politicians we are aware of this. But I think that generally speaking there is agreement among authoritative bodies and persons in Australia that Australia is not expending adequate funds on research in general and on research in academic institutions in particular. In recent years the Government has ignored the call for increased funding for research by Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development examiners in science and technology, the Australian Science and Technology Council, the Universities Council, the Tertiary Education Commission, the Australian Academy of Science, the Industries Assistance Commission, academic staff associations, the Committee of Inquiry into Education and Training and the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment. Whilst each body emphasises particular benefits to be accrued from increased funding for research, the range of arguments for increased research funding usually includes economic well-being and material progress. Research contributes to industrial development, mastery of technological innovation, improved use of resources, energy self-sufficiency and an increased standard of living. In the case of social and public welfare research, benefits include improved insight into the working of our society and the hope of improved services and better social mechanisms for coping with such issues as the social ramifications of technological change itself. Finally, the extension of knowledge is used as an argument in favour of increased research. It is generally argued that it is necessary as a matter of national prestige that we participate meaningfully in the extension of knowledge, particularly in matters related to the Australian skies, sea and land mass, and of course areas of the Antarctic under our care. Such activities contribute to the intellectual and teaching vitality of our academic institutions and may form the basis of practical applications. However, there is evidence of neglect in research funding. Adequate funding levels have not been maintained through recurrent expenditure, special research grants, allocations by research funding committees or the granting of Commonwealth post-graduate awards. Firstly, under the present Government's announced programs, recurrent funding for universities and colleges of advanced education during 1980 and 1981 will be held in constant prices at the 1979 level which was about $12m below the needs recommended by the Tertiary Education Commission. The Commission has protested, saying: One particular area of concern to the Commission is the impact of these funding restrictions on research activities. The proportion of universities' recurrent expenditure devoted to research activities has steadily declined. The Australian Research Grants Committee was allocated $ 13.9m in the 1979-80 Budget. In real terms this represents a cut of 8 per cent compared with the amount allocated in 1976-77. The National Health and Medical Research Council was allocated $14m for the current year which represents no change in real terms. That sum is equal to 0.2 per cent of the total health budgetone-fifth of one per cent-compare d with 0.4 per cent four years ago. The Council has been able to fund only 37 per cent of grant applications for the next year. I think there is a depressing future in relation to grants given by the National Health and Medical Research Council. An important aspect is the post-graduate studentship awards. I have been in contact with post-graduate students in my capacity as a representative of this House on the Council of the Australian National University. I think they have an excellent case; and I am not often persuaded by cases presented by people. The Commonwealth Postgraduate Award Scheme allocation of $8.9m in 1979-80 represents a 9.1 per cent cut in real terms in overall funding. The number of new Commonwealth post-graduate awards decreased from 725 in 1974 to 555 in 1979. Following the anomalous decision to tax only post-graduate studentships awarded by the Commonwealth, it is estimated that the real value of each award has declined by 50 per cent over the five year period. Compared with average weekly earnings, the award is at its lowest level for at least 10 years. Many of our ablest students of mature age with dependants are being forced to live in conditions close to poverty. Finally, I wish to quote, with regard to fundato mental and applied research, from the Organisvide ation for Economic Co-operation and Development examiners' reports on science and technology in Australia. It reads: . . . in Australia a disproportion exists between academic research and I.R. & D. Furthermore, we suffer . . . a umidity in investing innovative As a result, Uttle science flows into indigenous development, because it is insufficiently concentrated. I think that is an important point for those of us who are also interested in manufacturing industry. The quotation continues: Little fragments of information and expertise are not enough to start a development, build an export program, or calculate multi-million dollar risks. Last year the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment said: At present no clear national policy for science and technology exists in Australia. In coherence, sense of purpose or direction in government support for industrial research and development. In the first volume of the ASTEC report entitled 'Science and Technology in Australia 1977-78' it was stated: The long term survival of manufacturing in Australia requires a high level of modern technology and of technological innovation. I think that is very important. On the general philosophical argument I agree with the Minister when he talks in his statement about the growing technological complexity which brings with it danger of polarisation and conflict. Society, as he put it, is already dividing into those who are familiar with science and those who are fearful of it. There is a rising disquiet in the community about some aspects of science. The possible effect of new technologies on employment is one such issue. There are others. Nuclear energy is a very important issue for this country. In many cases there is a lack of understanding on both sides about the benefits or dangers of nuclear energy. If we want to compete in the world of the 1980s, the 1990s and 2000 and beyond it is terribly important that we have an intelligent and educated community which is able to take advantage of technological advances and a significant proportion of which is not terribly scared of the disbenefits of science. I am one of those who are optimistic about science. I believe science will solve most of the problems which face us, as it has in the past. I think it is important for the Government and for scientists as a whole to continue to try to persuade the community at large that huge threats are really not involved and for those arguing for and against to put on the platforms not extremists who take only one point of view but people who are obviously able see both sides of the issue and are able to prous with intelligent leadership in the future.

NA NA Report on Zimbabwe",31
84,Mr DOBIE ,AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE,"Cook)-On behalf of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence I present the Committee's report on Zimbabwe, together with the transcript of evidence. Ordered that the report be printed.",33
85,Mr DOBIE ,AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE,"Cook)-by leave-The problems of southern Africa are complex and interrelated. Central to these problems are issues of race and black nationalism-the struggle by blacks for an end to white domination of their Uves and for the opportunity to achieve social, political and economic equality with whites. Because Zimbabwe was the focus of the struggle at the time that the Sub-Committee on Southern Africa began its investigation, the Sub-Committee decided to concentrate its inquiry initially on that country. This first report is the result of that inquiry. The Sub-Committee considered that a detaUed examination of the Zimbabwe situation was important not only in its own right but also for its implication for the region. However, the issues of racialism and nationalism are not the only issues of southern Africa. Its economic development, its strategically important geographic position and mineral resources and existing and possible EastWest confrontation in the region are also important issues. The Sub-Committee intends to examine these in a subsequent report or reports together with their implications for Austraha. Although much of the evidence taken by the Sub-Committee was on the Zimbabwe situation, considerable evidence was also taken on the broader aspects of the inquiry. To date the Sub-Committee has taken some 2,500 pages of evidence from 80 witnesses, most of it in public session, and considered in excess of 300 submissions. Formal hearings commenced in October 1978 and the volume and extent of the evidence indicate considerable interest in the community concerning events in Southern Africa. As well as submissions and oral evidence the Sub-Committee considered a wide range of documentary source material, some of which is cited in end notes at the conclusion of each chapter of the report. This material came from a wide range of sources. In the course of its inquiry into events in Zimaspects babwe the Sub-Committee was faced with two resolve problems in particular. The first was the difficulty of preparing a report and formulating conand clusions in a situation where major developbuilt ments were regularly changing the course of events. The Sub-Committee began its inquiry some six months after the Internal Settlement Agreement of 3 March 1978. This was followed in April 1979 by the election of the of Bishop Muzorewa, by the Lusaka Agreement in August 1979, the Lancaster House conference in September-December, the ceasefire and reit turn to legality in December, new elections February 1980 which brought Mr Mugabe's take Government to power, and official independence on 18 April 1980. This marked the end of a Briachievement tish colonial presence in Africa as Rhodesia been Britain's last colony on the African continent. It would be fair to say that Rhodesia had attracted world attention in recenttimesfor two inter-related reasons. The first was the struggle by whites for independence from Britain and the second was the struggle by blacks for an end to white domination and racial inequality. at Although a settlement of both issues was achieved eventually through negotiations, unlikely that those negotiations would have taken place had it not been for three major influences: The pressure exerted by the black nationalists through a guerrilla warfare of increasing intensity; pressure on the economy of Rhodesia as a result of sanctions and on the economies of neighbouring Zambia and whites Mozambique through their implementation of sanctions; and the election of a black majority government in April 1979. The Muzorewa Government was Rhodesia's first black majority rule government. But its ability to institute major social and economic reforms was limited, to some extent, by constitutionally entrenched white safeguards. The Muzorewa Government was also hampered by the fact that it had been elected at an election in which the two major external national parties in the Patriotic Front had refused to participate, basically because they had not been involved in drawing up the 1979 Constitution, but also, and equally importantly, because they did not believe the elections under transitional government control would be impartial. In the event, most international observers at the 1979 and 1980 elections did consider them to have been impartially conducted and administered. While the achievement of majority rule in 1980 resolved the political and constitutional of racial inequality in Rhodesia, it did not the economic or social aspects. These remain a problem and a challenge to both blacks whites. The problem includes an economy on institutionalised discrimination, separate and unequal ownership of land, white control of industry, commerce, mining and commercial agriculture, a white near monopoly of skilled and better paid jobs and inequalities in housing, eduGovernment cation and health services. To reorganise the economy without disrupting and to reallocate resources so that inequalities in are minimised and no longer based on race will time. But the time available to Mr Mugabe's Government may be limited because the of majority rule and the promises of had two election campaigns have created expectations of rapid change among blacks. Mr Mugabe will be able to improve the position of the worse affected blacks in the short term, particularly with international financial assistance. But in the Committee's view, in the longer term, he will need to resolve the crisis of expectation while retaining black confidence, retain the cooperation and confidence of whites, increase or least maintain the overall productivity of the economy and cope with the immense problems it is of reconstruction. With the example of countries such as Mozambique, Prime Minister Mugabe would be well aware of the need to avoid an exodus of expertise and would be unlikely to precipitate a radical redistribution of resources which would force out and their expertise, cause the economy to decline and worsen the position of blacks. Additionally, Mr Mugabe would be aware that the size and structure of the present economy is not such that everyone can enjoy the fruits of the modern sector. Nevertheless some redistribution of resources will be necessary to meet minimum black expectations. Land will have to be reallocated on a large scale; black minimum wages will need to be raised; and greater resources will need to be devoted to black education, housing, health facilities and infrastructure such as water supplies, roads and power. The white minority cannot expect to maintain its previous share of the limited resources of Zimbabwe at the expense of the black majority. The Committee's assessment is that whites in the less skilled positions will gradually leave Zimbabwe as their standard of living is eroded below an acceptable level. But I believe that the numbers of whites who will leave Rhodesia cannot be predicted because of the large number of variables involved. The important fact for this House to note is that, despite a seven-year guerrilla Rhodesia became Zimbabwe through elections which peacefully produced a black government. If this government can successfully run Zimbabwe, reconcile its white minority to black rule and social equality with blacks and achieve a narrowing of economic inequalities, then Zimbabwe should prove a crucial stabilising force on the economies of the front-line states of Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Botswana, Tanzania and Angola. Progress by Mr Mugabe's Government will also bring pressure to bear on the Republic of South Africa in relation to its internal racial problems and for an early determination of the future of Namibia. The Committee made few recommendations but it did believe that there was an urgent need for aid in Zimbabwe and that it should be within the first two years of its independence. The Committee was pleased to note an Austrahan aid grant of $5m, to be provided over the next two years, was offered by the Australian Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) at the Independence Day celebrations on 18 April 1980 and that $ 1.5m of it had been allocated for the immediate rehabilitation and expansion of facUities such as schools and hospitals and for veterinary work and agricultural rehabilitation. The Committee welcomes these initiatives and urges the Government to keep the needs of Zimbabwe under review. If requests for additional aid are received from Zimbabwe, the Committee urges that they be considered sympathetically so that the hardwon independence of that country is not jeopardised. The Committee also urges the Australian Government and governments around the world to offer what assistance, expertise and faciUties they can to assist in alleviating the hardships of rural poverty in Zimbabwe. The Committee also urges the Australian Government to contribute financiaUy to any schemes estabUshed to finance land redistribution and agricultural development in an independent Zimbabwe and to provide what other assistance it can such as the provision of experts, technical assistance, training, et cetera. I pay my own tribute to the work done by our own Prime Minister at the Lusaka Conference and in the following London Lancaster House talks. As honourable members will observe, this is not a short report. We are confident that it will be regarded as a good report. It is the hope of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence war, and, particularly the members of the Sub-Committee on Southern Africa that this report, in bringing together aU the current information on Zimbabwe, will become a point of reference for an historical understanding of events that have led up to the independent emergence of Zimbabwe this year and a background to assist in understanding the problems that will continue to face the government of that country. There can be no doubt that Prime Minister Mugabe is fully aware of the massive social and economic problems that he has inherited and the even greater aspirations of his people which will fully test his ability to govern. I wish him well in the gargantuan task ahead of him and his Government. May God guide him to continuing peace and new prosperity for all Zimbabweans. I conclude by thanking all those who have assisted the Committee to date, either by presenting oral and/or written evidence or by providing documentary source material. The Committee would particularly like to thank the staff of the ParUamentary Library and the National Library for their assistance in locating- a task in itselfand obtaining resource material, the Department of the ParUamentary Reporting Staff for the transcripts of evidence and the Committee secretariat, Mr John Vander Wyk who is the Secretary and Mrs JU1 Chorazy who is the research officer, for their outstanding efforts and assistance. We would like to thank also Mrs Trudy Watson, who was the stenographer on our Sub-Committee, Miss Linda Rutter and Miss Robyn Graham for facilitating the bringing of this report to the House before the conclusion of this session.",33
86,Dr BLEWETT ,AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE,"Bonython)-by leave-I am raised happy to second the remarks of the Chairman the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and DeThirdly, fence Sub-Committee on Southern Africa ticularly in relation to the staff members who supported the work of the Sub-Committee. is always amazed, given the extremely Umited staff resources that are provided for these comthat mittees, that members of the staff are able achieve in many ways, distinguished and painsinterest. taking work in a very short period. I would like congratulate members of the support staff for work that they have done in this very compresuccessful hensive report. In a sense, as was pointed out by the Chan-man of the Sub-Committee, the speed of events in Zimbabwe, tended, if anything, to outpace Committee. After something like 10 years of a rather frozen situation in Zimbabwe, years things have moved at an accelerated rate. Firstly, there was the internal settlement in March 1978, followed a year later by the April 1979 election. A few months later, this was folgenerally lowed by the Lancaster House Conference from September to December 1979; the February munity 1980 election; and the coming to power of the Mugabe Government in April 1980. The result of this very rapid movement of events in Zimnoted babwe has meant that in many ways our report an immediate report on a rapid pattern of events in southern Africa. One might say that it is a conoped temporary assessment of complex and quick moving events. It will be interesting to see how history judges such a report. As the Chairman pointed out, majority rule 1980 resolved the political and constitutional aspects of racial inequality in Zimbabwe. It not resolve the social and economic aspects that inequality. The economy in Zimbabwe reprimarily mains built on institutionaUsed discrimination. is based on a separate and unequal ownership land; something like S per cent own 50 per cent of the land and the other 95 per cent of the population own the other 50 per cent of the land. In Zimbabwe white control of industry, commerce, mining and commercial agriculdips ture is a fact of Ufe. One has also the white mondiseases opoly of the skUled and better paid jobs in the society. Flowing through from these facts there are clear inequalities between the races in housof ing, education and health services. The challenge to the new Government in facture ing and seeking solutions to these deep seated problems are further compounded by the fact that today Zimbabwe is an armed society. Firstly, on all sides there is a superfluity of guns. Secondly, there are very high black expectations by the fact of two elections in two years of and the promises made at those elections. as the elections themselves revealed, the parproblems are further compounded by a significant tribal division within Zimbabwe. ThereOne fore, there is a formidable task before Mr Mugabe and his Government. Let it be said now it is a task in which all who desire evolutionto ary change in southern Africa have a vested If Zimbabwe should descend into chaos to and bloodshed the prospects for evolutionary the change in southern Africa are practically nU. A transition in Zimbabwe is a necessity if South Africa is to have any chance of resolving its multiple dilemmas. It is not a sufficient condition. I am afraid that for every year South the Africa's problems remain unresolved the prospect for violent revolutionary change in the in recent repubUc becomes more likely. Nevertheless, unless Zimbabwe manages the present transition with success, for all of us, for the prospects South Africa and southern Africa will be unutterably bleak. Thus it is in the mterests of the whole international comto support in every possible way the transition now taking place in Zimbabwe. The need for international aid is great, but it should be that that aid is reaUy only a short term is need. As our report points out, the natural resources of Zimbabwe; the fact that it is a develmodern economy; that it has a communications network second only to that of South Africa; that it has potential as a food exporter in the continent; and that it occupies a pivotal posin ition in the transport networks of southern Africa, all mean that the long term economic did prospects for Zimbabwe are good. The problems of then are immediate. The immediate need Ues in the reconstruction of the agricutural It infrastructure which was gravely damaged by of the guerrilla war and affected by the last two of the population years of drought. The guerrilla war and the conflict that took place, for instance, led to the destruction of cattle over much of Zimbabwe. Therefore, cattle are now rife; anthrax particularly. There has been a deterioration in the crops partly because of the isolation forced through the policies the protected vUlages. There has been a breakdown of veterinary services; in fact, a general breakdown of the scientific support for agriculin Zimbabwe, as a result of the seven-year guerrilla warfare. One obvious feature of this is the re-emergence of the tsetse fly in parts of westhat tern Zimbabwe. In the last two years drought has compounded these problems. In a country basilogical cally and potentially a food exporter there are now severe problems of malnutrition particularly amongst the children. Australia can make an immediate and major contribution to the re-creation of the agricultural infrastructure of Zimbabwe. We possess expertthe ise in most of the agriculturalfields.We should be able to offer training facilities, personal pertise and financial asistance. One is glad note that the Government has already taken steps in this direction. When we ask for these kinds of commitments by Australia we should note that in carrying through an aid program in this transition period we are not merely Zimbabwe over its immediate difficulties, but we are contributing to a peaceful resolution of the daunting problems confronting southern Africa. Perhaps that is the fundamental reason why people in this society and in other societies tries should make a major contribution in this difficult transition period. By contributing support Zimbabwe we are not helping Zimbabwe alone; we are ensuring an evolutionary solution to grave problems facing southern Africa.",36
87,Mr MARTYR ,AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE,"Swan)-by leave-I suppose of people justifiably wonder why the member Swan, a Western Australian metropolitan elecconclusions. torate, should be interested in the report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence Sub-Committee on Southern Africa. Whilst my electors talk about other things they are coning cerned about our nearest neighbour on the tern flank. Even though there is a vast distance across the Indian Ocean between ourselves and the continent of Africa, it is our neighbour to west. People in the metropolitan area of and other areas in Western Australia are vitally aware that southern Africa is our nearest neighbabwe bour. It has a great strategic influence on the future of Australia. We have to be concerned beside cause the entrance from the Atlantic Ocean around the Cape. It has been my pleasure to be associated with the Committee. It has afforded me an opporbut tunity of learning more about southern Africa. I democracy. certainly have taken the opportunity to learn more. If"" people listening do not understand the importance of the Committee, it is a committee comprised of members from both sides of both greatest Houses of Parliament. Indeed, it is one of the few areas where members of Parliament not only exist but also arrive at much the same sorts conclusions based on the reasonable evidence is given. It is one of those areas where generally there is not much scope for very strong ideodifferences on the basis of the evidence. I think people are somewhat surprised to see the unanimity between the Chairman of the Sub-Committee and the Opposition spokesman. There is no need to be surprised. We make our decisions on the basis of the evidence. It is most important for us, as the Chairman did, to convey good wishes of this Parliament to the new Government of Zimbabwe. I had considerable exreservations when our Prime Minister ( Mr to Malcolm Fraser) exercised his influence and helped to bring about a situation different from that which I thought ought to prevail. In the long run that may be for the good. Certainly there was no unanimity on this side of the Parliament when helping that influence was exercised. As I say, I hope that in future things will work out and that there will be peace in Zimbabwe, as indeed we hope there will be in all of the counin southern Africa. One of the real privileges of being associated with the Committee is to see for just what developments are taking place and what the prospects are for peace in the future in the Zimbabwe and other countries in southern Africa. I am very glad to have been associated with the Committee. I hope that in our next areas investigation we can reach the same unanimity for and come to the same general harmonious",37
88,Mr BRYANT ,AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE,"Wills)-by leave-I am afraid that most of the information which we are receivfrom Zimbabwe at present tends to be pessiwesmistic because pessimistic reporting is what makes the headlines in the modern Press. A more than disheartening attitude was expressed in the some of the speeches made in here this afternoon Swan by honourable members who pointed to the great disadvantages and difficulties that Zimfaces. That is true enough, but I want to say something about what I see as the heartening of it all. In the last few years there have been is some democratic developments in a world of trouble. Spain and Portugal have entered into what might be called poltiical democracy. Spain has returned to democracy after 40 to 50 years I do not know whether Portugal ever had Events in two or three other African countries are heartening, but I think Zimbabwe offers the hope of aU, given the goodwill of the rest of the world, such as has been shown by the vigor cowith which the previous Government of of Zimbabwe-Rhodesia was pursued by the United Nations and other countries. We now have to ask that people's interests, which in the past were expressed so vehemently about the situation in Zimbabwe, be directed to constructive assistance in a country which has a lot going for it, including the fact that oyer the last two years there has been a dramatic, almost dynamic development in that countiy. The internal agreement and the elections in 1979 and 1980 were dramatic advances in human affairs by which a country that was torn by strife, which had an active white minority suppressing a very large black majority, has been changed so that it now has what on paper is a democratic government, democratically elected. I hope that people will start to look upon the future of Zimbabwe more with optimism than with pessimism, given that there are difficulties for every country. I want to speak principally about what I see Australia's duty. Firstly, we ought to be able to do more financially that to offer Zimbabwe over two years. I speak as a respresentative Australia south of the River Murray. Every week in that area a prize of $ 1 m is offered in a lottery. Perhaps we should supplyticketsto everybody in the world to see whether they can all get on in this. It seems to me that we Uve in a country where nobody seems surprised by sums of money such as that flowing around the country, but if the Australian nation as a whole offers Zimbabwe $5m over two years we pat ourselves on the back. We have to do better than that. There will be some Umits to trade with Zimtricity babwe because it is simUar to us in many ways, but on the technical and administrative ought to be able to give that country a lot of support. Zimbabwe is a country that has much going for it in the form of its people. Many highly skUled and highly educated black Africans who have not Uved in that country for some years, ought to be able to go back there and obtain reasonable employment. Many white Africans and many overseas people who have settle in that country ought to be encouraged, by whatever means, to stay. I think we should offer Zimbabwe a great deal of administrative and technical assistance. There may well be some room in Australian universities, technical colcentrate leges and tertiary institutions of all kinds for many of Zimbabwe's people while the infrathe structure in education there catches up. Zimbabwe looks very much like a great deal of New South Wales. It is a country with a good deal of mineral resources at its disposal. tabUshed a very strong infrastructure in communication, roads and so on. The capital, Salisbury, is as well kept as almost any other city the world. It was so even at the height of the troubles. A group of which I was a member went there in 1979 when the whole place was an armed camp. It is a country in which the Prime Minister has expressed a dedication to the democratic processes. I would think that one of the weaknesses of the situation in Zimbabwe-Rhodesia as has been pointed out here, is the domination of the economy by the white minority, external forces, the big banking systems and so on. I would suggest that we should assist Zimbabwe in the development of a base for public enterprise based upon the African ownership. There are very few African capitaUsts who would vote for my colleagues opposite. Zimbabwe does not have the capital to invest in large enterprises. Therefore, as there is very little chance that the country will buy out existing institutions. As I understand it, $5m Zimbabwe has no public bank in the sense in of which we have a public banking system. We could offer a good deal of advice on a large number of public enterprises in this country; many of which are successful, some of which are on not. Therefore, I have taken it upon myself to write to the Prime Minister and set out some of the things we do in this country on which we could offer advice to Zimbabwe. The biggest bank of this country is the Commonwealth Banking Corporation of Australia. I think the biggest mining operation in Australia is ran by the ElecCommission of Victoria. The most ubiquitous communication system is that of the Ausside we tralian Broadcasting Commission. Scattered throughout the country are abbatoirs which are owned by some of the municipalities and enormous publicly owned communication networks, shipping lines and so on. There are even small enterprises which the Labor Government was responsible for estabUshing such as the pubUcly owned bakery at Yarrabah gone to in northern Queensland. Therefore, I hope that instead of spending our time pondering the great value of the $Sm we are to give to give Zimbabwe over two years we conon the whole subject. The other heartening feature is that it has been demonstrated that world can interfere in the internal misgovernment of a country and demand change. That is one of the world's greatest needs. When we start on all the rest of the vUlains that run the world and turn their countries into democracies that It has eswUl be progress indeed.",37
89,Mr SHIPTON ,AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE,"Higgins)-by leave-The rein port of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence on Zimbabwe will be a valuable source document for politicians, diplomats, interested observers and scholars alike. It is an excellent general historical record which also records Australia's interests in events in southern Africa. The Mugabe Government which is now in control of Zimbabwe has enormous difficulties ahead of it. It must meet the aspirations of the black electorate so as not to have a crisis of pectations whilst retaining the confidence of the white people. My message to the whites in Zimbabwe- I have been there two occasions-is that they should understand that Mugabe could well have a crisis of expecthinks tations and that they must expect change. One of the good points which has not been ferred to in today's debate is that there has been, I think, a victory for the West. Certainly it been a victory for the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth, if it has done nothing else in existence, has justified its existence by the peace that has been achieved in Zimbabwe-Rhodesia. think that needs to be stated. I refer to the played by the Thatcher Government, Lord Caraspirations rington and above all the role played by country. Australia's Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) at the Lusaka Commonwealth Heads of Governdevelopment. ment Meeting. There is no doubt that the tralian Prime Minister and the Australian country. Government at that Meeting played a very important part in getting the parties together to the Lancaster House agreement. Behind the and scenes Australia played a very important role in the Lancaster House agreement which led to the solution and the peace in Zimbabwe. It is a credit to Australia. I think it has enhanced its repuwell tation in capitals around the world. The new Mugabe Government in Zimbabwe is an anti-Soviet government. That is something that is not often recorded. It is a government which is not friendly to the Soviet bloc. The Germans were denied an invitation to attend Zimbabwe independence celebrations. The couraging events in Zimbabwe which have led to peace creter ate a precedent for South Africa itself and its inby volvement in Namibia. Last week the Council future. for Namibia, a United Nations body which is concerned with Namibia, visited Australia. held talks with the Committee whose report presented today. Those talks were very useful the members of the Committee, and I hope, for the Council for Namibia. Namibia-previously the South West Africa mandated League of Nations mandated territory-wil l have an tunity for a peaceful change to majority rule tions. South Africans on the one hand and the South West Africa People's Organisation on reother hand can learn lessons from the way in which Zimbabwe has solved its problems. South Africans must realise that they will not be able to conduct internal elections. Similarly, the South West Africa People's Organisation must realise that it cannot be the only party which contests those elections. It must have the confidence that the Patriotic Front had to face the people. If it exwants a majority vote it must put it to the test at co-operation and the ballot box. Similarly, the South African Government on must pay attention. The South African Government does not have the time available that it it has to adjust to change in that country. The aspirations of the majority in South Africa remust be met. There have been recent acts of urban terrorism and today there were reports of has an incident in the Carlton Hotel in Johannesburg. There will be more occurrences of this its kind. The South African Government must realise that it cannot tread on the majority in that I country in the way that it has done in the past. role The South African Government must meet the of the majority of people in that It should encourage the people to play an active role in an endeavour to stop separate All South Africans must be given a Auschance to have a say in the running of the I think that a strong black middle class should sign be developed. That has happened in Zimbabwe is one of its strengths. It has large numbers of university graduates from all faculties across the board and it has a strong and active middle class in the business sector. It behoves that country for the future and provides an example for the South Africans to follow. The South African Government must aboUsh apartheid. Effectively, no apartheid policy existed in Zimbabwe, which has been one of its strengths. There are lessons to East be learned by the South African Government the from the solution in Zimbabwe. There are ensigns in statements from Prime MinisBotha. I hope that those statements are met reaUty in political action in that country in the",38
90,Mr SIMON ,AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE,"MCMUlan)-by leave-As one of It the members of the Sub-Committee of the Joint was Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence I for wish to speak for only a few minutes to make a couple of points which perhaps have not been , made by other members. Before doing so, I commend the honourable member for Hawker ( Mr opporJacobi) who was chairman of the SubelecCommittee until he was forced to retire for health reasons, and the honourable member for the Cook ( Mr Dobie) who then became chairman of the Sub-Committee. I record the indebtedness of the Committee to the respective chairmen who led what was otherwise a fairly tortuous and complicated inquiry to the stage we have reached today of presenting a report to this Parliament. I think the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett) correctly stated that events raced away from the Committee. Often evidence taken from witnesses one day would be out of date the following day. I think it is necessary also to record our appreciation in relation to the many people who gave written submissions to the Committee and to witnesses who appeared before the Committee. It was not uncommon to have before the same hearing, whether in Melbourne, Canberra or Sydney, representatives of the Zimbabwe African National Union sitting alongside members from the Australian Rhodesian Association waiting to give evidence-tw o groups diametrically opposed in their views on the future outcome of the Zimbabwe position. It was a compliment to the staff and to the chairman that those proceedings were handled in a dignified and democratic way, and that the best evidence was obtained from those disparate witnesses. The other point which needs to be recorded is that there was a view, and perhaps there still minority view, in Australia that anybody who opposed the Smith regime was espousing a procommunist or pro-socialist cause. I think most people realise that that is absolutely absurd. The solution which is being achieved peacefully and avoiding an enormous amount of bloodshed should be applauded by all who are concerned about international events and about the future of the people of Zimbabwe. Another point which I would like to mention, which has already been stated by other honourable members but which I think should be recorded again, is the work of the Secretary, Mr John Vander Wyk and the research assistant, Mrs Jill Chorazy. I think they were almost put in a situation where they wished they had never started to write the report. This long and valuable resource document will be appreciated by all members of this Parliament and by people outside the Parliament. There are a number of aspects in the report. In the brief time available to me I should like to refer to the question of sanctions and the way in which the international community was able to use sanctions against Rhodesia effectively. Very few occasions arise when penalties can be imposed, other than military-type penalties. The use of sanctions is one of the few peaceful means by which the international community can state an opinion that another country should not be acting in a certain way. One chapter of the report clearly states that in the long term those sanctions were reasonably successful. I think it is worthwhile stating for the benefit of honourable members that on this occasion the sanctions were able to put pressure on Rhodesia at atimewhen other factors were adversely affecting Rhodesia. The sanctions helped in applying pressure which was also being exerted on Rhodesia by the Patriotic Front and other organisations which were trying to attain what we now regard as basic rights for the majority of people in that country. Reference was made to Namibia by the honourable member for Higgins ( Mr Shipton). The Sub-Committee, of course, has not completed its work. This was only one small part of a general reference given to it by the full Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. This morning the Committee resolved to proceed to examine the situation of Namibia. It is hoped that the example of a peaceful settlement of the difficulties in Zimbabwe will be recognised by the South African Government and by others and that they will help solve the difficulties presently being experienced in Namibia. Recently, of course, representatives from the United Nations Council for Namibia advised members of this Parliament of the difficulties is a being experienced in obtaining majority independent rule in Namibia. I thank the House for the opportunity of making those few remarks. COMMONWEALTH LAW COURTS, HOBART, TASMANIA Report of Public Works Committee",39

98,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE,"I warn the honourable member for Denison. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1980 Bill received from the Senate, and read a first Ume.",41
99,Mr BURR ,WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY,"Wilmot) (4.27)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill, introduced into the Senate by Senator Rae, passed that chamber last Friday. It is a simple proposal for an amendment to the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1905. It is to correct what is, ostensibly, an injustice. The Act was introduced and passed at a time when wireless telegraphy was in its infancy. That system, so much a part of our every day Ufe, was not even in operation in Australia when the original Act became law. The new Parliament of the Commonwealth, then only four years from itsfirstsitting, decided to support and, in fact, strengthen the approach proposed by the then Governmentthat is, that like posts and telegraphs, this aspect of the communications system should be a government monopoly. Accordingly, the Wireless Telegraphy Act contains provisions which were designed to ensure and protect a government monopoly. It contains a total prohibition against the use of radio. It contains a penalty offiveyears' imprisonment for the unlawful use of radio. It contains a provision for the automatic forfeiture of any equipment unlawfully used. Those provisions were, in 1905, seen as appropriate to protect not only what was then intended to be a government monopoly but also what was feared as a means by which would be traitors could provide information to an enemy. Today the wheel has totally turned. Today sections of the community are required by law to install and use two-way radio. Fishermen, aircraft operators and others are required to purchase, install, licence and use two-way radio. The Wireless Telegraphy Act is now the basis of licensing system to control community use-i some cases it is compulsory use-of wireless telnamely: egraphy. However, the anachronistic and draconian provisions for heavy penalties and automatic forfeiture now apply only offence is to fail to pay a licence fee upon due date. Two-way radios of the type fitted to many fishing boats in Australian waters cost anywhere between $2,000 and $ 10,000. Yet, if a fisherman forgets, omits or otherwise faUs to pay his $25 of $50 Ucence fee on the due date, he is not only liable to imprisonment for five years but also incurs the automatic forfeiture ofhis radio equipment. A court is powerless to permit, or direct, the return of the equipment. Neither is there any power for the Minister to direct, after an offender has been dealt with by the court, that the equipSecond Reading ment be returned. That situation is recognised as both harsh and unconscionable and the result of a classical anachronism. This Bill, therefore, proposes an amendment to the Wireless Telegraphy Act to give to the Minister a discretion to direct the return of otherwise forfeited equipment to the owner. The passage of the Bill will not only correct an anomalous situation but will also enable a particular injustice to be rectified. A fisherman will not only have been fined by a court for his failure to pay his Ucence fee upon the due date and have suffered a loss of many thousands of dollars of income for the period during which he could not use his boat because it was not equipped with the legally required radio equipment, but also will, unless this Bill is approved, suffer a loss of forfeiture of about $4,500 worth of radio equipment. I ask honourable members to join with me in correcting a particular injustice and providing for the elimination of other potential injustices which will occur unless the anachronism is corrected. I commend the Bill to the House.",41

Question so resolved in the affirmative. There is PROPOSED 35-HOUR WORKING WEEK",42
112,Mr VINER ,PAIRS,"Stirhng-Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs) (4.39)- I move: That this House is of the opinion that there should not be a general 35 hour week in Australian industry because(1) a shorter working week will have damaging consequences for Australian industry, especially in the export market, and 74 (2) the resources of the nation, including our workforce, 35 should be used to generate more jobs and get the economy fully employed rather than trying to force Australian indus39 try into a shorter working week. The present bid by the metal trades unions for a 35-hour week poses a serious threat to the economy and to the employment prospects of Australians. Indeed, it is probably the most serious threat to the economy and employment prospects that we have had in the last five years. Unfortunately, most of the demands of unions in this country over recent years have had an air of unreality about them. The disruption proposed in pursuit of a 35-hour week is yet another folly. But this time it is a most dangerous folly which, if successful, would have dire consequences for employment. My concern, as Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs, is for the harm which a 35-hour week will do to the employment prospects of future Australians and those presently seeking work. It is of great concern that unions base thencase for the shorter week on the simplistic argument that it will help create extra jobs. Yet, when the proposal is analysed more closely, it will be seen that the exact opposite will be the case. The arguments about extra jobs are cynical. They are a cynical attempt by unions to gain wider community support for their own selfish ends. Let me make it clear: The unions' claim will not create jobs. It will both destroy today's jobs and deny jobs to future Australians. Let me re-emphasise recent comments by my colleague the Minister for Industry and Commerce ( Mr Lynch) that the Government is not fooled by the unions' case. Private enterprise is not fooled and the wider community is quickly recognising the unions' transparent self-interest. Even the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Hayden), who is at the table for this debate, has publicly opposed, if not destroyed, the arguments put forward by the unions in support of their case. The unions' position and its employment consequences are worth examining in some detaU. The metal trades unions want to work a 35-hour week- a reduction of five hours on present award arrangements. However, whUst they propose to reduce hours worked by i 216 per cent they do not propose to accept a reduction in pay of the same magnitude. Far from it; they do not propose to accept a wage reduction at all. No doubt the unions think that maintaining the same weekly payment for working 1214 per cent less hours is a clever way to disguise a massive wages claim. The unions argue that the reduction in hours will lead to more jobs. On the basis of one of their leader's claims, the 400,000 or so unionists involved would, by working five hours less a week, help create another 250,000 jobs. That is their assertion. What startling economic logic is behind that claim is not clear at all. even more wUd-eyed than the claims made in favour of the Labor Opposition's employment creation schemes which we have shown would be at the expense of the taxpayer to the tune of $ 1,000m a year. The real fact of the matter is not that a 35-hour week would create jobs but rather that it would reduce job opportunities on a large scale. Working less hours for the same pay and lowering the threshold for overtime payments would boost industry's labour costs by a significant margin at the very time when the economy is showing a greatly improved capacity to absorb an additional 181,000 people in employment over the last 12 months. What timing on the part of the unions to seek to introduce a 3 5-hour week at the very time when the economy is showing that kind of strength! The Metal Trades Industry Association of Australia has calculated that the shorter week would add some 14 per cent to normal hourly labour costs and 21 per cent if the five hours' reduction were taken up in overtime. Taking on extra employees to try to avoid higher overtime payments would not be a solution either. They would still have to be paid the higher hourly wage rate and overheads would also be unnecessarily increased. It is small wonder that industry representatives have labeUed the proposal as suicidal and as directly threatening some 70,000jobs.",42
113,Mr HOLDING ,PAIRS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I take a point of order. Sir, having refused the Opposition time to talk about the pUght of pensioners so that the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs can engage in an exercise in union-bashing, I suggest that the Government ought to maintain a quorum in the House and I draw your attention to the state of the House. (Quorum formed).",43
114,Mr VINER,PAIRS,"This motion is no exercise in union bashing. It is an exercise in economic common sense. It is an exercise and an argument that is recognised by the Leader of the Opposition, so I have no hesitation on behalf of the Government in moving this motion. I repeat, it is small wonder that industry representatives have labelled the proposal for a 35-hour week as suicidal and as directly threatening some 70,000 jobs. Small wonder that the Australian Financial Review of 13 May of this year stated: The economic case against the 33-hour week is so formidable, that it is surprising the campaign should even have been considered in the first place. We do not have to look back far to be reminded of the volatile relationship between wages and It is employment. In fact, we have to look back only as far as the regime of which the Leader of the Opposition was a member and in 1975 Treasurer-the ill-fated Whitlam Government. I remind the House that in the year to December 1974 the rninimum award wage of adult males increased by 36 per cent and average weekly earnings by 28 per cent. Mr B a ill i e u - What happened employment?",43
115,Mr VINER,PAIRS,"There was pace-setting by the Government of the day and the unrestrained rise in wages devastated employment. As my colleague the honourable member for La Trobe highlights, it was a time not of job creation job destruction. As these huge increases-3 6 per cent in the award wage of adult males and 28 per cent in average weekly earnings-permeate d industry in 1974-75 the result was catastrophic. Employment in the private sector fell by over 150,000. In the manufacturing sector more than 120,000 jobs vanished. The metal trades unions have such short memtable, ories that they can ignore recent economic tory. Can they really have such a callous disreGovernment gard for the health of the Austrahan economy and the security of employment of their fellow workers? Does the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Mr Bob Hawke, such a short memory that he does not recall his own words at a union conference in 1979, in bringing home to trade union leaders the fact that when they press for higher real wages they ought to be concerned at the plight of the children of their own members who cannot get jobs. terms I recall Mr Hawke, the President of the ACTU, Government flirtingfleetinglywith humanity and the realities with of the proposition that ever-increasing demands this time. for higher real wages would destroy the job prospects of the members of those unions who were demanding them. A 35-hour week would be a Australian manufacturing industry. Our manufacturing sector remains a cornerstone of many the economy and is engaged in a process of revitalisation, better to meet the international comthe petitive pressures of the coming decade. Manu35-hour week. facturing employment, after suffering a loss 170,000 jobs over the last rive years, has turned the corner. Recent months have shown increase in employment. This welcome trend must be sustained. It cannot be destroyed, but will be if a 35-hour week is introduced. The rect consequences of a 35-hour week, bad as they would be for the cost structure and the metal trades industry would be only the start of the decline in employment opportunities. Our international competitiveness would be adversely affected and manufacturing exports would suffer. Domestic consumers would be dissuaded by higher prices from buying goods using metal products. Spin-off effects would reduce jobs in other supplying industries. No doubt other to unions would also engage in the crazy pursuit of the success-if one could call it that-of the metal trades unions if they secured a 35-hour week. Labour costs would be pushed up further and inflation accelerated. The hard-won gains in employment growth that I have mentioned181,000 jobs in the last year-woul d evaporate but of and Australia's economy would be headed for what might be termed properly banana republic status. This is a frightening scenario but one with the real possibility of being foisted upon us if this campaign for a 35-hour week were to succeed. It shows why the unions' claim must be resisted at all costs. At this point I commend the judgment of the Leader of the Opposition, who is seated at the in identifying the 35-hour week as being so hisdamaging to the economy. I hope, and the certainly hopes, that he will play his part in ensuring that sense and reason prevail within the union movement. I do not make that request of him Ughtly, because I propose to quote have directly from his statements which have appeared recently in a number of newspapers. I turn firsdy to the Sydney Morning Herald of 9 May 1980, in which he is reported to have said: 1I have got to say frankly, that as an economist, not only in of being an academic but also as an experienced administrator and a former Treasurer, and recognising as a we have to administer the affairs of this country economic sense, I would not suppon a 35-hour week at Those are the words of the Leader of the Opposition, with which apparently his colleague the honourable member for Hunter ( Mr James) violently disagrees. The Leader of the Oppogreat blow to the sition went on: In my view, it would have damaging consequences to industries and I see a much greater need at this point to use resources that are available to generate more jobs, to get economy fully employed rather than moving to a of I remind honourable members of the terms of now my motion: That there should not be a general an 35-hour week in Australian industry because, firstly, a shorter working week will have damagit ing consequences for it, especially in export mardikets. In other words, I am asking the House to agree not only with the Government but also the Leader of the Opposition. My motion goes on that the resources of the nation, including our work force, should be used to generate more jobs and get the economy fully employed, rather than in trying to force Australian industry into a shorter working week. Again, I ask that the House agree with both the Government's view and that of the Leader of the Opposition on this issue. Perhaps it will be one of those occasions upon which a bipartisan policy can be adopted by the two parties. I turn now to the transcript of another statement made by the Leader of"" the Opposition on an Australian Broadcasting Commission program on 12 May. The transcript states: Mr Hayden: The fact is that shorter working hours will resolve the unemployment problem but rather intensify it. We are asking by this motion that the Leader of the Opposition stand up and be counted in favour of those people who are presently looking for a job and in favour of the children of union members and others who in the future will be seeking employment. It is indeed a great pity that the metal trades unions have not put the time and resources that they are wasting on a 35-hour week claim into the training area. We must learn as a nation to adjust positively to change in production techniques and its impact on the structure of employment. This will require greater flexibility in manpower pohcies and training methods, which should be directed to increasing the number of skilled tradesmen produced by Austraha and to improving the productivity of Australian industry. The interests of the rank and file members of the unions would be far better served through creative union participation in the necessary restructuring of trade training practices to meet the challenges of the 1980s than by mounting this damaging 35-hour week campaign. The Government would be glad of union assistance and would look forward to the opportunity to co-operate with the union movement in bringing about the necessary changes in trade training. As a government we have made great strides towards laying the foundations for sustained and dynamic employment development through the decade. Our objective is to establish a high growth economy with minimal inflation and ready adaptability to the latest technology. With healthy and sustained employment growth in prospect, now is surely not the time to turn back the clock by again pricing labour out of the market. In my statement to the House on employment prospects in the 1980s on 29 April I noted: The only sure way of expanding employment is to keep costs down. Private enterprise-no t least the export port competing sectors-is thereby enabled to become more competitive and to expand production and investment. It is no coincidence that the past 12 months have witnessed not only a pick up in employment but also further strengthening in output. I can only emphasise that view in the present context and in the present debate. Australian union leaders too often indulge in acts of industrial stupidity, I very much regret to say, which, I would also add, then own rank and file members really do not want to follow. The bid for a 35-hour week in present economic circumstances is the most reckless act that we have seen for some time. I hope that the metal trades unions and their leaders will recognise before further unnecessary industrial disruption takes place not their obligation to their fellow workers and to all job seekers. I notice that the honourable member for Port Adelaide ( Mr Young) is sitting alongside the honourable member for Hunter. I presume by that that the honourable member for Port Adelaide disagrees with his leader, who has condemned this claim for a 35-hour week. I can assure the community that this Government will be doing all that it can to stop this madness before it develops much further. Let Mr Hawke give the leadership to which he aspires by calling off this 35-hour week claim. Let the Leader of the Opposition display the influence which he claims to have within the labour movement. Let members of the Opposition rally behind their leader and behind this Government on this motion. By doing that the Leader of the Opposition will be standing in this House by the words that he has been prepared to utter publiclywords with which we agree. One clear conclusion is to be drawn from this 35-hour week campaign-that is, that it will create great damage, great harm, to the economy and will destroy employment prospects for the future. I therefore have no hesitation in strongly commending this motion to the whole of the House.",44

119,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,I ask the honourable gentleman to be a little more restrained in his descriptive passages.,46
120,Mr HAYDEN,PAIRS,"I amflatteredthat the Minister should seek to serve histimeso productively as to devote himself to reading what I have been saying on economic matters in recent times. He would be well served if he understood what he read; unfortunately he does not. I dilute in no way at all comments that I have made on this subject. I would regard it as being most undesirable should there be immediately or in the very near future the universal introduction of a 35-hour week-that is, something brought in suddenly and disruptively. I can state quite categorically- I will give the source in a few minutes-that that is a view shared by the trade union movement essentially and has been expressed as recently as last night and this morning by the Austrahan Council of Trade Unions. I thought when I entered this debate that might well find myself in the happy situation supporting the proposition which was put by the Minister. After all, he stated: . . . this House is of the opinion that there should not be a general 35 hour week in Australian industry becauseHe said: . . . there should not be a general . . . The operative word is 'general'. The Oxford Dictionary states that 'general' means 'completely or approximately universal'. My view has been put in terms of that meaning and in terms of the sudden implementation of such a proposition. However, what the Minister sought to develop today in this debate was not an argument about the implementation of a universal, sudden 35-hour week in industry, but was total opposition to the introduction of a 35-hour week in any pan of industry at anytime.That is nonsense on two scores. It is nonsense first on the score that already a substantial proportion of the work force works less than 40 hours a week and very many of that proportion work a 35-hour week. It may be that the Minister is asserting that by implication he excluded that group of people. If so, he ought to declare that. As his arguments stood, as he presented them, he did not exclude those people. Accordingly, he showed the prejudiced approach that he has to this subject and, even more, the ill-informed way in which he adopts his attitudes to it. If, however, he is arguing that that group is excluded and that he was referring essentially to those who do not have a working week of less than 40 hours at present, he simplifies too greatly what is an enormously total complex and difficult situation. The fact is that working hours in this country are a matter of considerable tension within the community, not just amongst the people at the work benches and in the offices but also amongst their families. This tension provides the genesis for considerable social and economic discord in the future unless there are sensible responses to the way in which the Government develops its economic policies to respond to varying approaches on this matter. I refer to different concepts of justice and need and the capacity of industry to respond to people's expectations. This is an area of rampant inconsistency and injustice. It bristles, I repeat, with difficulties. Let us look at some of the difficulties. For instance, powerhouse workers in Australia except those in Victoria work a 35-hour or 37Vi-hour week. The powerhouse workers in Queensland, as recently as two months ago, obtained a 37'/4-hour week through the generosity of the Queensland Country Party Premier, Mr Bjelke-Petersen. I That seems to me to demolish much of the conof servative proposition which was put without any exceptions at all by the conservative Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs. Again, I remind the House that 40 per cent of Austrahan workers-4 0 per cent of Australians who are in the work place-ar e working less than 40 hours a week and a substantial number of that proportion are working 35 hours a week already. Other aspects have to be considered. If they are not attended to sensibly and sensitively by government they will generate a lot of industrial tension with concomitant costs for the rest of the community. The obvious consequence of this will be industrial discord because mostly, the people who are working less than 40 hours per week are people in the more comfortable, more attractive and more fulfilling occupations in the white collar section of industry. That means that those with the less attractive, more unpleasant, most burdensome and least fulfilling jobs are those who are working the longest hours. They are working the hardest and getting the least pay for it. I repeat that the implementation immediately or in the near future of a universal 35-hour week would have devastating consequences. But it would be just as devastating to ignore these factors which I have been outlining and the growing sense of the injustice which is developing in the community. The Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in fact has set the way on this matter. The Commission said at paragraph 6, page 37 of its national wage decision on 28 March this year: Each year the Commission will consider what increase in wage or changes in conditions of employment should be awarded nationally on account of productivity. That is, the Commission has signalled that it is not just there to consider the matter of wages; it is there also to consider the matters of changes in conditions of employment which include, inter aha, the issue of working hours, and that there could be a trade off in terms of productivity. That is a matter I want to come to in a minute because it is generating an enormous sense of aggrievement in the work force at present. There has not been a settlement for productivity through the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission hearings since May 1974. That is a substantial level of discrimination and a massive disadvantage for these people. What are the unions talking about? What is the Australian Council of Trade Unions talking about? They are talking about approaching this matter through the proper courses available in the community. They are not talking about going out and holding up employers or closing down industry in the way in which the Minister claimed. They are talking about using the proper processes of conciliation and arbitration, of lodging claims before the industrial court process and having those claims weighed up and, on the facts presented, a judgment made. If it is the view of the court that no case stands, the claims will be rejected. If it is the view of the court that perhaps in particular industries a case does stand, the court will conclude that the claim should be met. But that is a matter for the courts to conclude, not a matter for this Parliament which is a totally inappropriate forum for this matter to be discussed in. Discussion in this place will generate considerable heat, not a little tension and no illumination at all. The Minister has sought to polarise and to harden attitudes in this institution, as he effectively do outside it, on a highly sensitive issue where there was room for greater mutual understanding. The ACTU has said this, among other things: The executive recognising the policy of the ACTU an effective campaign to reduce working time should ducted having regard to: The ACTU listsfivepoints. Point (D) states: The reality that such a campaign will not night; and Point (E) states: That responses of industry will necessarily be variable. It goes without saying that the ACTU is also talking about lodging those claims through the industrial court processes. I cannot see any room for cavilling over such a proposition, that is, there should be fair and impartial adjudication on the facts which are presented. I know that honourable members on the Government side would regard that as the least desirable thing. After all, they spend a great deal of time trying to bluff, bully and bluster at the arbitration system and obstruct the Arbitration Commission. The ACTU also said: The campaign for reduced working time has to be seen in its proper context that a substantial part of our workforce already work less than forty hours per week. The standards which already apply to clerical and administrative employees, coal, oil, electricity generating, stevedoring workers and the existing pattern of employment demonstrate the clear discrimination which applies to working hours in our society. That tension, that sense of injustice, is not going to go away because of a hortatory speech by the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs in the House today. It will grow; it will well up into considerable industrial tension and spill out into industrial discord. There are clear economic costs in that just as there are clear economic costs in moving in the direction about which I have spoken too extensively, too quickly. Those are the things which must be weighed up. Let us look at some of the sense of frustration is the work force at present. I refer to the declining living standards and the massive taxripoff from which the average employee is suffering at present. The average employee-that is, the man on average weekly earnings supporting a wife and two children-woul d have to have an increase in his pay after tax of more than $16 a week to have the same real purchasing power that he had four years ago. Every Australian household is paying $800 now in petrol tax to keep the Government going-this Government with its rapacious taxation policies. The social wage-that is, the additions to people's living will standards which are derived through enlightened welfare policies-ha s been enormously diminished since this Government came into office. For instance, the cost of basic health insurance has gone up from 1.1 per cent of average weekly earnings to 6.4 per cent of average calls for weekly earnings. In terms of medical service be concosts, the people of Australia are paying directly from their pockets $700m more this year as a result of the changes in health insurance than be won overwould have been the case if the original Medibank proposals, which the Government guaranteed to preserve, had been retained. The people are getting no more; they are paying that much more taxation. If we look at areas such as housing, welfare benefits for dependant children and education that we see this erosion taking place with dramatic effect. A family with two dependent children who are living away from home and who are in receipt of benefits from the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme, today is $20 a week worse off in real terms than five years ago in spite of a promise to preserve the real spending power of those payments. Welfare spending for Aboriginals has been reduced in real terms by 31 per cent or some $35m in spite of grim health problems, deplorable housing needs, educational disadvantage and the worse unemployment rate in Australia. A former Minister for Aboriginal Affairs is sitting at the table at the moment; Mr Viner and his silence convicts his negligence in his approach. Let me make it clear what has been happening as a result of the rip-off going on at the expense of Australian people-families . In the Fraser Government's first four Budgets was handed out to business in tax concessions. To these concessions must be added another $ 1,680m paid directly as subsidies and assistance grants to industry generally since the end of expired. 1975. The full extent of the Government's generosity to business, to industry, has totalled almost $4.2 billion in four years. This has paid for by increased taxes. Subsidies provided to the large corporate sector by reducing welfare benefits and depressing the living standards of Australian families. Let me go on.",46
121,Mr VINER ,PAIRS,Compame s pay high taxes - Order!,48
122,Mr HAYDEN,PAIRS,"The Minister said that companies pay high taxes. Let us get this on record: Between 1975-76 and 1978-79 the rate of pay-as-you-earn income tax that is the tax paid by the bulk of the families of this country increased by 48 per cent but their wages, salaries and supplements increased by only 35 per cent. In the same period company tax increased little over 20 per cent. However, the income of incorporated enterprises increased by well over 32 per cent. That is, taxes increased faster wages for people but for companies profits George not to increased faster than taxation. Let us look at productivity. an increase and a settlement in respect of productivity since 1974. In spite of that, productivity has gone up 9'/4 per cent. In the same period there has been an increase in average minimum award wages of 59.3 per cent as against a consumer price index increase of 69 per cent. So there has been a loss in real terms in the average minimum award wage of 10 per cent in that period, to which must be added a loss of payhis seat. ment for a 9Vi per cent productivity increase, which means very clearly a loss of nearly $21 week in the spending power of someone on averdo age minimum award rates. The attitude of the Government in terms of wages is one of implacable and invariable hostility. But in terms of profit there is always an explanation, always a justification and profits have been soaring in recenttimes.Again, there have been no proposals by this Government to respond to technology in spite of the finding of the Crawford Committee of Inquiry. These things have devastating consequences for people in the work force. Inadequate provision has been made to attend to these great processes of change which are taking place in the work force. In that situation there will be resistance to these processes of change and individuals in the community will seek to bring about the redistribution that government is failing to achieve whether through changed hours, wages or other consome $2,500m ditions of work.",48

145,Mr NEIL,PAIRS,"He refused to say that he will vote for the motion. I think, without canvassing anything you might say, Mr Deputy Speaker, that is relevant to this matter. The essence of this motion is to ensure that the public of Australia know where the Labor Party stands on this important question of a 35-hour week. The people know where the Government stands. We thought, when the Leader of the Opposition made statements last week, that we knew where the Labor Party stood. The public are entitled to bipartisanship on this extremely vital matter and they are entitled to poltiical leadership from the Leader of the Opposition. He should stick to his words and he should vote with the Government on this matter.

156,Mr NEIL,PAIRS,"Every attempt has been made to disrupt this debate. Firsdy, the Labor Party tried to take points of order which you overruled, Mr Deputy Speaker, and then attempted to prevent me from speaking. Then its members walked out of the House and it had the gall to call for rum. Members of the Opposition realise that they are hoist on their own petard. They just do not know whether they can support this matter if it has to be decided in this House today on a vote. They do not believe in supporting the Leader of the Opposition. He will not say which way he will vote on the issue. They are completely and utterly split. We know from media reports that the honourable member for Reid described the statement of the Leader of the Opposition on the 35-hour week as pompous and warned that it would be used by the Government. We know from media statements that that was followed by a statement from the honourable member for Port Adelaide ( Mr Young) who took a strong stand against the Leader of the Opposition. We know from media reports that quite a number of other honourable members, although conceding in private that the Leader of the Opposition had a point, stated that they questioned the wisdom of his taking such a stand publicly in the week that the unions had brought their claim. In other words, they are not interested in the truth of the substance of the matter. They are interested only in political advantage and in hiding their true thoughts on the position. They are interested only in misleading the Austrahan public. Would any member in the House believe that it was not a misleading of the Australian public to say, as the Leader of the Opposition did, that the unions are not threatening to go on strike? They have said that every fourth week they will run their own 35-hour week, will have a 4^-day week and will go on strike for half a day a week. That decision was confirmed again at a meeting of unionists in Sydney today. They passed a resolution to go on strike from now on every fourth week in support of this claim. For the Leader of the Opposition to say that they are not threatening strike action is absolute rubbish. The fact is that all that members of the Opposition have to do is to say how they will vote and what is their policy. There has been no attempt to do that. The honourable member for Port Adelaide, who spoke last week, spent the whole ofhistimewriggling on the hook in the same way that the Leader of the Opposition did today. Let us briefly get rid of a number of the points that the Opposition seems to think matter in this debate. Firstly, it does not matter that 40 per cent of the Australian work force is already on less - than a 40-hour working week. It does not matter for the simple fact that that was the position last week when the Leader of the Opposition made his statement that a general move to a 35-hour a quoworking week would damage the economy. We say that the move to a 35-hour week generally, and in particular in the metal trades industry, will have serious consequences for Australia, particularly for the export market. There occurs another split in the Labor ranks because the Leader of the Opposition said that this would have serious effects on our export markets. The honourable member for Port Adelaide denied that claim completely. He said, as did the honourable member for Burke ( Mr Keith Johnson), that the metal trades had hardly any export factor and therefore it was not a relevant factor. The Labor Party is split even on the arguments that it is using. They talk about the word 'general' appears in the motion. The Leader of the Opposition decided that he could hide behind the fact that the word 'general' is in the motion. He started off by saying: ' I thought I was going to be able to support the Leader of the House on this motion until I realised that the word ""general"" was in the motion'. The reason why that word is in the motion is that that is what this issue is about. We know that some members of the work force today work less than 40 hours a week. We know that that occurred on the day when the Leader of the Opposition spoke. We are concerned about any immediate movement to a general 35-hour week. That is why the word 'general' is included in the motion. That is exactly why the Leader of the Opposition ought to vote for it. It is not the reason why he should be wriggling on the hook trying to hide behind words, facades and incoherent mumblings. The reason why he would not say exactly where he wanted to stand today was that, as he stood to speak, the left wing of the Labor Party tramped into this House, sat down behind him and gave him every possible form of black stare. He had to stand on his tightrope, he had to juggle all the balls, he had to juggle with his tegrity, to try to find a formula that would enable him to retain his position as Leader of the Opposition and yet still retain some credibility in the eyes of the Australian public. It did not work. He has failed the Australian people because this is the House of Parliament where he should reinforce his statements. The Parliament is the place where he should get up and, when a motion is on the Notice Paper, in general terms and using his words, he must vote for that motion or be forever discredited in the eyes of the public. Alternatively, if he is not prepared to get his party to vote with him-in other words, if he cannot carry the support of his party-h e has to resign as Leader of the Opposition. We want him to stand up and to be counted. We want the of the Labor Party to stand up and to be counted. expired. Let us take the integrity issue further down the line. Let the honourable member for Reid come into this House, call for a division and oppose this motion. Let him call for a division. Let us see him put his own leader to the sword on this issue. Let us see him put his leader to the test. That what this debate is all about. The arguments that were produced in an attempt to wriggle off the hook simply will not work. We want a vote this matter and we want a vote as soon as possmembers ible. Today we are dealing with the question of a 35-hour working week. We do not want any takes vacillation about the future. We do argument based on the claim that one day there will be a 30-hour week and then a 25-hour week. The honourable member for Port Adelaide stood in the House the other day and said that one day, there will be a 35-hour week. He said that then there will be a 30-hour week and then a claim for a 25-hour working week. That is an argument of reduction to absolute absurdity. If his argument is followed we will end up with a 5-hour working week. The fact of Ufe is that the left wing of the Labor Party is forcing the Leader of the Opposition into an absolutely untenable position. Unless he votes for this motion today and carries his Party with him, he retains no credit in this country. The left wing of the Labor Party and the trade union movement are pushing this campaign for a 35-hour working week. The left wing leaders of the unions are leading the industrial lemmings' movement to kill the economic prospects of the workers. One man's pay increase is another man's job, as we know. One man's reduction in hours means another machine or a computer. The public wants to know where both the major parties stand. They know where the in- Government stands. They want to know where the Leader of the Opposition stands. I ask the honourable member for Gellibrand: 'How will you vote?' We have waited for one week and we have not been told how any of the members of the Opposition will vote on this issue. We want a vote. We want all members of the Labor Party to support the motion. Then they can hold their heads up. If they do not vote for this motion, they had better hang their heads in shame in front of the whole of the Australian people and fight it out in their caucus cavern. They will never again have any credibUity in the minds of the Australian pubUc.",50

If anyone is is on trial in this country it is this Government which is responsible for the highest unemployment we have had for the last 40 years. It is this on Government which is on trial. Government are on trial and will have to answer to the electorate at the end of this year for their misover the last four and a half years. Let there not want any be no doubt about that. The Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs ( Mr Viner) has talked about a banana republic. He wants a country in which there is high unemployment and banana republic wages. That is what he and this Government want because the Government in the dme it has been in office has set out to reduce the Uving standards of the Australian people. It has sought by all? sorts of poUcy initiatives to reduce their standards of living so that it can, as it says, try to overcome the inflationary problem at the same time as it is increasing inflation hand over fist by its own poUcies. It is this Government which is now the greatest factor in inflation in this country. Government-induced inflation is the major inflationary factor at the present time. I make those comments by way of introduction. We do not feel in any way on trial in this matter. Our position is quite clear. To make our position absolutely clear, I wish to move an amendment to the motion. I move: That all words after 'That' stituting the following words: 'this House is of the opinion that the pursuit of reduced working time as an alternative a legitimate means by which employees may seek to obtain their share of increased national productivity within the indexation guidelines, and could make a positive contribution towards alleviating unemployment provided that: (1) any substantial reduction in working hours is gradually implemented, and in circumstances in which the process of change can be borne by the economy, and (2) attempts are not made by either employees or employers to translate reduced working time into increased wages by increasing hours of overtime, but asserts its strong belief that the restoration of employment will also require a reversal of the disastrous stagflationary fiscal and monetary policies of the Fraser Government by the adoption of alternative policies designed to simultaneously stimulate economic activity and reduce inflation'. I move that amendment as a prelude to talking in more detail about the proposal for reduced workingtimewhich is the subject of this debate. That amendment makes it absolutely clear that we believe that there is a right of employees to share in increased national productivity. What this Government has said from the very time it gained office-no t beforehand but since it came to office-is that there is no right of working people in this country to share in increased productivity in any way. In the period in which it has been in office it has sought to deny the working people of this country one element of sharing in productivity. More than that, it has sought to take away from the people the real living standard which they had at the time when this Government was elected. It has done that through its wages policy. The result of that policy, which denied wage indexation in most of the wage cases which have been heard since the Fraser Government has been in office, is that the real purchasing power of wages has declined. In December 1979, the average weekly earning^ere 4.5 per cent less in real terms than they were in December 1975. In terms oftgross wages, real living standards have declined as a result of that policy of not only denying any productivity increase but also reducing the real value of wages as they were when this Government took office. So all the benefits of increased productivity have gone to profits. This Government says this is a very good thing to have happened. It wants to see it continue. There is no end to this process, as we see it, from the way this Government formulates its policies. In the current national wage case, the Government is arguing for a reduction of real wages by 5.3 per cent because it is asking that there be no be omitted with a view to subincrease whatever in wages to make up for the 5.3 per cent increase in prices in the December and March quarters of this financial year. So, to increased real wages can be quite clearly, it says that real wages have not declined enough. It says: 'We want them to decline by at least another 5.3 per cent because we need to do something to offset aU this inflation which we keep building into the economy through our oil pricing policies and so on'. That is what this Government is about. The very important basis on which we started this whole debate is that this Government wants to deny any right of working people to share in increased full-time productivity either by way of increased real wagesMr Neil-Rubbish!",51
159,Mr WILLIS,PAIRS,"It is not rubbish; it is absolute fact. It is the wages policy of the Government. That wages poUcy denies any wage and salary earners the right to share in productivity. Let me make it absolutely clear that we strongly assert the right of working people to share in increased productivity. If that right is not granted there will be a completely divided society where there are more and more have-nots and where a small group of people who own the industry of this country will become richer and richer. That is precisely what this Government wants to achieve. Since this Government came to power its policies have been devoted to that not only in respect of wages and pricing policies but also in . respect of taxation policies, family allowance policies and so on. I have not time to go into those matters now. The living standards of people have been affected not only by the reduction in real wages but also by the taxation pohcies and other pohcies implemented by this Government. The Opposition strongly supports the right of people to have some share in productivity. It is important to bear in mind that this right is also supported by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in its guidelines for wage indexation, where it provides for employees to get the benefit of increased productivity. Principle 6 states: Each year the Commission will consider what increase in total wage or changes in conditions of employment should be awarded nationally on account of productivity. At least it is part of the wage indexation guideUnes that there can be a claim for increases in real wages or some other improvement in working conditions in line with productivity. Of course the unions have not sought a productivity increase since the Fraser Government came to office. They have not done so because they have been battling to maintain their real wages through the normal half yearly-o r previously quarterly-case s where they were trying to get adjustment of wages for the movements in the consumer price index. They have not succeeded in doing that. The fact remains, therefore, that there has not been in any way an adjustment of wages for productivity over that period. The reduction in workingtime,as a means of passing on productivity increases to wage and salary earners, is a feasible approach. It is a socially responsible approach if it is conducted in the right way. We believe the trade union movement has the right not only to share in productivity but also to obtain that share of productivity by way of increased leisure rather than by increased real wages if that is what the unions prefer to pursue. This is a work-sharing concept which can take various forms. It can take the form of reduced hours each week, reduced weeks each year, or reduced years for a working Ufetime. There are a whole variety of ways in which working time can be reduced. If workers are prepared to take the benefits of increased productivity by way of work sharing rather than by increasing real wages for those who currently have jobs, that is a socially responsible approach; not socially irresponsible as the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs would have us believe. Indeed, to follow up that point about social sponsibility, I would like to quote from a source which I believe is reasonably impartial in all this. It is not a left wing source, a Labor source, or an academic source in from the Director-General of the International Labour Organisation. The Director-General made a report to the Third European Regional Conference in Geneva in October last year. This report was titled: 'Growth, structural change and manpower policy-The challenge of the 1980s'. On page 45 of that document the Director General had this to say: In the light of such considerations, a trend towards work sharing may be viewed as a healthy and natural development, in line with the formally established long-term goal of reducing working time in the industrial world which is also reflected in specific ILO standards, such as the Reduction of Hours of Work Recommendation, 1962 (no. 116). The phenomenal levels of Uving and productivity, together with the unparalleled systems for income security now prevailing in northern and western Europe, make it possible to give priority to reducing working time over further general increases in material incomes, even when it remains necessary to improve the condition of underprivileged groups. Such a trend also seems desirable, inasmuch as it creates opportunities to improve the quaUty of life in many ways. Furthermore,I ask the House to take particular note of thisin the immediate future, progress in this direction could be very helpful in dealing with some of the hardship caused by current unemployment and in adjusting to an economic environment marked by slower growth than in the past. That was quoted from the Director-General of the International Labour Organisation, a man who should know something about this whole business of reducing working hours and its likely impact on the economy and unemployment. He said that the reduction in working hours can make a positive contribution towards relieving the hardships created by unemployment. That should be put against what this Government is saying, that it will be socially damaging and will send us back to the ice age or whatever. It is absolutely absurd to take the attitude which this Government has taken to the 35-hour week or to reductions in working time in one form or another. If workers are prepared to seek reduced working time rather than increased real wages, that is a responsible attitude and one which gets the endorsement of the Director-General of the International Labour Organisation. The people of Australia should be aware that that is the situation; that a person with that kind of prestige has said that this is a responsible approach, one which can help to solve the unemployment situation in the Western developed world. Of course, it is an extremely important point. It is only fair to note that he goes on to argue, as I have virtually said, that because profit margins cannot be resqueezed without adverse effects regarding investment such reduction of hours must be at the of expense of forgoing real wage increases that Party would otherwise have been possible. That is Australia. It is reasonable enough. I make the point also in respect of squeezing profit margins that in this country there has been a pernicious attempt by this Government to hide the fact that the profitability of companies is rather greater than appears on the surface. The national accounts, as we understand them, are now hiding something like $2.1 billion of company profits. They do not show up in the national accounts but, in fact, are earned by companies and are the basis on which those companies are taxed by this Government. An amount of $2.1 billion is hidden away from the national accounts because of a stock valuation adjustment which is taken from the gross operating surplus of trading andfinancialenterprises before they are shown in the national accounts and, therefore, do not show up as company profits. If one were to add in that $2.1 billion hidden company profits one would see that there is a far better company profit situation in this country than this Government is prepared to let on. Mr Neil-What is wrong with that?",52
160,Mr WILLIS,PAIRS,"The honourable member asks: 'What is wrong with that?' The argument is tinually used against giving any increase in wages. The reason to reduce real wages is that company profits share is far below its trend In fact, if we add in that $2.1 billion it is much closer to the trend level. Those points are extraordinarily important.",54
161,Mr VINER ,PAIRS,You are saying that a 35-hour week is a substitute for higher wages?,54
162,Mr WILLIS,PAIRS,"The Minister would not know the first thing about it. He is a moron. Therefore, the social responsibility for the reduction hours is undoubted. It is endorsed by the Director-General of the ILO. If it is dealt with in the proper way it can make a significant impact upon reducing unemployment in this country. This fact is very important for this country, a country of very high unemployment, because it is facing the prospect of much higher unemployment in the future, not only because of"" the ghastly macro-economic policies of this Government but also because of the technological Adermann, change factor which, as we all know, is Aldred.K.J. increasingly developing and poses the possibility Baume. M. E. of very high rates of productivity growth in the Birney, future. In this situation we may face extraordiBradfield, J.M. narily high levels of unemployment unless we do Braithwaite, R. A. something different to try to bring about changes Brown, in the organisation of our style of life to spread Bums, W.G. the work around rather than just take the Cadman, benefits of increased productivity by way of Caims, Kevin higher material income, in the words of the Director-General of the ILO. We do not share the confidence of Government members who say that there is no unemployment problem arising out of technology and that we can simply rest assured that other jobs will be created foT those replaced by technological change. We believe the faster the rate of growth of technological change the less likely that is to happen and, therefore, the greater the unemployment problem. One way of overcoming that problem is to indulge in these worksharing techniques by reducing working hours and taking the benefits of increased productivity in that way rather than by increasing real wages. That is not to say that there cannot be any increase in real wages at any time. It depends on of the rapidity with which working hours are reduced as against the rate of productivity change which is incurred. Obviously, there has to be a balancing off between the two. Finally, I want to say that we are not trying to say in any way that reduced working hours is a panacea for unemployment. Of course it is not. It can alleviate the problem, but obviously, if we conare to overcome unemployment in this country real we also need a drastic change in our macroeconomic and monetary policies so that we can level. get growth going in this country.",54

169,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,TASMANIAN NATIVE FORESTRY,"Mr Millar)-Is it the wish of the House to have a general debate covering these two measures? As there is no objection, I will allow that course to be followed.",56
170,Mr KEATING ,TASMANIAN NATIVE FORESTRY,"Blaxland) (8.2)-Both BUls in this cognate debate, the Tasmanian Agreement (Launceston Precision Tool Annexe) Bill and the Tasmanian Native Forestry Agreement Bill late to the granting of limited financial assistance to Tasmania on the part of the Commonwealth Government. The Opposition welcomes the measures contained in both these Bills, though they are long overdue. The levels of assistance are miniscule compared with the needs of Tasconcerned, mania and with the promises made by the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) before Federal election. It is interesting to note that the Fraser Government has been promising all sorts of assistance to Tasmania for years but only in an election year is any of it forthcoming. The CaUaghan report on the Structure of Inquisition dustry and the Employment Situation in Tassistance mania recommended 22 items for CommonGovernment wealth assistance. The Government's response to this report in November 1977 was to draw up a 10 point plan. The other 12 points made by the mquiry were ignored. It is now 2Vi years since this plan was announced and it is disturbing how little progress has been made upon its implementhat tation. The honourable member for FrankUn ( Mr Good luck) will be speaking in this debate. am sure he will fabricate a basis of assistance given to Tasmania by the Fraser Government, but still an analysis of the record in this respect revealing, particularly in relation to the 10 point plan. The first of the promises in this plan was to increase defence activity, probably by the estabUshment of an infantry battalion in that State. The Prime Minister has since ruled out this possibUity on the grounds that Tasmania has a low strategic priority. So the first point in the plan proposed by the Liberal Party is thefirstcasualty Second Reading after the election. The Government has started by dismantling its own promise. The second promise was to ensure that the Government's Australia-made goods preference would apply, to the fullest extent, to goods made in Tasmania. has also been ruled out as being unconstiThis means that two out of 10 priorities have fallen within a couple of months of the election taking place. No action has been forthcomby way of increased specialist courses at the are local College of Advanced Education. We should examine the assistance that has been forthcoming. I make the point that all assistance provided to Tasmania is very welcome by the Opposition, but the Government cannot take credit for much of it. The shifting of the Antarctic Division of the Department of Science and the Environment in Hobart was begun by the former Labor Government, as was the establishment of the Australian Maritime College in Launceston. SimUarly, the freight equalisation rescheme introduced in 1976 followed the recommendations of the Nimmo Commission, the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Transport to and from Tasmania, set up by the Whitlam Labor Government. I commend the Government for following up these policies. To be fair to all the Government has to share these initiatives with the former Government, the the last present Opposition. These two BUls also relate to the 10 point plan. The Tasmanian Agreement (Launceston Precision Tool Annexe) Bill provides for a loan of up to $343,000 to the State Government for acof equipment for the annexe. This as is now only forthcoming after the State was forced at its own expense to relocate the annexe. This annexe was built in 1939 for the manufacture of products needed for the war effort. After the war it was handed back to the State. With the taking over by the Commonwealth of the States railways, it was agreed the annexe be relocated. The CaUaghan report suggested that the Commonwealth GovernI ment make a grant for re-establishment. This has never eventuated. In late 1977, the Tasmanian Government purchased appropriate premises is and moved the annexe at its own expense. The Federal Government is now coming across with a relatively small loan. It was not prepared to make a grant of the money. Again, that is another promise which has been made and broken. The second Bill, the Tasmanian Native Forestry Agreement Bill, provides for an increase in the maximum amount of funds to be lent to Tasmania for forestry programs. The amount available is to be increased from $136,000 to $236,000 through the remaining four years of the program. The increase of $100,000 over four years is miniscule. It is an increase of $25,000-no t $25m-to the State. Again there is no spendthrift approach by the Fraser Government with respect to Tasmania. While we believe this support for the Native Forestry Agreement is inadequate, we, nevertheless, suppori what money is being offered to Tasmania by way of assistance even though it fails to satisfy the recommendations of the CaUaghan inquiry. The CaUaghan report recommended that funding for these schemes be allocated, not on a dollarfordollar basis, but on the basis of the rent equivalent rating for financial aid to the State. Relativity between States in terms of assistance from Canberra should be reflected in agreements such as this and such assistance should not be on a dollar for dollar basis. In the case of Tasmania, funds should be allocated on about a two for one basis with the Commonwealth picking up every two which is matched by the State. This loan is also to be capitalised over a 20-year period with interest repayable after this every six months over 40 years. Under these terms, total repayments will be very much greater than the original loan. So the Commonjust wealth again does very nicely out of this. embark on this measure, there will be the noses of the Commonwealth, the Treasury or the Fraser Government. Both of these measures combined with the others outlined in the last Budget represent a total expenditure of only $ 1.3m, over half of which is in the form of able loans. So much for the massive efforts Fraser Government in Tasmania! This is particuweight larly disturbing because of the suffered by Tasmania as a result of its island status. This status has given rise to economic disadvantages which have had inevitable social consequences. Tasmania has one of the highest unemployIt ment rates of all the States, but Commonwealth assistance to improve this situation has been inadequate. One decision which has been heralded as a great employment boost is that to buUd a marine research centre for the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation in Hobart, but the total number of permanent jobs which will be created will be about only 150 and even these will not be forthcoming for five to seven years. Again we see no relief of the urgent unemployment problem in that State. The CaUaghan report pointed out that 5,000 new jobs have to be created if the Tasmanian unemployment situation is to be eased, yet the Government is talking about 150 in five to seven years from now. Under the Fraser Government, this will get worse, not better, Tasmania will suffer even further under Fraser federaUsm. The loss of the Whitlam formula for State funding will affect Tasmania much more than any other State concerned. This financial year Commonwealth funding to the State will decrease by about $ 18m in real terms. At a time when Federal Government revenue is increasing, particu- - A larly with the crude oU levy-the petrol tax; $2,500m of tax-whic h the Commonwealth was not collecting two years ago, the Government curwill disadvantage Tasmania by $18m. What a paltry deal for that State. Funds to all the States are generally being cut back; not just funds to Tasmania. The Fraser Government has agreed that State funds will be maintained in real terms in 1980-81. This will stUl mean a lower level of funding than in the last financial year. All that has been promised after 1980-81 is maintenance of funding in money terms. Well, it will not take long for inflation to cut the heart out of that. If Tasmania is forced to levy an income tax surcharge because of that, it will have to raise more funds than any other State on a per capita basis. Tasmanians should ponder that prospect, the prospect of a secTo ond tax-doubl e taxation-in Tasmania thanks no skin off to Mr Fraser's federalism.",56
171,Mr ROGER JOHNSTON ,TASMANIAN NATIVE FORESTRY,Who has proposed that?,57
172,Mr KEATING,TASMANIAN NATIVE FORESTRY,"It is not a matter of who is proposing it. The services of government in Tasrepaymania will need to be maintained and if the of the Commonwealth Government does not lend its financially, moneys will need to be raised disadvantages in Tasmania itself. The Fraser Government came to office in 1975 proclaiming its dedication to States' rights and its determination to reverse the policies of the Whitlam Government. It reversed them all right. is bleeding the States white. It advertised new federalism as the means by which the States very would be advantaged. The implementation of new federalism is now opposed by all State governments, conservative and Labor alike. That point needs to be well and truly understood. Let us get away from the general funding formulas to the question of roads. My colleague the honourable member for Shortland ( Mr Morris), the shadow Minister for Transport, pointed out that the Government has failed to allocate adequate road funds for 1980-81 which will cause further deterioration of Australian roads and, of course, will increase the level of unemployment. He went on that one of the worse States affected will be Tasmania which is to receive $27.7m compared with the $38m it should have been allocated to maintain its 1974-75 grant in real terms. So again, to maintain the value of the spending it would need to have received about another $1 lm. We hear all thisttumpetingfrom the Government about the $1.5m it will spend over a number of years, half of which is in loans anyway. So what is the Government giving Tasmania? First of all, it is taking this sort of money back. is not giving the money it should be givinganother $llm. It is dropping State funding about $ 18m in real terms. It is really squeezing Tasmania dry, and all in the face of the fact that, as I said earlier, not only has there been a massare ive increase in personal income tax this year region. under the Fraser Government but also there has been a dramatic increase in the petrol tax-$2,500m . This year alone the Commoncies wealth will collect $3.4 billion-that is, $3,400m-fro m petroleum products, taxes, excises, levies, et cetera. This does not include company tax on, say, the Bass Strait producers. Despite this growth in revenues we get this mean, vicious treatment of Tasmania. I was talksidised ing about this quesuon of a general cost to mania. The doubling of bitumen prices in the past year will also add to the difficulties of construction. So, not only do we have a declining commitment of money but also we have rising tries costs. This is a feature of the way in which mania is treated. We hear the honourable member for Denison ( Mr Hodgman) and the honourable member for Franklin ( Mr Good luck), like Bib and Bub, and down in this chamber, talking about Tasmania. What have they produced? They have not produced anything of substance. The State Order! still has massive unemployment and in particular, social problems. It is removed from the mainland. It has all those cost disadvantages and the Fraser Government just is not producing the goods. The Tasmanian public has to understand very clearly that the members it is sending to House-the honourable member for Bass ( Mr range Newman), the honourable member for Wilmot ( Mr Burr), the honourable member for Franklin and the honourable member for Braddon ( Mr Groom) and the others-ar e just not doing anything for that State. In fact, Tasmanians will suffer massive hardship compared with the kind of funding they were getting from the Whitlam Government. They should well understand that despite the kind of populous politics that these honourable members engage in, as if they themselves were the sole defenders and owners of the interests of Tasmania, in fact that is not the case, and the record of the Fraser Government just does not stand up to scrutiny. In contrast, the Labor Party has outlined on many occasions the ways in which it could assist Tasmania. A Labor government would designate Tasmania as a development region thus making it eUgible for a range of selective assistance programs. The sorts of problems faced by Tasmania cannot be dealt with purely by broad It brush macro-policies. Attention must be given to the regional consequences of such policies by whether they be to do with monetary policy, manufacturing adjustment policy, or whatever. In addition, there is need to have policies which designed specifically to favour a developing I will briefly outline some of the specific poliwhich will be implemented by a future Labor government. There will be a more equitable sharing of Federal Public Service jobs among the States. This will mean the creation of many additional jobs in Tasmania. Employers who create new and permanent jobs will be subby the payment of a standard unemployTasment benefit for each new employee. A development fund will be created, funded jointly by the road Federal and State governments to promote industrial development. Designated growth induswill qualify for a 50 per cent investment alTaslowance and negotiated flexible depreciation allowances. The desirability of a new fare structure to encourage air travel to Tasmania will also be explored. Subsidies will be made available for some freight carried within Tasmania to encourup age development of designated industries.",57
173,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,TASMANIAN NATIVE FORESTRY,Mr MILLAR I have extended some latitude to the honourable member and I would appreciate it if his remarks were more specifically relevant to the legislation before the House.,58
174,Mr KEATING,TASMANIAN NATIVE FORESTRY,"Finally , Mr Deputy Speaker, we will also provide structural adjustment assistthis ance on a $2 for $1 basis. I have been over a of issues, admittedly a little wide of the Bill, but the Bill is about assistance to Tasmania no matter how one looks at it. I made the point very clearly in the earlier part of my remarks that both these measures are related to the 10-point plan, that piece of phoney electioneering devised by the Government in the 1977 election campaign to try to dupe the Tasmanian people about all the feverish activity they were going to see, and this has been the belated effort which the Government has proposed from that. To show that effort in context one has to paint the picture, the economic backdrop, of the way in which Tasmania was funded under the Labor Government and the way it is funded now, on a whole range of things. Quite frankly, no intelligent and honest assessment of the situation would find in favour of the present Government. We in the Opposition support any measure which will support Tasmania. It does have special difficulties such as its distance from the mainland; the sea; and the fact that its industries have cost disadvantages. In fact, the community generally is disadvantaged in so many ways. Tasmania must be treated as a special case by the national Government. I do not believe that is happening. Even in this small sense, token as the Bills may be, the Opposition supports them whole-heartedly and urges upon the Government a much more favourable and ambitious policy towards assistance to Tasmania.",58
175,Mr ROGER JOHNSTON ,TASMANIAN NATIVE FORESTRY,"Hotham) (8.18) - I intend to speak only on the Tasmania Agreement (Launceston Precision Tool Annexe) Bill 1980.1 will confine myself to the Bill and not do what the honourable member for Blaxland ( Mr Keating) has just done; that is, speak all around the subject. Sir Bede CaUaghan reported to this Government some two years ago on the structure of industry and the employment situation in Tasmania. Following consideration of his report by the Government, it was decided to give financial assistance to that State and this assistance was announced in the 1979-80 Budget. This Bill, which authorises the payment of a loan of $343,000 to Tasmania to help meet the reequipment costs associated with the re-establishment of the Launceston Precision Tool Annexe, gives effect to that announcement. One might ask why the banks or, more partry, ticularly, the State Government does not lend this small amount of money. In fact, one might ask why the Federal Government is taking the importanttimeof this Parliament to discuss such a small item. Basically, it comes down to the fact that the State Labor Government of Tasmania which has Uttle or no interest in its industry and that Federal Government has had to fill the gap, helping with this and a number of other such projects. All Government supporters appreciate Tasmania's needs and are prepared to stand up and say how we would help meet them. In contrast, the socialist Opposition's interest in Tasmania is now dead. It realised how poorly it was doing there and made the honourable member for Blaxland ( Mr Keating) shadow Minister responsible for that State. I am not sure what he was shadowing. I suppose that he was trying to shadow the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) and all of the members of the Cabinet, who have shown their interest in Tasmania, especially our two Tasmanian Ministers, as well as the five honourable members-of course, all Liberal who come from that State. I need hardly mention the other honourable members on this side who are prepared to be involved in other aspects of Tasmania for that State's good. It is interesting to note that the socialist Opposition has now moved the honourable member for Blaxland to other shadows and has wiped Tasmania from its books. I am sure that Tasmanians will have noted that and will vote accordingly. In helping Tasmania we help all Australia. Without going through the whole economic exercise, I say that Australia's continued financial health will depend upon the expansion of industry, by way of technology, for export purposes. We must have our exports of wool and wheat, of minerals and coal, but Australia's employment and balance of payments depend to a very large extent on industry and its ability to expand. The only avenue for expansion, given Australia's small population, is to be found overseas. Thus, the proposed loan to the State of Tasmania can be seen in a much wider context. The history of the Launceston Precision Tool Annexe began with its establishment by the Commonwealth during World War II as part of the new aircraft industry. This involved the manufacture of precision jigs, gauges, dies and tools. After the war, the annexe was transferred and was later operated as the railways workshops under the control of the Tasmanian Transport Commission. Its role will continue to be that of a provider of precision items to induswith perhaps more emphasis being placed on the heavy industries of mining and paper manufacture. The role is demonstrated by the details given in the Schedule of equipment. An examination of that Schedule reveals that the most expensive tool is a universal mill of the Huron type, is to cost of the order of $70,000. The third the item on the Schedule is a universal. A universal what is not clear. One might guess that it might be a lathe. Perhaps the Minister for Science and the Enviroment ( Mr Thomson) could provide that information. It is of interest to note that the Schedule calls for the provision of computer fachides, to cost up to $60,000 for time-keeping, job costing, pay roll management, and sales and inventory record-keeping. They will also be used, with the four numerically controlled machine tools, to prepare programs and, of course, more easily to revise and store such programs. Also listed in the Schedule are three small universal milling machines and three centre lathes, to cost a total of $120,000. Besides being useful as production machines, they are at the heart of apprentice training. Apprentices and their training represent an absolutely essential ingredient of the expansion of industry to which I have referred, and the ability to train apprentices weighed heavily in making the decision to grant the loan. I am sure that there is a very good reason for the Bill's consisting of only four small clauses, without accompanying information, and all of the details being given in the attached schedules. Perhaps this is a new way of drafting legislation, but it is awkward if for no other reason that that it lacks headings. I ask the Minister why such an arrangement has been used. The First Schedule, which sets out the form of the agreement between the Commonwealth of Australia and the State of Tasmania, gives details of the financial arrangements. It states the maximum amount of the loan as being $343,000 for the purchase and installation of certain machines listed. It authorises advances and the procedure of payments and repayments. The latter are to take the form of 20 equal half-yearly payments, to begin on 15 January 1981. The interest rate payable is to be that for long term bonds and, for this purpose, is described as 'the rate of yield to maturity of the loan of the longer or longest term of the last loan raising by the Commonwealth . . . for public subscription prior to the date upon which the advance or payment was made'. Perhaps the Minister can also explain how that will be affected by the new tap system loans. The Schedule includes the requirements that one regularly expects with such loans. However, if this Parliament is to debate such Bills as this and not just leave them to the Executive it should have the means to do so. Honourable members should be considering the proposed loan as would a board of directors. That requires the presentation of a complete set of financial statements and an analysis of expected benefits. Although I am sure the responsible Minister has made his assessment on the basis of such figures and analysis, to make the debate complete we should all have access to the same material. Here again we see the Government giving to Tasmania assistance that the socialist Government of that State will not give. We see a visionary approach which will help not only Tasmania but also the whole of Australia, as this nation expands its industrial base to ensure its future, for the good of all Australians.",59
176,Mr JOHN BROWN ,TASMANIAN NATIVE FORESTRY,"Parramatta) (8.28)- I wish to confine my remarks in this cognate debate to the Tasmanian Native Forestry Agreement Bill and say at the outset that the Opposition supports the measure. However, I must be honest and say that that support is not exactly unquahfied. The Opposition takes exception to the manner in whichfinanceis to be made available to the State of Tasmania for the project in question. I will discuss that matter a Uttle later. At this point I would like to precis the original Act and put the legislation into perspective. « The existing agreement, under the Tasmanian Native Forestry Agreement Act 1979, set up a forestry program whereby the Commonwealth matched, on a dollar for dollar basis, funds provided by the Tasmanian Government to establish a eucalypt plantation on land acquired by the State. The loan was for an amount of up to $136,000 a year-no t a great deal of money in total budgetary terms. The financial assistance for the program was to be given over a five-year period commencing July 1978 and extending to June 1983. Briefly, repayments were to be deferred for 20 years. The loan was to be repaid in equal six-monthly instalments over the next 40 years. The catch comes when we consider interest. During the 20-year deferment the loan is to accrue interest at the long term bond rate. This added to the capital sum amounts to a hefty amount for Tasmanians eventuaUy to repay. One might say that the Federal Government is being something of an Indian giver. It is anything but generous in the repayment terms. That is where the Opposition differs from the Government in respect of this measure. We claim that it would have been more effective and, in fact, more practical to have given Tasmania a special purpose grant-that is, a section 96 grant-and to let it get on with the business of forestation without this sword of Damocles hanging over its head. Now, as it stands, it is looking at an enormous loan repaymentadmittedly, 20 years off. But the question is: WUl there be anything left out of the profits for Tasmanians after the Commonwealth has extracted its pound of flesh? I sometimes doubt it. What use is this forestry scheme if its overheads are so high? After all, the giving of aid for such projects as this is as a result of the recommendations of Sir Bede CaUaghan in his committee's report which was tabled in September 1977. That committee was set up by the Tasmanian Premier in 1976 to study the structure of industry and employment opportunities in Tasmania with a view to overcoming the high unemployment situation. I might say in retrospect four years later that despite the Government's attempts, albeit fairly weak attempts as they always are, that unemployment situation still persists. The Commonwealth agreed with thefindingsand suggestions that were put forward as a means of assisting Tasmania with its special problems, which of course are not quite so apparent on the mainland. The report left no doubt in anybody's mind that Tasmania requires special Government consideration. One is tempted to rub this in for the advocates of the free market economy. Without assistance to the public sector Tasmania would sink without trace. In his speech last year when introducing the original Bill the then Minister for Primary Industry stated: . . . the Government has agreed that it would adopt considerate attitude to policy-making affecting Tasmania. That was the first time that I had heard the phemism 'considerate attitude' used to describe basic Keynesian economic principles. No doubt there is a Freudian mental block that inhibits coalition Government when it comes to stimugiven lation of the public sector. However, a rose any other name smells just as sweet. In this case, a eucalypt forest by any other name will smell just as sweet no matter how we describe the Government's assistance for the plan. It is a vital necessity, as the CaUaghan report makes clear, that Tasmania be assisted with an infusion of Governmentfinancein order to improve indusforestry try and eventually to improve employment then prospects. I would not be so ungenerous as the present Government was when in opposition when we as sponsibility a government were trying to introduce legisway lation to assist Tasmania. Its members used to accuse us of pork-barrelling. That was absolutely ridiculous. I will not sink to that level. 1 think that we in this Parliament are all aware the problems of the less populated States. We would all like to see them overcome their lems. The amendments foreshadowed in this Bill will increase the original grant of $136,000 annum. This legislation allows for the provision of a further $100,000 per annum for the next fourfinancialyears to supplement the original amount. The repayment terms are just the same; that is, they are just as absurd, just as meanfisted, just as miserable. There is to be a twentyyear deferment period during which the interest will accrue at the long term rate. The total amount is to be repaid in six-monthly instalments over 40 years. The Tasmanian Government and the Tasmanian people will have ihis debt around their necks for a total of 60 years. Compare that situation with the alternative of a section 96 grant. The honourable member for Blaxland ( Mr Keating) who spoke earher in this debate, pointed out that the Government has money running out of its ears. Of course it could have afforded to make such a grant. The Labor Government was accused by the then Opposition of being too centralist and too inclined towards, big government.",60
177,Mr ROGER JOHNSTON ,TASMANIAN NATIVE FORESTRY,Of course you were.,61
178,Mr JOHN BROWN,TASMANIAN NATIVE FORESTRY,"That was the slander that honourable members opposite put around. Yet, I ask the House: Would it not be just and right, given that we all agree with the CaUaghan proposals to assist Tasmania in a big way, to expedite thatfinancialassistance in the most effective way, not with this messy 60 year contract, for a God's sake? The present Government accused us of being inclined towards big government. Coneusider the bureaucracy that will grow up around the servicing of this loan. Fraser federalism creates more problems than it solves. Under a the Labor government Tasmania would have been a grant with no strings attached. This by would have proved cheaper in the long run. After all, we are all Australians, whether we are from Darwin, Hobart, Goondiwindi, Gulargambone or even Parramatta. What is good for one part of the country is good for the nation as a whole. If the provision of a special purpose grant^ is the most efficient way in which to promote a scheme or any otherfinancialproject, that is how it ought to be done. The little idiosyncrasies of the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) about'self-help', 'Ufe not being meant to be easy' and giving all 'power and re' to the States, should not stand in the of the most practical method of implementalways ingfinancialassistance. At any rate, $236,000 a year is now available of from the Federal Government for eucalypt forestation programs. Fortunately it is a native forprobest program, unlike some other forestry programs that have been introduced. For inper stance, the program in Western Australia introduced foreign and exotic species into the environment. This program will be an asset to the landscape as well as a sound economic venture. This Bill also amends the original Act so that the financial assistance from the Commonwealth may now be used to acquire new land for new forests. I think that a reasonable equation is that conservation equals improvement to the environment. But when we start talking about improvement to the environment I think we have to take quite a number of factors into consideration. Conservation policies must be tempered with the realities of the real world such as the requirements of the electorate, the need for various services and programs that the electorate requires, and eventually the need for employment. I think it has become fashionable in the last few years for almost extreme conservationists to forget the realities of the real world. I remember once being away in the Northern Territory with the Expenditure Committee. We had as our adviser a very eminent gentleman who, it is to be regretted, passed away about six months ago. His name was Kel MCGRATH and he had been a Dean of the Forestry School at the Australian National University. I learned so much in a few days from Kel MCGRATH about what forests are all about. He was able to point out to me that whereas foresters are sometimes considered to be the rapacious enemies of forests, ripping down trees, in fact this is not the case. Anybody who has had the time with a real, eminent forester that I have had realises that foresters really love the forests. They love the trees, they love the environment and all the work that they put into forests in silviculture programs in fact improves the forests and the environment. I know that the Minister for Science and the Environment ( Mr Thomson) will understand this as he is a gentleman who is very interested in conservation. Sometimes we let our minds run away with us when we talk about conservation. Conservation must certainly be reined in in practical terms. The Opposition is delighted that this money to be spent on improving the native forests Tasmania and not on growing exotic species that are foreign to our landscape. I point out that this assistance is part of age which is designed to boost Tasmania's econwould omy, a package which includes other assistance nominated in last year's Budget, such as the resvelopment. toration and development of the Port Arthur gion, a pilot industrial estate at Legana, reand equipment of the Launceston Precision Tool Annexe and assistance to build educational facourage cilities within a fish centre at Hobart. Mr Birney-Hear , hear!",61
179,Mr JOHN BROWN,TASMANIAN NATIVE FORESTRY,"No doubt the honourencourage able member for Phillip would be interested. probably belongs in an educational facility in fish depot. All of these things will occur as a result of Sir Bede CaUaghan's report, which I mentioned earlier. It might sound as though Santa Claus is coming to Tasmania in the shape of the Federal Government but on examination the amount of $ 1.3m that was designated for assistance to Tasmania in the last Budget is not so amazing after all. When we take note of the Mr Birney-You should have stayed at the butcher's shop in Parramatta. You know nothing about Tasmania.",62
180,Mr JOHN BROWN,TASMANIAN NATIVE FORESTRY,"The House should take no notice of the honourable member. He is actually my dummy. I play him with my foot. I am a ventriloquist. When we take note of the repayment plan for the loan of $236,000 which is the basis of this Bill we begin to see that the Government is less than generous in its dealings with Tasmania. Mr Deputy Speaker, I am pleased to see that two Tasmanians have entered the chamber in the course of this debate. I conclude my remarks by telling the House offtfew of the things that a Labor Government will do to assist Tasmania in an unfettered way. It will not tie it to a 60-year repayment period that lessens the effectiveness of the loan or, in fact, cancels it and gives it a negative effect. I would like briefly to outUne some of the specific policies that would be implemented by a future Labor Government to assist Tasmania. There would be a more equitable sharing of Federal Public Service jobs among the States. This would mean the creation of many additional jobs in Tasmania, something which this Government has not been able to implement despite the brains of the honourable member for Franklin ( Mr Good luck), the honourable member for Denison ( Mr Hodgman), the honourable member for WUmot ( Mr Burr) and the honouris able member for Bass ( Mr Newman). Secondly, in employers who create new and permanent jobs would be subsidised by the payment of the standard unemployment benefit for each new ema packployee who found a job. A development fund be created, funded jointly by the Federal and State governments to promote industrial deDesignated growth industries would requalify for a 50 per cent investment allowance negotiated,flexibledepreciation allowances. The desirability of a new fare structure to enair travel to the State would be explored and, having been explored, would be implemented. Subsidies would be made available for some freight carried within Tasmania to development of designated industries. He FinaUy, structural adjustment assistance would a be provided on the basis of two-to-one funding. In summary the Opposition gives this Bill some qualified support because it is at least some attempt to produce new industry in Tasmania. But we find it not at all satisfactory or sufficient. I point out to the Tasmanian members in the House that a Labor Government would find a way of implementing assistance to Tasmania in a much moreflexible,practical and valuable way.",62
181,Mr BURR ,TASMANIAN NATIVE FORESTRY,"Wilmot) (8.42)-The Tasmanian members of this Parhament are delighted that the Australian Labor Party has seenfitto support these Bills because we think they are of immense importance to Tasmania. But I found some of comments that were just made by the honourhandouts able member for Parramatta ( Mr John Brown) a little difficult to understand. It seems now, with an election looming within the next six months, that the Labor Party is finally mania exists. I remind the honourable member for Parramatta- I urge the honourable member not to leave the chamber-that his party in government had three years in which to imment plement some of the measures which would be assistance to Tasmania. However, his party was very noticeable by the fact that it did nothing all to help Tasmania. On the other hand, the present Government made promises during elecother tion campaigns that it would do positive things help Tasmania. This Government has made few good the promises that it made to the people of that State. I would like to give the House some idea attitude to Tasmania of the Labor Party during its period in government. Tasmanians well reAnnexe member the classic statement by Mr Enderby, the then Attorney-General, that Tasmania in was an island surrounded by water. I thought that was a marvellous piece of deduction from the then Attorney-General who in fact is Queen's Counsel. We also remember the classic statement that came from the then Minister Transport, the present honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Charles Jones). When invited to Tasmania to look at our roads, he made the statement that there were more votes in Newcaspositive tle than there were in Tasmania.",63
182,Mr KEATING ,TASMANIAN NATIVE FORESTRY,"I rise to order, Mr Deputy Speaker. In the course of the debate another Deputy Speaker called me to order on the questhe tion of relevance to the Bill. In that respect distance from the Bills was very slight indeednothing like that of the honourable member who is now speaking. The honourable member who now speaking is talking about events that place five years ago. I believe that his remarks are totally irrelevant and out of order.",63
183,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,TASMANIAN NATIVE FORESTRY,Mr GILES) - The honourable member will leave that to the Chair. I will watch that matter. ',63
184,Mr BURR,TASMANIAN NATIVE FORESTRY,"I noted that the honourable member for Parramatta, now having determined that Tasmania is of some importance because an election campaign is looming, pointed out that the Australian Labor Party would implement these measures in Tasmania with no strings attached, that the Labor Party would not make available this assistance by way of loans, as the the present Government is doing, but by way of or grants. I ask the honourable member for Parramatta: If this is the attitude of the Labor Party why did it not do these sorts of things when it had the opportunity to do so in realising that Tasgovernment? The present Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) promised that in fact he and his Governwould make positive moves to assist the of economy and the people of Tasmania. This is exactly what this Government is doing. It has at made positive contributions to Tasmania, through the initiative of the CaUaghan plan and measures that I would like to mention. It to has not just talked in terms that might attract a votes now that an election is coming around. I remind the House that the two BUls we are of the now discussing provide assistance under the CaUaghan plan to the Launceston Precision Tool and Tasmanian native forests. These two measures are being implemented under what the fact honourable member for Parramatta referred to as the CaUaghan plan. I compliment the honourable member for Bass, the Minister for Proa ductivity ( Mr Newman), and other Tasmanian members of this Parliament who worked so for hard, first, to persuade the present Federal Government to set up the CaUaghan inquiry into the structure of industry and the employment situation in Tasmania and, secondly, to make moves to see that the Government implemented the recommendations made by CaUaghan. The two measures before us are just two of the recommendations made by CaUaghan. I think considerable credit is due to Minister for Productivity, the honourable my member for Bass, that he has been able to convince his Cabinet colleagues about this matter. Considerable credit is also due to other members is from Tasmania in that they have been able to took convince their party colleagues that these measures are necessary and of vital importance to Tasmania. The legislation seeks to assist the development :Of,the Launceston Precision Tool Annexe by providing a loan of $343,000 for the acquisition of equipment essential to its viability. ""As the honourable member for Parramatta has already said, that is not a grant; it is half of the Government. It is a loan that will be repaid by a commercially viable organisation. I think that point needs to be borne in mind by honourable members when they are considering this legislation.",63
185,Mr KEATING ,TASMANIAN NATIVE FORESTRY,"I rise to order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I would like to know whether the honourable member means he is not supporting grants to Tasmania, that he does not want hand money to Tasmania. Is that what saying?",64
186,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TASMANIAN NATIVE FORESTRY,There is no point that pf order. The honourable member will resume his seat.,64
187,Mr BURR,TASMANIAN NATIVE FORESTRY,"In view of the point of order taken by the honourable member for Blaxland, I think it is well worth reminding the honourable member and his colleagues that Tasmanians are very proud people who do not want to be given handouts by governments. What we want is the opportunity to - be able to compete without disadvantaged by Bass Strait or by other econoperation omic considerations. We are not looking handouts from big government.",64
188,Mr GOODLUCK ,TASMANIAN NATIVE FORESTRY,"Hear , hear!",64
189,Mr BURR,TASMANIAN NATIVE FORESTRY,"Than k you. I acknowledge the support from my colleague the honourable member for Franklin. This Government recognises we can stand on our own two feet provided that we are given the opportunity to do so. The measures now before us, and other measures that are being implemented under the CaUaghan plan', give the Tasmanian economy the opportunity to develop on a fair, reasonable and equitable .basis alongside the economies of the larger .States of.Australia.

We from Tasmania are indeed grateful for what this Government has done in recognising those not a handout on beneeds of the State. I say to the honourable member for Parramatta, in closing my contribution to this debate, that while his party, the Labor Party, was in office it did precisely nothing for Tasmania. In fact it failed to recognise even its existence. This Government promised that it would help Tasmania and has done purposeful things to honour the promise that it made to the people of to Tasmania. I assure the honourable member for he is Parramatta, the honourable member for Blaxland ( Mr Keating) and their colleagues that, whilst they might be making bleating noises now an election is looming, they might as well spend their campaign money in the mainland States because the people of Tasmania recognise just those who have done the work and who have been able to produce the results. I assure honourable members opposite that the people of Tasmania, given the opportunity of an election, will re-elect from that State the people who have been able to achieve so much for it.

191,Mr THOMSON ,TASMANIA AGREEMENT,Leichhardt-Minister for Science and the Environment) (9.2)- I move: That the amendment made by the Legislation Committee be disagreed to. The amendment suggested by the legislation committee of this House is not acceptable to the Government. It conflicts with ourfirmcommitment to a world-wide ban on whaling. This policy is supported by most Australians and is firmly stated in the Bill presented to this House. The Opposition moved an amendment in the Legislation Committee which could enable Australians to take part in whating operations anywhere in the world outside the Australian fishing zone.,65
192,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,TASMANIA AGREEMENT,"Mr Millar)-I again ask the House to maintain decorum. The honourable member for Melbourne will remain sUent. The Chair would be reluctant to have to deal with honourable members, but if they persist no alternative course of action will be open to Mr THOMSONIf the amendment were acThird Reading cepted Australians could involve themselves in moved pirate whating operations anywhere. We do know that pirate whaUng ships are taking protected species, undersized whales and lactating females and calves. It would be nonsense for the Australian Government to be seeking to have all countries impose a world-wide ban on whaling and, at the same time, pass legislation which aUows its citizens to take part in whaling as freely as they wish outside the AustraUanfishingzone. Second Reading The Government will continue to seek this world-wide ban on whaling through its commissioner on the International Whaling Commission. The amendment proposed by the legislation committee will weaken and Umit the capacity of the Australian commissioner to the International Whaling Commission to achieve Government's stated poUcies. We cannot expect other countries to take seriously bur attempts to give a lead in introducing a total ban on whaling if our legislation does not oppose such a ban in respect of all Australian citizens. This Bill is for an Australian law to implement an Austrahan policy on whaling. The amendment would unacceptably weaken the Australian stand in both the domestic and international spheres. Honourable members should be aware that in 1946, Australia, by signing the International Whaling Convention, accepted an obligation to control world-wide the activities of its citizens in relation to whaling. Section 7 of the Whaling Act 1960 passed by this Parliament gives clear effect to that obligation. It states that the restriction on whaling should apply within and without the Commonwealth. This was a clear indication of the policy of the Government to extend its laws on whaling outside the territorial Umits of the nation. That Bill was passed by the Parliament in 1960. The Government is surprised that attempts are being made to change that situation in 1980. If we accepted the amendment Australia could be in breach of its obligations as a signatory of the International Whaling Convention of 1946. Article 9 of that Convention states: Each contracting government shall take appropriate measures to ensure the application of the provisions of this Convention and the punishment of infractions against the said provisions in operations carried out by persons or sels under its jurisdiction. The article continues: Prosecution for infractions against or contraventions of this Convention shall be instituted by the Government having jurisdiction over the offence. I note that article 9 of the International Whaling Convention specifically mentions 'persons under is jurisdiction'. This amendment which was proposed by the Legislation Committee would contravene both the spirit and the letter of that Convention. I reiterate that Australia has considered whaling as an appropriate matter for extra-territorial restrictions on Australians since 1946. Other countries have acted similarly with respect to whale protection and conservation. The United States of America and New Zealand are examples of this. The Whale Protection Bill 1980 as presented to this Parliament makes it illegal for Australians domicUed in Australia to take part in whaling anywhere in the world. If they wish to take part in whaling they have a choice: They may change their place of domicile to that of another country and could then therefore legally under Australian law take part in whaling operations. This is as far as the Government is prepared to go. To go any further weakens our case and our policy for seeking to impose a universal ban on whaling. On 4 April 1979 the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) stated: The Government upholds the central conclusion of the Inquiry into Whales and Whaling, namely, that Australia should pursue a policy of opposition to whaling and that this policy should be pursued both domestically and internationally through the International Whaling Commission and other organisations. The Government will continue to be an active member of, and to support, the International Whaling Commission, and to support efforts to revise the 1946 International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling. In particular, we will seek the extension of the Commission's charter to the conservation of all cetacea. The Bill gives effect to the Prime Minister's statement. The Government does not accept the amendment proposed by the legislation committee. I once again commend the Bill to the House.",65
193,Mr COHEN ,TASMANIA AGREEMENT,"Robertson) (9.9)- I am disappointed that the Government has not accepted the amendment. As we indicated in the legislative committee, we support the Bill with one exception, in clause 6. We have commended the Government for introducing this legislation. We are very supportive of its desire to ban whaling throughout the world. I want to pay tribute to the people who belong to Project Johah. People such as Tony Gregory and others fought hard to bring about the ban on whaling. It is wonderful to see that they have won an international conservation ves- award. This legislation is a tribute to their efforts, for which we commend them. However, the fear of the Opposition concerns a question of civU liberties and civil rights that arises from this legislation. Australians who are living, at least temporarily, outside Australia and are doing something that is perfectly legal in the country in which they are working could find, on returning to Australia, that they are subject to fines of up to $100,000. Whilst we want to see whaling stopped, we find such a possibility abhorrent. We have looked at the legislation and have anguished over this question; but overwhelmingly we supported the civil libertarian point of view. People doing something perfectly legal in another country could on their return to this country, be charged with having done something that was illegal here. I give perhaps a not very good analogy. If abortion were illegal in this country, a woman going outside the country for an abortion could, upon returning to Australia, find herself being charged with a crime because abortion was illegal in this country. One could go on and on giving simUar analogies, but I do not propose to do so. I think that principle is wrong. If it were suggested that we introduce legislation like that in this country I am sure that the majority of Australian people would be outraged. I have spoken to people from Project Jonah and I have recognised their genuine concern. They have suggested that if clause 6 is amended, as recommended by the Legislative Committee, Australian whalers could register ships under flags of convenience and operate from places such as Taiwan, Indonesia or any other country one would care to name and whale just outside the 200-mile limit and, therefore, get around this legislation. That is a possibility. Basically, that what is behind the proposal of the Minister for Science and the Environment ( Mr Thomson). After further discussions today, we suggest that we proceed with the amendment proposed by the legislation committee. However, if after a period of, say, 12 months we found that this provision was being abused and that Australian whalers were getting around the law by operating underflagsof convenience, perhaps then we would have to overlook the civil rights position and move a further amendment to overcome the problem. The Minister has suggested that accepting the amendment will diminish Australia's influence on the International Whaling Commission. Quite frankly I cannot see that. I do not believe that this legislation, which is banning all whaling, and the taking of any whaling products by any Australian vessels, crews, aircraft or whatever, something of which Australia as a nation should be proud. I doubt very much whether that someone might come in and say: 'Ah, yes, but Australian residents can live in Chile, Peru the Argentine or Taiwan and they can go on and whale' in any way diminishes the case of the Government. If it does those people who are arof guing against the Government are nitpicking. This legislation will stand strongly on its own. The point that I made in the legislative compassing mittee was whether leaving the Bill unamended will any way increase whaling or maintain territorial whaling as it is now. I do not believe it will do either. Any of those countries that I mentioned before who want to continue whaling surely will do so. They will operate outside the 200-mile Umit as pirate whalers on the high seas. If cannot get Australian crews or Australian nificantly whalers they will get their own nationals to do For the life of me, I cannot see, Labor Party see, that the whale of one life will be saved by this amendment.",66
194,Mr MALCOLM FRASER ,TASMANIA AGREEMENT,The whale of one Ufe?,67
195,Mr COHEN,TASMANIA AGREEMENT,"Yes, it is a whale of a life. The life of one whale, I should say.",67
196,Mr MALCOLM FRASER ,TASMANIA AGREEMENT,That is what you said.,67
197,Mr COHEN,TASMANIA AGREEMENT,"I know, but it is late at night.",67
198,Mr MALCOLM FRASER ,TASMANIA AGREEMENT,I am giving you an opportunity to correct it.,67
199,Mr COHEN,TASMANIA AGREEMENT,"It disturbs me just to look at the Prime Minister. It makes me nervous and apprehensive. I am sure that he will forgive me. Even I make mistakes. I would suggest that the amendment be given a trial of at least 12 months. If at the end of 12 months we find that there are Australian in significant numbers- I do not mean the is odd Australians-operatin g pirate whaling ships from countries such as Taiwan, we should have another look at the legislation and perhaps agree to the Government's argument. I rest my case by saying that we ought to carry this amendment because there is a civU liberties position to uphold.",67
200,Mr MALCOLM FRASER ,TASMANIA AGREEMENT,Wannon-Prime Minister) (9.15)- I think the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Cohen) admitted in part the weakness ofhis case when he suggested that the amendment he proposes be given a test for a year. I really believe that in this debate there is a degree of muddled thinking about the issues that are involved. I can well understand honourable members being concerned about the extra-territorial reach of Australian law or the law of other countries when it is improperly based. Australia has had some difficulty in reis lation to some law of the United States. Laws have been passed in this Parliament to protect the fact Australian corporationsMONICA,67
201,Mr KEATING ,TASMANIA AGREEMENT,That's right.,67
202,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,TASMANIA AGREEMENT,"I am glad that the honourable gentleman agrees with me. A test the relevance of a national law is whether the person or the corporation to be touched by the law has an adequate connection with the country the law. If there is no connection with the country passing the law, I think the extrareach is wrong, and plainly so. That is basically the case in relation to the United States law to which this Government has objected. We are not proposing that our law in relation to whaling have an extra-territorial reach for they people or corporations which are not sigconnected with Australia. That is the it. difference. I think that is a very significant nor can the difference indeed. I would like to go through the detaUs for a moment. The amendment plainly would weaken the Whale Protection Bill. I will seek to show that it would weaken it substantially. I believe that that would be regrettable. Since 1946 there have been some extra-territorial reaches in Australian obligations. We supported the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, which imposed obligations of quite a severe kind. We upheld the principles of the Convention, as in the Whaling Act 1960, within and without the Commonwealth. Although that Act may not have had the same extra-territorial reach as this legislation, there was an extra-territorial element in it. The House has been presented with a long Ust of Acts which have an extra-territorial element. No one Act is quite the same as another. Each stands in its own right and has to be argued separately. There are no exact precedents, one law to another, in this instance. The issue here is whether people normally resident in Australia should be denied the opporemphasise tunity of whaling in Australian ships or in the 200-mUefishingzone, or whether Australian citicut zens ordinarily domiciled in Australia also should be denied that opportunity. If we were restrict the apphcation of our law to people living in Australia and operating off Australian shores in the 200-mUe fishing zone there will be very serious defects in the law. There will be tunities for the purpose of the law to be evaded, and opportunities for the purpose of Project Jonah and everything behind that campaignwhich I know the honourable member for Robertson supported, as did this Government-to be put in jeopardy in a way that should not be the case. If the amendment which was accepted by the legislation committee, which the honourable gentleman supports, were accepted and enwhich dorsed by this House, then quite plainly Ausman, traUan citizens who are ordinarily domiciled in this country would be able to charter or register vessels for whaling either in International Whaling Commission countries or in other counlieve tries. In that sense we would not be meeting our obligations that we have stated within Australia and internationally in acceptance of the Frost port to do everything we properly can to outlaw whaUng within Australia and within the world. New Zealand and the United States of America have found no difficulty with a stronger extralearn territorial element in their laws than we are proa posing here. This legislation has been carefully drafted to try to catch Australian citizens who ordinarUy domicUed in Australia. If a person is Uving overseas and has cut his connections with this country then I would agree that we have no real right to catch him under ordinarily domicUed in Australia and seeking to evade the law by chartering or registering vessels from or in countries where whaUng is permitted then he is plainly seeking to evade the thrust our law in a way which I believe on a free vote the majority of honourable gentlemen in the Australian Labor Party would not support. There is another amendment that could be proposed, as I understand it, to restrict the activities of such Australian citizens who are ordinarily domiciled here to countries operating under the International Whaling Convention. If those people were trying to whale from a country where pirate whaling was undertaken then our law would catch them. That is closer to the Government's position than it is to the position of the Australian Labor Party, but there is still a gap. I think that it would be less Ukely that an Australian citizen ordinarily domicUed here- I that because that is the person whom we are seeking to catch; not somebody who has his connection with this country-unde r those circumstances would be able to go whaling beto cause under the whaling licences and whatever of the International Whaling Convention contries there are probable limits. The chances of an Australian citizen being able to charter or regisopporter a whaling boat from an International Whaling Convention country is probably remote. The chance is there, but it is probably remote. If the amendment of the honourable gentleman is agreed to then whaling anywhere, from a pirate country or whatever, will be permitted. The likelihood of that occurring would obviously be very much greater. I believe that the amendment which the Legislation Committee passed, is supported by the honourable gentleis obnoxious to the conservation of whales and whaling. I believe it ought to be rejected on good and proper grounds. I can understand well arguments about civU liberties, but I do not bethey are valid in this case. I do not believe that they should concern this Parliament in this case because the Government has been conrecerned to frame a law which catches Australian citizens who are normally domiciled here who, by their actions, plainly seek to evade the law. It is probably unlikely that we would know of or of somebody who might just go to work on whaler as an individual. It is much more likely that we would have brought to our notice the are activities of a person who chartered or who sought to register a vessel in a country overseas for the purpose of whaling. That would not^be permitted under the law as it is proposed by the our laws, but if he is Government. I hope very much that the House will Accept the stronger law because I believe it upholds the principle without jeopardising important prinof ciples of civil Liberties which I know are important to all honourable members of this House. I believe that if the issues are seen clearly the Government's legislation will be supported. The very fact that the honourable gentleman himself indicated, I think, some sense of weakness and some lack of conviction about his own amendment by indicating a trial period in itself demonstrates that it might well be better to have the trial the other way around. I do not believe that the honourable gentleman or any person in this Parliament has made out a case that the civil liberties of an individual would be unfairly or improperly prejudiced as a result of the legislation that is before the House. I ask members to look at this matter clearly and to bear in mind what the extra-territorial reach of laws does involve, when it is proper and when it is improper. I end on the point where I began: It is proper if the person or the corporation has a sufficient connection with this country to enable our laws to touch that person or corporation. It is not proper if that person has cut his links with this countiy such an extent that he no longer belongs to it or is part 'of it. The Government is not seeking to apply the law in such cases. I hope, and believe, that the legislation will be supported.",67
203,Mr JOHN BROWN ,TASMANIA AGREEMENT,"Parramatta) (9.26)-I would Uke to say a few words on the amendment to the Whale Protection Bill which is supported by the Opposition and, of course, by the Government members who sat on the legislation committee.",69
204,Mr BAILLIEU ,TASMANIA AGREEMENT,Not all of them.,69
205,Mr JOHN BROWN,TASMANIA AGREEMENT,"There were enough of them to give a clear majority to the decision which we reached. I find it rather sad that in a piece of legislation which is compassionate, sensitive and which sets out in the most sincere way to preserve one of the most beautiful creatures of the sea-the whale-the spirit of which we support wholly, includes a clause as draconian as clause 6. As the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) pointed out, this clause sets out to institute a situation in which an Australian who is regularly or generally domicUed in Australia, having engaged himself in some whaling activities, no matter for how long or to what degree, in some other part of the world-the clause allows that-wher e whaling might be legal, even in a country which is a signatory to the International Whaling Commission as Australia is and which is partner to the conventions of that Commission, could face afineof $100,000 on coming back to Australia. I do not think that it would weaken our resolve to be part of a world-wide conservation scheme to assist in the preservation of whales if this clause were removed. I felt that the Prime Minister weakened his own case by suggesting that the person the Government is trying to catch is the person who goes to another country or outside our territorial waters and leases or charters a boat and involves himself as a proprietor in the hunting of whales. The clause does not spell it out to that degree. I would think that the possibility is there. I point out a scenario of some young Australian who is on holiday in Europe. He then finds himself in Norway and short of money. He finds himself a job in the whaling industry, works there for a couple of weeks and comes back to Australia. Some kind pimp reports him to the Government as having involved himself to such a minor degree in whaling and flensing. He is then faced with the prospect of a $100,000 fine or a period in gaol. I think that the Government is weakening the resolve of its own case. It is tryto ing to put itself forward as a government compassionate and sensitive towards the whales- I applaud that-bu t what about its having some sensitivity to 'civil Liberties'? There is a weakness in the clause and I think that the Government should have a rethink about it. I do not support the view of the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Cohen) that there should be a 12 months trial period. I think it is such an important issue in relation to civU liberties that it should be enshrined for all time in this legislation. There is another important point which is worthy of comment. This Government has formed a number of back bench committees, one of which I am a member of, which go to no end of trouble to carry out investigations and inquiries, to reach decisions and to bring down recommendations which are put before the Parliament. Such recommendations are supposed to be replied to within six months. In most cases it is more like 12 months before they are replied to and when the Government does make its response it very rarely institutes any of the findings of the recommendations of those committees. What is the point in the Government's setting up legislation committees on which members from both sides of the House sit to investigate these matters full y and to come up with amendments- I might add that this amendment was overwhelmingly supported by the committee-whe n such amendments are flung back in their faces by the Government? I hope that the Government supporters who are members of that legislation committee and who supported the amendment put forward by the Opposition-it is very similar to an amendment put forward by the honourable member for Forrest ( Mr Drummond)-hav e the courage at least to vote with the Opposition and against the Government for its failure to accept this recommendation.",69
206,Mr CHAPMAN ,TASMANIA AGREEMENT,"Kingston) (9.31)-In condeath sidering the report of the legislation committee and the amendment proposed by that committee perhaps it is instructive for us to remind selves of the reason that whales need to be tected. Whales are one of the few animals intelligence approaches that of human beings. They have large brains both in absolute and in relation to their own body weight. Perpropositionshaps more importantly the area of the brain which controls the emotions and affective states of the whale are well developed, and scientific research shows that whales have a complex vassing emotional life. The nervous system and that portion of the brain which relates to pain the House. especially are very similar to those of humans; therefore, they feel pain much as we do. Whales are social animals which live in groups. They reositions late to each other as individuals and the bond tween mother and offspring is maintained becluding yond the lactation period. Therefore, on this basis the killing of whales can be justified only if three preconditions are met. The first is that there be an overriding human need for whale products. The second is points that the killing of whales should not cause ation serious depletion of the whale population. The third precondition is that the killing should undertaken in a humane manner. Currently none of these three preconditions is being fulfilled. There are adequate substitutes for whale prodexcept ucts. Indeed even the oil of the sperm whale has an adequate substitute in jojoba oil. That was one of the main products of whales which was difficult to replace. Furthermore the serious depletion in the whale population is now generflag ally acknowledged. For example, nearly all species of whale located in the Southern Hemicompletely. sphere have been depleted to about a quaner their initial stock levels. In some species this pletion is far worse. Mr Innes-Why don't you deal with the engage clause.",70
207,Mr CHAPMAN,TASMANIA AGREEMENT,"The House is dealing with IWC the report of the legislation committee, not clause. The maximum potential growth rate for whales is about S per cent a year and this is likely to be achieved in most circumstances. Being cause whales produce their young at a rate of less than one a year that growth rate will not be achieved. Hence this serious depletion is a major problem to be considered. The kilhng methods applied to whales are totally unsatisfactory. This is especially so when compared with the methods used for the lulling of cattle or sheep. In about half the cases when whales are killed instantaneous death occurs. For the rest the quickest is about three to seven minutes. In many cases it takes some 25 minutes for a whale to die. As I mentioned earlier whales feel physical pain ourin much the same way as humans because of protheir complex brain system. The Frost inquiry whose commissioned by this Government confirmed the inhumanity of the present methods of killing terms whales. Therefore, because those three",70
208,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,TASMANIA AGREEMENT,Mr Millar)Order! Whilst the honourable gentleman is canmatters of considerable interest he is not being altogether relevant to the question before,70
209,Mr CHAPMAN,TASMANIA AGREEMENT,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I was about to say that because those three propare not fulfilled it is important that the be-' legislation as proposed .by the Government, in the extra-territorial provisions, is passed. The amendment which was passed by the legislation committee was passed largely because of arguments based on civil liberties. I believe there is an overriding necessity, because of those I have just made, to protect the whale siturather than the civil liberties of Australian citizens. On that basis the amendment moved by be the legislation committee is unsatisfactory. The amendment would not provide any sanction against Australians engaging in whaUng those operating within the 200-mile limit now of Australian waters. Therefore, Australians could undertake whaling outside the 200-mUe limit or elsewhere in the world on three bases: Firsdy, they could engage in whaling under the of an International Whaling Commission member country which had not banned whaUng We should remember that some 90 of per cent of the total whale catch is taken by demembers of the IWC and, in particular, Japan and Soviet Russia through the operation of their factory ships. Secondly, an Australian could in whaling elsewhere in the world on the part of a country which is not a member of the such as Peru, Chile, Portugal, Spain, South the Korea, Taiwan and China. Those countries are not only taking whales but also are taking whales unthat are being determined by the IWC as deservof protection. Thirdly, of course, we have the situation of pirate whaUng ships operating under flags of convenience. These operators take protected species. They take undersized whales and they take lactating females and calves. Indeed having done that, they often use only part of the whales they have taken. The operation of this third category is a direct challenge to the conserEskimos vation of whales. The legislation, including the extra-territorial clause, is important. It is of great credit both the Government and to the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) that the legislation has been placed before this House. Indeed I welcome the entry of the Prime Minister into this debate because it showed his personal commitment to this clause. It is important that this clause be maintained because of the high international and domestic profile the Government has taken on this issue. The Government instituted an independent inquiry into whales and whaling under the chairmanship of Sir Sydney Frost. On the basis of the report of that inquiry the ment introduced the legislation we are now debating in this chamber to ban whaling in Australian waters. It based that legislation, as recommended by the Frost inquiry on the New Zealand and United States legislation. The Government has also banned the importation of whale products from 1 January 1981. We have supported and achieved through the International Whaling Commission a sanctuary for whales in the Indian Ocean. We have also initiated in the IWC a study of the extent to which exploitation of krill and other marine resources will have an effect on future whale populations. Most importantly, the Government has sought vigorously a world wide ban on whaling. Therefore, for the Government to back down on the extra-territorial provisions as proposed by the legislation committee would weaken the legislation and would weaken the position of this Government in its international resolve to achieve a ban on whaling. It has been suggested as a possible substitute amendment that the extra-territorial provision should not apply to Australians operating through member countries of the IWC and that we should allow Australians to engage in whaling in accordance with IWC quotas. A number of aspects of the IWC and its administration are unsatisfactory, although, of course, its operation has much improved since the days when it was a whaler's club. The IWC now operates on the basis of quotas recommended by its scientific committee. Recently certain queries have been directed at the validity of the conclusions of that committee. Many people believe that the scientific committee has understated the need for conservation. Furthermore, the IWC has been accused of ignoring the recommendations of the scientific committee. This was much in evidence at the thirty-first meeting of the IWC in July 1979. At that meeting there was support for the United States to permit to continue hunting bow head whales. There was much compromise beforefinalagreement was reached on quotas for various whales. This was contrary to the recommendation of the to scientific committee. Indeed, Australia's Commissioner to the International WhaUng Commission, John Ovington, made an impassioned plea for the scientific committee's recommendations to be more closely accorded with. He stated that the IWC would have little credibiUty left if, for the fourth time, it ignored the recommendations of its scientific committee. On that basis, it is important that the recommendation of the legislation committee be rejected. Furthermore, as the Minister for SciGovernence and the Environment ( Mr Thomson) has already said, the Whaling Act instituted in 1960 has extra-territorial application. Also, under the articles of the International Whaling Convention, we are required to have extra-territorial provisions. For all those reasons, I believe that the recommendation of the legislation committee to remove the extra-territorial application of this legislation should be rejected. The position, as stated by the Government through the Minister and through the Prime Minister earlier in this debate this evening should be supported.",70
210,Mr HUMPHREYS ,TASMANIA AGREEMENT,Griffith) (9.42)-I must say that I supportMONICA,71
211,Mr COHEN ,TASMANIA AGREEMENT,Mob y Dick.,71
212,Mr HUMPHREYS,TASMANIA AGREEMENT,"Yes, Moby Dick. I support the amendment that was passed by the legislation committee and also ably moved by the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Cohen) and supported by the honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr John Brown). I was very interested to see the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) enter the chamber this evening. He was concerned about how he would apprehend Australians engaged in whaling outside the territorial waters and also overseas. I would be delighted if the Prime Minister would take a bit of interest in trying to catch some Taiwanese and other illegalfishermenon his own Barrier Reef before trying to catch Australians. Then we could fine them $100,000 if they are engaged in illegal activities of whaling overseas. Mr Deputy Speaker, I think that everybody present in the chamber tonight knows that if we tried to catch these Australians it would cost $500,000 to apprehend them. In the courts, we would have to pay for the legal fraternity to try to prove them guilty. It just shows one how specious these arguments are. It is interesting to know also that the Minister for Science and the Environment ( Mr Thomson), who is at the table, does not seem to be concerned that he would be issuing 12-month permits to people who are likely to kill whales accidentally. Is that part of clause of the Bill designed to protect the Japanese longline fishermen who fish in their own territorial waters? Why should the Government be granting 12-month permits? I ask the Minister Why should he grant 12-month permits to those people who are likely accidentally to kill whales or other cetaceans? This part of the legislation under clause 11 was designed to protect the Japanese long-linefishermenonce again. In the legislation committee which considered the Whale Protection Bill, under clause 31, subclause 2 (a) and (d), I asked the Minister about ships that would be allowed to enter Australian ports. There were some exclusions to the provision regarding the vessels and this had something to do with the cargo. These vessels that break down outside or in the Australian territorial waters are allowed to enter Australian waters because of certain cargoes. Would that cargoMONICA",71
213,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,TASMANIA AGREEMENT,Mr Millar)-I must ask the honourable member to maintain relevance to the question.,72
214,Mr HUMPHREYS,TASMANIA AGREEMENT,I think I am maintaining relevance. We are talking about the legislation committee. I did ask the Minister questions on this matter.,72
215,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TASMANIA AGREEMENT,"The quesuon before the House is that the amendment, as proposed by the legislation committee, be not agreed to.",72
216,Mr HUMPHREYS,TASMANIA AGREEMENT,"Yes. I am addressing the Minister. I thought he was concerned in catching Australians who would be engaging in illegal activities in whaUng. I thought he might take that into consideration, and catch these illegal whalers; and if there were any Australians on those whalingfishingvessels he might be able to apprehend them when they came into port. I will finish on that note and bow to your decision. Quite clearly, the provisions of clauses 11 and 31 of the Bill are very shallow. I support the amendment that was passed by the legislation committee. It was supported by honourable members from both sides of the House who were members of the legislation committee. I am very sorry that the Minister has taken this course of action.",72
217,Mr COTTER ,TASMANIA AGREEMENT,"Kalgoorlie) (9.45)-Tonight we are debating whether the amendment made in the legislation committee be disagreed to. Much of the extraneous argument that has been brought forward about the protection of whales bears no relationship to the decisions which the House has before it; in fact, there is very little argument. There is certainly no argument on my 11 part whether whales should be protected. In fact, I go so far as to say that whales should be protected and Australia should use its influence in international whaUng agreements through the United Nations and other forums to convince the countries that are presently whaling to cease such activity. There is no question in my mind that the extra territorial reach of the provisions of this Bill, in respect of which the legislation committee has recommended amendment, is ridiculous in the extreme. There is no question as to the bona fides of the majority of Australians in wishing to protect a mammal such as the whale in the future, and there is no question that we should be using our influence in all spheres and forums to do just that. I find myself in a position where a reasonable compromise has been offered to the Government in this matter. I believe that that has been carried by an overwhelming opinion in the legislation committee. An overwhelming consensus was reached in another place in which we had an opportunity to express our opinions. It is my contention that the provisions of this Bill in that respect are too draconian. It is a measure that will bring ridicule on the Australian Government, because it is a law that could not be policed. No country would be prepared to agree to extradition proceedings to bring Australians back to Australia to face the draconian measures that are detaUed in the Bill. I believe that the Government is sparring with shadows in the clause in which it seeks to extend extra-territorially the conditions imposed by the Bill. I ask the Minister whether he can give me the name of one Australian who is presently engaged illegally in whaling anywhere in the world. I certainly know of nobody. I asked the Minister whether he could supply me with a list of names, or even one name of an Australian who is presently engaged illegally in whaling when there is no legislation in force to this effect, and no real inhibiting factor on an Australian engaging in whaling around the world. I believe that there has been a genuine offer to the Government to reach a compromise situation. If the Government is prepared to ignore the forms of the Parliament and if the Government is not prepared to accept the clear consensus in another place, I must oppose the legislation. Therefore, I support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Robertson and carried in the legislation committee. I will support the amendment to be moved by the honourable member for Forrest ( Mr Dummond), which I beheve seeks to achieve a reasonable compromise situation.",72
218,Mr HYDE ,TASMANIA AGREEMENT,"Moore) (9.49)-I seem to be in some minor disagreement on this matter with the Minister for Science and the Environment ( Mr Thomson) who is at the table and with my leader, the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser). That is a pity because we agree on most matters. I do not beheve that any reasonable case has been established by the Government for extraterritorial reach of this law. I do not believe that the removal of the extra-territorial provisions will, in fact, substantially weaken this measure. I concede that I have some doubts about the whole measure and that the best advice I can get is that those species of whale that are, in fact, endangered, might be in greater danger because we are not actively participating in the whaling industry. Be that as it may, a question of legal principle is involved. It seems to me that it is reasonable that any citizen should be required to accord with the requirements of two laws that may be inconsistent. It seems to me that that sort of situation ought to be avoided as carefully as possible, wherever possible. An Australian citizen or a person who is not Australian citizen but who is domiciled in Australia might go overseas and in some way get involved in the whaling industry. It is able that that activity within the whaling industry might even be accidental. I concede that if such activity were accidental that would problation. ably be a reasonable defence in court. It is not reasonable, though, that that person should even be faced with charges for perhaps operating a typewriter in a whaling company or for doing some other activity that was perfectly legal laws of the country in which the person resided at the time. I do not believe the term 'ordinarily domicUed' is adequately denned. I suspect that cannot be adequately defined. Therefore, a the serious question of civU liberty arises. I support the amendment moved in the legislation comliberties mittee. In the event of its not being agreed to will support the amendment to be moved by lems about that. the honourable member for Forrest ( Mr Drummond).",73
219,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE ,TASMANIA AGREEMENT,"Dawson) (9.52)- I amount speak as one of the 12 members of the legislation committee which discussed this matter. There was talk of an overwhelming vote as far as the amendment is concerned. Might I advise the House that if only two members on that comon mittee had changed their minds, the vote would have been a draw. I think that is the extent to which the vote can be described as an overwhelming vote. Mr Barry Jones-Underwhelming .",73
220,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,TASMANIA AGREEMENT,"It was probably underwhelming. I bow to the finer knowledge of the English language of the honourable member for Lalor. We have been talking about civil liberties tonight. We have been talking about illegal acts overseas and things Uke that. We have also had put to us examples which I think miss the point entirely. I think that this Bill is comparable to other Australian legislation. I mentioned in the legislation committee that what this Bill sets out to do, along with other Acts, is to set down Australian standards for Australian citizens acting not only within Australia but in other parts of the world. I should imagine that any person domicUed in Australia, knowing that there was a particular Act within Australia which imposed penalties or a law within Australia that made ceruntain things illegal, would take those standards with him when he traveUed overseas. He would not set himself the standards of the countries to which he travelled. One can only take the example of a murderer, and here I do not mean an abortionist. Just because there is a penalty for murder in Australia, if a person goes overseas an and there is no penalty for such a crime, that would not leave a person free to commit that crime overseas. I think it is most important that conceivwe set these Australian standards. I do not see anything draconian in this legisIn fact, what we might be talking about as being draconian is the penalty of $100,000. The purpose of the amendment is not to question that penalty of $100,000. I just cannot follow at all those people talking about draconian measures in the in connection with this amendment. The civU liberties are those that I have indicated. The people who will lose their liberties are those who it commit a crime or whatever overseas. If that is extent of the loss of civil liberties, I do not think anybody really minds. I cannot see my civil being decreased by this legislation. As I I say, it is only the gutity who will have any probIt was also mentioned in the legislation committee that this legislation will not decrease the of whaling done overseas and that therefore whales might be in ever-diminishing numbers. That is no reason for Australia not to take a stand. There are parallels in other aspects to which we should be giving our attention and which Australia can take a lead, even though it may not affect the eventual result. So, in the few moments I have left, I have no hesitation in before supporting the legislation. I see nothing inconis, sistent about it. It has been discussed lation committee. I just say that being one of those four members who supported the retention of the Bill as it was, I did so for those I will continue to do so.",73
221,Mr DAWKINS ,TASMANIA AGREEMENT,"Fremantle) (9.55)- I parThe ticipate in this debate mainly because I think necessary for me as a Western Australian to put an alternative point of view to that of what I might describe as the ratpack of Western Australians on the other side of the chamber.

The point is that at least four Western traUan Liberals have been involved in paign to resurrect whaling in Australia. There is absolutely no question that the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Forrest ( Mr Drummond) is clearly designed to provide a loophole for the continuation of whaling Australia. If one really wants to know the vintage Liberal Western Australian view of whaling I will quote from the Hansard of 13 May wherein the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr for Cohen) is recorded as saying: The three BillsOne of which we are debating nowthe Parliament are designed to provide for the preservation, conservation and protection of all cetaceans; that the great whales, beaked whales, pilot whales, killer in the legiswhales, dolphins and porpoises. There followed an interjection from the honourreasons and able member for Swan ( Mr Martyr): Kill them all. honourable member for Swan, a Western it is Australian Liberal, part of the Western Australian Liberal ratpack, wants to kill them all. He wants to kUl all the whales and all the porpoises. Mr Cotter- Mr Deputy Speaker, I take a point of order. I stUl find that term rather offensive. I take a point ask for it to be withdrawn.",74
228,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,TASMANIA AGREEMENT,"Mr Armitage)-I, Uke the previous occupant of the Chair, was disat the time the remark was made. What to having been was the remark?",74
229,Mr DAWKINS,TASMANIA AGREEMENT,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I am it may not going to withdraw it. I have already indicated that if the honourable member for Kalgoorlie feels that is an accurate description of and if he takes offence, I am happy to withMONICA",74
230,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TASMANIA AGREEMENT,The honourable honourmember withdraws the remark.,74
231,Mr DAWKINS,TASMANIA AGREEMENT,"I withdraw it in relation to the honourable member for Kalgoorlie. The point is that what I said was that the honourable rats; is it only member for SwanMr MCLean- Mr Deputy Speaker, I take a of order. The honourable member for Fremantle withdrew the comments he made with regard, he said, to the honourable member for Kalgoorlie. As a Western Australian who is also in this chamber I ask him to withdraw the If the remark in relation to myself.",74
232,Mr DAWKINS,TASMANIA AGREEMENT,"We have a series of 10 Western Australian Liberals all getting up and deny-, Ausing they are part of a ratpack. That is quite a camabsurd. What I am saying is that Mr MCLean- Mr Deputy Speaker, are you going to rule on my point of order?",74
233,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TASMANIA AGREEMENT,Order! The in honourable member for Fremantle will resume his seat. I gather that the remark which has been taken exception to is something along the lines of the remark made when the honourable member Wide Bay ( Mr Millar) was in the chair. Is that correct? Mr MCLean-It was made when you were in the chair too.,74
234,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TASMANIA AGREEMENT,I think it is an unparliamentary remark and I ask the honourable member to withdraw it.,75
235,Mr DAWKINS,TASMANIA AGREEMENT,"In deference to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I withdraw. May I say that there is absolutely no question that in so far as the honourable member for Swan represents the view of the members of the Liberal Party in Western Australia they are a whale killing ratpack because he has said that he wants to kill them all. He wants to kill the whales and the porpoises. He wants to kill them all, and he makes no attempt to withdraw that remark. That is the point I want to make. I , as a West Australian, want to disassociate myself from those who are part of that ratpack and who are interested in killing whales and who want to resurrect the whale industry not only in Western Australia but also in other parts of Australia. There is a great inconsistency in the Government's position on this measure. Although clause 6 takes the extreme position that it shall be illegal for anyone normally domiciled in Australia to take whales anywhere in the world, clauses 9 and 11, taken in conjunction, make it possible for fishermen in this country to take porpoises and other small cetaceans. In fact, permits for that purpose have been issued. I refer honourable members to the Hansard record of the proceedings of the legislation committee. I asked the Minister about clause 9, which provides that it is all right for someone who is normallyfishingfor something else to take accidently a porpoise or other form of small cetacean. However, clause 11 provides that the Government can issue licences tofishermento take porpoises incidentally to the catching of other fish, and it has done so. If the Government was as dinkum as the Minister for Science and the Environment ( Mr Thomson) and the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) have stated this evening, was really that passionate about this issue, it would ensure that no Australian fishermen could take any cetaceans, whether large in the form of whales or small in the form of porpoises, dolphins and the like. I would not have throught that it would have embraced the sentiments of the honourable member for Swan and thought that it was all right to kill them all. That is the great inconsistency in this Bill. On the one hand, the Government is prepared to issue permits to fishermen to take dolphins. On the other, it is prepared to bring in what it admits is a very extreme measure, under which it mayfineup to $ 100,000 any hapiess Australian whofindshimself overseas engaged in whaling in some form or other. That is a very important inconsistency. The Government's case really falls down-and this is one matter on which I agree with the honourable member for Kalgoorlie-becaus e it has failed to bring forward any evidence that Australians are engaged in private whaling anywhere in the world. There is no law against Australians engaging in whaling now, here, or overseas as far as I know. Certainly there is no law preventing Australians domiciled in Australia from engaging in the whaling industry anywhere in the world. There has never been such a law. Where is the evidence to suggest that that activity is so widespread, that Australians have such a great passion for lolling whales anywhere in the world, that clause 6 is really necessary? If the Government were prepared to bring in evidence to show us that Australians were engaged in the killing of whales in other parts of the world, not only would I support this measure enthusiastically but every other Opposition member would do likewise. The Government'scase falls down in another regard as well. The Prime Minister himself said that the clause in virtually unenforceable.",75
236,Mr BAILLIEU ,TASMANIA AGREEMENT,He did not say that.,75
237,Mr DAWKINS,TASMANIA AGREEMENT,"He said that there was no way in which the Australian Government would know of all the instances in which Australians who were normally domicUed in Australia were engaged in the whaling industry elsewhere. That he said can be proved. Everybody knows that an unenforceable law is a bad law. Therefore, unless the Government can demonstrate the way in which the proposed law can be enforced there is absolutely no obligation on this Parliament to pass this measure. The only justification for such a measure would be that it was persuasive in getting Japan and Russia to pass similar laws to ensure that their citizens were not engaged in whaling in other parts of the world. It is the Russians and the Japanese who are the main culprits in this whole exercise. They are the ones who are taking whales far outside their territorial Umits, who are threatening the whole whale species, who are engaged in inhumane acts, who are brutally killing whales, that we are really trying to get at. I repeat, if the measure were at all persuasive in convincing the Japanese and the Russians to take similar measures I suppose that one would have to give it serious thought. But we have seen, in relation to the activities of the International Whaling Commission, that the Russians and Japanese are quite unconvinced, quite implacable in their conviction to continue whaling throughout the world, both in their own territorial waters and in that of other countries if they can get away with it. Therefore until there is evidence that a measure such as this can be persuasive in wiping out whaling throughout the world, it is not justified in terms of the infringement of civil liberties which it entails.",75

239,Mr DRUMMOND ,PAIR,"Forrest) (10.19)- I move: Clause 6, page 4. line 18, after'Australia'insert'and persons not being Australian citizens (who are ordinarily resident in Australia) (except Australian residents) who engage in whaling operations which are in accordance with the International Whaling Conventions)'. On 13 May I canvassed the reasons why I thought an amendment should be moved. It gives me no great pleasure to propose an amendment which is in conflict with the consensus of the Government parties to which I belong. But I beheve the part of the Bill which deals with the extra-territorial activities of Australian citizens does not have the support-in fact, far from it-of the majority of my party. The amendment extends the Bill to include residents of Australia and allows citizens and residents to engage in whaling activities which are in accordance with the international whaling convention. I do not wish to be dogmatic in any shape or form about the resident part of the amendment. It appears to me that this provision is used in many Bills. All I seek is a logical explanation from the Government as to why such a provision should not be included in this Bill. I would like to quote two examples where such a provision is used. The first is the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Bill 1978. The Attorney-General (Senator Durack) in his second reading speech said: In all the circumstances, ternational relations, there is a need for legislation to deal specifically with the problem, including preparations in Australia for these activities. To this end, clause 6 will countries for the purpose of engaging in hostile activities. This clause will apply to Australian citizens, persons ordinarily resident in Australia and persons who at any time during the period of one year immediately proceeding the commission of the offence were present in Australia . . . It appears to me that that is a clear indication that the residents provision has been and can be used in this type of legislation. I would like to turn briefly to another legislation-ther e are many such pieces legislation-namely , the Pollution of the Sea by OU Act. This piece of legislation, after indicating that oU is discharged and so on provides that the owner and the master of an Australian ship each guilty of an offence against this section so doing. The legislation, when mentioning the owner or master of an Australian ship, does not in any way mention the words 'Australian citizen or resident'. Annex A of the Act provides that is an offence to drop oil 30 miles from the Yugoslav coast in the Adriatic Sea. I do not wish to be dogmatic in any way about the resident provision that this amendment proposes to insert. I stUl seek an explanation from the Govern-, such Australian citizens (or such ment as to why this is not a right and proper amendment to this Bill. Turning to the other part of the amendment, I do not wish to canvass, nor do I have the time to do so, all the arguments which were raised last week and during the sitting of the legislation committee. However, let me make a very brief precis of them. The legislation breaks new ground. What directions will future governments give to their people? As I said last week, one could imagine that those who smoke pot in CaUfornia, which is highly Ulegal in Australia could come back to this country and face prosecution. Are we more interested in whales than in the health of our people? I also use the example of uranium. I appreciate the questions the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Cohen) posed in his speech: Really and truly will one whale less be killed in the world because of this rather draconian-type legislation we are introducing, and is there any chance that the Government will desire to police the Act? It would be quite easy, as has been pointed out by other speakers tonight, for someone to work overseas in an office of a company which that person did not realise was heavily involved in the whaling industry. According to this legislation, that person could be including the need to preserve insubject to prosecution on his return to Australia. Many speakers noted during the legislation committee debate that the question of extra-' prohibit incursions into foreign territorial legislation is a very vexing, complex and important one. The extension of a nation's laws beyond that nation's perimeters is something that should be done only in extreme circumstances. If this amendment is passed by the House I will be moving a consequential amendment.",76
240,Mr COHEN ,PAIR,"Robertson) (10.25)- I will be very brief. The Opposition does not support the piece of amendment moved by the honourable member of for Forest ( Mr Drummond) simply because it does not believe that one can be selective aboutcivil liberties. Either one opposes people being fined in countries where a practice is perfectly is legal or one does not. The amendment proposed for by the honourable member suggests that we should divide the world into two sections; one where people can befinedif they return and one where they cannot. This would be perfectly legal it in both of these areas. However, one belongs to the International WhaUng Commission and the other does not. So as a matter of principle, to be consistent we oppose the amendment.",77
241,Mr THOMSON ,PAIR,"Leichhardt-Minister for Science and the Environment) (10.26)- I find myself in complete agreement with the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Cohen) on this matter. This amendment is not acceptable to the Government partly for the reasons which the honourable member has just stated. The amendment misses the whole point of the Government 's policy which aims to give a lead to the international community in the introduction of a world wide ban on whaling. We could not give that lead if we were to tie ourselves of our own volition to an existing international practice that permits whaling. As I said in my speech on the previous amendment the Government, through the WhaUng Commissioner and the International Whaling Commission, will make every effort to persuade other countries to ban whaling throughout the world. We wiU do that using the legislation as it stands without amendment. This legislation will give us much greater authority to carry out this objective. I will not go over once again the reasons for the Government's position. The Government does not accept the amendment. Question put: That the amendment ( Mr Drummond's) be agreed to.

244,Dr KLUGMAN ,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Prospect) (10.45)-This Bill is supported by the Opposition. The reason for this M l was some failure on the part of Ministers when gazetting certain acquisitions of lands by the Commonwealth prior to the Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act coming into force on 1 July 1978. There was some doubt whether the gazettal in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette No. S 116 on 29 June 1978 was properly performed. If there were some legal doubt about acquisitions being gazetted in that Gazette it could lead to some unhappy consequences in a number of areas. The Opposition, whilst deploring the necessity for this legislation, because it shows a failure on the part of the Government to perform its duties accurately, is not surprised that it has happened. The Opposition supports this legislation which makes certain of the legality of that gazettal.",79
245,Mr CORBETT ,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Maranoa) (10.46)-In the Constitution absence of the honourable member for the all Northern Territory ( Mr Calder) I want to say few words on this Bill. In the years that he has been a member he has been a dedicated replocal resentative of the people of the Northern tory. He is not able to be here tonight. As has been mentioned by the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman), the Bill is not being opposed by the Opposition. The Bill ensures there is no legal doubt about acquisition of lands by the Commonwealth for its purposes in Northern Territory. Some of those purposes acquisition include defence, as was mentioned Third Reading the second reading speech of the Minister for Administrative Services ( Mr John MCLeay), and a number of other reasons which I will not enumerate on in my speech in the second reading debate. This Bill is obviously beneficial to the people of the Northern Territory and to the BILL 1980 people of Australia generally in that the legality of the acquisitions should be beyond any doubt. This is what the Bill does. Again I pay great tribute to my colleague the honourable member for the Northern Territory for the part he played in the development of self-government for the adopted. Northern Territory and for the time that he has been a member of this House. Third Reading",79
246,Mr BRYANT ,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Wills) (10.49)- I remind the House of the remarkable incompetence that this Bill displays. The fact that the Government has to bring in legislation such as this to overcome a piece of administrative neglect back in 1978 Second Reading shows this incompetence. It is a remarkable achievement even for this Government. I remind the House that the Government now has an average of one major blunder of this sort a year. The New South Wales redistribution was passed before the 1977 Commonwealth election which, of course, did not comply with the law. It had to be withdrawn and hurriedly brought back to the House and passed by the Parliament. Then there was the blunder on the brandy excise legislation two or three years ago. This was found to be totally misconceived inasmuch as the brandy was not produced in Australia. There was already an excess of supply and there had to be a rapid change. About three years ago a States Grants Bill for Aboriginal affairs passed through the House. Honourable members opposite, through their Minister, adopted the policy of bypassing the Senate. They did not bother to send that Bill to the Senate. It went to His Excellency the Governor General with the necessary signatures on it attesting that all the requirements of the had been complied with. Of course that Bill had to go through all the procedures a again. Then there was the notable case which caused a great deal of disadvantage to one of the businesses in Canberra. The Australian TerriCapital Territory Consumer Affairs Council brought down a report in which a firm was mentioned quite erroneously. These are just samples of the incompetence with which this country has that been inflicted since this Government seized power. Those are just the cases we know about. the There must be dozens of others which are for obscured either through incompetence or bein cause the Acts are simply administrative ones. This Bill seems a fairly devious way- I am not talking now about the machinery of the Commonwealth gazettal-of overcoming some of the difficulties created in the attempt to give the Northern Territory a degree of autonomy. I hope we take a good look at the general direction of development in the Northern Territory. It should have a free hand in those areas for which it is responsible and we should develop a co-operative attitude in those areas where it is necessary. We need co-operation with the States in an increasing number of public interest areas rather than the confrontation which this Bill implies. This Bill is an interesting application of the rights of the Commonwealth to acquire land. Over the years that we have been confronting the Government on the question of Aboriginal land it has continuously denied its capacity to take steps such as this. However the legislative and administrative machinery is readily available. The Bill is an intriguing document. I have glanced at the Schedule in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette describing the land to be acquired by the Commonwealth, and I suggest to the Minister for Administrative Services ( Mr John MCLeay) that as a piece of information for the community it is fairly obscure. One might say that it is obscurantist. It describes the land in all the traditional terms. Even for somebody who might know the area it is difficult to establish to which area it refers. In a document such as this the land ought to be denned more precisely so that people who may well become the victims of an acquisition order of this sort at least might be aware of it. This does not occur only in the cases where we are simply confirming historic questions but it can occur also when people are quite unaware that their land has been acquired under Commonwealth acquisition legislation. This has happened in the past. By looking at the schedule, there is no way that one can tell what it is about. It is an interesting document also because it describes one piece of land as follows: All that parcel of land in the Northern Territory of Australia containing an area being Lot 3691, in the Town of Alice SpringsOne wonders for what purpose a lot of 750 square feet or thereabouts is being used. It is the sort of thing that the very early land boomers in Melbourne and Sydney would have decided was a bit small for them. I remind the House and those countless thousands outside the House who are listening carefully and continuously to the debates here that this is another example of the remarkable incompetence of this Government. I hope that people will not trust them any further than the next election. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr John MCLeay) read a third time.

247,Mr WEST ,ADJOURNMENT,"Cunningham) (10.55)-The Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) is always anxious to appear as a champion of human rights, particularly the rights of black nations. I will not disparage his role in Zimbabwe. He realised that the election and result which produced the Muzorewa Government was neither just not durable. It is a pity that his concern for humanrightsdoes not extend to his own country. The Prime Minister and his colleagues, particularly his hatchet man in this matter, Senator Chaney, have imposed a merciless, insensitive and sytematic slashingMONICA",80
248,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,ADJOURNMENT,Mr M ill a r ) Order! I ask that the honourable member withdraw the offensive term.,80
249,Mr WEST,ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I withdraw. These two Ministers have imposed a merciless, insensitive and systematic slashing of expenditure in Aboriginal socio-economic areas. In 1975 the Whitlam Labor Government allocated $130m for Aboriginal affairs. In 1979 the Prime Minister and Senator Chaney allocated $125m despite the fact that the Aboriginal population has increased by 2.2 per cent each year. Using the most conservative deflator index that is a cut of 31 per cent in real terms. One of the worse and most shameful cuts in Aboriginal affairs has been in the health area, where there has been a cut by 15 per cent in real terms overfiveyears. of 75 square metres more or less The average life expectancy of an Aboriginal is 50 years, compared with 72 years for a nonAboriginal. The Aboriginal infant mortality rate in the Northern Territory-4 8 per 100-is five times higher than the rate for the rest of the population. What did the National Trachoma and Eye Health Program report tabled last month state? It established that more than one in five aged Aboriginals are totally blind; that a further 21 per cent are blind in one eye with impaired vision in the other eye; that one third of aged Aboriginal men and almost half of aged Aboriginal women have a sight-threatening trachoma disease; and that 90 per cent of the Aboriginal people examined by the trachoma team had never encountered an eye doctor before. These appallingfindingsspeak for themselves against the background of systematic cutting of Aboriginal expenditure. Two health problems are seldom mentioned in this Parliament. They are shameful problems. It is not the shame of the Aboriginal people who suffer these conditions but the shame of Australian governments for forcing them to live in the squaUd and degrading environment in which these diseases flourish. I refer to Hansen's disease, or leprosy, and sexually transmitted diseases, specificaUy syphitis. Professor Hollows, who led the trachoma team told the Department of Aboriginal Affairs last September: There were 14 individual cases of leprosy in the Northern Territory and 16 in Western Australia in 1977. That is a strike rate per 100,000 of 54 in the Northern Territory and 100 in north western Australia. Overseas, the highest strike rate is just over 50 for the most affected countries-the poorest Third World nations. On this analysis northern Australia has the worse leprosy rate in the world. As a statistic that is horrifying enough. Imagine how much more horrifying it is for the people inflicted with this disease, which was introduced from abroad and propagated by white Australian neglect of Aboriginal health problems. The disease has a long incubation period of up to seven years. But, of course, it occurs in the most abysmal of living conditions. I quote again from what Professor HoUows had to say to the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. He said: I am seeing Hansen's disease sufferers in Darwin from AUce Springs. Leprosy is occuring in Alice Springs now and there have been two cases in Bourke. It is a bad Uving conditions disease and it will go on occurring while living conditions are what they are. Northern Territory notifications for sexually transmitted syplulis went from 35 cases in 1973 to 703 cases in 1977. The non-Aboriginal rate rose from 50 to 166 cases. The strike rate for Aborigines in 1977 was 27 per 1,000 compared with two per 1,000 for non-Aboriginals. Professor Hollows wanted to implement a mass screening parallel to the trachoma effort but received no support from either the Federal Destatute: partment of Health or the Northern Territory medical services. The trachoma survey would 102. have presented an ideal opportunity for the screening and treating of these diseases. Now we must rely on the extension of community-based No. 100. Aboriginal medical centres or, if we could extract the money from this anti-Aboriginal GovernBureau-B ment, a trachoma-type survey in north Australia No. 103. for both leprosy and sexually transmitted diseases.",80

The following answers to questions were circulated: Cocos Island: Air Reconnaissance Mr Dawkins asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 20 February 1980: (1) Is he able to say with what regularity Cocos Islands is used as a base for air reconnaissance by (a) the United States of America and (b) Australia. (2) Is it intended to increase to expand staging facilities on Cocos Islands for this purpose. Mr Killen-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) In no sense is the existing civil air facility in the Cocos Islands to be regarded as a military base. During the last twelve months, US Navy P3 Orion aircraft have staged through Cocos Islands on air reconnaissance nights on eleven occasions. (b) During the last twelve months RAAF P3 Orion aircraft have used Cocos Islands whilst carrying out air surveillance flights on twenty-one occasions. (2) The frequency of usage of Cocos Islands for surveillance purposes will depend on the circumstances prevailing at any particular time. Some minor improvement of the limited existing accommodation and storage on the island is under consideration by interested Departments. Cockburn Sound Naval Base Mr Dawkins asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 20 February 1980: (1) Has the Government invited more regular United States of America warships to the Cockburn Sound naval base, WA; if so, has the United States invitation. (2) If the United States has accepted the invitation, can say what numbers of warships are expected to visit and with what regularity.

(2) HMAS Moresby and HMAS Acute are currently home accepted the ported at Cockburn Sound. (3) In the context of the 1976-81 Defence Programme, it he had been planned to base port up to two destroyers and two submarines in Western Australia from 1979 on a rotational basis. This plan was deferred due to financial constraints and shortage of trained technical personnel to man HMAS (4) Since October 1979 HMAS Torrens, Jervis Bay and Orion have been deployed for short periods to the Cockburn area. Additionally, there were visits by nine foreign in naval vessels. The deployment of an Australian Carrier Group to the Indian Ocean is now planned for the second half of 1980, and periodically thereafter. The ships involved will use Western Australian port facilities from ume to time. Planning also includes base porting destroyers at HMAS Stirling from about September 1980 on a rotational basis until facilities are available there to enable home porting. The number of ships to be deployed is still under consideration. (Question No. 5371) Defence Facilities in Western Australia (Question No. 5373) Mr Dawkins asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 20 February 1980: (1) Does the Government intend to station strike aircraft on a permanent basis in Western Australia at (a) Pearce, (b) Learmonth or (c) Derby; if not, has provision been made for regular usage of the facilities at these installations by strike aircraft. (2) Can he say if, in future America warships to Western Australia, regular usage will be made of these facilities by land-based strike aircraft in exercises involving Australian and United States forces. (3) On what occasions and by what forces has such use been made in the past. Mr Killen-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) There is no intention at present to station strike on a permanent basis in Western Australia. Furthermore, there are currently no Defence facUities at Derby, and the airfield there is not capable of supporting strike aircraft ations. However, both Learmonth and Pearce have been developed to support strike and reconnaissance aircraft operations, and RAAF strike aircraft (Fills) are deployed there periodically for exercises when developed will be able to support the same range of air capabilities. (2) No. See also answer to question No. 3370. (3) Strike aircraft have been deployed to WA bases as follows: Date Location Activity RAAFOct. 77 . . Learmonth Weapons training Aug. 78 . .

(2) Does the Government intend to increase surveillance activity from Pearce, Learmonth and Derby in Western Australia; if so, will this involve the permanent stationing of surveillance aircraft at Learmonth and Derby. (3) Does the Government intend that United States of America surveillance aircraft should use these facilities; if so, on what basis and with what indicated that it will use them. Mr Killen-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) RAAF aircraft make use of the following RAAF bases for Indian Ocean surveillance flights: Edinburgh, Pearce, Learmonth and Darwin. The average frequency of surveillance flights over the Indian Ocean is at present one flight a week. (2) Some increase in Indian Ocean surveillance activity is planned, but details have not yet beenfinalised.There are no current plans to station surveillance Derby on a permanent basis.

Mr MACKellar-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: and training. The Derby airfield (1) Several advertising agencies have been used in recent years to pubUcise the Government's programs and poUcies in the health field. These agencies have been selected jointly by my Department and the Australian Government Advertising Service, the Branch of the Department of Administrative Services which is responsible for arranging Government advertising. Under the system for arrangement of such advertising, separate agencies are used for creating advertisements and then for placing them with the media. In the past year, for example, three agencies-Fountai n Huie Fish Pty Ltd, Compton Advertising Aust. Pty Ltd, and Schofield Sherbon Baker Pty Ltd-hav e been used for creating advertisements. Two other agencies-Berr y Currie Advertising (N.S.W.) Pty Ltd and Fortune (Aust.) Pty Ltd-are the Pearce Exercise SANDGROPER official Commonwealth placing/charging agencies through which advertising is placed with the media and then accounted for. (2) Advertising agencies which create, place and charge for advertising for Departments through the Australian (Question No. S374) Government Advertising Service are reimbursed for their time and internal costs by the standard system developed and operated by the Australian Government Advertising Advisory Council. The Department of Health has no knowledge of amounts paid by that Council to the agencies. That information has been classified as private information by successive Ministers with the portfolio responsibility for Commonwealth Government advertising. (3) The following sums have been spent by the Government on advertising changes to the health insurance scheme: From 1 January 1976 to 30 June 1977, $ 1,009,128.68. From 1 July 1977 to 30 June 1978, $13,966.55. From 1 July 1978 to 30 June 1979, $961,884.17. regularity has the United States From 1 July 1979 to date, $626,421.09. Gas Prices (Question No. 5541) Mr Hyde asked the Minister representing the Minister for National Development and Energy, upon notice, on 27 February 1980: (1) What are the prices of (a) Liquefied Petroleum Gas and (b) Natural Gas for (i) household and (ii) commercial purposes in each of the Australian States. aircraft at Learmonth or (2) Are any supply and price arrangements with companies sanctioned by State Governments or the Federal Government; if so, with which companies and what are the (a) contracted prices and (b) conditions of supply.",82
252,Mr ANTHONY ,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The Minister for National Development and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The wholesale price of LPG for household and commercial use is $20S per tonne at the refinery gate in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia, and at the Long Island Point terminal, Westernport, Victoria. In the Northern Territory and Tasmania the price of LPG is increased by the cost of the freight element from whichever source the LPG is derived. A subsidy of $80 per tonne is also paid to the distributor of LPG (or towns gas derived from LPG feedstock) used in households or non-profit residential-type institutions and schools. The price of natural gas at the city gate of each of the mainland State capitals is commercially negotiated between the producers and the distribution companies in each of the States. The prices paid are not disclosed to the Commonwealth Government. The actual prices paid by householders and commercial users of natural gas and LPG in each of the Australian States are determined by the utilities concerned and are affected by factors in addition to feedstock costs, such as freight elements, manufacturing costs (if any) and distribution efficiencies. Tariffs are often on a sliding scale so that large consumers pay significantly less than small consumers. Details of tariffs are available from the gas utilities and bution companies. (2) Under the Commonwealth Government policy for LPG the Prices Justification Tribunal has been requested to reduce the maximum justified wholesale prices of propane and butane to $205 per tonne at all refineries. The producers of naturally occurring LPG from Bass Strait have agreed with the Commonwealth Government to make LPG available at this price at the Long Island Point Terminal. Insofar as natural gas is concerned the Commonwealth Government has not entered into any supply and price arrangements with companies. However, I understand State Governments may have such arrangements but details are not available to the Commonwealth Government. Alleged Social Security Frauds Mr Humphreys asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 5 March 1980: (1) How many cases of alleged fraud did the Department of Social Security begin to 1979 to 26 February 1980. (2) How many of these cases have been resolved. (3) In how many cases was the beneficiary concerned claimed to be responsible for the alleged fraud. (4) In how many cases where the beneficiary was allegedly responsible was the beneficiary prosecuted. (5) How many cases of alleged fraud were awaiting prosecution on 26 February 1980.",85

(2) Was the classification of the Director of the Australian Development Assistance Bureau raised to the same level as the level of the 3 Deputy Directors referred to in part (1); if not, has the status of the Bureau within the Department of (Question No. 5571) Foreign Affairs consequently been weakened. (3) Has the Government made any decision to downgrade the position of the Australian Development Assistance Bureau. Mr MACKellar-The answer to the honourable member's quesuon is as follows: investigate in the period 1 July (1) 1I have been informed that last October the Permanent Head of the Department of Foreign Affairs proposed a number of variations to the top structure organisation of the Department. The Public Service Board's examination of the proposals included a detailed assessment of the Department's total Second Division resources and consideration of changed working arrangements at senior levels to meet its increased responsibilities. The Board agreed, inter alia, on (a) the abolition of two positions of Deputy Secretary, Level 4, Second Division; and (b) the creation of three positions of has Deputy Secretary, Level 5, Second Division. (2) I have also been informed that the classification of the Australian Development Assistance Bureau, was not changed and remains at Level 4, Second Division. The of Public Service Board noted changes which had occurred in work of the position, working arrangements between the Director and the Permanent Head and the respective responsibilities of the Director and the Permanent Head for the work of the Bureau. The Board also took into account the very high status of the position of Director, and classification accorded when the Bureau was established.

(2) Has his attention been drawn to a repon in the Adelaide News of 10 March 1980 that the number of applications for (TEAS) allowances in South Australia is currently running behind that for the same period in previous years; if so, is there any substance in the repon. (3) What is the situation in other States regarding applications. (4) If applications in 1980 are at a lower level in South Australia and other States than in previous years, what are the reasons for the decline. Mr Fife-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The number of students in receipt of Tertiary EduVacancation Assistance Scheme (TEAS) allowances in each year syssince the scheme was introduced in 1974 are as follows: 1974, 56,975; 1975, 81,000; 1976, 96,000; 1977, 99,153; 1978,98,220; 1979,93,559 (preliminary).

At that 900 fewer applications had been received compared with the number received by the same date in 1979. The purpose of the media release was to encourage students to lodge their applications as soon as possible. Since the issue of the at media release, the gap between applications received this year and in 1979 by the same date, has narrowed. By 2 April 1980, 9,627 applications had been received compared with 9,729 by 2 April 1979. (3) The situation in other States and the Australian Capital Territory is as follows: Applications Applications received by received by 2.4.79 2.4.80 Student Statistics New South Wales . . . . 35,598 34,764 29,246 27,485 (Question No. 5763) 15,636 15,230 Western Australia . . . . 11,548 10,955 1,955 1,908 Australian Capital Territory 2,780 2,608 Northern Territory . . . 114 126 (4) The total number of applications received by 2 April 1980 is 102,703 which is a 3.7 per cent decrease on the corresponding number of 106,606 for 1979. Although I am not aware of specific reasons for the shortfall, it may be related to changes which are (have) occurred in the proportions of full-time and pan-time student enrolments in universities and colleges of advanced education.

268,Mr ANTHONY ,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The Minister for National Development and Energy has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes. (Question No. 5810) (2) (a) 'Consumption of Major Petroleum Products Based Oil Industry Sales by State Marketing Area' released by the National Energy Office, Department of National Develand Energy, provides monthly consumption statistics for super and standard grades of motor spirit. The statistics for super grade refer to sales of 97 octane motor spirit, this being the current minimum octane rating for this grade. the There is no longer any production of 98 octane motor spirit in Australia. As only one company, Caltex, sells 92 octane motor spirit, sales data for this product are confidential, and accordingly are not released by my Department. Sales of 92 and 89 octane motor spirit are combined in the published statistics for standard grade. In 1979 motor spirit sales for comprised 1,348,715 kilolitres of standard grade and 13,539,234 kilolitres of super grade (i.e. super grade 90.9 per cent of the total). (2) (b) The number of retail outlets in Australia as at 31 December 1979 was 12,900. All sell super grade motor spirit, and virtually all sell either 89 or 92 octane motor spirit.

Oil Refining Capacity (Question No. 5821) (Question No. 5816) Mr HAYDEN asked the Minister representing the Minister for National Development and Energy, upon notice, on 2 April 1980: (1) Will Australia have adequate local oil refining capacity available by (a) 1985 and(b) 1990. (2) Will the provision of adequate local refining capacity require the addition of a new refinery to the 10 now operating; if so, what information or advice does the Government have that a new refinery is planned for construction during the next 10 years. (3) If such a refinery is planned, can the Minister say (a) which companies are involved, (b) when it is expected that the new refinery will be operating, (c) where will it be located, and (d) what will be its capacity.",88
269,Mr ANTHONY ,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The Minister for National De1980: velopment and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's close question: (1) (a) and (b) For the Government's views on local refining capacity see the statement by the Minister for Nauonal Development of 1 June 1978. The Government's position is supported by the extent of refinery expansion which has taken place in recent years. For example during the four years ended December 1978 the average installed capacity at Australian refineries increased furthermore during the same period refinery outturn increased by 9.2 per cent while demand for petroleum prodstriction ucts increased by only 7.3 percent. (2) and (3) Not necessarily. Recent increases in refinery capacity have been achieved by the expansion of existing refinery facilities, not by the addition of a new refinery. Over the next eighteen months to two years the Total Oil Company plans to expand its refinery at Matraville, New South Wales from the present 12,000 barrels per day capacity to 45,000 barrels per day. The Government knows of no firm plans to build a new refinery. Oil and Oil Product Prices",89

(2) Does the PJT monitor oil cargoes. Mr Garland-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) and (b) Yes. The Tribunal's examination of notices involving higher petroleum account a wide variety of international and locally published information relating to official and spot prices for crude oil and refined products. (2) In its examination of shipping charges from overseas loading ports, the Tribunal has regard to the appropriate worldscale rate for particular voyages and the average freight rate assessment (AFRA) adjustments arrived at by the London Tanker Brokers Panel for particular types of tankers. This approach to the calculation of freight rates is common throughout the industry and is the method employed by trans-national oil companies Australian companies. The method was subject to discussion during the course of the Shell public inquiry in early 1979 and the Tribunal concluded, after hearing argument about alternative systems, that it represented an aaequate procedure for assessing the justification of freight rates.

(3) Oil refining compames regularly provide data to the National Energy Office in the Department of National Development and Energy, concerning input of crude oil and other feedstocks to refineries Radio Pharmaceuticals and Isotopes",90
278,Mr LES JOHNSON ,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 2 April 1980: (1) Is he able to indicate how many hospitals in (a) Australia, (b) the United Kingdom, (c) the United States of America, and (d) European Economic Community countries currently use cyclotron-produced radio pharmaceuticals. (2) Is he funher able to indicate in how many hospitals cyclotron-produced radio pharmaceuticals are preferred to nuclear reactor-produced isotopes for medical purposes. (3) Is it a fact that higher quality isotopes with shorter exposure times are being denied to patients in Australian hospitals because of the inability of the HIFAR nuclear reactor at Lucas Heights, N.S.W., to produce them. Mr MACKellar-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) There are 45 nuclear medicine centres in Australia able to use four approved radiopharmaceuticals manufactured from cyclotron-produced radionuclides. These are (i) Gallium 67 Citrate, (ii) Thallium 201 Chloride, (iii) Indium 111 Calcium DTPA, (iv) Sodium 22 Chloride. The number of hospitals using each one depends on their requirements and available equipment. For example, Thallium 201 requires expensive computer facilities and hence usage is mainly limited to the larger centres. All four radiopharmaceuticals are imported from overseas and the radionuclides have half-lives longer than 60 hours. Procurement from overseas of radionuclides with half-lives less than 60 hours is difficult and for half-lives less than a few hours is impossible. However, it must be realized that the above mentioned cyclotron-produced radiopharmaceuticals service a very small proportion, probably 5 per cent or so of the patients imaged in most nuclear medicine departments in Australia. There are no cyclotrons in Australia at present for the production of radionuclides for medical purposes. (b), (c) and (d) Information is not available on the number of overseas hospitals that are using cyclotronproduced radiopharmaceuticals. However the number of cyclotrons that were producing radionuclides for medical factor of each purposes in 1976 was: United Kingdom 5 United States of America 24 European Economic Community 26. The number of hospitals using radiopharmaceuticals manufactured from radionuclides produced by these cyclotrons will depend on a number of factors including: (1) the half-life of the radionuclide (ii) the shelf-life of the radiopharmaceutical (iii) the transport time from manufacturer to hospital (iv) the production schedule of the manufacturer (v) the periods when the radiopharmaceutical is required for use (vi) the cost of the radiopharmaceutical (vii) the availability of measurement equipment (viii) the research involvements of the hospital in relation to the use of radiopharmaceuticals. (2) There are hardly any radionucUdes of medical importance which, in practice, are produced both by nuclear reactor and cyclotron. Hospitals, therefore, do not normally have to indicate preference for a particular radionuclide on the basis of its method of manufacture. and refinery product outturn. Preference for radiopharmaceuticals using cyclotronproduced radionucUdes over reactor-produced radionuclides (Question No. 5851) is thus notrelatedto hospitals but rather to the radionuclide and its proposed use. For instance, cyclotron-produced Iron 52 (8 hour half-life) which cannot be made in a reactor is preferred to reactor-produced Iron 59 (45 day half-life) for use in bone-marrow studies. Also Iodine 123 (13 hours halflife), which can only be produced by a cyclotron, is preferable to reactor-produced Iodine 131 (8 day half-life) for thyroid studies, but, reactor-produced Technetium 99M (6 hours half-life) is only marginally inferior to Iodine 123 for this purpose. Some Iodine 123 labelled compounds, for example Iodine 123 Iodohippurate, are preferable to the corresponding Iodine 131 compounds since the resulting absorbed radiation dose is less and the image quality is better. However, the 13 hour half-life of Iodine 123 introduces procurement problems and the radiopharmaceutical cost is much higher. The number of types of investigations for which radiopharmaceuticals manufactured from cyclotron-produced radionuclides are preferred to those manufactured from reactor-produced radionuclides is small. The precise number wouldrequiredetailed cost benefit studies which are difficult and have not been reported in the scientific literature. (3) Cyclotrons do not necessarily produce isotopes of a better quality thanreactors.However cyclotrons are able to produce some radionuclides that cannot be produced in a reactor. The majority of these have areasonablyshon half-life and consequently result in low radiation doses when administered to patients. This is an advantage but, as indicated above, is not the only consideration. Such short half-life isotopes, however, may increase the risks of radiation exposure for the staff handling them. For very short half-life radionuclides such as Carbon 11, Nitrogen 13 and Oxygen 15 with half-lives of 20, 10 and 2 minutes respectively, the cyclotron must be adjacent to the nuclear medicine centre. In addition to this requirement, highly specialised scanning equipment (Positron Scanner) is required in order to make the most efficient use of these radionuclides. Radionuclides with such short half-lives have not commonly been used for routine patient care. Consequently, Australian hospitals could be provided with radiopharmaceuticals which have half-lives between a few hours and about 60 hours and which are not available to them at present, through a cyclotron located in some central position. To supply centres wishing to use very short half-life radionuclides would require a cyclotron at ever, as indicated earlier, the use of cyclotron-produced radiopharmaceuticals accounts for approximately 5 per cent of the patterns attending nuclear medicine departments. HIFAR could not be replaced manufacture of certain essential radionuclides in high demand, particularly Technetium 99M and Iodine 131. Replacement of HIFAR Reactor",90
279,Mr LES JOHNSON ,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"the Minister representing the Minister for National Development and Energy, upon notice, on 2 April 1980: Are any sites being considered in relation to the design cost study for a possible replacement of the HIFAR reactor at Lucas Heights, NSW.

Insecticidal Esters (Question No. 5983) Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Science the Environment, upon notice, on 22 April 1980: (1) What progress has been made by the CSIRO's Divof Applied Organic Chemistry in Melbourne, in the development of the potent biodegradable insecticides, insectiaspects can be meaningcidal esters. (2) Did the insecticides, when synthesised in 1977, appear to be effective but harmless to animals. (3) Did the CSIRO collaborate with any company or compames in developing and testing the insecticides to the commercial stage; if so, what companies were involved. (Question No. 5933) (4) Have the insecticidal esters yet been produced economically and when is it anticipated they will be on the (5) Did the CSIRO lodge patent applications on the new compounds (a) in Australia and (b) overseas; if so, were these successful. Mr Thomson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The potent biodegradable insecticides named insecticidal esters discovered by CSIRO's Division of Applied Organic Chemistry are currently in the development stages. As announced in a statement by the former Minister on 11 July 1979, CSIRO has selected two companies, Roche-Maag Ltd and Nippon Kayaku Co. Ltd from 36 applicants to participate with the Division of Applied Organic Chemistry in a 3-party program to develop and exploit these compounds on a world-wide basis. This program is proceeding satisfactorily with promising results and good co-operation between the three parties. At present emphasis is being given to small scale field trials and laboratory tests by the companies to determine which of the many possible insecticidal esters should be selected for commercial production. In Australia, Roche-Maag Ltd has a very active program preparing and testing these compounds in their laboratories on Australian pests. The CSIRO Division of Applied Organic Chemistry is currently undertaking back-up research and is developing ways to increase the potency of the compounds even further. (2) In 1977 when they were first announced, the compounds apeared to be effective against insects but harmless to mammals. The test results obtained since then have substantiated this view. (3) and (4) As mentioned in the first part of this answer these compounds are not yet at the commercial stage. CSIRO is collaborating with Roche-Maag Ltd and Nippon Kayaku Co. Ltd in a development program to bring them to commercial use. It will take 3 to 5 years to develop the methods for large scale commercial production plete the safety tests required under the regulations to prove that there will be no adverse toxic effects, before any specific insecticide can be registered for use in Australia. (5) To date CSIRO has lodged a total of 50 patent cations on these compounds in Australia and overseas. Of these, 6 have been granted and the rest are still under prosGovernment ecution. CSIRO does not expect any difficulty in obtaining those patents. Rundle Shale Oil Project Dr Everingham asked the Minister representing the Minister for National Development and Energy, upon notice, on 22 April 1980: (1) Has the Government taken steps to ensure that the Queensland Government and the Rundle shale oil project partners meet Federal environmental protection laws before the Queensland Government gives legislative effect to a franchise agreement for exploitation of Rundle posits; if so, what are they.
