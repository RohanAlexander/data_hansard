2,Mr SPEAKER,ZZZZZ,"I inform the House of the unfortunate death on 19 November 1989 of Mr James Mark Bradfield, a member of this House for the· division of Barton from 1975 to 1983. EmptyHere to express my very deep regret at the passing of Jim Bradfield. Mr Speaker, I know that he was also a friend of yours and that you regret his passing, as do so many members on both sides of this House. Jimmy Bradfield distinguished himself in a number of fields. Firstly, as a businessman he was a remarkably successful man, starting and building up the Straight Talk Tyre Serv­ ice retail chain in what is arguably one of the most competitive industries of all. As a member of parliament he served the electo­ rate of Barton most admirably between 1975 and 1983, in particular, in his work on the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. As an opponent Jimmy Bradfield was tough and he was wily, but he was always fair and that was the measure of the man. If success was one standard, so too was community involvement with Jim Bradfield. As a committed Anglican he played a very active role in his church and was very active in the motor boat fraternity and in many pursuits with his children-sailing, for one, comes to mind. He was also very active in the Rotary movement and was a past presi­ dent of one of the local organisations. After leaving Parliament Jimmy Bradfield's work continued and he spent some consid­ erable time working with the Reverend Ted Noffs at Sydney's Wayside Chapel. Jim was proud, and rightfully so, of his role as a director of the Life Education project. He also played a very active role in seeing that institution promoted overseas. His greatest involvement was as a dedicated family man. To his wife Jill, his sons Timothy, Michael and Christopher, and his daughter Angela, I extend not only Amanda's and my very great sympathy but also, I am sure, the sympathy of a great many people on both sides of the House and in the other place. · Finally, if success and community involve­ ment are fitting descriptions of Jim Bradfield's life, one further epitaph that he would cher­ ish is one with which all who knew him would also agree; that is, that Jim Bradfield was a very good bloke. I believe that he is one good bloke who will be very sorely missed by people of all walks of life. EmptyHere Opposition)-by leave-The honourable EmptyHere the last words of his tribute to Jim Bradfield what all of us in this Parliament-! came in contact with a wide spread of his own con­ tacts-and those in the community would say: that Jim Bradfield was 'a good bloke'. It was reflected in all his dealings in this Parliament across parties. Frankly, .he was a friend to all. He was a hard working and extraordinarily enthusiastic member of the Parliament, obviously having shown the same sorts of characteristics in his business career prior to entering the House of Representa­ tives. In all his dealings he reflected decency and fairness and yet, when the occasion de­ manded, a firmness and a capacity to be uncompromising. It is an interesting combi­ and friendly, nation of talents. As one who went with him to a number of functions in his period of membership of this House, I know that his constituency contacts were extraordinarily wide and cov­ ered a breadth and· spectrum of the com­ munity. This was dealt with by the honourable member for Barton. We were all deeply saddened by his death. Bearing in mind that he had not held a particular office in the Parliament, I am grateful for this rare opportunity to extend, on behalf of both the National Party of Australia and the Liberal Party of Australia, our condolences to Jill and his children.",11
3,Dr HARRY EDWARDS ,ZZZZZ,"Berowra)-by leave-As a close friend as well as a col­ league of Jim Bradfield, I would like to join honourable members in their expressions of condolence and sympathy. Jim Bradfield was all that the honourable member for Barton EmptyHere very high esteem by honourable members on both sides of the House. I visited him only about a fortnight ago. He was accepting of his illness and was determined to fight it. Even then, he was concerned to contribute to our policies in certain areas, in particular, the industrial relations field. For many years he was the chairman of the Treasury committee of the coalition parties. He was also an active member of the Parliamentary Christian Fellowship. I join with other members in expressing my deepest sympathy to his wife Jill and the members of his family.",11
4,Mr SINCLAIR ,ZZZZZ,New England)-by leave-My wife and I would like to extend our condolences to Jill and the family of the late Jim Bradfield. Jim was a remarkable man. Over a considerable period his illness was quite debilitating and he bore it with a fortitude that I think is an example to everyone. His contribution to the Parliament and to the community has been spoken of. Yet he rendered·quite unusual and exceptional service in other areas. His work with the Reverend Ted Noffs and the Wayside Chapel was really quite exemplary. He gave admirable service to Ted Noffs and that wonderful community facility in the heart of Sydney. His undoubted devotion to the well-being of his fellow man was one of the hallmarks of what I regard as the attributes of a great Austnilian. Jim Bradfield was a great Australian. We are all the poorer for his passing and I think we would all do well to remember the contribution he made to the wider community during his lifetime.,12
5,Mr HOWARD ,ZZZZZ,"Bennelong)-by leave I, too, woul- like to associate myself with the remarks that have been made about the late Jim Bradfield, a former Federal member for Barton. I had occasion to visit him in hospital at the beginning of last week and, despite his great illness, it would not surprise many of his friends and colleagues, particularly but not only in the Liberal Party of Australia in this place, to know that even in those circumstances Jim maintained an enormous interest in current political events and was not reluctant to give some advice both to the Opposition and to the Government. Throughout our conversation he maintained a very lively and committed interest in public affairs. I would like to extend my personal sympathy and that of my family to Jill and her children, to Jim's mother and to his very close and devoted brother, Robert.",12

7,Mr HAWKE ,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Wills-Prime Minister)-I inform the House that the Treasurer, Mr Keating, left on 12 November on Government business overseas. He will return to Australia on 25 November. In his absence the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Dawkins, is the Acting Minister. The Minister for Trade Negotiations, Mr Duffy, is also overseas on Government. business. He departed on 13 November and will return on 25 November. In his absence the portfolio Minister, Senator Evans, will assume Mr Duffy's portfolio responsibilities, with the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, taking questions in his place.

8,Mr JULL,AIRLINE PILOTS DISPUTE,"Is the Prime Minister aware of widespread concern over his linkage with Sir Peter Abeles, and widespread concern over the Prime Minister's claim that the airline dispute is over and his readiness to support. inflated airline estimates of capacity? Is the Prime Minister aware that a Minister reportedly has said he 'does not know why we are telling lies and why we are giving the public total misinformation'? Does the Prime Minister still believe that the pilots dispute is over? Can the Prime Minister inform the House as to the identity of his Minister who believes the Prime Minister is lying?",12
9,Mr HAWKE,AIRLINE PILOTS DISPUTE,Let me take the last point first. Throughout this unfortunate episode if there has been any area in which untruths have been told it has been from the other side and those who are supporting it. Let me go to the other aspects of the honourable gentleman's question. I noticed that he referred to my friendship with Sir Peter Abeles. He says that there is widespread concern about that. It is a matter of public record in this House and outside that my friendship with Sir Peter Abeles is something not only for which I do not apologise but of which I am proud. Mr Halverson-What?,12
10,Mr HAWKE,AIRLINE PILOTS DISPUTE,"The honourable member may laugh. I happen to regard Sir Peter Abeles as a great Australian who has established one of the world's great transport enterprises. He has given enormous opportunities of employment and development to people not only within this-country but in more than 50 countries around the world. Rather than the denigration in which the honourable gentleman seeks to engage, I would have thought that Australians would share the pride that I have that an immigrant to this country has established an enterprise of such dimensions, not only within this country but also around the world, which is an object of pride and envy by people within the transport industry world-wide. Far from in any sense apologising for my friendship with the gentleman who has· been responsible for this achievement; I stand proudly in this House and assert that he is one of my close friends. I do not withdraw in any way from that fact. I am proud of it and I will always stand up and state that fact. As to the second part of the question about the dispute, I simply rely-Mr Carlton-Dispute?",13
11,Mr HAWKE,AIRLINE PILOTS DISPUTE,"I am referring to the question about the dispute; they were the honourable member's words. I simply say: look at the language used by the Industrial Relations Commission when it dealt with this matter this week. I know that the honourable member does not want to take my explanation for it. In the words and decisions of the Industrial Relations Commission it has said that, if the' Australian Federation of Air Pilots wishes to have any part in this matter, then there are certain things which it has to do. Until it does that, it has no role. That is the answer to the second part of the question. As to the third element of the honourable member's question about allegations made by a Minister, the easiest thing in the game is to say, 'Minister X said this'. I could just as easily get up and say that one of the Opposition's fellows said X, Y and Z. It would be easy to do. When I fo-ecast the change of leadership I did not quote any person, but there is the embodiment of the accuracy of what I said. I told the Leader of the Opposition what he was doing. He knew that what I was saying was right. Some members of the Opposition did not have the guts to be open about it. EAST-WEST RELATIONS",13
12,Mrs HARVEY,AIRLINE PILOTS DISPUTE,My question is directed to the Prime Minister. What are the implications for East-West relations of the remarkable changes taking place in eastern Europe?,13
13,Mr HAWKE,AIRLINE PILOTS DISPUTE,"I believe that the changes under way in eastern Europe hold out the hope of a fundamental transformation in East-West relations. Before the remarkable developments we have seen this year in Poland, Hungary, the German Democratic Republic and, inevitably, Czechoslovakia, there had been, as we all know, a remarkable improvement in relations between the United States of America and the Soviet Union in the last two years of the Reagan Administration. The high point of that much wider dialogue than ever before was, as we all appreciate and applaud, the conclusion of the intermediate-range nuclear force agreement in December 1987. Subsequently, the Soviet Union's withdrawal from Afghanistan and its very constructive role in the negotiations over Angola and Namibia have all had a very positive effect on East-West relations. The remarkable moves towards democratisation in the market in eastern Europe can only accelerate that trend. It is quite obvious, most graphically in Czechoslovakia at the moment, that eastern European communist leaders who turn their faces against the aspirations of their people for reform certainly cannot count on Mr Gorbachev to prop them up. For these countries struggling with their economic. difficulties, the European Community and its associated institutions have been a very powerful magnet, as has been obvious from my conversations with these people. I do not believe, on all the evidence, that Mr Gorbachev will stand in the way of his neighbours who look to assistance from that source. Until now, the greatest potential for conflict between East and West has been the political and strategic fault line running along the border between the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic. In our judgment, the historic breach in the Berlin Wall which has occurred in recent days has been an inspiring development. But it has also raised questions in all thoughtful minds around the world as to the future security arrangements in Europe. My view is that an open border between the two Germanies and regular human contact between Germans from east and west are likely in the long term to be a source offar greater security and stability at the heart of Europe than the division, fear and tension symbolised by the Wall. The meeting between the leaders of the United States and the Soviet Union next month off M-lta obviously could not come at a more appropriate time. Last week I discussed with the United States Secretary of State Jim Baker the approach that the United States will take in these talks. I know from those discussions that, as we would all expect, President Bush's attitude in those talks will be constructive and forward looking. The Soviets' attitude to major East-West issues was graphically illustrated by the speech a couple of weeks ago by Foreign Secretary Shevardnadze and his unequivocal acknowledgment that the· Krasnoyarsk radar station, which, properly, had been for so long an object of criticism· by Western countries, violates the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. This surely bodes well for the successful conclusion before too long of further significant arms oontrol agreements between the superpowers. While I believe that we need to appraise these developments carefully, I also believe, as I trust do all members of this House, that they have the potential to transform the world for the benefit of all people. NA EmptyHere what actions he will be taking to bring about a fall in home mortgage interest rates to 15 per cent by the end of this year, as he promised during the Western Australian election campaign.",13
14,Mr HAWKE,HOUSING INTEREST RATES,A similar question in one form or another has been asked on several previous occasions. I have nothing to add to the answers I have given before. NA,14
15,Mr OKEEFE,PRODUCTIVITY AND WAGES POLICY,"My question to the Minister for Industrial Relations concerns productivity and wages policy. Has the Minister's attention been drawn to national accounts figures released on 10 October showing revised figures for productivity growth? What information is the Minister able to provide on these figures and what are their implications for proposals to link wages directly to productivity? EmptyHere honourable member for his question. My attention has been drawn to the national accounts figures to which he referred. Those figures show that, on an industry revalued basis, labour productivity for the period 198283 to 1988-89 increased by 1.4 per cent per annum. On an expenditure revalued basis the increase is some 1.2 per cent per annum. When we compare that with the period prior to the Australian Labor Party coming to government-the 1974-75 to 1982-83 period-we see that both measures are up about 1.8 per cent per annum I can say to the honourable member that there is a marginal change in the comparison between. the two periods. But that marginal change has occurred at a time when, under this Government, there has been a five times greater growth in employment than there was in the seven years of the previous Government. The fact that there has been a marginal change is simply a reflection that real unit labour costs have been lower and that labour has been used instead of capital-there has been an increased labour input rather than an increased capital input. All things considered, part of the success of this Government has been its ability to get employment up and real unit labour costs down so that industry can grow and investment can increase. That experience with the greater use of labour is similar to what has happened in other countries where there has been a high growth in employment. The Opposition's policy calls for wage increases to be tied to increases in productivity. Mr Reith-What is wrong with that? EmptyHere with it is that there is no specified measure of productivity. There is a whole range of measures that can be used in respect of productivity. The point we will make repeatedly in this place and elsewhere is that one ca.nnot make that kind of arrangement unless one can specify the measure of productivity. For the period 1988-89, labour productivity on an industry revalued basis is up 1.6 per cent. On an expenditure revalued basis, it is down 0.2 per cent. So the. obvious question to ask of the. Opposition is: which measure will it use this time-a 0.2 per cent decrease in wages or a 1.6 per cent increase in wages? What would the Opposition ask the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to do with that mix-up 1.6 per cent or down 0.2 per cent? Industry knows the position out in the real world. In a very tight and scarce labour market where there are companies that want to pay 14, 15 or 20 per cent increases in salaries and wages, does anybody seriously believe that one will get away with a 1.6 per cent increase in wages, as the Opposition is trying to suggest, by tying wage increases to productivity? We know that the Industrial Relations Commission, under its obligations, takes productivity into account. But the best score to go to is that from Senator Stone. Senator Stone says, 'Okay, give· the pilots 30 per cent. As long as there is productivity improvement, they can have 30 per cent'. What do we do with the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd in Newcastle? That company has a 50 per cent increase in steel output per person. Do we give them a 50 per. cent increase in wages or a 0.2 per cent decrease in wages? One can take one's pick. That is the nonsense of what is. being argued by the Opposition. That is the nonsense of its industrial relations policy. That is why industry and industry associations do not want a bar of it. That is why four out of five chief executives in major companies do not want a bar of the Opposition's policy. On the other hand, the honourable member knows that out there in the workplace and industry this Government, in an orderly and responsible manner and in consultation with industry and the trade union movement, is, through award restructuring, reshaping workplace arrangements, training arrangements, career structures and occupational health and safety provisions, so that productivity can continue to be improved and substantially lifted without the confrontation, conflict and dispute which are embodied in the policy put forward by the Opposition. It is a real, practical, moving policy that has the support of industry and the trade union movement and, as Bert Evans of the Metal Trades Industry Association told the Leader of the Opposition a couple of weeks ago, 'We don't want your American experiments here, thank you very much'. The simple essence of all of this is that this Government is about creating and keeping jobs; the Opposition stands for destroying jobs. . NA",14
16,Dr HEWSON,ENTERPRISE BARGAINING,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. In the light of his answer to the last question, I refer the Minister to two recent statements by the Treasurer in relation to enterprise bargaining. In the first, in a press conference on 23 October 1989, the Treasurer said: One thing is for certain if we had enterprise bargaining you can forget the investment phase, it's over. In the second, in a speech to Nomura Securities on 14 November 1989, the Treasurer said: The challenge now is to further develop the process whereby enterprises can deal directly with their work force, as occurs in Japan. In the light of the Minister's position, as revealed in the answer to the previous question, will he indicate whether the recent statement by the Treasurer represents the Government's new policy. position endorsing enterprise bargaining units? EmptyHere is not able to understand-Opposition m(!mbers interjectingMONICA",15
17,Mr SPEAKER,ENTERPRISE BARGAINING,"Order! The House will come to order. EmptyHere is not able to understand that one can have enterprise bargaining through an enterprise bargaining unit. The Opposition is talking about a separate set of wage arrangements for each enterprise outside the wage fixing system. There is a vast difference. If those opposite cannot understand that, I feel sdrry for them. If the honourable member for Wentworth were to read on in the Treasur- . er's speech he would see that on the next page the Treasurer says: However, while there is a widespread recognition that wage negotiations must have an increasing enterprise focus, there is also an acceptanceit goes on after the comma where the honourable member stoppedthat this process must be underpinned by the uing role for Australia's Industrial Relations mission and the Accord to ensure effective aggregate wage constraint. Put that in your pipe and smoke it! NA",15
18,Mr CROSS,DEFENCE PERSONNEL,Has the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel seen reports of proposals concerning the conditions of service of Defence Force personnel? Can the Minister advise the House of the actions which he is taking to improve the conditions which apply to the members of the Defence Force and their families?,16
19,Mr SIMMONS,DEFENCE PERSONNEL,"I thank the honourable member for Brisbane for his question. and acknowledge his long standing interest in the welfare of the members of the Australian Defence Force and their families. I have certainly seen some of the press reports that the honourable member refers to. In particular, those press reports refer to Senatqr Newman's promotion of the Opposition policy on defence science and personnel. An examination of the proposals and the policy reveals two important facts. First, most of the Opposition's so-called initiatives and commitments simply restate the achievements and the policies and programs which this Government already has in place. On behalf of the Government and members of the Australian Defence Force and their families, I sincerely thank Senator Newman for her very strong endorsement of our exhaustive list of achievements. The second point about the Opposition policy is that, true to form, it has once again got its sums wrong. Where Senator Newman has dared to be innovative, even a generous analysis of her proposals reveals that there is a cost underestimate of about 50 per cent. In contrast with the Opposition, our record is one of achievement and not simply wordsachievements such as an independent service pay system that is both fair and efficient. A complete review has been announced of the service pension scheme. We have made a commitment of some$300m to service housing in the last three years as part of a $1 billion plan to upgrade defence service housing over a decade. Real progress has been achieved for the first time in meeting the educational and contincommunity support needs of service families. Com- I can assure the House and the members of the Defence Force that our achievements on their behalf will be just as real in the future-for example, with things like improved career management structures, real career opportunities for women in the Australian Defence Force, improved community amenities, a fairer deal for single members and rationalisation of the conditions of service machinery. Unlike the Opposition's superficial and very muddled proposals, our plans have been developed with a great deal of care and can be achieved in a very timely and financially responsible way. NA",16
20,Dr HEWSON,INTEREST RATES,"My question is directed to the Acting Treasurer. In the light of the Prime Minister's promise, made in the Western Australian election campaign, that home loan mortgage interest rates would fall by the end of the year, I refer the Acting Treasurer to the recent paper by two Reserve Bank of Australia economists which said: When the monetary authorities reduce the Australian short term nominal interest rates, at some unpredictable time there may be a big fall in the demand for Australian nominal assets and a large, rapid depreciation. I ask the Acting Treasurer whether he expects a substantial and rapid depreciation of the Australian dollar in response to the Government's attempts to engineer lower interest rates in the run-up to the next election.",16
21,Mr DAWKINS,INTEREST RATES,"Firstly, neither I, the Treasurer nor the Prime Minister comments on the exchange rate. Secondly, there will be no artificial lowering of interest rates now or in the future. What we have said quite clearly is that whilst conditions require interest rates to be at their current level, whilst monetary policy is required to be tight, it will remain tight and it will not be relaxed until circumstances unambiguously argue for its reduction. NA",16
22,Dr CHARLESWORTH,GENERAL PRACTITIONERS,I ask the Minister for Community Services and Health whether he can advise on progress being made in the implementation of the new general practitioner (GP) arrangements which were unanimously endorsed by the all-party Senate Select Committee on Health Legislation.,17
23,Dr BLEWETT,GENERAL PRACTITIONERS,"I thank the honourable member for his question, which reflects his continuing interest in the enhancement of GP practice which was, of course, the object of the reforms that were passed through this Parliament. I am delighted to advise that considerable progress has already been made in implementing the GP arrangements despite what has been a continuing campaign of obstruction by the Australian Medical Association (AMA). The new arrangements are to start on 1 December when higher, content-based Medicare fees and rebates will become available to vocationally registered GPs. A month ago, letters were sent out to all Australian GPs explaining the new arrangements and inviting them to register. So far, over 6,000 responses have been received by the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, which we estimate is over 50 per cent of those who· are entitled to be eligible for vocational registration. The applications are continuing to come in at over 100 per day. Of the 6,000, over 3,300 have now been formally registered and the new vocational registration eligibility committees are now in place. I am sure that, the very positive response to date will be further enhanced as the information and education campaigns related to the scheme begin. Honourable members will recall that when the Senate Committee reported it specifically recommended that information and education programs be implemented both for the medical profession and for the public and proposed the use of print media, television and radio. The campaign to inform doctors, that is, advertising in specialist medical journals, in information kits and through posters and seminars, has already begun and a mass media campaign for the public begins next week-print, television and radio advertising. That is vitally important so that the patients themselves can understand the major reform of general practice that has taken place. That material becomes even more important because of the continuing obstruction by the AMA of these proposals. Let me quote what the AMA President said when the Senate Committee report came down. He said: The Select Committee vindicated the AMA's stand calling for a select Senate inquiry into proposed legislation for vocational registration of general practitioners . . . The Select Committee has addressed most of these concerns in a well balanced way. The Government put into place every recommendation from that Senate Select Committee-recommendations which vindicated the stand of the AMA-and the AMA President said: The AMA will therefore adopt a constructive attitude to the recommendations of the select committee and will respond positively to proposals for its further involvement in implementing the general thrust of the report. I have to say that the President's promise has not been honoured, because the troglodytes in the AMA will not allow him to do so. We have had a continuing advertising campaign, a continuing campaign by the AMA to try to prevent and discourage GPs from registering for the register-even though the AMA, as a result of our agreement with the Senate, has been involved in the whole process as it has been developed over the past few months. I think this kind of about-face by the AMA in saying, 'We approve of the Senate Committee's report, we will back it in a constructive way', and then becoming completely destructive is simply one further example of the fact that throughout this issue . the AMA has put politics before the constructive interests of the profession. I am confident that the vast number of GPs will continue to ignore that kind of politicking and will put the best interests of medicine and patients above and beyond all else, which is in fact the basis of the whole reform of general practice. NA",17
24,Mr LLOYD,INTEREST RATES,"My question is directed to the Acting Treasurer. Given that tomorrow representatives of the New South Wales Farmers Association will be presenting a petition with 40,000 signatures detailing the devastating effect of record high interest rates, from 22 per cent to 25 per cent for farmers and small businesses, why has the Government so penalised this vital sector of our economy with such punitive interest rates, which threaten the viability of those involved and will kill the investment necessary to increase productivity and exports so essential for the nation's economic future?",17
25,Mr DA WKINS,INTEREST RATES,"I thank the honourable member for his rather flamboyant question. The point which the Opposition has to understand is that the reason interest rates are as high as they are is that the Government has a very firm determination to contain demand. One cannot run an economy with demand running at the level that it is. Even though we are determined to ensure that the necessary restructuring of the economy is undertaken which will require new investment, we also recognise that we cannot sustain a situation where demand-that is, the combination of investment and consumption-is running at the level that it is. The Government has taken a firm decision which means that the monetary policy is tight and that it will remain tight until cumstances subside. I would have thought that it was very much in the interests of rural community, the agricultural producers generally, that we ensure that Australia has a competitive economy, one which can commentary pete with the rest of the world on a firm basis. It has been the Government's intention all along to ensure that there is an appropriminute ate restructuring of the economy, so that in all sectors, not just the agricultural sector, we can compete effectively with the rest the world. I might say that, far from being critical of the Government's efforts, people in the rural community have been extraordinarily full praise and congratulations for the efforts this Government has made in terms of trying to produce a fairer market for their product in the world. For years and years hopeless and hapless members of the National Party of Australia swaggered around the trying to get changes to the international trade environment but were, of course, tally ineffective. It is only as a result of a concerted effort on the part of a number of Labor Government Ministers-I might say, humbly, myself included-that we have been able to ensure not only that Australia has an effective voice in the world but also that we are not a lone voice crying in the wilderness, that we are actually taken notice of and that, indeed, the changes which have already taken place and the organisation which has already been done produces the most positive likely outcome from the current General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade round. One cannot look at the agricultural sector of the economy just in terms of interest rates. We are trying to secure for people in the agricultural sector a long term and confident future in the rest of the world, and that we will do. NA",18
26,Mr LINDSAY,ROYAL AUSTRALIAN AIR FORCE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Defence. Is the Minister aware of claims concerning the safety operations involving Hercules aircraft, and can the Minister assure the House of the safety of Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) fiying operations? Mr BEAZLEYYes, I have seen the claims alluded to by the honourable member cirfor Herbert, which emanate in the first instance from the .embattled and increasingly the deceitful Premier of Queensland and also from the Leader of the National Party of Australia, continuing the Opposition's parliaattack on the Royal Australian Air Force. In this instance it is an attack which has deeply incensed the RAAF, and in a I will come to its answer to the allegations made against it by the Premier of Queensland. Firstly, on behalf of the people of of Australia, I thank the RAAF for the role that it has performed in this period of considerable trouble in the aviation sector. It has carried many Australians safely and well. of The praise emanating from the civilian comthat munity to the RAAF and Royal Australian Navy (RAN) pilots and air crews that have been involved in Operation Immune has been legion and fulsome, and it has been extremely well deserved. As I have said, the world people have been flown in safety. The Air Force operation is now to be towithdrawn, and will be phased out by the middle of next month, not because there is concern in the Air Force or anywhere else about the safety of its operations but for the simple reason that the requirement that was there when it started this operation no longer exists. The fact of the matter is that the commercial airlines, both through the use of their own aircraft and through an extensive program of chartered aircraft, are now beginning to get into a position where they can fulfil the need that exists. It is envisaged that that will apply from the middle of next month, at which time the RAAF and the RAN will no longer be needed in that regard. The RAAF and the RAN have been subjected to persistent attack which has challenged their. capacity to carry out air operations safely and effectively. What the honourable member has referred to is simply the latest attacks, in which the Premier of Queensland has suggested that an aircraft operating under Operation· Immune developed problems which caused it to depressurise, by implication placing the safety of the passengers in doubt; that the aircraft was subsequently operated and people's safety jeopardised; and that the RAAF launched a cover-up. That is downright deceitful dishonesty and a despicable accusation against the RAAF, over which it has taken great offence. Mr Blunt-That is tautology. Mr BEAZLEy-It needs a bit of emphasis, and honourable members opposite need a bit of correction. I will read from what Air Commodore T. W. O'Brien, the Chief of Staff at Air Headquarters, has just sent me in this regard. The document, headed 'Allegations by the Premier of Queensland', states: 1. The Premier made two allegations against the RAAF. First, that an aircraft had developed a cracked wing in a flight to North Queensland and secondly, that the RAAF were being withdrawn from Operation Immune because of problems with Hercules engines and other fatigue issues. 2. The 'cracked wing' incident he refers likely an .incident that occurred on a Defence support (not Immune) task from Richmond New South Wales to Amberley. During that flight a decrease in pressurisation was noted. On inspection a crack was discovered in the aircraft wheel well side wall. The aircraft captain elected to descend, depressurised land at RAAF Amberley. 3. Subsequently, the aircraft was inspected and flown to Richmond, unpressurised for repair. The repair was effected within 36 hours and the aircraft was returned to service. Whilst there is no history of cracking in this particular area, the general wheel well area has a history of minor cracking stretching over 20 years; consequently, all Hercules aircraft are regularly inspected during routine servicing. A fleet wide inspection subsequent to this incident has not revealed any similar occurrence. 4. On the allegation of engine problems and other fatigue issues, the only incident that could be categorised is one where a 28 stone passenger cracked a toilet seat such that he had to calJ for assistance to extricate himself from his predicament. The air commodore has not informed me whether the person concerned is a former member of the Queensland Cabinet; nor has he informed me whether or not the passenger was a tourism spokesman for the Opposition. The minute concludes: 5. AHQ would wish to issue a firm rebuttal to the Premier's allegations which are wrong in fact and which impugn the RAAF transport forces internationally recognised safety record and universally accepted dedication to absolute professionalism. There is no question about this matter at all: there is only one issue in the Queensland election, that is, the issue of corruption. In his comments last week, the former Federal Leader of the National Party correctly identified that issue. He said that the only issue in the Queensland election was corruptionnothing else. It ill behoves those who are rightly the target of that concern by the electorate to decide to cover themselves by creating flak in the direction of the RAAF so that they can conceal the fact that they are rightfully on the ropes for their dishonest, deceitful and vicious behaviour during the years they have been in government.

27,Mr SHACK,REMUNERATION TRIBUNAL,"I refer the Minister for Housing and Aged Care to a statement he made regarding the 28 August determination of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal (PBRT). As recorded in Hanto is most sard on 5 September, at page 863, the Minister said: The Government recognises that the PBRT's decision cannot be overthrown . . . I further refer the Minister to a statement and made by his senior colleague the Minister for Community Services and Health on the Sunday program of 12 November. Dr Blewett said: . no doubt the' Government could simply have rejected an independent umpire's tribunal. How does the Minister for Housing and Aged Care explain the difference between his statement and that of his senior Minister?",19
28,Mr STAPLES,REMUNERATION TRIBUNAL,"That statement needs to be seen well and truly in the context of the overall situation. There is certainly no conflict between the Minister for Community Services and Health and me, nor between any members of the Government in this regard. We have alw-ys made it clear that this Government would not interfere with the process of setting the remuneration of pharmacists under the PBRT. The relevant legislation was set up by a Liberal-National Party government with the very intention of removing from the political arena the need for government to become involved in the issue of remuneration. Certainly, any government can legislate for changes; but in this case the' fact is that, under the National Health Act, a determination by the PBR T pursuant to section 98B is binding. This situation applies under legislation introduced not by us, but by the Liberal and National parties when in government. The situation could be changed by an Act of Parliament, as distinct from an act of Executive government. Further, it could be changed by the courts-but twice that course has failed-or it could be changed by the Tribunal itself. Therefore, the issue is not what could be done but,rather, what should be done and what will be done. The situation is that the Government has stood by the process-a process set up by the Liberal and National parties when in government-and clearly in this case has done the correct thing. NA",20
29,Mr BLANCHARD,ASSISTANCE FOR DISABLED,My question is addressed to the Minister for Community Services and Health. Can the Minister inform the House whether the funding of the new employment initiatives under the Disability Services Act has resulted in any improvement in the economic circumstances of people with a disability?,20
30,Dr BLEWETT,ASSISTANCE FOR DISABLED,"I thank the honourable member for raising the question of disabilities because, despite the major reforms we have made in this area, certainly we have had very little discussion of those proposals from the Opposition. Of course, the honourable member has always been interested in the development of the prograrh under the new Disability Services Act. One of the great achievements of that Act was to encourage employment services funded under the Act to show that many people with a disability are capable of earning a living outside the traditional sheltered workshop. It may be of interest to some of the honourable members opposite who are not showing interest now to know that the Act funds two types of employment servicescompetitive employment arid supported employment. In competitive employment a placement officer identifies jobs in the open work force which could be undertaken by a person with a disability. Following negotiation with a potential employer, the worker in question is trained to do the job in the ordinary workplace but with continuing access to the placement service. In supported employment-the other type-jobs are again identified, but a support worker remains with the worker or members of the enclave or work crew as a continuing support. The candidates for these new places in supported and open employment have come from sheltered workshops, special schools and activity therapy centres. At present there are 1,420 workers in regular jobs in the community as a result of these programs-l,100 are in open employment and 320 are in supported employment, such as work crews and enclaves. Indeed, the speed with which the program is beginning to move is indicated by the fact that since November last year 644 people with a disability have been trained for a specific job in the open work force and 85 people are receiving ongoing assistance in supported employment in the community-a total of 729 over the last year. Just let us see what this means for these people in terms of wages and salaries. In 1986, before the Disability Services Act came in, these workers would have been getting an average weekly wage of $20.13 a week plus $102.10 in the form of a sheltered employment allowance. Today those workers are getting wages ranging from $322 a week to $386 a week, plus award conditions including sick leave, recreation leave, long service leave and superannuation. To take an example, here in Canberra the Royal Australian Mint is employing a number of people with an intellectual disability in an enclave setting. These workers had been getting 72c an hour in a local sheltered workshop. Today they are getting $6.81 an hour, which is related to their productivity in the Mint. Their lives have been transformed. For the first time they have economic independence and this leads to a much greater sense of independence in their daily lives. Other jobs making a similar difference under these programs right across the country range from K-Marts in Albury to cleaning crews in Artarmon, computer analysts in Botany and personalised printing work in Hobart. The employers are uniformly enthusiastic about the high standard of work achieved and even in areas of high unemployment, such as Albury, are looking for more placements under these services. Some of the men and women I have been talking about had spent up to 17 years of their lives in sheltered workshops or activity therapy centres and now they are working in the open community. In those workshops and sheltered therapy centres they had accumulated a number of skills, but very few savings. Now they have a real job, with real pay, in the real work force. I am very pleased to inform the House that, with the knowledge of these facts, the Prime Minister has agreed to sponsor the Prime Minister's Employer of the Year award to go to an employer in the open work force who has a record of excellence in employing people with a disability. While the Opposition has minimum interest in people with disabilities, I am delighted that the Prime Minister is lending his name to. this award and that Australian Airlines and Business Review Weekly are underwriting it.

Question so resolved in the negative, NA EmptyHere Opposition) (3.18)-by leave-I move: That this House: (I) welcomes the breach in the Berlin .Wall as symbolic of the triumph of freedom over oppression; (2) hopes that this historic event, together with the processes of political and economic reform that have begun in many Eastern European countries, will continue to gain momentum and provide a democratic future for their peoples; (3) applauds the courage of those many people in Eastern Europe who defied repression and intimidation in the cause of greater political and economic freedom; (4) notes that events in Eastern Europe continue to unfold and that there is considerable uncertainty as to the future; and (5) supports measures that will actively encourage the reform process in Eastern Europe in a way that is consistent with Western security and economic interests, The Opposition is moving this motion today because of the historic significance of recent events in eastern Europe and because their consequences are likely to reach far beyond Europe's borders, with important implications for Australia's international interests, Over recent weeks we have witnessed a succession of extraordinary events in eastern and central Europe: what Winston ChurchiIl called the 'Iron Curtain' that descended on Europe after the Second World War has been partly lifted, The pace and the direction of the reform processes in eastern Europe, and the Soviet Union itself, have swept away the seemingly entrenched realities of the communist monopoly of power, What now seems within reach is an historic opportunity for a new era in the history of Europe, Snow, J. H. Snowdon, W. E. It is appropriate that our Parliament acknowledge the momentous events, such as Theophanous, A. C. Tickner, R. E. the breaching of the Berlin Wall, the prospect of free elections in some east European states West, S. J. Willis,R. and the processes of internal reform within the Soviet Union for what they are-symbols of the irrepressible attraction of freedom for ordinary men and women, For 28 years the Berlin Wall has stood as a symbol of the abject' failure of communism, It was, aptly described in 1964 by one writer as 'a masterpiece of the squalid, the cruel and the hideous; the most naked assertion one could find anywhere that life was not intended to be anything but nasty, brutish and short', Now, under the weight of the dead hand of communism and the outpouring of nationalist resentments, the East German authorities have been unable to maintain even the pretence of authority over the aspirations of their citizens, The Wall may not yet have come tumbling down along its full length, but it has been breached and, it no longer inspires instinctive fear and a sense of hopelessness, The Berlin Wall, for so long a symbol of repression by communist governments, is now a symbol of their failure, This dramatic reversal was not somehow pre-ordained, It was the result of the, brave actions of ordinary men and women, In moving this motion we salute those people for their courage and their determination to be free, We are, of course, more knowledgeable about the causes of the dramatic events that we are witnessing than about their consequences, We can assess fairly accurately why the old communist order is breaking up, but we can only speculate how the current uncertainties and instabilities will be resolved, Essentially, what has happened in eastern Europe is the apparent resolution of a confrontation that has been going on for most of this century between competing moral and political positions. The confrontation has been between democracy and autocracy, between personal freedom and state· control, between capitalism and communism, between the rule of law and the arbitrary rule of an elite responsible to no-one but itself. There are, of course, particular nationalist concerns in countries such as Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and East Germany. They have reinforced the strength of the current reform processes. But what is happening in the Soviet Union and throughout eastern Europe can only be fully understood in terms of the bankruptcy of communism as an ideology and as a system of authority under which people live their lives. The battle of ideas in Europe to which I have referred is being resolved by people in communist countries by either voting with their feet or committing themselves to a thorough overhaul of their own unworkable national systems. They have shown that political and economic freedom has an attractive power that no repressive government can stifle for long. Their actions have demonstrated that centralised economic control is discredited and is a demeaning system. They have shown that the denial of basic political freedoms to the majority of the population only builds up pressures for change rather than stifling them. Ordinary citizens have demonstrated a fierce determination that there should be no return to the old. communist order with all its inefficiency and its backwardness and its corruption. The coalition parties, of course, welcome these developments. We have always emphasised the inherent value of maximising political and economic freedoms. We have always highlighted the dangers in political, econom-c and human terms of communist and socialist centralisation. We have at the core of our political philosophy and belief that wealth is not created by governments but that the enterprise of individuals is the source of that wealth and that political freedom can only be guaranteed by the freedom of individuals to both organise and influence the system of government under which they live. What we have witnessed in eastern Europe is testimony to the irresistible power of those ideas. The triumph of ideas underpinning political and economic freedom has, of course, not always been apparent. It was only a decade or so back that the fashionable talk was of a 'general crisis of capitalism'. What we are witnessing now is a crisis of socialism and communism that is both general and terminal. In this context I must say that it is fascinating to listen to the Government's interpretation of events in eastern Europe. The Australian Labor Party, the party of democratic socialism, has its historical and intellectual roots in theories of economic and political centralisation. This is because socialism, irrespective of whether it operates coercively or otherwise, demands a faith in public authority rather than private action, a commitment to collective rather than individual interests. As it surveys developments not only in Europe but also in Asia, the Government faces clear evidence that its own ideological roots are relics from the past, not the way of the future. The dramatic changes in eastern Europe are not only the product of the battle of.ideas. The course of events we have witnessed is directly related to the effectiveness of Western strategies of containment and deterrence. The consistency of purpose with which those strategies have been applied has sent a clear signal to the Soviet Union and others that its ideological and territorial expansionism would be actively resisted. Western strength and Western resolve are seen to be achieving their purpose. The coalition parties have consistently and unambiguously supported the Western strategy of deterrence. We have done so at times when peace groups and, let it be said, elements of the Australian Labor Party kept insisting that Western policies of peace through strength were aggressive, provocative or doomed to failure-or all of those or a part of those. No-one should neglect the role that Western resolve in its strategic policies has played in bringing about the current changes in eastern Europe. We know that it is as unrealistic to pretend that everything has changed as it is to insist that nothing has changed. Historic turning points, such as those that we are witnessing in eastern Europe, are not the time for hasty decisions; nor are they the time for smug complacency. Euphoria can hardly become a substitute for sober judgment. The resolution of the current instability in eastern Europe will above all be a test of statesmanship. It will call for high and sustained levels of insight and for prudence and courage on the part of many governments. I think it was Graham Greene in one of his novels who, in regard to people journeying off, used the phrase 'a journey without maps'. In many ways, the leaders of the Western world, and other leaders today, are on a journey without a map as they seek to find their way through the unravelling of the centralised communist socialist states. As they deal with the multiplicity of issues that arise as a consequence, I hope that those elements of insight, prudence and courage will charter an effective course. But at this moment the journey does not have a clear and established blueprint. There are two fundamental challenges that will call for these qualities of insight, prudence and courage. The first is to engender some sense of stability and confidence in eastern and central Europe over the coming weeks and months. Without political stability the prospects for economic reform are immeasurably diminished. The second and longer term task is to focus on a new political, economic and security framework that takes account of the changed realities. I noted at the outset that we can be more certain about the causes of the recent dramatic developments in eastern Europe than we can be about their consequences. It is timely to recall de Toqueville's warning that the most dangerous moment for an oppressive regime is when it starts to reform and particularly when in the process rising expectations are frustrated and disappointed. Events in eastern Europe are still unfolding and we cannot predict where and when they will stabilise. An imposing agenda is building up of unresolved issues, spawned by the current crisis. The implications of large movements of population are being assessed. The economic and political relationship between eastern Europe and the European Community is being reviewed, fuelled by fears that economic turmoil could stifle the tentative steps now being taken towards constructive political reform. The future of both the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and the Warsaw Pact is being debated. The possibility and the desirability of many's re-unification or of a neutral united Germany are being assessed more directly. Military operations in the heart of Europe are being reassessed. The negotiations on conventional arms levels in Europe now have a new context in which to be conducted, and looming in the background against all of these contingencies is the possibility of a backlash against the reform movements in eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. None of these challenges is insoluble, but all of them are generating uncertainty and doubt. The test of statesmanship in the 1990s will be to encourage the reform processes in ways that generate confidence and security, and to ensure that the new Europe will be the product of diplomacy and not armed conflict. In the interim, as a new framework is being constructed and until there can be more certainty about the nature of the changes we are witnessing, prudence will be called for in considering major changes to the economic and security policies that have served Western countries so effectively in the postwar era. Western countries must ensure that the good intentions that we have seen demonstrated in recent statements by the East German and other east European governments are matched with the. appropriate action. Real changes in the direction of greater political pluralism in market economic reforms and the protection of human rights will be worthy of our encou-agement and support. The significance of recent events in eastern Europe is not confined to Europe's borders. They could generate a significant movement of population, they could generate important changes in the pattern of trade and financial flows, and they could lead to a major review of European security planning and military deployments, including a reassessment by the United States of the basis for its own approach to these issues in Europe as well as beyond it. The situation in Europe will ultimately be settled by the European nations themselves in consultation with their allies, in particular the United States. However, Australians need to recognise the wider consequences of the changes now under way and acknowledge that our national interest will be affected by Ger- them. There is a need for a considered and detailed assessment of the implications of the current European upheaval for Australian security, trade, financial and other interests. The silence from the Government on this dimension of the European crisis has deafening, but when we assume government we will certainly rectify that inadequacy. No-one can yet be certain of the precise scale of historical change that we are nessing in eastern Europe. It could be the first steps towards a new European grand settlement that takes up where Yalta Potsdam left off. It could be the beginnings of a global democratic revolution or, natively, only a brief flowering of both and change. Some would argue that we be seeing the beginning of the end of politics and ideological conflict-even, in phrase that is certainly generating such tense debate in the United States, of history' itself. Those of us on this side of the House who have read the argument supporting that thesis would reject it. However, for the moment these speculations that and no more. It is right that we welcome and encourage the liberating changes that we are seeing, but we should always distinguish between concessions to the blatant bankruptcy of communism by its former adherents, which mayor may not endure, and the ongoing economic and strategic competition between states, which most certainly will. It is this House. mood of cautious optimism and realistic hope that inspires the Opposition's motion today, and I commend it to the House.",22
38,Mr HAWKE ,EASTERN EUROPE,"Wills-Prime Minister) (3.33)-ln seconding this motion I indicate that, of course, the Government supports it. At the outset I say that I am pleased that the Opposition has now discovered portance of eastern Europe. This discovery is no less welcome for being very recent. For example, the Liberal and National parties left eastern Europe completely out of their . foreign affairs policy which was produced March this year-left it out Western Europe is there, the Middle East is there, Africa is there and so is Antarctica. But one will look in vain for anything at on the Warsaw Pact countries other Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR).

52,Deus ex machina,EASTERN EUROPE,Opposition members interjectingMONICA,28
53,Mr HAWKE,EASTERN EUROPE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, we hear nothing but noise from the Opposition. I will prove the accuracy of what I have just said. When I have quoted from the present Opposition Leader arid recent Leader, members opposite may want to respond, but first let them listen to what those honourable gentlemen have said recently. Almost exactly two years ago, I visited the Soviet Union and met there at length with Mr Gorbachev and other Soviet leaders. Before I left, the then Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Bennelong, who is now back on the front bench, raised a matter of public importance purporting to instruct me on how I should conduct myself during that visit. In attempting to instruct me on that visit to Mr Gorbachev, the then Leader of the Opposition-and I ask these interjecting irrelevancies on the other side to note what he had to say-said: There is no evidence that glasnost has - ny application in the way in which the Soviet Union pursues its basic foreign policy or external milit-ry objectives, apart from presenting a more attractiye public relations face to the Western media. On my return, the then Leader-and we must give him marks for consistency-said: The Prime Minister has not been able to produce any evidence that glasnost has any application to the way in which the Soviet Union pursues basic foreign policy objectives or its external military objectives. I say to the Opposition: tell that to the people of Afghanistan; tell it to the people of Angola and the people of Namibia; tell it to Mr Rakowski in Poland, to Mr Grosz in Hungary, to Mr Honecker in the German Democratic Republic, and to Mr Zhivkov in Bulgaria. In July this year, I visited Hungary, being the first Australian Prime Minister to do so. The timing of the visiting, Mr Deputy Speaker, could not have been more fascinating. The Hungarian leaders had just honoured, more than 30 years after their tragic deaths, Imre Nagy and his colleagues of 1956. They had just announced their intention of holding free elections, and they had just legalised the opposition. Of course, I found these events enormously encouraging and important, and I said so at that time. What was the response of this new Leader of the Opposition-a former Foreign Minister? In commenting on the report I had given to the Parliament, the Leader of the Opposition said: The Prime Minister made reference today to his visit to Hungary. Like Cleopatra in her barge, we had the sight of our Prime Minister sailing down the Danube proclaiming that the world 'was at a turning point in history'. There was his cynical response. When I acknowledged the significance of what was happening at that time the best that this cynical Leader of the Opposition could do was to say, 'There was the Prime Minister floating down the Danube on a barge proclaiming that the world was at a turning point in history'. He went on, and honourable members should listen to. this and savour it: The Prime Minister's belief that the new democratic process emerging in Hungary will automatically flow through to other Eastern European nations is not borne out in fact. What did he say? Let me repeat it so that honourable members get the full gist of it: The Prime Minister's belief that the new demothat cratic process emerging in Hungary cally flow through to other Eastern European nations is not borne out in fact. What of Czechoslovakia? What of East Germany? What a pathetic performance! The Leader of the Opposition is touched, as he should be. He talks nonsense and he cannot cop exposure. EmptyHere you know it.",28
54,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,EASTERN EUROPE,",---Order! The Leader of the Opposition will withdraw. EmptyHere",29
55,Mr HAWKE,EASTERN EUROPE,He cannot take it. EmptyHere,29
56,Mr HAWKE,EASTERN EUROPE,"He cannot take it. I may not have Cleopatra's nose, but I will back my nose and my Government's nose on dePresident velopments in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and eastern Europe and, indeed, on any other aspect of foreign policy against that of the Opposition and its pusillanimous lenges. leader. We are indeed witnessing a process of profound historic importance. Nobody can fail to be moved by the extraordinary and exhilarating events that we see daily on television screens. As we encounter the shock of the new, as we see repugnant but familiar divisions disappear, as we see peoples used to repression and orthodoxy now rejoice freedom and rights denied to them for genStates erations, our minds understandably worried by some of the anxieties of what comes next. But my instinct is that, for the peoples of Europe and for the international system as a whole, the changes are wholly positive. We should ask ourselves the quesdiscussions tion: To what do we owe these develophim ments? First of all and without question, most important fundamental reason is that they are a tribute to the unquenchable spirit of freedom of men and women. Events in Moscow, Warsaw, Budapest, Berlin, Prague, Sofia-let us hope before in Bucharest--,---show that one can control, perhaps for a very long period, what people say, but one cannot control what they think. In democracies we have properly known this to be the truth, to be the characteristic our society. I find it reassuring-I trust all members of this House find it reassuring-,-to know and to be reminded so vividly that is a truth also within the dictatorwill automatiships of this world. The positive role of President Gorbachev has obviously been an issue of critical importance in these matters. When I met him and his colleagues in 1987-as I say, I had the singular good fortune of being with President his Gorbachev for a very long period-I was struck then by their unvarnished acknowand ledgmentof the economic crisis into which the Soviet Union had fallen. The words of Mr Gorbachev were an acknowledgment that the Soviet Union was in a pre-crisis economic condition. Coming from a tradition where different approaches have often prevailed, the Soviet Union is to be congratulated on recognising that economic reform cannot be divorced from political reform. The USSR faces great challenges and indeed Gorbachev himself faces very great challenges. I believe that I speak for everyone in this House in expressing the hope that they will find a way of meeting these chalThe response of the West has also been of great significance. I believe that the responsible and constructive attitude of President our Bush and of the European Community has created the right international atmosphere in which reform can flourish. It is important now to broaden the dialogue, and I applaud in the statesmanlike decisions of the United President and the Soviet President to may be meet off Malta in early December. Australia has not been a passive spectator during these events. Naturally I was pleased that President Bush himself has publicly acknowledged that we had an impact, in the that he asked me to have with on my return from Hungary, on the the Bush Administration's response to events in Hungary. That is his own public response. We have worked with the 24 Western nations to coordinate material assistance to eastern Europe. On 15 October I announced long a package of measures to provide economic assistance to Poland and Hungary. The package includes food aid to Poland to the value of $5m, the extension of the Australian system of tariff preferences to both Poland and of Hungary, and the negotiation of double taxthat ation agreements and investment protection agreements with both countries. It is important to understand that the thrust of these measures is not to provide charity, but to give Poland and Hungary a better opportunity to help themselves and to reinvigorate their economies. In addition, the Government has for some years maintained a refugee and special humanitarian immigration program for the people of eastern Europe. Australia's engagement in charting a new course of international relations will not there. I have asked Senator Evans to visit Europe next month and to bring forward to Cabinet recommendations on further steps Australia should take. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade will visit Brussels Bonn to participate in the coordination of the Western response. He will attend a ministeriallevel meeting in Brussels of the Group of 24 to discuss the strategic political and economic implications of the changes. He will visit those east European capitals at the forefront. of the reform process. That visit will allow Senator Evans to address developments first hand, to meet the leadership of these countries, and to determine the constructive role Australia can play. (Extension of time granted.) The winds of change obviously are yet to blow completely through eastern' Europe and we cannot yet be certain"" of the outcome. Romania is still a closed, repressed society. In Czechoslovakia the current leaders, whose days are obviously numbered, do not understand yet that police truncheons will not halt the reform process. I urge them to enter a civilised dialogue with the Czechoslovak people, as their neighbours have done. Human rights in the Soviet Union and some east European countries, while significantly improved, still fall a long way short of what we see as appropriate standards. Nevertheless, by any standard we can say that 1989 is a landmark in world history. In Poland my counterpart as Prime Minister is not a communist; he is a leader of Solidarity, a group which earlier this year was a banned organisation. In Hungary the Communist Party is itself abolishing communist rule and is transforming that country into a liberal democracy with close links to the political and economic institutions of western Europe. In East Germany, the starkest reminder of the Cold War, the physical embodiment of a world where the family of nations was divided, the Berlin' Wall has been breached and replaced. The reforms instituted by President Gorbachev are sweeping aside the old order in the German Democratic Republic as the new authorities prepare to introduce fundamental changes to their system. I say genuinely that I take heart in the fact that the Government and the Opposiend tion are now at one in acknowledging the importance of and welcoming the changes in eastern Europe. Not only do we have a deep obligation to respond positively to these dramatic changes but we owe it to all fellow and Australians who, with us, yearn for a more secure, more peaceful and more prosperous world.

58,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,AIRLINE PILOTS DISPUTE,"Mr Ronald Edwards)- Mr Speaker has received a letter from the honourable member for Fadden ( Mr Jull) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The cost to the taxpayer of the subsidies involved in the present airline dispute. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their placesMONICA",31
59,Mr JULL ,AIRLINE PILOTS DISPUTE,"Fadden) (3.52)-1 think I would be correct in saying that, when this Parliament met in the last week of August and we were confronted with the prospect of a national airline strike, nobody dared to believe that this dispute would go on for 15 long weeks. Nobody dared to believe that this would be the most devastating dispute that had ever been experienced in Australia and I think nobody would have believed that any government would be prepared to face Australians with the cost of this dispute. It has been well documented in this House as day after day, during the length of this dispute, the Opposition has raised questions and matters of public importance as to what is really happening in Australia as an ongoing result of this dreadful dispute. Time and again we have chronicled the facts that already the tourist industry has lost in excess Opportunity of $600m; that more than 22,000 people in the tourist industry have lost their jobs; that our greatest export earner is being destroyed; that people are walking out of that industry; and that it will take us years and years to get it back. Almost forgotten by this House in recent times have been the promises that were made very early in the piece as to the Government's contribution to the airlines and to other institutions around Australia to try to keep the system going and to try to provide recompense for the airlines that were providing just skeleton services. One thing that has been absolutely deafening by its silence has been the Government's attitude as to just how much that dispute has cost Australia thus far. In fact, if we look back at the records and the public statements we see that we can properly recall only three. Very early in the piece the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) told us that the Government was prepared to spend up to $100m to try to overcome the difficulties that were facing the airlines at that stage. A little later we heard the Treasurer ( Mr Keating) say that this dispute would probably cost the public purse only in the vicinity of $30m. In terms of the recompense to be paid to the airlines we have to date heard only one major pay-out figure, and that was a little over $700,000 to Ansett Airlines of Australia, which I believe was the recompense that was paid to that airline, from memory, up to II September. As this Parliament draws to a dose for this year we believe that the taxpayers of Australia have a very real reason to know just what this dispute is costing in terms of their contribution to the airlines. We also believe that the tourist industry has a real right to know what sort of recompense is being paid to the airlines and not to it. also want to know what government instrucharter mentalities are forgoing in revenue as a sult of this dispute. According to the popular figures, the cost to the Federal Airports poration (FAC) is in the vicinity of $5m $6m a week, and, as has been rumoured around this place, the Civil Aviation Authormoney ity (CAA) has already lost in the vicinity $50m to $60m during the time of this diswill pute. We want to know what those figures are and what contribution has to of the pockets of the taxpayers of Australia. Very early in the piece a question was asked of the Minister for Defence ( Mr Beazlian ley) about the costs to the Royal Australian Air Force of providing aircraft under charter to Ansett to provide the emergency services. We questioned very closely the rates that Government was charging the airlines for the hire of those Boeing 707, Hercules and HS748 aircraft. At that time the Minister for Defthe ence told us that he was not absolutely sure what the subsidy might be but he was deterthe mined to find out and would report back to the Parliament, and he was hopeful that some adjustment might be able to be made. At this stage we have heard not. one word from the Minister for Defence. We, have absolutely no idea what the public subsidy might be on those aircraft. We have also learnt that, when the pilots resigned and the superannuation payments had to be made, there were some difficulties within Australian Airlines as to the amount of money that had to be injected into its superannuation fund to payout the pilots. We do not· know what the amount of money was in the unfunded section of the Austrathe lian Airlines pilots' superannuation fund was. These figures add up. If we listen to the predictions and the rumours that have around, we could probably say that, those terms, this dispute has already cost the taxpayers of Australia in excess of $120m. If that figure is denied by the Government, let government. the Government give us a breakdown of the exact cost. If we believe that this dispute has been costly so far, if we believe that we are the worse of it, we have another think comPerth ing, because a few things are abundantly clear. They include the cost to our tourist industry, admittedly, but we have yet to see We the cost to the Australian economy of the of wet lease aircraft from overseas recompanies to ply the Australian and Ansett routes. At the moment 11 or 12 of those Coraircraft are flying around Australia. Sure, to some fares will be going to that, but we would like to know just how much of our is going out of the country to pay for of those wet lease charters and what the effect be on Australia's balance of payments. It is my understanding that, at this stage, no come out moneys have yet been paid. Since this dispute started, the international carriers already operating between Austraports have been flying domestic passengers throughout the length and breadth of the nation. How much has been involved in that operation? While many of us could be the thankful for having been able to get a ride on .those planes, let us never forget that we have to pay those overseas companies for privilege of using their routes. Is the figure of $20m a month too low? If that is case in the third month of the dispute, will another $60m go out of Australia to pay people such as British Airways, Singapore Airlines, Garuda Indonesian Airways and the other carriers that have been involved in that operation for the rights for Australians to use those seats on international services? We have heard from the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories ( Mr Holding)-and in a bipartisan way the Opposition welcomes this move-that the Government will provide some $30m as part of its tourism restoration program. We are not denying that that operation will be successful and will probably require a great deal more than just $18.5m that will be poured into the industry to try to get it back to its former glory. Let us not forget that that industry been was our No. 1 export earner and No. 1 in just earner of foreign exchange. Dr Charlesworth-Not while you were in",31
60,Mr JULL,AIRLINE PILOTS DISPUTE,"It will take a great deal of time and effort and a great many years to rebuild that industry and get it back to its over former glory. The honourable member for interjects. I suppose the brighter side of this is that it will be a coalition governGovernment ment which will have to rebuild that ular industry. It will be these parties that will be directing the operations so that things are done absolutely correctly and well. That $30m has been put up for tourism promotion and the provision of an extra $lm has been announced today to go to Western Australia to help those industries. This Government completely ignored Western Australia last week and said it did not exist. It said that the tourist industry in Broome and Karratha and the whole north-west of Western Auscoming. tralia was in such a fine position that it did not need any help. When the hoteliers of Perth said, 'Really, our occupancy rates not 84 per cent, like the Government says; they are more like 28 per cent', it finally came good with another $lm. The point we have to make is that all this has to be funded from somewhere. It is funded by the taxpayviding ers of Australia. There are two other aspects that this House must consider. We would like some direction and information from the Government to booming. ease our concern. The first of those questions is: What is the future and what are the Government's plans for the future of Australonger? lian Airlines? Last week the - Chairman of Australian Airlines, Mr Ted Harris, said quite publicly on the Australian Broadcasting poration PM program that this dispute thus far had cost Australian Airlines at least $55m. He admitted that the .cost to Australian lines was probably going to be much more than that. If we believe the financial pages of the newspapers around Australia it would seem that the airlines are bleeding each the extent of $8m to $10m a week. Obthe viously that statement by Mr Harris could be quite conservative. Nobody on this side of the House would ever deny the fact Australian Airlines has been undercapitalised for years. That is one of its real difficulties. Australian Airlines made just on $110m last year in profits. It has sold five DC9 aircraft and one 727 aircraft. I ask the Minister what it would have received for those-about each? If we do a few sums we can obviously see that Australian ''Airlines is in a grave financial position. We want to know what happens at the end of the day with Austrathis lian Airlines. Do we pick up the tab to resurrect that particular service or does say that it will let it rot and die particas part of the deregulation process? The other thing that has come to our notice is that it is not only Australian Airlines which is feeling the pinch of this particular dispute. The truth is coming out, despite what the Treasurer has said before, that Qantas Airways Ltd is most concerned about the way this particular operation is now going. It is suggested that at a minimum up to $60m could be slashed from its profits next year because the tourists are just not We are all getting reports about the Qantas aircraft that are coming in half full. We all saw the newspaper reports just last are week saying that Qantas has slashed fares from Japan to Australia by 40 per cent to try to build that traffic. We commend Qantas in terms of its assistance in trying to promote the crippled tourist industry by proinnovative fares. The real stories are that Qantas has had a magnificent couple of years because its aircraft have been packed to the gunwale, as the tourist industry was Now it recognises that it is in trouble. What is going to happen to it if this stupid dispute is allowed to continue much We are looking for guidance from the CorGovernment as to what is involved from the taxpayers of Australia. We want to know what the cost has been to the F AC and what Airhelp has been given to it by the Government so far. We want to know what the real story is in terms of the Civil Aviation Authority and how much money it is down. Is it true to that there is a document circulating within bureaucracy in which the CAA is saying that it may have to borrow money to pay staff wages because the Government has not that come good as yet? We want to know what the real subsidy has been from the Royal Australian Air Force in terms of providing these emergency services. We also want to know what the contribution has been to the Australian Airlines superannuation fund. We $7m desperately want to know what the future is for Australian Airlines. We really want to know what other plans the Government has on the plate for trying to resolve ridiculous dispute. The sad thing is that 15 weeks into the pilots strike there is no the indication that it is going to end.",32
61,Mr NA BROWN ,AIRLINE PILOTS DISPUTE,"There is no dispute, according to the Prime Minister.",34
62,Mr JULL,AIRLINE PILOTS DISPUTE,"We are told that there is no dispute. We are also told by various Ministers in this Government that there are hundreds of pilots signing up with the airlines. We actually did an exercise. If honourable members look at the public statements of Sir Peter Abeles and Mr MCMahon from Ansett and its public relations man, the Prime Minister the Minister for Transport and Commu-ications ( Mr Willis) and the MinEmptyHere ris) honourable members will be delighted to know that so far Ansett has signed up 1,314 pilots. The real story is that as of t?day Australian Airlines has signed up 24 ptlots, Ansett has signed up 58 pilots and East-West Airlines Ltd has signed up 13 pilots. If we believe the information that is coming through at the moment-that is, .that we are going to get 90 per cent of servIces cate-ed for by Christmas-we have another thmk coming. There is no indication that this dispute over. The indications from the timetables that are published by Australian Airlines and Ansett, compared with normal schedules, are that at the moment we have about 42 per cent capacity. I think we have another think coming if we believe there is any hope of a dramatic improvement in the situation of the tourist industry or a dramatic improvement in terms of the contribution the F AC, the CAA and other government instrumentalities are making to this particular exercise. If we are to have 90 per cent capacity by Christmas, we want an announcement by the Government saying that all recompense and subsidies are going to cease. If things are S? good I hope the Minister for Telecommumcations and Aviation Support ( Mrs Kelly) will tell us this afternoon that that is so. This dispute is alive and well. The cost tourism and the Australian economy, and most particularly the direct subsidy out of the pockets of Australian taxpayers to the airlines is still going on. We all want to know iust how much money is being provided by the taxpayers.",34

Before I do so I w0!lld .lIke to point out to the House the motIvatIon behind this matter of public importance today. The motivation can be found in the document entitled Go Around. It is prepared by the Australian Federation of Air Pilots (AFAP) and it tells us wh-t is happ-nin-. It is really telling us what IS happenmg m this Parliament. It is really telling us what has been the basis of the speech that we have just heard in this House. What is happening in Go Around? Go Aro-nd tel-s. us that links are being developed WIth polttIcal groups that support an end to the dispute. Quite clearly, it means the Opposition. What are the issues that the Federation is going to push? Firstly, it has emp-oye- pu-­ lic relations consultants to help It WIth ItS image. Obviously, the -:,-FAP is. concer!1eabout the image that it IS presentmg. ThIS IS rightly so. So what is. it doing? Instead of is getting back to work It has decIded. to e.mploy a public relations consultant. It IS g-mg to highlight the shallowness of the clal-s that the airlines are restoring capacIty quickly. This is one ?- the po-nts .tha- w-re raised by the OpposItIon. It IS hlghltghtI-g the effect of what it calls the Hawke-HarnsAbeles-Kelty axis. Again, this is the b-s-s of the question asked by the shadow Mmlster for tourism, aviation and sport, the honourable member for Fadden ( Mr Jull), in Question Time today. The AFAP is exposing the real cost to the public of the use of the subsidised Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) aerop-anes. This was - n.other important issue raIsed by the OpposItIon today. Basically the whole motivation for the response by the Opposition toda- has bee- to give support to the AFAP and ItS campaIgn. to The AFAP's campaign is totally unrealistic. Let me read a paragraph from Go Around so that every Australian can just get some understanding of the thought processes of this AFAP membership. It states: Each major undertaking through history has had its underpinning in solid preparation. The Allies worked for four years after Dunkirk before D-Day; most of that preparation would have been slow and very unspectacular-but like us, they knew victory could only come by doing it right! What an unrealistic view of this industrial dispute! What a farce it is to think that that is the solution. Do honourable members know what the Federation is preparing for, what it is trying to stir up its membership to do? It is stirring up its members for scab patrols. I will tell honourable members what it has said about scab patrols at the airport. It said: The ""scab patrols"" are especially effective and do help our cause enormously. That is the sort of unrealistic language it is using to stir up its members, to keep them in the fold and get them ready for their scab patrols. These are the people who have been holding this country to ransom. They are the people who have motivated this matter of public importance today. But I do not want to get bogged down in that. I want to deal with the serious aspect of this problem and what the Government has done about it in a very constructive waytotally contrary to the attitude of the Opposition. It is true that we have spent money; I am not embarrassed about that one bit. Do honourable members know why we have spent it? We do not want to throw money away. We spent that money to keep the airlines flying. We did that so that constituents of all members in this place could get around the country. It would have been much easier for the Government to sit on its hands and say to the airlines, 'Do it yourselves'. Instead of that, we have given financial assistance. Mr Nehl-It would all have been over by now.",34
65,Mrs KELLY,AIRLINE PILOTS DISPUTE,"A member of the Opposition interjects, 'It would all have been over'. I will tell honourable members what would have happened if we had gone the. Opposition's way. If we had caved in and given the pilots their 30 per' cent pay rise, who do honourable members think would have been next in line with hands held out? I have responsibility for the aviation industry and I know that those working in other areas would have been queued up. The Opposition may think that its way would have settled this dispute. It might have settled it for one week, but others would have followed. We would have had a stop-start airline industry. The dispute would have gone on not for 15 weeks, but for months and months. There is no way that it would have been restricted to the airline industry. It would have flowed on through the entire economy. The entire wages system would have broken down. That is why we had to do something about it. That is why we gave assistance-not just because we wanted to throw money out of the window. We did it because the Government believed that we had to take a constructive role in this dispute for the good of the people in this country and for the future of the tourism industry. Members of the Opposition laugh, but all we hear from them is criticism. The latest criticism has been of the RAAF. The men and women of the RAAF have been dedicated to the service of this country and have done much to help those people living in isolated parts of Australia. The only thanks they get from the Opposition is criticism, which is totally despicable. Mr Brumby-Fabricated.",35
66,Mrs KELLY ,AIRLINE PILOTS DISPUTE,"My colleague says, 'Fabricated'. One of my responsibilities is the Civil Aviation Authority. The Government has responsibility, through the Civil Aviation Authority, to ensure air safety in this country. Its officers do an excellent job. But what have we seen throughout this dispute? We have seen the fabrication of story after story about safety being neglected. Instead of making people feel secure about the RAAF and the services it has tried to provide for this country, the Opposition has undermined us every step of the way. Some honourable members may say, 'Well, that is politics. What do you expect?'. To that, I say that, when the country is in a crisis situation, as it has been because of the actions of the AFAP, I would expect that to be a time for unity. Instead, we have had from the Opposition consistent screeching and yelling in such a negative way. The Opposition has asked us for some information and I am only too. pleased to provide the information that I have to date on how much this dispute has cost us as taxpayers. But, if I were to ask Australian taxpayers whether they were happy to pay this, I think the answer would be an overwhelming yes. I will tell honourable members about the waivers to date. A total of $6.4m in employee cost equivalents has been approved for reimbursement to the airlines in the form of a waiver of statutory charges. That is made up of a waiver of charges of $2.3m for Australian Airlines and $4.1m for Ansett Airlines of Australia. During the last half of September, airline employees who could not be usefully employed were required to take leave under the terms of the Australian Council of Trade Unions airlines agreement. The return to work of staff previously required to take leave will obviously result in higher claims for a period. However, as operational capacity expands, as is now the case, the level of claims is expected to decline, with more staff able to be usefully employed by the airlines. So we are providing assistance. I do not want to run away from that. But it is there only when the airlines need it, and they have done everything they can to get their staff to take holiday leave, et cetera. The reason we needed to provide that assistance was principally that we are now in the process of rebuilding. Had we not given that support, the rebuilding would have taken so much longer because it is a very integrated industry. Without the pilots, everything else could have collapsed. Of course, that is what the Opposition and the AFAP wanted. I am thrilled that I can stand up· in this place and say that we were able to provide that assistance. Today I can say that the RAAF will be able to pull out by 15 December because it has done its job and its duty-and extremely well. On the issue of RAAF assistance, I will give some details of what the airlines are paying for. The airlines are responsible for providing at their own expense the fuel, the crew and ground maintenance staff accommodation, meals and transfer costs, ground handling, aircraft cleaning, in-flight rations and minor miscellaneous expenditure. In addition, the airlines are paying an hourly rate to cover spare parts and contractor maintenance. Those hourly rates are $1,500 for 707s, $800 for 748s and $970 for C130s. The cost to the RAAF will depend on the number of hours that will be flown to 15 December, when the RAAF services will be withdrawn. I understand from statements today that the Opposition supports the tourism assistance package. I am very pleased to see that we at least get its support for that. The package will provide $18.5m for the Australian Tourist Commission to rebuild Australia's image as an international tourist destination. A further $12.75m will be spent on domestic advertising, $5m of which will be spent to encourage Australians to take their holidays here rather than overseas, and $7.75m will be spent to promote those regions most affected by the disruption, namely, north Queensland, the Northern Territory, Western Australia and Tasmania. Another very important provision deserves a mention. If it can be demonstrated that a business is unable to pay provisional or company tax because of the disruption, the Commissioner of Taxation has advised that the tax may be deferred without penalty. Obviously, that is an issue for the Taxation their Commissioner, but it is a very important initiative and will be very well received. Before I conclude, I wish to take up the issue of the capacity of the system at the moment. We just heard from the Opposition all the derogatory comments about the rebuilding process. I will give a few facts in this debate. We are slowly rebuilding the airlines. In the week ended 17 November about 230,000 seats were available on the domestic airline network. That is an average of over 32,000 per day. Seventy-five per cent of those were on company and leased aircraft. As I have said, we will have phased out the RAAF operations by 15 December. The Government will continue to allow the international airlines to carry domestic traffic where such capacity is required by the domestic airlines. However, the domestic airlines expect that that international capacity will no longer be needed by 1 January. One important initiative we have seen is that firm timetables are now in place to allow bookings until the end of daylight saving. The timetables provide increasing frequency of service. These are all very good signs that rebuilding is well and truly under way. Rather than take a negative approach, I want to state the facts. Firstly, we have made financial contributions and we are not embarrassed about that at all. Secondly, we have used that money to provide the framework for rebuilding the airlines. Thirdly, we have done that to provide a service for Australians, particularly those living in remote parts of Australia. What has the Opposition provided? Mr Reith-You have wrecked the tourist industry singlehandedly.",35
67,Mrs KELLY ,AIRLINE PILOTS DISPUTE,"I will tell the honourable member for Flinders who has wrecked the tourist industry. It is the Opposition, the AFAP and the Opposition's support for it. It is that support which we have seen today with this matter of public importance. What have the policies of '---the Opposition been during this dispute? The Opposition started by saying that it supported the Government, but that support disappeared pretty quickly. From then, the Opposition criticised the Civil Aviation Authority over safety; it criticised the Government all the time-but we expect that-and it criticised the airlines. What I do not tolerate is criticism from the Opposition of the RAAF and its role. The AFAP should really be condemned-and the Opposition's support for it. I thought the Opposition would have been above that and that, at times of crisis, we could have worked together. That did not prove to be possible. It is a disgrace, and one which the constituents of this country will remember for a very long time.",37
68,Mr SHARP ,AIRLINE PILOTS DISPUTE,"Gilmore) (4.22)-We have just heard from the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support ( Mrs Kelly) a speech on this matter of public importance which borders on the pathetic. It has been a long time since. we have heard from the Minister on the subject of the pilots dispute. It has been interesting to note how absent she has been during debates relating to what is basically her portfolio area. It seems that in matters as important as this we are not to hear from this Minister under normal circumstances-only on occasions such as this, when the senior Minister is away, is this junior Minister allowed to have a run. And have a run she has. She has had a run today telling us all sorts of things that could be described only as somewhat fanciful. She has told the House this afternoon that the Opposition has been negligent in its approach to this whole issue by attacking the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). Mr Deputy Speaker, I can assure you that on this side of the House nobody is attacking the RAAF. What we are attacking in this dispute is the way in which this Government is prepared to use the Royal Australian Air Force in the manner it has done during the last 15 or 16 weeks since this pilots dispute came to fruition. The Minister has also said during this debate that there is no problem with the Government throwing all the money that it has at the airlines during the last 15 weeksindeed, it has been a great idea. I put to the House the proposition that, by throwing money into this airlines dispute, all that the Government has achieved is to extend its du-ation and to magnify its consequences quite significantly. There is no doubt whatsoever that, if the Government was not prepared to roar in with tens of millions of dollars of taxpayers' money, the airlines would have sat down with the pilots months ago and negotiated a solution to this problem. There is no question at all that that is what would have happened. But, reinforced with taxpayers' funds and with the ridiculous comments made by the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke), the airlines have felt secure in engaging in this dispute simply because they know that, at the bottom of the table, will be the taxpayer paying the cost of it; and that has extended this dispute. That is why the Opposition has raised this matter of public importance today. The Opposition raises it because it is concerned at the level of subsidy that the Government is paying to the airlines-a subsidy which, at the end of the day, is doing nothing more than lengthening the dispute and magnifying the consequences of it. The consequences of this dispute go beyond just the cost to the taxpayer; they go to the heart of every Australian. The standard of living of every Australian is dropping and has already dropped as a consequence of this dispute, a dispute which has been promoted by the Prime Minister of this country. It cannot be denied that the tourism industry of Australia, which is an immediate and direct sufferer of this dispute, was Australia's fastest growing industry. It was also our biggest export earner; it had become our biggest export earner only a month or two before this dispute occurred. It was also the fastest creator of jobs in this country, particularly for young people. All of those things have gone out of the window. The tens of thousands of young Australians who could look forward to finding jobs in the tourism industry can forget that hope altogether. There are people losing their jobs in the tourist industry today because of this pilots dispute. More than 20,000 people have lost their jobs during the last 15 or 16 weeks as a consequence of this pilots dispute. Only last week the Westpac Banking Corporation brought out a paper showing that, as far as it could work out, the Australian economy has lost $1.2 billion as a consequence of this dispute-a dispute promoted and nurtured by the Prime Minister of Australia, an Australian Labor Party representative who bleats to the community that he is creating jobs for young Australians. He is not creating jobs for young Australians; he is actually taking them away. He is destroying the hopes and futures of many young Australians who could, and should, have been employed in the tourism industry-one of the best industries this country had to offer. It is not just young Australians, but all sorts of people who are involved in all walks of life in this country. I have referred before in this House to a butcher in Tasmania who has lost 80 per cent of his business because of the pilots dispute. I have talked about hire car operators here in Canberra whose families are being split as a consequence of the drop in income that has flowed from the pilots dispute. There is a good example in the Australian Capital Territory-an area with which the Minister will be very familiar and should take a direct interest in. The War Memorial tourist shop reports that the trade it would normally be doing at this time of the year is down by $3,000. When one asks why, the answer is: 'Because of the pilots dispute'. Taxi drivers in Canberra, Sydney and other places will say that, generally speaking, their business is down by 35 per cent. Why is it down? It is because of the pilots dispute. Why is the pilots dispute still going on today? It is because. of this Government's support for the airlines and its preparedness to throw taxpayers' money at the problem. All of these people are hurting. These are ordinary Australians. They are not big business people. Taxi drivers, hire car operators, people who run shops, butchers, and people who run tourist operations in the Northern Territory are ordinary Australians. To the Labor Government here in Canberra, ordinary Australians do not matter-they are the little people, and the little people do not· matter. The people who matter are the mates of the Government-mates who happen to own big businesses and mates in the trade unions. These are the people for whom Labor governs. They are not ordinary Australians. There are many good examples of it. If one wants to see what type of government this is, one just has to look at the formulation of the tourism task force by the honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr John Brown), which is funded with Government money. That group does not represent ordinary Australians or the bulk of the people who make up the tourist industry of Australia; it represents big business. A look at the people on that list will show that they are all big business operators in this country. They are the people that Labor steps in alongside; they are the people that Labor is prepared to put money towards; they are the people that Labor prefers to deal with-not the ordinary people who make up the economy of Australia, or who make up small businesses and who have built the tourism industry. One of the things that I have found galling as I have sat here on this side of the House representing the Opposition on matters relating to tourism is the fact that this Government used to claim full credit for the growth in our tourism industry, a growth which admittedly was tremendous. If this Government claimed full credit for the growth in the tourism industry a year or so ago, it can take full credit for the decline of the tourism industry today. There is no doubt whatsoever that our tourism industry is declining-not because of WorId Expo, as the Government tries to say it is, or because of the Bicentennial. Indeed, all people, including the Ministers from this Government, were saying that the tourism industry had strong growth prospects when Expo was on last year and when the Bicentennial was on. Now, of course, they say that the decline in the tourism industry is due to Expo and the Australian Bicentennial. What rubbish. What convenient use of the language. What convenient excuses. The decline in the tourism industry is the direct responsibility of this Government, and make no bones about that. Throughout the country ordinary people are losing their jobs and going bankrupt. In Launceston the other day a brand new hotel, which had only just opened, went broke. We see on the front pages of the papers that businessmen and entrepreneurs, be they people in hire car firms or be they people· who run tourism resorts, are going broke because of the way this Government has nurtured and supported the airlines by throwing taxpayers' money at them and by extending the dispute over the last 15 or 16 weeks. Whether it be the pilots dispute, whether it be the banks, whether it be Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd or whether it be even the wharfies, who are currently receiving $300m of the Australian people's money to sponsor their inefficient activities, this Government does not rule for the ordinary Australian or the small business operators who built the tourism industry. This Government rules for big business and for its trade union mates. That is what this Government is all about. And when the Government's big business mates and its trade union mates are in trouble, it throws taxpayers' money at them. That, I suggest to the Minister, who is sitting opposite, will be the demise of this Government because people see through that sort of activity. They do not like it and they will get rid of the Government because of it.",37
69,Mr BRUMBY ,AIRLINE PILOTS DISPUTE,"Bendigo) (4.32)-It is getting somewhat tedious-'tedious' is the right word for it-to hear the Opposition raise these matters of public importance week after week and mouth the platitudes of the Australian FederationMr Reith-You will not have to soon. Mr Hawker-Don't worry, old son; you won't have to do it for much longer.",39
70,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,AIRLINE PILOTS DISPUTE,Mr Hollis)Order! The preceding speaker was heard in silence. I suggest the same courtesy be extended to this speaker.,39
71,Mr BRUMBY,AIRLINE PILOTS DISPUTE,"It really is tedious. Week after week the Opposition raises matters of public importance and uses them simply as as vehicle for mouthing the platitudes of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots (AFAP). It has become so tedious that when the Opposition raised its matter of public importance today it barely scraped together the 10 members it needed to have this matter debated in the House. People were going out and scurrying everywhere to find Opposition members to support the Opposition spokesmen so that this matter could be debated. That is how tedious these matters that the Opposition brings into this House have become. All we heard today was more of the same. We have just heard another summary, another liturgy, of all the facts contained in the AFAP bulletin Go Around. All we heard today from both the Opposition speakersthe shadow Minister for tourism, aviation and sport, the honourable member for Fadden ( Mr Jull), and the shadow Minister for land transport and shipping, the honourable member for Gilmore ( Mr Sharp)-was a regurgitation of the campaign strategy espoused in Go Around. We also heard some fabrications today. The honourable member for Gilmore made some remarkable somersaults. He said, 'The National Party really has not impugned the integrity of the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). We have not made spurious claims; we have not made claims about its safety. All we want to do is ensure the safety of air passengers in Australia'. This matter was dealt with in Question Time. But just to remind the members of the National Party of Australia, the Federal Leader of the National Party, the honourable member for Richmond ( Mr Blunt), in his press release of 18 November, had this to say when talking about air safety: The latest allegation to come to my attention involving an RAAF Hercules fully laden with civilian passengers on a flight to north Queensland. The aircraft was in mid-air when a crack developed in one wing, forcing the pilot to descend to below 10,000 feet. After landing the damage was judged so bad that the aircraft was withdrawn from service. During Question Time today the Minister for Defence ( Mr Beazley) was asked about that allegation. The Minister, on advice from the air services, was able to say that claim was totally and absolutely false-a complete fabrication; that there was no domestic service carrying passengers in which a safety fault appeared; that it was a RAAF flight for military purposes; and that there was no threat to safety. Week after week those opposite have come into this House with fabrications of incidents involving air safety. They do not exist. But again those opposite have fabricated the position on this occasion. This matter of public importance which the Opposition has brought before the House basically attempts to assert that the cost to the Australian taxpayer of the programs we have put in place in relation to this issue is too costly. By wanting to know the exact cost to the taxpayer it is implying that this is a waste of taxpayers' money. I make it quite clear that everyone on this side of the House fully supports the views of this Government and the decisions taken by it in an effort to resolve this dispute properly in nation's long term interests. Today the Opposition managed to identify costs well under $100m at this point. The Minister was able to detail the moneys which have actually been paid or committed at this time and which are substantially below this amount. And those opposite infer that this is a waste or a misuse of taxpayers' money. Let me just make it clear: if the Opposition's policy had applied in this dispute, we would have seen the old cave-in philosophy of the past for which the Fraser Government was so noted. There was a cave-in on every hard dispute. That is what those opposite were famous for in government and they have learned nothing because they still espouse that policy in opposition. Those opposite would have caved into a claim for a pay rise of 30 per cent. There have been only two other periods in Australia's history when we had wage movements of that kind. One was in 1974 under the Whitlam Government and it soon spread throughout the work force with average weekly earnings increasing by more than 30 per cent. It also happened in 1981-82 under the Fraser Liberal Government with the metals deal. In one year we saw wage rises in the work force in excess of 16 per cent. The results of that were quite catastrophic for the Australian economy, and those opposite know it. If we had applied the Opposition's policies in this dispute we would have seen the old cave-in for which those opposite have become so noted. We would have seen a 30 per cent pay rise to Federation pilots and a flow-on effect right throughout the whole Australian economy. Responsible economists who have looked at this and done some sums have suggested that if a wage rise of around 30 per cent were suddenly applied throughout the Australian economy over 12 months we could contemplate that at least 300,000 people would lose their jobs. . Mr Reith-That is a laughable proposition.",39
72,Mr BRUMBY,AIRLINE PILOTS DISPUTE,"In 1982, 200,000 jobs were lost in one year-and that was not because of anywhere near a 30 per cent wage rise. The amount being paid in unemployment benefit in respect of those 300,000 job losses would be well in excess of $2 billion a the year-not $2m, $20m or $100m but $2 billion a year. If we then added the cost that would flow through Public Service pay rises, grants to the States and so on, we would probably be looking at a total cost to the Australian economy of in excess of $3 billion or $4 billion. That is what those opposite say they would prefer. They do not have the guts to say it publicly because they are a gutless Opposition-they are spineless. They say that they would prefer costs to the Australian taxpayers of around $3 billion or $4 billion instead of the amount that this Government has provided, which is well under $100m.. The honourable member for Flinders ( Mr Reith) keeps saying, by way of interjection, that there would be no flow-on of wages under Opposition policy. The point was raised in Question Time today by the Minister for EmptyHere if it were acceptable to pay a 30 per cent wage rise under the Opposition's policy, assuming a group in the community could show productivity improvements of that extent-' this is what the Opposition has said and the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), said on television on the weekend that he would be happy to give the pilots 15 per cent or 30 per cent provided there was productivitywhat would happen in the case of the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd steelworks in Newcastle where productivity has increased 50 per cent in the last 12 months? I ask the Opposition: Under its policy, is it saying that steel workers in Newcastle will get a 50 per cent pay rise? I cannot hear the answer. Mr Reith-I have been told I cannot respond to that.",40

75,Mr BRUMBY,AIRLINE PILOTS DISPUTE,"They are a spineless Opposition. They have had a succession of failed economic policies. Their latest Economic Action Plan is no better: it is a grab bag for swinging voters and people on middle comes. I conclude by saying that this matter public importance is no different from the other matters of public importance on this issue which the Opposition has been raising for some time. It has become a matter such tedium that the Opposition is struggling to get enough of its members to support its case. Today we simply saw a rehash of arguments. We saw a ""farrago of claims taken Springs. straight out of the AF AP Go Around publication. The Minister earlier spoke of that publication.

81,Mr TIM FISCHER ,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"Farrer) (4.45)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. It is a personal privilege to present this Bill, the End of War List Bill, to the House of Representatives following its passage through the Senate without division. I do so happily, both as a Vietnam veteran and as a colleague of Senator Julian MCGauran, who initiated this legislation in the Senate on 7 September last. There has been a considerable and welcome change in public attitudes regarding Vietnam veterans. This change is a sign of a maturity of thought within Australia and was best exemplified by the Welcome Home parade in Australia in late 1987. Whilst the Australian public has now sought to rectify an injustice in terms of the recognition which our Vietnam veterans so richly deserve, this process has not been extended by us as the community's representatives. Senator Julian MCGauran's End of War List proposal is a worthy initiative to correct this great injustice. The passage of this Bill through the Australian Parliament will enable the Australian Government to acknowledge exemplary service where it occurred throughout the Vietnam conflict. Whilst honourable members will have very definite opinions about the conflict and Australia's role in it, I would contend as forcefully as I can that the Australians involved represented their country in a most professional and selfless fashion. The special contribution of some soldiers, sailors and airmen has only been put into perspective with the advantage of hindsight and with the passage of time. This has. always been the case throughout Australia's military history. In the past this has been rectified through the means of an End of War List. Largely due to the public mood at the time of our troops returning· to Australia, no such End of War List was deemed appropriate for Australia's Vietnam veterans. As a result, there are war heroes in Australia going about their normal business and others who have never returned whose contributions have never been properly recognised. Now is the opportunity to correct a great injustice and extend recognition to those who so richly deserve it. I say this whilst acknowledging that there would be members in the chamber today who have very mixed feelings about the wisdom of Australia's involvement in the war. I ask all members to put aside any misgivings about our role in the war and concentrate their minds on the sacrifice and professionalism of those who were sent to Vietnam by this Federal Parliament. I turn to the specific proposal and again acknowledge the work of Senator Julian MCGauran and his comments to the Senate in relation to an End of War List for Vietnam. End of war lists are established for the purpose of recognising individual acts of valour that were overlooked in the disruption of the war. The list itself consists of a quota of awards, ranging from a 'Mention-in-Dispatches' to the highest honour of a Victoria Cross. The purpose of the Bill is to create an End of War List for the Australian defence personnel who served in Vietnam from 1962 to 1973. The Bill has the full support of the National Executive of the Returned Services League (RSL) and the Vietnam Veterans Association. The RSL has written to all its branches in Australia requesting its members to sign a petition of support. These petitions are being presented almost daily to the Senate. The establishment of an End of War List has much to do with maintai'ning a certain spirit of Australia, a spirit born out of the Gallipoli campaign-the ANZAC spirit, that spirit of pride and appreciation Australians have toward service men and women in times of war. Regardless of the horror and evil of war, Australians have always' had an appreciation of, and respect for, those who fought and died wearing the Australian uniform. That is what each ANZAC Day parade symbolises. Not to recognise individual acts of valour in the Vietnam War would be to destroy that spirit passed on through time. Unless the decision not to establish an End of War List is reversed, the Vietnam veterans can never be on a. par with veterans from past campaigns; The real hangover and shame of the lost Vietnam War comes from the fact that Parsupport liament has been unwilling to accept this age-old tradition, for the single reason fearing the revitalisation of the war debate. We have had to live with that mistake ever since the early 1970s. I am reminded of comments of one veteran who told Senator MCGauran that, while his attitude was against Australians being called up to fight, lieved that, once in the battle zone, every soldier was duty bound to fight with every ounce of strength for those fellow Austratively-to lians alongside him. If there was one weak link in the fighting chain all his mates be in danger. That was the atmosphere and reality of the war zone in Vietnam, regardthe less of the opinions and demonstrations home. It is to that spirit which those served in Vietnam were so true. It was not until the 1987 Welcome Home parade, organised by Peter Poulton and his committee and by Vietnam veterans themhave selves, with support eventually from across the board, that some 14 years after the diers had left the battlefields of South Asia the first step towards bridging the gap between the veterans and Australian society was taken. It was a very moving event for those who watched the thousands of AustraBill. lian men and women march. It was my privTribunal. ilege, alongside the honourable member for MCPherson ( Mr White) and many others, march on that occasion myself with the First Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment conRoyal tingent. The marchers had been given no victory, no glory and not even any pride having done their duty until that wonderful Welcome Home parade. On that day one could not help but bedid lieve that Australia had begun to heal the bitter divisions of war, that the spirit of that has made the Australian character unique in the world-that unique spirit of unconquerable determination of Australians against adversity-had returned. Certainly, that spirit of mateship was present that when stories of br-very and loss were told. If the coming home parade, the Welcome Home parade, was the first step, the second step must be the approval of this Bill grant an End of War List. The third step should be the issue of the Vietnam Campaign Medal to those who served on HMAS Sydney and other logistical ships, who have thus far been denied that recognition. The coalition has given an of absolute commitment, in a letter signed by the honourable member for Bennelong ( Mr Howard) and the right honourable member the for New England ( Mr Sinclair), and supported by the honourable member for EmptyHere he bemember for Richmond ( Mr Blunt)-the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the National Party of Australia respeccorrect the anomaly that exists in that a return from active service badge has would been issued to those who served on HMAS Sydney and other logistical support ships but Government has stopped short of grantat ing the Vietnam Campaign Medal. We say who that we should build on the good work of the Welcome Home parade. Let us provide, quite properly, through the passage of this Bill, the End of War List and let us also the granting of the Vietnam Campaign Medal to those in the special categories resolferred to, namely, those who served on the East HMAS Sydney and logistical support ship personnel, who thus far have been denied it. I now turn to the specific clauses of the It will establish an End of War List The Tribunal is to consist of three members, coming from the three arms of the to Australian Defence Force-the Royal Australian Navy, the Australian Army and the Australian Air Force. These members will be appointed by the Minister for Deffor ence. The function of the Tribunal will be to prepare a list of Australian service personnel who served in the Vietnam war and who not receive awards for valour in respect of the relevant military conflict but who all should, in the opinion of the Tribunal, receive such awards. The Tribunal is also to recommend to the Minister the level of the award that it believes should be granted. In keeping with the spirit of the original request day, by the Defence Force, a quota of some 30 awards can be recommended, although the Bill empowers the Minister to expand the list beyond the initial total of 30 awards. to The Tribunal in making its recommendation is not to have regard to whether or not the rigid monthly quota of awards used by the defence forces during wartime was filled. The Bill also establishes the principle that such a tribunal would be established for future military conflicts. This aspect of the Bill will ensure that political considerations of the time could never again prevent the creation of an End of War List. An End of War List has existed for World War I, World War II and other conflicts but was denied these Australians who proudly and professionally served their country in Vietnam. We are commemorating the start of World War II, some 50 years ago, and next year we will be commemorating the seventy-fifth anniversary of ANZAC Day, of the landing at Gallipolio There will be a special pilgrimage, which I again say the coalition supports, to take some 60 World War I veterans back to ANZAC Cove, with some eight war widows and some eight Legacy school children. Let this be the time to put aside the arguments for and against the Vietnam war. It is now time to turn to the question of finally bringing our troops home, through granting the End of War listing. I remind the House that some 496 Australians were killed in action in Vietnam. Some 2,398 Australians were wounded in action, and countless thousands of other people from various countries and from Vietnam itself were either killed or wounded in the course of that conflict. I know from personal observation first-hand that there were many acts of great valour which have yet to be recognised. A spirit of service, regardless of the controversy associated with Vietnam, dominated those of us who served this country in Vietnam, by the determination of this Parliament. We went there to do our job to the best of our ability, to provide a determined and dedicated level of service, which I think stands as one of the types of service that Australian diggers have given in other conflicts at other times this century. Not to have an End of War List is to do a great disservice to the 30 or so individuals who might be picked up by the End of War List Bill and a great disservice in a direct and indirect sense to all Australians who served in Vietnam. Finally, I point out that the End of War List initiative has the full support of the veterans community. It has the support of the Returned Services League, the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia, and many other organisations and individuals who have signed the. petitions which have been widely circulated at the initiative of Senator Julian MCGauran, who I note is in the environs of the chamber. I commend his work in relation to this proposal. It is only correct that with the perspective of hindsight Australia should correct this grave anomaly by granting the End of War List Bill passage through Parliament. This will continue the process of healing and the recognition of the contribution of a very worthy group of Australians. I cannot overstate my commitment to this Bill. I freely acknowledge that I am one who served in Vietnam, but this Bill stands on its merits as being right and proper at this time. Indeed, it would have been right and proper many years ago. It will continue the process of redressing the injustices which come out of so much that has been associated with . Vietnam. This Parliament sent Australians to Vietnam,· and this Parliament should now properly salute the extraordinary acts of valour committed by so many Australians in Vietnam in the service of their country. I commend the Bill to the House.",42

Second Reading Lamb, A. H. (Teller) Mr ROBERT BROWN (Charlton-MinLangmore, J. V. ister for Land Transport and Shipping Support) (5,10)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time, This Bill proposes new legislation, the Bounty Milton, P. Morris, Allan (Photographic Film) Act 1989, to provide bounty assistance to Australian manufacturMountford, J. O. O'Keefe, N. P. ers of sensitised photographic colour film from 1 January 1990 to 31 December 1992, Price, L. R. S. Punch, O. F. This legislation will remain in force for a further period of two years to 31 December Sawford, R. W. Scholes, O. O. D. 1994 for the purpose of securing the performance of undertakings under this legislation. The bounty arrangements contained in this legislation provide in clause 10 for a bounty to be paid at a rate of $3.75 per square metre of silver halide colour sensitised photographic film which has been sensitised and finished in Australia pursuant to conditions noted in clause 7, which I will discuss shortly. The Government's decision to bring forward this legislation results from the Government's consideration of recent events relating to Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd. On 24 August 1989, Eastman Kodak of the United States, the parent company of Kodak Australasia, announced that it would be restructuring its worldwide operations following disappointing financial results. The restructuring taking place over the next 12 months involves the sale, closing down or reorganisation of several operating units with combined revenues of $1.25 billion and the cutting of 4,500 jobs worldwide. One operating unit selected for closure· by Eastman Kodak was Kodak Australasia's manufacturing operations at Coburg, Victoria. Kodak Australasia's Coburg operation is Australia's second largest exporter of elaborately transformed manufactures. The operation contains a major research and development, manufacturing and distribution capability, employing some 1,500 people. For 1989, Kodak Australasia' forecast that, of its total sales of $472m, exports of $164m will be generated. The Australian operation is recognised, even by Eastman Kodak, as an efficient and world competitive operation. However, for strategic reasons, Eastman Kodak is unwilling to close down its less efficient operations in other parts of the world. For example, Eastman Kodak's plants in Europe are positioned to take advantage of the changes in 1992; Eastman Kodak is unwilling to close down its South American operations because of the existence of high tariff walls and very favourable taxation regimes; and its plants in the United States represent Eastman Kodak's corporate home base. Following an initiative by the management of Kodak Australasia, an undertaking from Eastman Kodak was obtained that, if Kodak Australasia could substantially improve its economic performance, Eastman Kodak would maintain and develop its Australian operations. To achieve this target, Kodak Australasia undertook to deliver $20m per annum in productivity improvements and to approach Federal and State governments for additional temporary assistance. The Victorian Government recently announced that it would assist Kodak Australasia through various measures at a level of approximately $6m over three years. This was granted on condition that the Federal Government would provide further assistance. In considering the question of whether to provide assistance to Kodak Australasia this Government has taken into account the significant contribution Kodak Australasia has made over a number of years in the areas of wealth and job creation, skills, technology and, most significantly, exports independent of any form of government assistance program. The signals from Eastman Kodak also suggested that a window of opportunity existed not only to overturn the closure decision but to press for a commitment to enhance Kodak's Australian operations in the Asian region in return for temporary assistance from this Government. In reaching a decision to provide assistance, the Government took account of the following major commitments from Eastman Kodak and Kodak Australasia. First, Kodak Australasia will be retained as a manufacturing plant for colour film employing sensitising operations for a minimum of three years and finishing operations for a minimum period of five years. Secondly, Kodak Australasia will retain its corporate mandate as the sole producer of Kodacolour 100 colour film for Australia and at least those Asian and other markets currently supplied by the company. Thirdly, Kodak Australasia will retain its export mandate into those Asian and other markets currently supplied by the company, and be entitled to seek further export markets in these regions. Fourthly, Kodak Australasia will implement significant productivity improvements through award restructuring, inventory, overheads and production line improvements. Fifthly, in the event that Kodak Australasia does not maintain its mandate for the Asia Pacific region over the next five years, Kodak Australasia has agreed to pay back any Federal government assistance provided. Finally, Kodak Australasia will be broadening its research and development activities within Australia over the next five years. Any changes in Government policy that would provide a comparative financial advantage to Kodak Australasia-for example, reduction of corporate tax rates or of tariffs on input costs-will be taken into account and any assistance provided reduced accordingly. In the light of Kodak's decisions, the Government favours the provision of support to Kodak and believes that a production bounty effectively incorporating the conditions referred to is the most appropriate form of assistance. This will, in the Government's view, enable the company to carry out and complete its restructuring satisfactorily, expand its export base substantially and enhance its research and development capabilities. The Bill contains the following substantive elements: To be eligible to receive bounty under this legislation, clause 7 requires the producer of bountiable film; , (a) to carry out in Australia all the sensitising and finishing operations in spect of the film; (b) to complete the finishing of the film in the first three years of the five-year period to which the Act applies; and (c) to be registered for the five-year period to which the Act applies. Clause 16, dealing with the registration of persons under the legislation, will enable regulations to be made prescribing conditions to be met by bounty claimants, including: A requirement that a registered person perform finishing operations for the whole of the period to which the Act applies; A requirement that a registered person maintain prescribed production levels, employment levels, and in a, plant of a prescribed production capacity; and A requirement that a registered person enter into a photographic industry development agreement for the period to which the Act applies, with progress under that agreement subject to an annual review. Bounty will be paid on the production of bountiable film where the producer satisfies all the preconditions I have described, and where the producer lodges a claim for payment within the first three years of the scheme. The proposal to limit this bounty to a three-year period brings this legislation into line with other pieces of bounty legislation which are scheduled to phase out by 199293. Retaining the legislation for five years, however, enables the Government to recover bounty payments in the event that the requirements of the legislation, including the registration conditions to be prescribed under clause 16, are not complied with by the intending claimant for the entire five-year period. The Comptroller-General of the Australian Customs Service is empowered periodically to monitor and audit the application of the bounty under clauses 20 to 24 to ensure that the bounty is paid in accordance with the legislation. , In framing this bounty legislation, the Government considers that its implementation will encourage the long term growth and development of sensitised film producre- tion in, Australia, assist in the modernisation of plant and equipment and lead to Australia enhancing its position aS,a major exporter of photographic film and related products. Exports are expected to total $1 billion in earnings over the next five years. The Government is satisfied that the commitments entered into between Eastman Kodak, Kodak Australasia and the Government and this legislation will provide a policy environment which will encourage health and efficiency in a sector vital to Australia's future growth as a manufacturing nation Financial Impact Statement The amount of money available for the payment of bounty, or advances on account of bounty under this scheme, is limited to that amount which is appropriated by the Parliament for that purpose under subclause 12 (2) ,and clause 31. In announcing the bounty scheme on 31 October 1989, the Government indicated that only the first three years of the bounty scheme would receive an appropriation totalling up to $36m, at an annual limit of up to $12m. The financial impact of this Bill by financial years is therefore $6m for 1989-90; $12m for 199091; $12m for 1991-92; and $6m for 1992-93. I commend the Bill to the House and present the accompanying explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Howard) adjourned. NA Suspension of Standing and Sessional",45

89,Mr BEAZLEY,URGENT LEGISLATION,"I move: That, in relation to the proceedings on the lowing Bills, so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the House making one declaration of urgency and moving one motion for the allotment of time in respect of all the Bills: Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) 1989; Industry Commission Bill 1989; Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) 1989; Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No.4) 1989; Courts and Tribunals Administration Amendment Bill 1989; Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.5) 1989; Broadcasting Amendment Bill 1989; Grain Legumes Levy Legislation 'Amendment Bill 1989; Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No.4) 1989; Housing Assistance Bill 1989; Bounty (Photographic Film) Bill 1989; Income Tax (International Agreements) Amendment Bill (No.2) 1989; Marine Navigation Levy Bill 1989; Marine Navigation Levy Collection Bill 1989; and Australian Heritage Commission Amendment Bill 1989.",48
90,Mr FIFE ,URGENT LEGISLATION,"Farrer-Manager of Opposition Business) (5.20)-This motion, apparently designed by the Leader of the House ( Mr Beazley) to slip through very quietly and quickly without people being aware of what it is all about, will help to put in place the guillotine. This is something that I have had cause to complain about recently ahd throughout last year. Indeed, this is a tack that is being used by the Government to limit ,debate on a number of Bills. All governmentS have used the guillotine. In that regard I plead guilty. As Deputy Leader of the House when the former Government was in office I introduced the guillotine, but it was always done very sparingly and in a way to ensure that on the one hand government Orders business was dealt with, but that there was adequate time for debate. Just before we rose a fortnight ago, the Government again resorted to the guillotine to get its legislation through. It cut off any meaningful debate on a whole range of important legislation covering education, prifol- mary industries, taxation and Aboriginal land rights. We had the same callous resort to the guillotine in the autumn sittings. This year the Government has used the guillotine on a disgraceful total of 42 Bills. Last year an incredible 93 Bills passed through the House under the guillotine-the highest number ever. That was the third year in which the Hawke Government chalked up record numbers. Apart from one year during the latter Menzies period, and 1971, the only other period in which the number of Bills declared urgent reached double figures was during the period of another Labor government-the Whitlam Government. Today the Government is going to restrict debate on a further 15 Bills. All these Bills must be debated and voted upon by just after midnight on Thursday. It is on again. It is all very well for the Leader of the House to say, as he has said on other occasions-and no doubt he will remind us this afternoon-that all we have to do on this side of the House is to tell our colleagues in the Senate to lift the 23 November cut-off date and the legislation will be dealt with in the current sittings without all this fuss and the need to use the guillotine. The Leader of the House is saying that he wants the senators to stay here right through until Christmas. I say to the Leader of the House and to the Government that they should start the sittings earlier and ensure that Ministers have the legislation ready when the session commences. If the Ministers were better organised they would have their legislation ready earlier and synchronised more realistically within the time frame of the proposed sittings of the House. Then there is the question of the sittings themselves. I put the rhetorical question to the Leader of the House: what is wrong with sitting earlier in February? We are coming back a week later than we used to. We could sit more frequently. There is absolutely no need to force legislation through this House in the way this Government is doing it. The Government is taking the House for granted; it is not taking it seriously; it is not giving adequate time for members to consider the legislation; and, indeed, some Bills have not even been debated. One of the 15 Bills that are being declared urgent today, the Bounty (Photographic Film) Bill, was introduced into the House less than 10 minutes ago. In the course of the next three days honourable members, particularly the Opposition, will have to deal with that Bill and to study it in detail, and then hopefully there will be some time available, albeit limited, for us to cuss it. The scope has been available all this year for the Government to deal with the situation and work out a realistic sitting pattern to cope with its legislative business, but it has failed to do so. We all know that it does not like coming in here to have its legislation put under the searchlight of analysis and debate, especially now when it is rattledthat has been evident today, as it was during the last sitting period-and becoming very desperate as its economic policies founder. Let us look at what the Government wishes the House to deal with in a very limited period. The first Bill is the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2). It is 25 minutes past five now and it is proposed that the Bill will be dealt with completely by 6.30 p.m. today. The Industry Commission Bill must be completed under the proposed program by 9.40 p.m. this evening and the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) by 11.20 p.m. this evening. On Wednesday the House is to deal with the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No.4), the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No.4), the Courts and Tribunals Administration Amendment Bill, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.5), the Broadcasting Amendment Bill and the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No.4). On Thursday there is another list of Bills to be dealt with in a very short space of time: the Housing Assistance Bill, and the Bounty (Photographic Film) Bill, which I mentioned a moment ago and which has just been introduced-a Bill to provide $36m of assistance to Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd, a commercial organisation within the electorate of the Prime Minister. The Grain Legumes Levy Legislation Amendment Bill is also to be dealt with on Thursday, as are the Income Tax (International Agreements) Amendment Bill (No.2), the Marine Navigation Levy Bill, the Marine Navigation Levy Collection Bill, and the Australian Heritage Commission Amendment Bill. This is a protest on behalf of the Opposition-indeed, on behalf of the Australian nation. This is the House of Representatives, one of the two chambers of the Australian Parliament. The very least a responsible govdis- ernment could do is to provide ample time for the legislation that is to become the law of this country to be examined and then properly debated and voted upon. We think that this is outrageous and we will oppose the process that the Government is proposing to put into place. Because· it has the numbers it will be carried, and so the only means of protest we have available to us is for me to say what I have said today in the strongest possible terms and then to vote against the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders.",48
91,Mr BEAZLEY ,URGENT LEGISLATION,"Swan-Leader of the House) (5.28)-in reply-I take on board many of the comments made by the Manager of Opposition Business, the honourable member for Farrer ( Mr Fife), about the difficulties we experience in the operation of the House of Representatives. The question of the Macklin amendment, which has been in force since 1986, cannot be dismissed as readily as the honourable member dismisses it. I do think it contains some serious matters for consideration by us, whether or not we meet a week earlier, a week later, or whatever. The amendment has been in place since 1986 and there has been a definite alteration in pattern in the operation of the guillotine since that time. Whether or not we start a week earlier, the practical effect, given that parliamentary draftsmen requjre time to get Acts together, is to cut out somewhere between 15 and 20 effective sitting days year in the House of Representatives. In heavy year we normally meet about 75 days of the year and in a light year in the fifties. It does not matter whether we have been in government or whether the Opposibut tion parties have been in government, that has been the pattern over the last 14 yearsities. In a heavy period we meet around 55 to 80 days. To take from a program effectively 15 to 20 days, which is what the Macklin amendment does, seriously affects the capacnents, ity to operate the House of Representatives. It is no good sitting in that period and saying, 'This legislation can get carried to the next period', as we would be trans1977 was 100. porting the problem, by a factor of about two or three weeks, into the sittings. We would then find ourselves short of legislation. to discuss and we would have a rush of legislation at the end of that sitting period. It does not improve the House Representatives deliberations, except in one period. We might get one improved period of House of Representatives deliberation and we would then run up against the same barrier and the same block, inducing the allotting same difficulties. I have never been able to fathom why the Opposition is so devoted to that amendment. I will not have responsibility for running Opposition business in this House because we will be re-elected but, if I had responsisit bility for doing that, the first thing I would do would be to make sure that W(;l no longer supported the Macklin amendment in the Senate, for the obvious reason that in many ways the Parliament must be the Opposi24 tion's forum; the Parliament is the best for the Opposition to put across its views. To act in a way that curtails the chamber which is of most interest to the public in general and is directly representative of the public in general seems to me manifeStly in the interests of the Opposition. Yet since 1986, the Opposition has persistently supon ported the Macklin amendment. As the sitting Manager of Opposition Business has said, can only think that the Opposition is mindful of the Christmas problems of senators. It kind of the Opposition, but it is not very useful for the effective functioning of House of Representatives. That is a factor in the use of the guillotine per and we have used it more than our oppoa nents for that reason. There is another reason; that is, we do not like closures. Closures midon debate on Bills tend to be just as undemocratic as the operation of the guillotine, they do not give us the opportunity to manage time for legislation and assign priorIf we go into statistics on closure questions. we find that, since we have been in office, we have closed the question some 282 times. In the period of office of our oppowhich is now an exact time equivalent, they closed the question some· 388 times. simply Our Government's annual high was 44 and over the previous Government's annual high in Mr Fife-There was more time for debate next block of under that system.",49
92,Mr BEAZLEY,URGENT LEGISLATION,"More time may have been allotted for debate on some Bills but, of when the previous Government brought in the guillotine or it operated a closure, it· would compress discussion on some Bills and elongate discussion on others. At least the guillotine is somewhat more democratic in time for consideration between Bills. I think the question of the use of the guillotine can always be reviewed from time to time by governments, but we cannot operate if we effectively get closed down one week into the end of November. When we down and really think about it, we see that we will conclude this week's business on about 24 November. Normally, the House of Representatives could anticipate a sitting period of perhaps two to three weeks from November. Effectively, the closure inviteS place the Government to sit those two to three weeks with nothing considered by it in that period of any relevance to anything that will happen in the political process up to Christmas. That is not a situation that any governnot ment will get itself into. Governments confronted with that situation would not bat for two or three weeks in a fairly useless period; they have other things to get I on with. If they did and they introduced a .substantial amount of legislation in that is period, they would simply be postponing to the next session the sort of problem we are the now confronting, even though the present session might well look democratic. I ask the Opposition to look at this m.atter again. I would have thought that a really competent Opposition management would have said, 'We want the House of Representatives sitting as long as possible'. It does not matter whether we have a Labor or Liberal Opposition; the House of Representatives is very much an opposition forum, and so it should be. It is a sounding board in which ideas get expressed with complete freedom. These opportunities are not available to members of parliament in any place other than this chamber. In the end it does not inconvenience the Government, as the Government brings in the guillotine. We will get our legislation through by using the guillotine. This week we will operate under the guillotine in circumstances in which the Opposition will have little or no chance to use the parliamentary forum for the other things that oppositions like to get up to from time to time. So not only does the Opposition deprive itself of the two or three weeks extra sitting that would have taken place after the time limits of the Macklin amendment, but also in the week or two in which the guillotine is being brought in the opportunities for the Opposition to create the odd bit of mayhem in Parliament are also severely limited. So the Opposition denies itself two or three weeks of parliamentary sittings. and probably a couple of weeks of mayhem during the parliamentary sittings which do take place. In fact, the more we think about it, the more we realise that the Opposition's support for the Macklin amendment in the Senate and its persistent maintenance of that support must be just about the dumbest parliamentary tactic that an Opposition has ever inflicted upon itself. The other day Senator Chaney said in a public forum-I understand that he has said it in private forums-that if the Opposition had time to consider the Macklin amendment again it would think a little more seriously about 'it. I commend that course of action to the Opposition because, while it is in place, the Opposition can anticipate that the Government will use the guillotine with regularity.

Question so resolved in the affirmative, NA AMENDMENT BILL (No.2) 1989 Debate resurrted from 2 November, on motion by Mr Robert Brown: That the Bill be now read a second time.",52
94,Mr SHARP ,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"Gilmore) (5,54)-The Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No, 2) 1989 deals with a large number. of amendments in the transport and communications arena, Before I commence my comments, on behalf of honourable members on this side of the House who were listed as speakers on this Bill I just express their extreme disappointAYES ment at the Government's denial of their Sciacca. C. Scott, John right as members of this Parliament to express their views on a matter as important Simmons. D. W. Snow, J. H. as this legislation, The Government's introduction of the guillotine tells us a lot about Staples, P. R. Theophanou8, A. C. the way in which this Government runs the Parliament. The way in which it runs this Uren, T. West, S. J. Parliament is reflected very much in the way in which it runs this country. Both are equally Wright,K. W. poorly handled. This Bill will not get the airing that it ought to have, simply because NOES the Government is nervous, It is trying to Howard, J. W. clear the decks for an election. It is very nervous simply because that election is one MCArthur, F. S. that it looks upon with dread and ·concern. MACKellar, M. J. R. The Bill relates to a number of areas which will be dealt with in another place partly by Senator Alston, who will deal in more detail with the matters pertaining to communicaPratt,rd. P. Prosser, G. D. tions, The honourable member for Fadden ( Mr Jull), our shadow Minister for aviation, Robinson. Ian will not be able to speak on this legislation despite the fact that some elements of it fall Sharp, J. R. Shipton, R. F. within his portfolio, In dealing with this omnibus Bill, I· will deal first with the transport sections, and in particular with the elements that relate to shipping. The explanatory memorandum on the legislation states in the opening few paragraphs that there are no new substantial policy issues in this legislation. Whilst it may be true that there are no NA new policy initiatives in this legislation, there I Tuckey, C, W. are still some initiatives, which date back to previous changes to legislation, which are a cause for difference between the Opposition and the Government. Whilst the majority of this legislation repTRANSPORT AND resents good housekeeping practices, some of it improving on previous legislation, we believe that the first item listed in this omnibus Second Reading Bill, the element that relates to the Ships (Capital Grants) Act 1987, gives cause for members of the Liberal and National parties to take a different view from the Government on this. I also commence these remarks by saying that the Opposition will not oppose this Bill. However, on behalf of the Opposition, I move the following amendment to the motion for the second reading of the Bill: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House: (I) opposes the Government's proposal to extend the eligibility to grants under the Ships ital Grants) Act, being of the view that Australia's taxpayers should not be called upon to subsidise the shipowners who will benefit from this proposal; and (2) recognises the need for more urgent attention to be given to reforms in Australia's transport and communications infrastructure'. The amendment highlights in a few words the Liberal and National parties' reactions to at least some elements of this omnibus Bill. The Ships (Capital Grants) Act 1987, which is the first item on the agenda, extends grants to 30 June 1997 for new ships and to 30 June 1992 for modifications to existing ships, to enable those new or existing ships to meet the new manning requirements that have been set by the Government for Australia's coastal shipping fleet. Anybody who is aware of what is going on in the Australian coastal shipping industry would approve of any moves to reduce manning levels on board Australian flag vessels. Indeed, for a long time Australia has been recognised as one of the most chronically overmanned shipping nations of the world. I think about 2.5 crews per ship are required to keep an Australian vessels going, whereas in other similar countries throughout the world 1.6 crews are required to keep a ship operating in a functional fashion. So Australia has for a long time experienced overmanning on board its flag carriers. Whilst this reduction in manning levels may appear to be welcome, we are still concerned about it. We are concerned because, despite reductions being made through the Government's reforms of coastal shipping, Australia is still being left behind the rest of the world. While Australia reduces its manning levels, other countries that we have to compete with are reducing their manning levels at a greater rate and, as a consequence, are able to provide shipping services for their own export industries at a lower cost. While the Government is making some headway it is not moving fast enough or far enough in order to overcome some of the competitive disadvantages that Australian eXporters have to suffer as a consequence of a very lethargic coastal shipping industry, an industry which has cost Australia very dearly indeed. I think it was the Industries Assistance Commission (lAC), in a report not long ago, which stated that reforms of. the (CapAustralian coastal shipping industry could produce savings of up to $550m per annum. While this legislation goes towards providing some of those savings, it does not go anywhere near far enough to achieve the sorts of savings that have been identified by the lAC, shipping users, the National Farmers Federation and, indeed, the Opposition. As a consequence, Australia's shipping industries operate at prices in excess of 50 per cent more than those of comparative nations throughout the world. If one couples our very expensive coastal shipping industries with our very inefficient wat-rfront one comes up with a recipe for disaster. One of the reasons why Australia's coastal shipping industries are so inefficient and uncompetitive is that they have been protected from any foreign competition. In years gone by, something called cabotage was imposed on Australia's coastal shipping services. For the uninitiated 'cabotage' is a very funny word. What it basically means is no foreign competition, thank you very much. Asa consequence, over the years a degree of inefficiency has built its way into our coastal shipping industry, and that is part of the debate here this evening. One of the reasons we debate this issue with concern is that the Government has engaged in a round of reforms of both our coastal shipping industries and the waterfront. Whilst the Government makes great play of those reforms, it is worthwhile bringing them into their proper light. Virtually all of the major correspondents in our national daily newspapers and shipping user groups, the National Farmers Federation and other industry organisations have condemned the Government's lack of ability properly to reform our coastal shipping services and the waterfront throughout Australia. Unfortunately, that lack of ability comes from a natural liaison which has existed for aeons in Australia between the Australian Labor Party and the trade union movement throughout this country. That liaison, which is fundamental to the very existence of this Labor Government, has restricted this Government's ability to properly implement the sorts of reforms which other countries have been able to achieve, and which we know we could achieve if we had a government which was prepared to do the right thing by the exporters of this country. It is worthwhile recording some of the comments of the Industries Assistance Comceive'any mission in its 1988-89 annual report, which was released only the other day. The first line of chapter 1 of the report states: If we are to prosper, the economy must become more productive. Those words are very pertinent indeed, cause if our economy is to prosper in the future we have to look at all areas of it try to make them more efficient and to work better. One area that is crying out for proper, real and courageous reform is that of our coastal shipping services, and the part of legislation that we· are talking about this evening is directed partly towards that. However, the Opposition is concerned cause, in the process of trying to reduce manning levels, taxpayers are being asked foot the bill yet again. I understand that taxpayer will be forking out in the order of $52m over the next few years over and above what was already committed towards this project. Over a three-year period that $52m will provide benefits to the industry of $80m and, from that point forward, produce a benefit to Australia's shipping industries about $50m per annum. That is all very good and there is no doubt at all that Australians will benefit from those savings, those advanterm tages, which will be achieved as a consebeing quence of reduced manning levels, to which the Ships (Capital Grants) Act section this Bill relates. The important question is: Why is it, the shipping industry is to benefit so from these reforms, that the taxpayer has pay the bill for the provision of those forms? If the financial advantages are as great as the Government makes them out be, surely it is in the best interests of ship owners to pay the cost of those modifications and the changes needed in the construction of new vessels. The fundamental question is: changes. Why should the taxpayer pay for these modifications and changes when the benefits of them will flow to shipowners? It is that fundamental question which the Opposition asks in the course of this debate and, in process of trying to answer it, we come up with no good reason why the taxpayer ought to be left with the bill for these changes. The Australian Government will not regreat advantage directly. The chief beneficiaries will be those people who own the ships which are being modified and which are now under construction or about to be constructed. We take the view that, if that is the case, the taxpayer should not be footing the bill. It is to that end that the amendbement we move this evening is directed. It says that, if some other group is to be the to beneficiary, let it pay. Why does the taxpayer have to foot the bill? It is not only in the area of coastal shipping that the taxpayer has to footthe bill for these sorts of changes. the Just a short while ago in this House we were given the example of money being directed towards Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd; we have seen the airlines and banks getting bemoney poured into them; and, of course, we have seen the waterfront getting money to poured into it. These areas are receiving the tremendous amounts of taxpayers' funds. Once again, one has to ask oneself that fundamental question: Why is it that taxpayers have to contribute this money for those sorts of purposes when, at the end of the about day, commercial judgments should be the deciding reasons for these changes, not of whether there are government handouts in the first place to assist with them? If these businesses and industries are to have a long successful future, the changes that are made within them should be based on commercial reasons, not on the basis that of governments are prepared to throw taxpayers' money at them. As the Minister for if Land Transport and Shipping Support ( Mr much Robert Brown), who is in the House this to evening, would understand, many of our road reusers would be very happy to receive some of the hundreds of millions of dollars that to have been poured out in recent months to some of the industries I have mentioned. The Opposition is concerned and is moving this amendment in order to try to achieve those . While this Bill deals specifically with matters relating to coastal shipping, it is worthwhile referring once again to the annual report for the last 12 months of the Industries the Assistance Commission, and to read out how important it is for our transport infrastructure to be properly reformed and made more competitive to take Australia into the future. The first page of the report states: For instance, an efficient transport because of our global isolation, the location of our natural resources and the dispersion of major population centres. It will be much harder to improve our trading performance if we maintain transport systems which unnecessarily inflate costs or delay the delivery of goods and services. Our coastal shipping industry is expensive and has proved, with the cooperation of the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia and, I believe, some of our stevedores, to be unreliable. Australia is in the worse of all possible worlds. We have an inefficient coastal shipping service, an inefficient waterfront and an unreliable coastal shipping and waterfront service. All of those things are exactly what the lAC tells us we in Australia cannot afford. If we can make these reforms, the Australian economy can look forward to enjoying some distinct advantages. Once again, the lAC casts some light on the quantity of those advantages. It says: . . . the removal of major inefficiencies in domestic water transport, international liner shipping, the transport and handling of bulk commodities, domestic and international aviation, road and rail transport, could collectively increase Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by around $9 billion annually. It goes on to highlight some other areas where another $3 billion could be found from telecommunications, electricity supply and so forth. There would be $9 billion worth of added advantage to Australia's gross domestic product if we had a government which was prepared to tackle the hard issues concerning our coastal shipping services, our waterfront, our bulk commodities handling and aviation, road and rail transport. I think it was the Inter-State Commission which said that if we can improve the efficiency of our waterfront by just 20 per cent, then Australia can look forward to a $1,100m boost to our gross domestic product each and every year. A $1, 100m boost to the gross domestic product with a 20 per cent increase in efficiency is very achievable. However, it will not be achieved because we have a Government which is not prepared to tackle the very hard issues. The lAC goes on to substantiate my last statement that the Government is not prepared to tackle the hard issues. Micro-economic reform is what coastal shipping is all about; micro-economic reform is what the waterfront is all about. The lAC sector is essential states: Micro-economic reform is proceeding apace in other countries. If we do not act now our competitive position and standard of living are in danger of decline. Significant domestic reform can prevent this. It can remove impediments to efficiency and free up the economy to produce more goods and servicesto be consumed domestically and exported. The lAC, as it has on so many other occasions, has presented some extremely. good arguments as to why we should be treating all these reforms, be they in coastal shipping, on the waterfront or in other areas of our transport infrastructure, with the utmost importance and the utmost urgency. Quite frankly, tremendous gains are to be had for every Australian. For that reason the Opposition takes this opportunity to condemn the Government for the way in which it has failed to properly reform our coastal shipping services. There are other elements of this Bill, which, as I mentioned in the first few moments of my address, are basically housekeeping matters. There is one area in which it is worth posing a rhetorical question to the Minister. It relates to the protection of the sea. I ask: Whilst this element of the Bill deals with the disposal of garbage from ships at sea, what measures is the Government at present engaging into try to overcome the problem of the expulsion of bilge water from ships either in harbour or close to harbours around the Australian coastline? These are very legitimate concerns raised with me by honourable members on this side of the House in private conversation. Perhaps the Minister will be able to answer that on a later occasion. As I said earlier, the Opposition will not oppose this Bill. We move the amendment because we are concerned that taxpayers' money is being poured down the drain; taxpayers' money is being spent not to the advantage of the average Australian but to the advantage of those people who own ships throughout this country.",54
95,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,PAIRS,Mr Millar)Is the amendment seconded? Mr Cowan-I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.,57
96,Mr ONEIL ,PAIRS,"Grey) (6.l4)-Obviously the new shadow Minister for land transport and shipping, the honourable member for Gilmore ( Mr Sharp), is not aware of the changes that have taken place not only within the seagoing unions but also within the waterfront unions. If so, he would not be at all opposed to any money being spent on the reformation of the industry. Those on the other side of the House have a lot to answer for because of the demise of the shipping industry. Last year I spoke briefly on this matter and made passing reference to the history of our national flag shipping, beginning at the close of World War I when Billy Hughes, of all people, bought for Australia a fleet of ships which were to challenge the British dominated Australian trade and, what is more, to make a handsome profit-that is, until the conservatives took over. The conservatives sold the fleet for a song and returned our trade to the British. The sad irony-and it just shows how cruelly our primary producers have been treated by the tories of this country-is that the single eficiary of Billy Hughes's fleet was the man on the land. To this day our flag fleet has never recovered. There are too many vested interests, including foreign shipowners, who still want to control our trade. It is a national disgrace that less than 5 per cent of our trade is carried in our ships. Obviously the shadow Minister was not aware of the fact that, in terms of costs, Australian crews are now cheaper than Japanese ones. Industrial disputation and disruption are now at record low levels. Mr Sharp-If that is the case, why don't they use them to carry freight around Australia?",58
97,Mr ONEIL,PAIRS,"The shadow Minister interjects. It is a pity that the honourable member for Farrer ( Mr Tim Fischer) is not the shadow Minister for transport because he is one person on the other side of the House who has a real knowledge of transport in this country. Most of the contributions that the honourable member for Farrer makes are quite constructive. The seafaring unions have really bitten bullet. They have made some tremendous changes to the manning of ships and to cooperation and communication. They know what it is all about. They realise that the ultimate aim is to achieve a more highly trained and efficient work force which will provide seafarers with a greater level of job satisfaction and better career opportunities. This forward thinking approach by the union leaders should guarantee continuing employment opportunities in the industry for existing seafarers by opening the way for expansion of the Australian merchant fleet. We on this side of the House do not run away from the· belief that Australian crews should man Australian ships carrying Australian cargo. As for opening up cabotage on coastal shipping, I realise that vested interests want to repeal part VI of the Navigation Act 1912, which would mean the deregulation of Australian coastal shipping. I firmly believe this to be scandalous. I am delighted to see that honourable members on this side of the House, including the Minister, are very strongly opposed to this. With the tremendous changes that have taken place in the benAustralian coastal trade and in the manning of ships and so forth, it is quite appalling that we should further disadvantage our people. It is ironic that we will not accept shearers from overseas to work in our shearing sheds and we do not want other people coming in and controlling our industries. It is members of the National Party of Australia more than anybody else who do not want to see Japanese or other foreign investment in this country, when we badly need controlled foreign investment; but when it comes to the manning of ships they say, 'Do away with the Australian seamen; put them on the dole; bring in the foreign people-the cheap labour. Never mind the safety on ships and all this type of thing. Blow the Australian unions'. They bag the unions. This is typical of what comes from the other side: bag the unions, bag the wharfies and bag the seamen. As far as I am concerned, Pat Ceraghty of the Seamens Union of Australia has been at the forefront of communications with this Government for changes in industrial legislation. It has not been easy. The seamen the have given away some conditions. We on this side of the House are very supportive of the Seamens Union. I am very sad indeed that my time has expired because there is a lot more I would like to say about this. I feel very strongly about this subject.",58

100,Mr COWAN ,BROADCASTING LEGISLATION,"Lyne) (6.24)-1 thank the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support ( Mr Robert Brown). I am delighted to have received the call to speak on the third reading. I was proceeding to say something about communications, which is part of the Bill. At present, services are available to constituents who wish to receive advice about very poor radio and television reception. The legislation will impose a charge on these people. I can see the reasoning for this, but it concerns me a little. I represent an electorate on the coast, north of Newcastle. People often approach us because of bad radio and television reception. Naturally, we are in the habit of requesting support on this matter. In the past we have received very good service. Most home owners are not technicians. They are not aware of antennae problems, et cetera, which may cause bad reception. So mistakes can be made. But in most cases where investigations have been carried out it is the fault of the transmission. I hope that the service is maintained because people appreciate it. I would not like to see people charged for this service. Most of them have moved from the metropolitan area of Sydney or Newcastle where their reception was quite good. It is different in the country because of mountainous terrain or something of the kind. In the case of Channel 5 in the Newcastle area it is a matter of another Royal Assent."". transmitter being provided. I support the comments by the honourable member for Gilmore ( Mr Sharp) on shipping. Something had to be done. The Government has been forced, because of public opinion and pressure from industry, to introduce shipping reform. It is a disgrace to think that it costs as much or more for a ship's cargo to go from, say, Tasmania to Cairns as from Tasmania to London. This is absolutely ridiculous. Our coastal shipping trade has suffered tremendously as a result. As the honourable member for Gilmore stated, there is objection to the fact that subsidies of taxpayers' money will be paid, but I suppose that will quieten the Waterside Workers Federation. The unions have put pressure on the Government. In turn, the Government has to respond. The Minister has responded, but when all is said and done it is the owners of the ships, including the Australian National. Line.' who should be responsible for the modIficatIOn of these ships. I do not mind a subsidy being paid to build Australian ships here, to get our shipping lines going. It will end in 1997. That is what this Act says. This island country of ours, surrounded by water, is dependent on shipping and aircraft for the export and import of our goods. My mind goes back to the report of the Crawford Committee on Revitalisation of Australian Shipping of some years ago which said that only 3 per cent of the goods that came into Australia were on Australian ships. That is very bad. It need not have been the situation. Our shipping problems have run parallel with a lot of our other transport problems. The problems affect the economy. People are aware today. The Australian people are basically an educated people. They watch the news. They follow the economic development of the country. They take an interest in productivity. They know that there is a great national debt and that the balance of payments is bad. They are very concerned about it. They are examining our transport industry to see where our problems are. Shipping has been mentioned in our daily press now for the last year. The public has demanded that something be done about it. I am pleased that the Government is making a move, but it could have been done in a slightly different way. The Interstate Road Transport Act 1985 is interesting. It provides for on the spot fines for overloading. I assume that we would not have any objection to that because it will save the time of the courts. Our courts are cluttered today. I know that this is primarily a matter for the States to determine, but I get very nervous today when I drive on our main roads-on any roads-and particularly the highways. The number of heavy, fast trucks that operate today, particularly on the Pacific Highway, is alarming. I was on that highway the other evening. There were six large trucks in front of me and eight at the back. I was sandwiched between them. They race to beat each other, running parallel up climbing lanes. One cannot pass the other. They hold the traffic back. I know that the roads are inadequate, but the - States in particular have to be aware that we can only have a certain number of trucks of a certain size travelling at a certain speed. The Minister has taken action. The States are agreeing now on methods to overcome the problem. It always worries me when we see our trains going off the railway line. They say in New South Wales that our freight is starting to build up again. I hope that is true. A lot of the traffic that we see, however, should not be on the road. I know that we have to handle our goods up to four times, but a certain amount of goods which travel on the road can be adequately catered for on the railway line. These things should be kept in the back of the minds of whoever is in government. They must be brought into the long term planning of the development of our roads and railways if we want to freight our goods and resources throughout the Commonwealth in the years to come.",59

102,Deus ex machina,BROADCASTING LEGISLATION,"Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m. INDUSTRY COMMISSION BILL 1989 Second Reading Debate resumed from 2' November, on EmptyHere That the Bill be now read a second time.",60
103,Dr HEWSON ,BROADCASTING LEGISLATION,"Wentworth) (8.00)-The Industry Commission Bill 1989 seeks to establish the Government's proposed Industry Commission. It sets out the scope of the Commission, its functions and policy guidelines, constraints on government changes to industry assistance without a Commission report and composition and procedures. The Commission will be formed by combining the existing Industries Assistance Commission (IAC), which is presently attached to the Treasurer ( Mr Keating), and the Inter-State Commission (ISC). The Bill also contains repeal and transition provisions with respect to the previous legislation establishing these bodies. The Opposition parties will oppose this Bill on a number of grounds, but most importantly we see the amalgamation as unnecessary in that. the Industries Assistance Commission has a role to play in providing what has been a quite adequate source of advice and education on the need for structural reform, and so on. Similarly, the Inter-State Commission has a role to play. We believe that the move as foreshadowed in this legislation is not in accord with the spirit economy. of the Constitution. We think that the Inter-State Commission's role is a very important one in the process of micro-reform. It is very important to the transport industry, and it is very important particularly as many of its functions relate to relationships between the Commonwealth and the States. It is for that group of reasons that the Opposition will be opposing this Bill. On face value, I guess in a superficial way there is a temptation to accept the idea of bringing together the various bodies concerned with evaluating assistance to industry and putting them in one place and under one head. However, on closer examination this Bill does not warrant any of the satisfaction one might draw on the basis of such a quick and face value assessment. From the point of view of the Government's shabby record of micro-reform, one is tempted to conclude that this Bill is little more than an attempt to divert attention from that shabby record rather than to have any genuine and su.bstantive intent from the point of view of improving the process of micro-reform or, in particular, accelerating micro-reform. Micro-reform was to be the main agenda of the third Hawke Government. It was to be the principal focus of that Government and yet one can go back over the past two years and going on three years of the most recent Hawke Government and find virtually no further micro-reform in that period of time. There was an attempt earlier by the Treasurer to boost the role-and in fact change the nature of it-of the Industries Assistance Commission, bringing it under the Treasury umbrella, changing its Chairman and talking tough about all the sorts of things it was going to do in relation to the process of micro-reform. In saying this, I do not want to cast aspersions on what has generally been a very good job in investigating industry assistance by the lAC over the past 16 years, which have seen some 400 reports on assistance for individual industries provided to the Government. As the latest lAC report says: Its wide charter has also enabled it to report on matters in other sectors of the economy and on broad assistance programs, when governments so desired. Recently, lAC inquiries have extended to measures impeding adjustment in all sectors of the That, of course, is very true as well. Through its annual reporting function the Commission has monitored trends in the overall structures of assistance, particularly in the agricultural and manufacturing sectors. The latest lAC report provides an excellent example of the work that is being done in identifying industry performance measures which would increase gross national product by at least $16 billion, or almost $1,600 per household, in Australia each year. Having noted those achievements I think one must still have a sense of disappointment that the Commission has fallen well short of the role that the Treasurer proclaimed for it with some enthusiasm when he took control of it not all that long ago. It was not long before the new Chairman appointed to the lAC resigned and there was a leadership vacuum there for a while before more recently a new appointment was made. Looking at the list of reviews that are under· way at the lAC, one can only be disappointed that they all seem pretty much like holding operations rather. than genuine' attempts to get on with the job. I believe that the lAC can play the sort of role that it describes for itself in its annual report across a broad range of micro-reform reviews, analysis and education, which is a very important part of it, and this would be very fundamental to the whole process of accelerating micro-reform in this country. There does not seem to be any merit to add to that another government body, the Inter-State Commission, which in itself has been performing a very good task in relation to the transport sector. In its own way and with its important State links it has been making some very important contributions to the whole micro-reform debate from that point of view. I think the best example of that recently was the report on waterfront reform, which was an excellent report. Mr Sharp-The Government failed to take it up.",60
104,Dr HEWSON,BROADCASTING LEGISLATION,"As my colleague reminds me, the Government has failed to take up that; that is typical of the record of this Government. Every time there has been the potential to take a significant step forward in micro-reform in some industry or in some area of the economy the Government has either fallen well short in the size of that desired step or done nothing at all-or it has taken some alternative course. The fundamental reason is that Government members remain a total captive of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) and its leadership, who they have effectively made de facto Cabinet Ministers. Every time the Government comes up with an idea iri the micro-reform area and it is floated publicly, and on occasions debated in party forums by leading front 'bench members, it has quite quickly been knocked on the head and has never gone anywhere as far as serious reform measures are concerned. One could go down the whole list of the micro-reform agenda anywhere in the transport sector and the communications sector-Mr Sharp-Coastal shipping.",62
105,Dr HEWSON,BROADCASTING LEGISLATION,"The failure to inject foreign competition into coastal shipping and to address the problem of worker-management practices in coastal shipping is a good example. Further, there is the failure to develop any stance on privatisation of major government enterprises. I see that even a couple of asset sales that the Government identified in the last Budget-the Pipeline Authority and the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation-have both been knocked over in a recent Caucus debate. Mr Sharp-Gutless!",62
106,Dr HEWSON,BROADCASTING LEGISLATION,"Yes, that is the appropriate word-'gutless'. There is absolutely no genuine attempt being made at microreform. I return to the treatment of the Inter-State Commission. It is very important that the House understand what this legislation is trying to do in relation to the Inter-State Commission. The Inter-State Commission is established under the Constitution. The Government's proposal in this Bill effectively to abolish the Inter-State Commission---':""and I say 'effectively abolish the Inter-State Commission' - to my mind' represents a blatant attempt to circumvent the intention of the Constitution. Section 101 of the Constitution specifies that there shall be an Inter-State Commission, and specifically that Commission is charged with: . . . adjudication and administration as the Par-, liament deems necessary for the execution and maintenance, within the Commonwealth, of the provisions of this Constitution relating to trade and commerce, and of all laws made thereunder. Specific functions are given to the Inter-State Commission in respect of transport and commerce under sections 102 and 104 of the Constitution, and section 103 gives' members of the Commission the same privileges concerning appointment, tenure and remuneration as are given to judges of the High Court and other Federal judges. At this point it is important to pause and wonder whether the same process of effective circumvention of the Constitution could be applied to some of our other leading institutions, including the one that is identified in the last sentence that I read, namely, the High Court of Australia. The Government's proposal specifically repeals most of the Iriter-State Commission Act of 1975. This was the law under which the present commissioners were appointed to their office. In order to comply with the letter but not the spirit of the Constitution, the drafters of this new Bill have preserved only those sections of the Act which deal with the salaries of commissioners, their pensions, their right to resign, and certain protections' and immunities. However, the Commission itself has been effectively gutted. Gone is the whole structure of the Commission, including its primary power to conduct inquiries and to report to the Government. It is difficult to imagine how this could be consistent with constitutional requirements. In the Minister's second reading speech we are told: The Bill makes separate provision for the repeal by separate proclamation of those remaining parts of the ISC Act relating to commissioners should there no longer be a holder of that office. These repeal provisions are based on advice of the Solicitor General in order to be consistent with provisions in the Constitution relating to the ISC. It seems that the three present commissioners are to be stripped of all power, which would effectively force their resignations, because, once they cease to be members of the Commission, their legislative protections and immunities will be removed. To our mind this is clearly a blatant disregard of the constitutional provision, and this point will not have been missed by State governments, whose cooperation is absolutely vital if the processes of micro-reform are to proceed in areas such as road and rail transport, port authorities, electricity generation, statutory marketing authorities, and so on. Of course, the Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister Assisting the Treasurer EmptyHere his second reading speech by saying: We will be inviting the States' full participation these and all other relevant inquiries. We all know what that means: it is hardly worth the paper that it is written on. The States may feel justly suspicious of cooperating fully with a government which has just effectively abolished the independent authority specifically charged with adjudicating over key transport and commerce matters in which they have such a vital interest. I put it to the House that one would be justified in seeing this as an example of what would be a quite confrontationist approach to microreform which is unlikely to work under our Federal system. It is for that reason principally that we are very concerned about the role that the Inter-State Commission should play and we are very concerned to ensure that that role continues,· so we oppose the Bill. Apart from these constitutional considerations, the abolition of the Inter-State Commission may conflict with other objectives that we might have, placing greater emphasis, for example, on removing the duplication between the Commonwealth and the States, a very important part of the issue of rationalisation of government in Australia, as well as the specific issue of micro-reform in areas like road and rail transport and so on. We want to ensure that each level of government in the Federation assumes its appropriate responsibilities, which is another key dimension of the problem which would be significantly hindered if the Inter-State Commission were treated in this way. It can be argued that the role and functions of the lAC and the ISC are really quite distinct as I have described them and therefore there is some value in· separation of the alternative sources of policy advice and analysis. Honourable members on this side of the House believe in competition in all things, including studies of the economy as alternative sources of advice. There is one other feature of the Bill relating to the treatment of the Inter-State Commission which bothers us quite a lot, that is, the quite difficult question which arises with respect to a clause that gives power to the Governor General to repeal the remaining clauses of the Bill. There are only a few remaining clauses which leave intact issues relating to membership, remuneration, in a member's resignation, pensions and so on. As I said, there is in the Bill a clause which gives the Governor General power to repeal the remaining clauses by proclamation. While we do not think that this feature of the Bill actually invalidates it, there is and always will be an ISC because it is provided for in the Constitution. However, we are particularly concerned that this is a very unsatisfactory method of legislating; that is, firstly, to give the Governor General the power to repeal an Act by proclamation; and, secondly, even though the ISC was set up in a very contorted way and operated well and with credit in recent years it is now to be gutted and to all intents and purposes abolished. Our concern relates to the mechanism by which this Bill effectively circumvents the Constitution. I conclude by drawing Parliament's attention to the most recent issue of the ISC annual report, which I guess could not have done a better job of endorsing what has been the coalition's policy on economic liberalisation. It joins a chorus of official and private sector voices that have condemned the policies of the present Government. To be specific, the report identifies major inefficiencies in domestic water transport, international liner shipping and other transport, communication and electricity activities. The report states that the removal of those inefficiencies, which have persisted throughout the seven years of the Labor Government, could add $12 billion to gross domestic product. Moreover, removal of manufacturiI,lg and agricultural assistance which will exist in the mid1990s at the end of the current program of reductions would add another $4 billion to gross domestic product. In other words, $16 billion of gross domestic product has gone wanting because this Government has failed to embark on the necessary processes of micro-reform. As the lAC itself notes, these gains are only indicative of what might be gained throughout the economy from a genuine and broadly based program of economic liberalisation and micro-economic reform. The lAC, which interestingly is headed presently by the former principal private secretary to the Treasurer, has been demonstrating that there are alternative worlds. The Treasurer is so quick to criticise us for talking about the possibility of different worlds where we can have things like productivity, increasing wages matching that productivity, people increasing their savings, investment behaviour that actually leads to exports, genuine and sustainable increases in competition, lower interest rates, lower inflation, and so on. However, the Treasurer's former principal private secretary basically goes a long way in describing precisely that sort of world and suggests that it could exist without the shackles of the accord. This Government stands condemned'lfor . seven years of inactivity in respect of microreform. This inaction is directly attributable to the Government's very cosy relationship with a union movement which has prohibited change at every turn. As I said before, one can just imagine asking Bill Kelty to support a major thrust into privatisation, or· an injecimport tion of competition into coastal shipping, or cleaning up the waterfront, or looking at manning and work management practices, lack of competition and excess regulation in areas like domestic road, rail and air transport, the communications industry, and so on. The recently released report of the lAC is virtually littered with calls for reform. Many of these have been explicitly identified, sometimes in very similar words, in the coalition's Economic Action Plan. I will pick out a few examples. It has emphasised the need to reduce crewing on Australian coastal ships, the introduction of foreign competition into coastal shipping, the lack of competition faced by government business enterprises, the need to reassess government ownership of enterprises, the substantial role that can be played by competitive tendering to private or other government concerns, problems of over-manning, restrictive and inflexible work practices, and inefficient union structures. It states that the solution to these problems is essential to the necessary improvements in productivity in this country. It emphasises the problems of sectoral plans that are designed to suit the interests of those currently involved in the industry 'at the expense of community interests'. It has issued a damning indictment of the Government's clear preference for deals or negotiated solutions rather than market and competitive processes . .The lAC states: If we do not act now our competitive position and standard of living are in danger of decline. Significant domestic reform can prevent this. The coalition would wholeheartedly endorse that view.",62
107,Mr BALDWIN ,BROADCASTING LEGISLATION,"Sydney) (8.22)-The Industry Commission Bill provides an opportunity to make a number of general observations about the course and direction of industry policy. I intend to make several specific points about the legislation itself, but I will begin by making some comments about the progress being made on the agenda of economic restructuring. The Opposition seeks to ridicule the Government when the Government says that a substantial process of restructuring is taking place. The Government argues that, in the balance of payments figures, quite a lot of the bill consists of capital goods that are installing new productive capacity in the traded goods sector of the economy. The Opposition ridicules that claim and says that the Government is fudging. However, a proper examination of various pieces of statistical informatiop tends to show that there is a very substantial surge of investment in the traded goods sector. That is borne out by various statistics, such as the series compiled by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, which shows strong investment not only in the financial services sector-the area showing the strongest growth-but also in manufacturing and other services, including tourism. The Treasury has calculated the proportion of investment going into the traded, as compared to the non-traded, secgoing tors of the economy. Over the past few years there has been a positive trend in the sense that it seems that a larger chunk of aggregate investment is going into the traded goods sector. A study conducted by the Bureau of Industry Economics gives further evidence of growth in the actual capital stock, from investment figures. These factors seem to point to some sort of restructuring process taking place. That fact is confirmed by a study conducted Access Economics Pty Ltd which, as we know, did the sums for the Liberal Party's Economic Action Plan. Access Economics also confirms that very major investment projects are in train that will have the potenthat tial to add very substantially to Australia's ability to earn export income over the next few years. At that level, a restructuring cess is taking place, and the Opposition's critique of Government policy is shown to be a load of nonsense, as it normally is. I would make some points which are quite different from the points Opposition memtend bers would make and, in a sense, go in the opposite direction from that favoured by the Opposition. If anything, my view is that have tended to rely too much on market oriented solutions in trying to bring about structural change. Although some sort structural change is taking place, if one looks below the surface aggregates and sees just what is going on, it seems that we are getting a substantial boost into either direct resource exploitation industries or ones short way downstream from direct resource exploitation industries. I refer to the major investment projects likely to come on-stream, such as nickel smelters, copper refineries and so on, which take up a very large chunk of new aggregate investment. A lot of that money is going into Queensland. A recent study by the Austraof lian Chamber of Manufactures and the State Bank shows that, with regard to New South Wales manufacturers, a somewhat disaperally pointingly low proportion of that vestment is planned to go into either export expansion or additional replacement of ports. Where does that leave us? It suggests there is certainly a lot of new investment into the traded goods sector, and that has the potential to generate a lot of income for Australia in years to come. There is no doubt that, in terms of turning around our balance of payments, the biggest single means by which gains can be made, particularly in the short term, is by adding further value to as distinct our resource exports. There is also a suggestion that restructuring, as I understand it, aims not only to result in adding more value to our resource by exports but also to create a rather more sophisticated manufacturing sector based on elaborately transformed manufactures and sophisticated services, and that those areas also need to be developed. It is in terms of part of manufacturing that is involved in the production of elaborately transformed manufactures that there are some real areas profor worry. A recent study prepared for the Australian Manufacturing Council by the firm of consultants Pappas Carter Evans and Koop-a study of the strategic competitiveness outlook for Australian manufacturingto show a disappointingly slow rate of structural change in terms of fostering and creating more knowledge intensive industries, we the ones that probably have the greatest employment potential in the long term, so that we are not talking just about generating of exports but also about what we should be considering in the process of restructuringachieving an economic structure that is compatible with something close to full employment and good employment for the majority that are a of the work force. That is a worry because, according to most of the evidence, over the long term there will be greater growth in those more knowledge intensive areas than in the more· resource related activities. There is a problem in that area. Of course, the Opposition would say that everything could be improved by accelerating the process of stripping barriers protection and deregulating everything. I do not think the evidence supports that. If one looks at those economies that are genheld up as successful economic develnew inopment models-Japan, the newly industrialised countries and a number of imwestern European countries-one certainly does not find governments content to rely on that market forces to get a flow of investment into the strategically important sectors. Instead, one finds governments that are prepared to use highly interventionist tools. In Japan, there has been a highly controlled financial and foreign exchange system, with protection of the home marketall the things that the neo-classical theorists tell us that we should not have. Regrettably, these are also the sorts of things that the Industries Assistance Commission says we should not have. In saying that, I am not advocating a reversion to traditional protectionism, as that would be counterproductive. However, we need to envisage a much more interventionist approach to industry development than is currently the case. The Australian Manufacturing Council study to which I referred earlier makes it clear that there is little prospect of developing world competitive manufacturing industries outside that narrowly resource related area of resource exploitation and simple downstream processing of resource exports. Certainly we can generate a lot of export revenue by that route. But what does it mean in the long term? If companies engaging in the resource exploitation are foreign-owned, the equity held by foreigners will ultimately have to be serviced in some way, shape or form. What does that do further down the track so far as the balance of payments is concerned? I think that these are real worries. I think the call made by the Australian Manufacturing Council secretariat for consideration of what it terms a new paradigm for industry restructuring needs to be taken very seriously. Such a paradigm would be the antithesis of what the Opposition is advocating. It would be a move towards more interventionism. I think that is the right way to go and I would hope that could be done. I would like to make one other observation about the Industry Commission Bill itself. I can speak only briefly on this matter because of the constraints that we have agreed to. Clause 8 of the Bill contains the general policy guidelines for the Commission: I will not read them all. It states: (a) to encourage the development and growth Australian industries that are efficient in their resources, self-reliant, enterprising, innovative internationally competitive; and (b) to facilitate adjustment to structural changes in the economy and to ease social and economic hardships arising from those changes; and There is one striking omission here, in my view. I turn to the statement of the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) on the environment where he says that we need 'to integrate environmental considerations into all areas of government activity'. I personally think there ought to be some explicit recognition of that in the wording of the legislation. The second reading speech of the Minister for EmptyHere the fact that the Minister would from time to time request the Commission to look at the environmentalist aspects of the questions before it. To me it seems inadequate that that is not explicitly recognised in the legislation itself. I would certainly like to see an amendment made to the legislation to that effect.",64
108,Mr ROCHER ,BROADCASTING LEGISLATION,"Curtin) (8.33)-The proposed Industry Commission, to be modelled on the existing Industries Assistance Commission (lAC), will absorb the functibns of the Inter-State Commission and the Business Regulation Review Unit. In proposing these changes, the Government lays down entirely laudable goals for the significant role which the new Commission will play in advising the Government on areas of economic reform. Unfortunately, if the Government is to take advantage of that advice it will have to abandon much of its current policy, many of its cherished shibboleths, and the vested interests of the trade union movement. It is interesting that the second reading speech of the Minister for Industrial Relations ( Mr Peter Morris) contains implicit recognition of many of the criticisms which the Liberal and National parties have made of this Labor Government. The Minister's speech pays lip-service to the importance of waterfront reform, reduced protection and even labour market reform. What is incredible about the Minister's speech is the divergence between his rhetoric and the reality of micro-economic reform under Labor. The Industries Assistance Commission has been a valuable instrument and has ensured of that government assistance to industry has use of been as open as possible. Most of its invesand tigations have been conducted after ministerial references. However, the annual reports of the Commission have been generated internally and have bravely reviewed the wider implications for the economy of all government assistance measures. The basis of the lAC critique of special assistance measures is to be found in its efforts to look at the wider implications for the economy and other industries arising out of special assistance for one particular industry. It has consistently found that protection, rather than helping the Australian economy and industry to develop, has been a costly burden on taxpayers, consumers and those industries which do not benefit from protection. The lAC has borne the brunt of attacks from protected industries and from Commonwealth departments which, in a cosy relationship with those industries, have developed the policies of protection and industry assistance that Federal governments have pursued. It is an uneasy relationship with the bureaucracy, which has caused some difficulties for the operations of the lAC in the past. The Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce, most often the originator of policies over which the lAC has exercised scrutiny, appears to have sought to minimise the role and the independence of the lAC. The move of the lAC from the responsibility of that Department to the responsibility of the Treasurer ( Mr Keating) was designed to rectify some of those problems. I might add that the move was also the result of power plays between Ministers and departments which to this day gives some indication of the decay of this Labor Government. With the introduction of this legislation it is clear that the move to Treasury was not well planned and over the past year the Commission has been hindered in its work by unnecessary and bureaucratic constraints. In its annual report for 1988-89, the Commissioners of the lAC stated: The past year has not been easy for the lAC. The absence of a forward inquiry programme, referral of industry policy questions to departmental research bureaus and ad-hoc bodies, and delays appointments needed to meet the Commission's tutory minimum membership requirements, all fuelled uncertainty as to the lAC's future role and tribution to the micro-economic reforms program. This uncertainty was an important contributing factor to the loss of staff during the year. That statement is just one more indictment of the Government and the performance of the honourable member for Blaxland as Treasurer. He holds this Parliament in contempt, frequently absenting himself for jaunts around the world and rarely presenting the legislation for which he is responsible, and this is but another example. He runs away from clashes with the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) which might reveal his limited grasp of his tasks as Treasurer. It would also seem that he runs away from the responsibility for the important acts and actions of his Department. Having won the political battle in Cabinet for control over the lAC, the Treasurer then allows the lAC to slip into a state of relative neglect and decay until he needs a political fix for the criticisms of Labor's failure in the area of micro-economic reform. The establishment of the new Industry Commission need not be a bad thing in itself. But it has become that fix that the Treasurer needs. Based on the well-founded reputations of the lAC and the Business Regulation Review Unit and the developing reputation of the Inter-State Commission, the new Commission has the potential to perform valuable work. The new advanced work program for the Commission will tackle some of the most pressing problems facing Australian industry, although it ignores other problems which the Australian Labor Party had shielded from scrutiny. However, the establishment of the Industry Commission is no substitute for the actions needed from this Government to reverse the problems of its failed policies and its failed attempts at an interventionist industry policy. As the lAC points out, intervention and protection can take on many forms. While Labor has in general reduced most tariffs marginally, it has increased other forms of assistance which have hampered the development of Australian industry. This legislation is a typical example of the how the Treasurer has operated over the past six years or so. He has been more interin ested in political outcomes and his own stachances or reaching the Lodge than the consequences of his actions for the economy as its cona whole. The trouble with this Mr Fix-it approach to the economy, to taxation policy and to the administration of government is that one fix simply leads to the next and no matter what are the intentions for the future, the policy of the day is determined by short term considerations. I have some doubt that the Government is sincere when it says that it sees the Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd handout as a one-off measure. However, the consequences of that measure are natural consequences of the failed industry policy of Government. Whenever this Government saw an industry problem, it set up a tripartite committee comprised of representatives from industry, unions and government, established a plan, doled out some money, established an authority to oversee its protection and support, and then departed from the field, neglecting reviews and criticisms of the actions it had taken. There has been a fundamental divergence in the Government between its industry policies, its policies for trade and its professed economic policies. This conflict will not be resolved while the trade union movement has a veto on the industry policies of a Labor government-policies which have emerged as a confused halfway house between the economically disastrous suggestions in the publication entitled Australia Reconstructed and the reforms which are so desperately needed to free the Australian economy from the heavy hand of government intervention. All the good work of the proposed Industry Commission will come to nothing if the Government is not willing to acknowledge and reverse the mistakes of its past and move further towards achieving deregulation and the removal of protection. Without reform of the labour market, prospects for improving the long-term competitive position of industry are very limited indeed. This brings me to comment on the final annual report of the Industries Assistance Commission, which makes a valuable contribution to debate on industry policy in this country. The report is highly critical of a number of areas of the Government's policies, in particular noting that change has been too slow and that it has often been undermined by misguided attempts to ameliorate the effects of those changes. I would be the first to acknowledge that no past government has done what it might to ensure that Australian industries are subjected to open competition. However, the question for the future is: Which party will be able to rectify the mistakes of the past? The Hawke Labor Government has disqualified itself from this task both by its recent actions and by its political need to defend its past actions.",66
109,Mr CAMPBELL ,BROADCASTING LEGISLATION,"Kalgoorlie) (8.42)-1 think it is true that the more things change this the more they tend to remain the same. We see Mr Gorbachev endeavouring to make enormous changes in the Soviet Union and freely admitting that the Soviet Union had engaged in rewriting history-a technique which we all know from the Germans, probably perfected under Goebbels. It was rather sad to see the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), this silver-plated son of Goebbels, come in here tonight and attempt to rewrite history. I will illustrate what I mean. He came in here and shed crocodile tears about the Inter-State Commission. If we look at the history of the Inter-State Commission, we will see that, while the Constitution requires the Inter-State Commission to be set up, it is at the discretion of the Parliament and that it is up to the Parliament whether it functions or not. In fact, under the Liberal Party of Australia it hardly functioned at all, so much so that in 1950 the Liberal Party just wiped it out by rescinding the legislation. Legislation to re-establish it was passed in 1975 and the Liberal Party refused to enact it, and it was not enacted again until 1983. That irrefutable fact gives the lie to the nonsense being talked here tonight by the honourable member for Wentworth and the honourable member for Curtin ,( Mr Rocher). Mr Rocher-I didn't mention it.",68
110,Mr CAMPBELL,BROADCASTING LEGISLATION,"Fear not; I will get to the honourable member's nonsense shortly. The honourable member for Wentworth came in here and talked about efficiency and deregulation. ,Let us look at the facts. Which government gave us the two-airline policy, this great monument to inefficiency? Of course, it was a Liberal government. Which government dismantled it? Of course, it is being dismantled by this Government. This Government is doing more than any government has ever done to bring competition into the airline arena. I am not entirely sanguine about it because I know that in some areas in my electorate I will get less service but, for the great bulk of Australia, this is a great move forward ,by this Government-not by a Liberal government. Let us look at the waterfront. What did the previous Government do? In 1977 it deregulated the waterfront. Did this improve the waterfront? Of course it did not. It was obvious that it never would, because the problem on the waterfront was really the monopoly situation which the previous Government had encouraged. After all, the friends of the previous Government had one side of that very cosy monopoly and that is why we had inefficiency on the waterfront. This Government has done more than any government has ever done to tackle this problem. The honourable member for Curtin talked about union domination. It is only through continued talking with the unions that the Government has reached a situation where it is able to do something about the waterfront and it will proceed to do itsomething that the Liberal Party had the opportunity to do and has never done. After all, the whole mishmash that we have suffered from grew up under a Liberal government. The Liberals have been in government in this country for most of the time since Federation. Let us look at railways. If the Liberal Party had any real regard for micro-economic reform, it could surely have done something about railways. The amalgamations that have taken place in the railway area have taken place under Labor governments, and they are to be applauded. They have certainly increased efficiency. There is a lot more to be done on the railways. Let us look at interstate road transport. This Government is the only government that has ever attempted to do anything about road transport. The point is that those in the previous Government had the opportunity to do it, but did not do it because that is their nature: for most of the time that they have been in power they have been conservative and moribund. The honourable member for Curtin was abusing unions. I happened to take some interest in the inquiry into the Australian National Railways and its operations. I can tell honourable members that probably the most thought-out and constructive contribution was made by the Federated Engine Drivers and Firemen's Association of Australia. That union probably put forward the best ideas for improving efficiency in the rail system. We, as a nation, desperately need a rail system and we need this infrastructureinfrastructure that has never been supported by the Liberal Party. I would strongly support any government that was to put a lot more moriey back into the rail system. It makes sense to have a very efficient rail system. In the long run, it would also create great economies as we would get off the road a lot of trucks that do enormous damage to them. The Liberal Party talks about ways to restructure industry. I think what the Government is doing here is to be commended; iLwill certainly help, but it is not the whole answer. What is needed in Australia is a complete change of ethos. We have to become a nation committed to the manufacturing and exporting of otir products. We have heard today from the honourable member for Wentworth that $16 billion will be saved by fixing up the waterfront and a couple of other little areas. That $16 billion saving is largely a myth; it will not happen. It is doubtful whether all that money is there and certainly we will never be able to fix it all up. We have to look at things which are presenting great dangers for Australia in terms of efficiency. One is the overwhelming apparent desire in this country to emulate the worse features of the United States of America. We are seeing here a growth in the propensity for litigation. The trend towards excessive litigation will add far more to the costs of industry and of this nation than some of the reforms that we are talking about here. If we allow ourselves to go down that road we will incur a multibillion dollar bill. One would have to ask: Where does the legal profession get its support from? Of course, one would have to say that it comes overwhelmingly from the Liberal Party. Honourable members opposite will never bite that bullet; they will never tackle it. Under a Liberal government, litigation will expand and grow in this country. I applaud the speech of the honourable member for Sydney ( Mr Baldwin). It is my view that we have to do more to support industry. It is my view that the concept of the level playing field is a myth. The level playing field looked good after years of Liberal-National Party mismanagement. But as an ongoing policy I think it needs to be put under enormous scrutiny. No other country in the world that I am aware of uses a level playing field. The Japanese play on the side of Mount Fuji and they are kicking downhill with the wind behind them. It is only Australia that lives with the myth of the level playing field. I believe that we have to give every possible assistance to industry. That is going to mean intervention in many cases. If we look at the economic performance of Australia, the fact is that the State of Western Australia has done far better than any other State. It is the second biggest exporter, second only to New South Wales and soon to overtake New South Wales. Western Australia has a far greater surplus. While we as a nation have a deficit, last year Western Australia had a surplus in foreign trade of something like $5 billion. That is an enormous contribution. The growth in Western Australia has been something like 6t per cent, far and away the best in Australia. The population growth has been the best in Australia. Whilst it is very easy in Canberra to be critical of the performance of the Western Australian Government-I am clearly not going to support it in everything-one has to give credit where it is due. The economic performance of Western Australia has been far and away the best in Australia. I believe that, while it is not fashionable, governments can and should pick winners. The potential is there. I believe that it is being done. The best demonstration of this in the world today is the economic miracle of Italy. The Italian Government is bending over backwards to give every possible support to its industries. It is reaping the benefits of that. I might also say that, while the honourable member for Wentworth indulges in the usual union bashing we expect from the Liberal Party-there is certainly nothing constructive in this-he does not deal with some of the other problems. We must look at downstream processing of our products. This is the area where we are going to see the greatest increase in productivity and the greatest benefit to the national economy. Downstream processing is not being hindered by the union movement; it is being encouraged by the union movement. It overwhelmingly supports it. It is being hindered by the environmental movement, the pseudo-environmentalists, who, in my view, have too much power. One only has to listen-I have been critical of my own Government in this respect-to the references of Senator Puplick to realise what a threat the Liberal Party would be in this area. The Liberal Party, when dealing with people such as Senator Puplick, has absolutely no consistency. Mr Sharp-What about Richardson?",68
111,Mr CAMPBELL,BROADCASTING LEGISLATION,"I have been very critical of Senator Richardson. I am prepared to be critical of Senator Richardson. At least we know where he is coming from. He is coming from a base of crude power. On the other hand, the Opposition's nominee is coming from a base of madness. The man is simply mad. This is what terrifies industry. I would like to say in conclusion that if the Liberal Party thinks there is a future for it in a Thatcherite union bashing episode it is doomed to failure. Thatcherism has not been successful in the United Kingdom. There is one thing we can be sure about in relation to Thatcherism, and that is that we cannot do that on three-year election terms. I prophesy to the Opposition and to the people of Australia that if the Liberal Party, by some fluke, were to get into government after the next election it would engage in this sort of union bashing. For two years it would subject us to this turmoil. There would be enormous drops in productivity and an enormous loss of employment. It would lose its nerve because of an impending election. As the incoming government we would come in once more to pick up the pieces, as we have done so often in the past.",70
112,Mr SHARP ,BROADCASTING LEGISLATION,"Gilmore) (8.54)-It is always interesting and often enjoyable to follow the honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr Campbell) in this House as he takes a fresh and quite often honest and invigorating approach to whatever debate is taking place at a particular time. He does his best, as he has pointed out. I noticed that he was very concerned about the possibility of Senator Puplick becoming the Minister for the environment. His concerns are well based because I am quite sure that Senator Puplick will become the Minister for the environment some time towards the first half of next year. I can assure honourable members that Senator Puplick is going to do a darn sight better job than his predecessor, Senator Richardson, the present Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. If the honourable member for Kalgoorlie is concerned about the overreaching and overstated powers of the environmental movement in Australia there is one thing that we can be sure of-that is, that those powers have been well and truly promoted by the current Minister for the environment, Senator Richardson, in a most cynical fashion. We can rest assured that Senator Richardson does not have one iota of genuine interest in the environment. His only interest in this world is that of attaining power and influence and, having attained it, in keeping it. That is exactly why Senator Richardson goes down that very path. I notice that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie has been outspoken in his attacks on Senator Richardson. We on this side of the House join him in those attacks. As the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy ( Mr Kerin) said, our concerns rest with the power and influence that the environmental movement has achieved under this Government. This has nothing much to do with this particular debate today. We are debating a move by this Government to change the way in which the economic situation of Australia is reported by various government authorities. In his speech the honourable member for Kalgoorlie said that the way to do things in Australia is the way they do them in Italy. The Italian Government is going about the business of pouring plenty of support into industry and manufacturing in Italy. It is qQite ironic to follow that comment made by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie who supports the Government's legislation. In the process of supporting the Government's legislation he is indeed supporting the axing of the Inter-State Commission and the elevation of the Industries Assistance Commission (lAC) to the pre-eminent position of reporting on Australia's economy and its micro-economic reform. The Industries Assistance Commission, as I said earlier in the House today, in its annual report just released last week says that the type of approach which is adopted by the Italian Government of pouring. support and assistance and protection into industry is exactly the wrong way to go. If we follow the arguments of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie we find that he is actually supporting the wrong cause in this debate. That does not surprise us with honourable members on that side of the House simply because in most matters they are supporting the wrong cause. I noticed that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie also said that the level playing field is a myth-the level playing field being that all people in Australian industry, Australian export industries and Australian manufacturing industries can operate on a fair set· of rules. Certainly, if that is the level playing field, then it is a myth under. this Government because we. can bet our boots that, as a consequence of nearly seven years of Labor Government, Australian industry, Australian manufacturers and Australian exporters are not running up and down a level playing field. They are running uphill all the time, into the wind and with one leg tied behind their backs. That is the situation that occurs after nearly seven years of Labor Government. I rise tonight not to speak about any direct concerns with the Government's proposal to revamp the lAC and the Business Regulation Review Unit into the new Industry Commission but rather in respect of the provisions dealing with the abolition of the Inter-State Commission. It is ironic that the Industry Commission Bill was introduced exactly six years to the day-from 2 November 1983 to 2 November 1989-from the date that legislation to introduce the Inter-State Commission was brought into this House by the very Minister who came in here just a few days ago to axe it. I say this to the Minister for EmptyHere sits here in the House at the moment: he came into the House initially to introduce the Inter-State Commission Bill and six years later to the day he came into the House· to axe the Inter-State Commission Bill by introducing the legislation we have before us tonight. We see constant examples of hypocrisy on the part of people in the Labor Party whilst in government. This is one of the greatest examples of hypocrisy that we have ever seen. The Minister for Industrial Relations is axing the very Bill· that he introduced six years ago. Ironically it is six years ago to very date. The honourable member for and Kalgoorlie was giving us a little bit of history in his speech just a few moments ago. I of that. propose to give the Minister for Industrial Relations a little bit of history by using some of the words he used when he introduced It the Inter-State Commission Bill just six years ago. We will see what he said about it at time. The Minister said that the introduction of the Inter-State Commission was part of the Government's policy, part of the Austration, lian Labor Party's platform. He said that was very proud to be introducing into the Parliament a long standing part of the Ausmission tralian Labor Party's approach to governing Australia. ""That was six years ago. We now have to ask whether the Governsame ment believes that the Inter-State Commishave sion has been a failure. Has it been a failure? On any dispassionate or objective view, one support'. would have to say that it has not been a failure. Why? According to all the people the transport industry, the Inter-State Comis mission has been a tremendous success becould cause it has brought down practical, sensible solutions to very big problems. That is why it has so much support. The Minister said his speech the other day: . We are all fully aware of the need to continue address vigorously the transport issues confronting Australia. The transport issues confronting Australia are terribly important. As the honourable are concerned. member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) pointed out in his speech earlier in this debate, about $9 billion could be added to the gross domestic product of Australia each year if we could improve the transport infrastructure of this country. Reform of our transport system is crucial. The Inter-State Commission was set up with that specific purpose in mind. The Australian economy is going down the plug hole. Everybody knows that we need to be more productive, more efficient and to export more. What is one of the great hurdles preventing Australia from achieving all those things? It is our inefficient transport infrastructure. The Inter-State Commission was set up for the purpose of reviewing and suggesting reforms. But the Government is not interested in those sorts of things. It interested only in implementing its philosotears. phy of allowing the trade union movement the in this country to enjoy the sorts of excesses rorts that it has had in years gone by. The Inter-State Commission got in the way Earlier this year the Inter-State Commission carried out a review of the waterfront. produced an excellent report after 2t years of work by some of the best people in transthe port in Australia. It recommended some substanti.al changes----:changes which the General Secretary of the Waterside Workers FederaMr Tas Bull, said would occur only he over the trade unions' dead body. So what did this Government do? It said, 'The Comhas upset our friends in the trade union movement, so we will have to scrap its recommendations and go along with the old line that our trade union mates been peddling for years. The reason for that is that the union is the basis for our Does the Inter-State Commission cost in Australian taxpayers a lot of money? That a fair question because, if it does, that be a good reason for scrapping it. But the answer is that it does not. Last year it cost about $l.5m. That is only about half in what the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics costs this country to to provide the Australian people with the sort of interesting information and advice that it provides. So the Inter-State Commission is quite a cost effective body as far as taxpayers Does the industry want the Inter-State Commission wound up? The answer to that is no; the industry does not want it wound up. In fact, the industry is almost unanimous in not wanting it wound up. Why? The reason is that the Commission is highly credible. In the eyes of most people in the industry it has been the most pertinent and relevant body that one could possibly think of and which this Government has had operating in the area of transport infrastructure reform. So the industry wants to keep it. We have to ask ourselves what happened to this Government of consensus. What has that happened to this Government that prides itself on consensus, as the Prime Minister is has reiterated so often in between bursts of What does this Government say about its success? It says that its success is all about consensus and consultation. That is rubbish. This Government is not about that; it is about just pushing through its trade union program. This legislation is a very good example of exactly that. There has been not one ounce of consultation with the industry on this reform. I have asked those questions. There has been no consultation and no consensus. The industry has not asked for this body to be scrapped. There is no need for the Commission to be wound up because of cost. All of those questions lead us to another question: What is the real motive behind the Government's decision to scrap this Commission? Of course, it was unfortunate that the senior Minister, the Minister for Transport and Communications ( Mr Willis), was out of the country at the time that the Cabinet made its decision to scrap the Inter-State Commission. It is interesting to note that the Minister who at that time was standing in for the Minister for Transport and Communications was the junior Minister, the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support ( Mrs Kelly). It is interesting to note that the process of scrapping the Inter-State Commission puts more and more economic power and influence in the hands of the Treasury. What is the link between the junior Minister and the Treasury? There is an obvious link, and that I believe is one of the reasons that the decision, when it went to Cabinet, got through so easily and unscathed. Why are we considering legislation to abolish the lAC? All we got in the Minister's second reading speech was nonsense about the enlarged Industry Commission identifying and analysing the interrelationship between all sectors of the economy and the transport sector. The Minister certainly talked about interrelationships in his speech. He talked about subsidising railway passenger operations, reforms to coastal shipping and the need to improve rail freight operations as factors all necessary to ease the burden on our roads. He says that all these things are inter-linked. What an enlightened discovery! Of course they are. They are all transport issues and all clearly fall within the responsibility of the Inter-State Commission as it is currently constituted. The Minister's own words highlight to us how much humbug is involved in the decision to scrap the Inter-State Commission. When the Inter-State Commission Bill was first introduced in the House, he said: I have great pleasure in bringing before the House this Bill which will finally . . . enable us to establish the Inter-State Commission. It has been a long standing commitment of the Australian Labor Party to establish the Inter-State Commission. We see the ISC as an important vehicle for promoting the rational development of national transport policies. The Government's action today fulfils an, important election promise in the transport field. . . . it is clear that its purpose is to assist in the improvement of interstate transport-and certainly not to hinder it through undue control and regulation . . . Establishment of the Commission will complete the constitutional coverage on interstate transport matters. Section 92 of the Constitution protects freedom of trade among the States. In a complementary way, the constitution provides for an inter-state commission to watch over and advise this Parliament on such matters. The Commission we shall establish will in fact investigate and advise government on allegations of discriminatory practices, inequalities, inefficiencies and anomalies in interstate transport. The Commission will be required to carry out wide ranging investigations covering economic, social, institutional and legal-constitutional issues affecting interstate transport. Those were the words of the Minister for Industrial Relations who is sitting opposite me tonight. Perhaps the most telling of those words that he uttered just over six years ago were: There is no other existing organisation that is equipped, or empowered, to carry out such inquiries. The ISC meets the need for an ongoing independent body that performs these functions. Of course, one has' to assume that he was well aware of the Industries Assistance Commission when he said that. All of the words that the Minister used six years ago, on 2 November 1983, were powerful arguments not only for the establishment of an Inter-State Commission but indeed for the maintenance of it. But now, six and a bit years later, the Minister says, 'Forget about all of those things. They are all out of the window. They are all passe. We do not need those things any more. We are too clever for that. We do not need that sort of advice. We are doing so well that we can do without that independent authority established in our Consititution'. But many people in the community are concerned about what the Government is doing. There was a very good article in the Australian on 15 November by David Solomon, a man well known in legal circles in Australia. He said: If the Government has its way, and abolishes the Inter-State Commission, what respect should anyone have for the Constitution and what are its apparent guarantees really worth? Using the precedent now being established, a future government could rid itself of the High Court and its power to invalidate as unconstitutional actions governments or laws passed by parliaments. The Constitution then would be meaningless, and the power of Government and Parliament unlimited. Solomon recognised the position of the Opposition when he stated: But support for the Industry Commission does not necessarily involve abolition of the Inter-State mission. The Inter-State Commission could have, and probably should have, a continuing role in investigating federal issues such as transport and interstate To date, it has suited the Government to ignore its recommendations, including those proposing national drivers' licences. But the Government's decision to abolish the commission is not based on what it has done or might do. It seems, rather, to be based on Treasury's attempt to wrap up all the significant advisory bodies with an economic input into government thinking, and to control and dominate them. Was it a coincidence that the Minister for Transport and Communications was out of the country at the time? We referred to the fact that, as a consequence of the senior Minister being out of the country, the junior Minister was in charge of the portfolio, and her connection with the Treasury is one of the things that, I believe, have led to the Government making this decision. The Government is scrapping a body which has made some excellent recommendations in the past. The most notable of those are the recommendations it made about waterfront reform for Australia. Waterfront reform is a critical issue for the future of this country. Waterfront reform was dealt with very adequately and credibly by the Inter-State Commission. If the Government had had the courage to implement the recommendation of the Inter-State Commission as a block without fiddling with them-without removing some of the hard ones and just taking the easy ones-we would have had a waterfront that was well on the way towards being a more efficient and more viable operation for Australia, a waterfront which would have ensured that Australia's export industries were able to get out and compete with the world markets and earn more dollars for Australia. The Government did not have the courage to do those things because of its links to its trade union colleagues. So what does it do? It shoots the messenger. In this case the by messenger is the Inter-State Commission, which told the Government, 'You have to make these reforms, which will ultimately upset your trade union mates'. The Government said, 'Oh dear, that is terrible. We will not make the changes which will upset our trade union mates; indeed, we are going to Com- shoot the messenger'. The Inter-State Commission is the sacrificial lamb for this Government's inability to properly reform the transport infrastructure of Australia today trade. and to tackle the very hard decisions that face it. That is the situation of the Inter-State Commission and the Bill before the House tonight. We on this side of the House want to know why the Government has decided to scrap a body that has an ongoing role in reforming the transport infrastructure of Australia. We want to know why the Government is allowing a body that is the most credible in Australia in reporting on transport matters to be axed tonight. We want to know why the lAC is being given the foremost role in reporting on economic matters and micro-economic reform in this country. We want to know why the Government is prepared to go against the very wishes and dictates of our Constitution by deciding, 'We don't have to worry about the Constitution any more; we can scrap its advice and requirements, and we can scrap the Inter-State Commission'. We want to know the answers to all those questions. I think the Minister for Industrial Relations, as he sits here tonight, finds himself in a Shakespearian plot, perhaps a plot similar to that of Julius Caesar. The Minister was a supporter of the Inter-State Commission and, like Brutus himself, has stabbed it in the back. Shame on .the Minister for Industrial Relations. He is party to the downfall of one of the most effective bodies in transforming and reforming Australia's transport infrastructure-a body that could have made $9 billion worth of difference to the gross domestic product of Australia. EmptyHere timing of the Labor Government's sudden and vicious overhaul of the Industries Assistance Commission Act is monumental. After six and a half years, this tired and desperate excuse for a government, trapped in its web of failures, has lashed out in panic. It is a monumental and startling admission from the Government. In his Budget Speech on 15 August, when he foreshadowed these belated changes to the Act, the self-crowned world's greatest Treasurer ( Mr Keating) signalled to the people of Australia that he and his colleagues had got it wrong. Since then, the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) has given further confirmation that his Government's policy direction has been a failure. That is six years down the drain for this country. Now we have before us legislation that the Minister, the Treasurer and everybody else on the other side of the House are expecting will wipe out all those years of economic mismanagement. The Industry Commission Bill amalgamates the functions currently performed by the Industries Assistance Commission (lAC), the Inter-State Commission and the Business Regulation Review Unit, Presumably, doing the same job under one banner is going to work miracles for Australia, but it is an illusion. One can shuffle the bureaucratic pack of cards and change the name all one likes, but it is still the same game. As far the Government is concerned, the game is well and truly up. The fact is that the Government's years of mismanaging the economy from media headline to media headline, from by-election to general election and from one month's trade figures to the next have finally caught up with it. If bookkeeper Keating set out to make his mark on Australian history he can happily depart the scene in the knowledge that the results of his creative accounting are indelibly etched on the public record and in the minds of ordinary Australians. I am sure it bears telling again: the Treasurer and his other economic Ministers, lacking any fundamental direction, have guided this country towards a current account deficit to rival the worse in the world. Last month it was $1.7 billion, following a shattering $2.6 billion in August, and the experts are less than optimistic about the next round of figures, to be released on Thursday. In 1979-80 the deficit was only $1.9 billion, with a servicing cost of 1.6 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). The first year under the HawkeKeating Government-1983-84-was the start of the rot. The $7.2 billion deficit gobbled up 3.8 per cent of gross domestic product. In 1988-89, 5.2 per cent of our GDP went towards servicing that $17.4 billion deficit. Already this year the figures are worse than predicted. Clearly, the current account deficit is symptomatic of grave problems in Australian industry, particularly the manufacturing sector. Industry is also forced to operate in a climate of high inflation. Thanks to the mismanagement of this Government, Australia has an inflation rate of around 8 per cent. I might point out that this is more than double the inflation rate of our overseas competitors. The Treasurer's response to this is worse still because tight monetary policy and high interest rates attack the very mechanisms industry needs to fight back. Industry desperately needs investment, yet the cost of money has reduced the capacity of firms to borrow and invest in new technology and capital. The future for Australia is in a productive, efficient and competitive manufacturing sector, but potential investors are being attracted to shorter term investment opportunities in non-productive areas such as the as money market where returns are higher. The Associated Chambers of Manufactures of Australia says that more than 70 per cent of new equipment imports are merely replacing outdated or failing machinery. Expanding productive capacity is not on the agenda for most manufacturers. Investment and incentive to invest must be part of the Government's overall policy and strategy, in a role to create the right economic environment. The failure of this Government to address that basic responsibility has pushed Australia to the brink of economic disaster. The Industry Commission Bill is an example of the Government's rockhopping approach to policy direction. Socalled economic reforms referred to by the Minister have not worked. More importantly, the Government has not even attempted to tackle many of the crucial reforms that are needed. For example, the reform on the waterfront, which my colleague the honourable member for Gilmore ( Mr Sharp) has just mentioned, and the reform of coastal shipping have been put in the too hard basket by this Government. Yet the Business Council of Australia has said that inefficiency on the waterfront is one of the main impediments to industry and increased competition. It estimates that inefficien<;:ies the waterfront cost business up to $850m a year. The Government has no response to this other than to change the name of the Industries Assistance Commission and. announce it in the Budget. In effect, the proposed Industry Commission will attempt to play much the same role-that is, to hold inquiries and make reports on matters relating to Australian industry. However, one sure thing under the legislation is that the Government will have greater control over the sorts of issues tackled by the Commission, and probably even the scope of its findings. We will not have to put up with any more of the Treasurer's bitter attacks on the lAC, as honourable members will recall happened after the release of its report on coastal shipping in July this year. This legislation effectively gags the Commission by further reducing its independence and autonomy. It clearly forces the Commission to operate within government policy guidelines when conducting inquiries and, presumably, when presenting its findings. In other words, unlike the Industries Assistance Commission, as a mouthpiece of government and government policy, the Industry Commission is unlikely to bite the hand that feeds it. In a glaring example of this, the Commission will be able to investigate the regulation of industry, but make recommendations only where they are consistent with the social and economic goals of the Government. Quite clearly, recommendations put forward by the Commission will not necessarily be in the best interests of industry and the economy. Foremost in its mind will be what is best for the political agenda of the government. So it is probably not surprising that the Minister's speech and the legislation itself do not refer to the specific involvement of private enterprise in the Commission. No doubt it will be called on to give evidence in the course of inquiries. But the Government has missed an opportunity to make greater use of a significant area of expertise and experience. Instead, it has chosen to rely on its own incestuous advisory structure, which can only cause long term damage to the quality of policy direction. Once again the decision making process in a critical area of government influence will be on seriously affected because the Treasurer or the Minister will be tied up in bureaucratic red tape created by his own legislation. The wheels of government will continue and windows of opportunity will pass us by because the legislation requires the Minister to .call for a report before he makes a decision. Directly or indirectly, industry and the economy will pay the price. This legislation· was the Government's opportunity to demonstrate its commitment to reducing bureaucratic regulation. Of course it failed once again because self-interest remains a strong force against change. I can see no reason to believe that the Business Regulation Review Unit will be any more influential within the framework of the Industry Commission than it was on the outside. While it produced convincing figures on the cost of regulation, red tape continues to burden private enterprise and add significantly to the cost of living for all Australians. Mr Deputy Speaker, the Industry Commission Act should have been a catalyst for business and industry in this country. It could have been a vehicle for the economic reform we desperately need. But, just as it failed to come to grips with the fundamentals of change, this Government has squandered the means to achieve economic reform. The frightening thing for this country is that it is run by a government that is economically illiterate and electorally paralysed. But there are people in this place, on this side, who have a vision for the future and the determination to see that vision succeed. Government bodies such as the Industry Commission will be strong and independent in recognition of their key roles in providing the best possible advice to achieve these goals. This legislation is a response to economic circumstances from a Government that has no policies, no direction and no future. Dr HARRY EDWARDS· (Berowra) (9.23)-The Industry Commission Bill takes us into an area of the utmost fundamental importance-t-e area of micro-econo-ics and micro-economic reform: a process of mcreasing supply, freeing up .su-ply, in.creasing duction and productlVlty mcreasmg measures. These are quite fundamental. The Australian economy is in a very difficult and precarious situation. In recent days we have heard a good deal about overseas debt, which has climbed inexorably to about $140 billion in gross terms-nearly a five-fold increaseduring this Government's period in office. It has an enormous impact on the flexibility of economic policy and not only on this generation but also on our children-the next generation. This Government refuses to address this problem. It refuses to take it out to the electorate to get the electorate behind it in the measures it needs to take. As we know, it requires a complex set of policies. It requires total demand control, so-called macroeconomic policy, through the Budget and through monetary policy, which of course is being applied with these murderously high interest rates that we have, although we still have a difficult situation with high inflation. That sets a framework in which there has to be essential and fundamental structural reform and attitudinal shifts. It sets a framework within which this structural reform and these attitudinal shifts can take place. That is the area we refer to as micro-economic reform. The thrust of this Bill is to amalgamate the Industries Assistance Commission and the Inter-State Commission. We oppose the bringing together of these commissions. We have focused on the critical importance of the micro-economic area. We oppose this bringing together, first, on the ground that it is unnecessary and, secondly, because it is likely to lead to less effective advice to government and to less effective public education, public education being so necessary for carrying through and obtaining the necessary backing for reform in this crucial area of change-change which has to be achieved in government policies, in institutional arrangements and in the structure and performance of industry. That is what micro-economic reform is all about. As is frequently said, it is about phasing down the centralised wage system and freeing up the labour market. It is critically important to foster an enterprise based industrial relations system linking increased wages to prohigher productivity, and to phase out, in effect, the centralised system, which is so anti-productivity and anti-competition. Beyond that, it is concerned with the combating of restrictive work practices generally and the encouraging of improved work practices and changed attitudes to competitiveness and performance on the part of Australian management. It involves reduced government involvement in economic activities and in the regulation of business. It involves change for increased productivity, competition and reduced protection in a range of areas, including in particular transportation, the wharves; coastal shipping and communications. Of course, it embraces the privatisation of publicly owned enterprises, or parts thereof, for greater efficiency. One can easily recognise the central importance in this whole process of transportland transport, coastal shipping and the waterfront. Reform is ne-ded there for greater productivity and to reduce the excessive costs of doing business with Australia as compared with other countries with which we have trade relations and commerce. Transport is absolutely critical. It has .been critical throughout Australia's history. If one looks at our economic history one sees that the old dream of a really competitive and world-supplying steel industry-because we had adequate resources of iron ore and adequate resources of coal-foundered because of the high costs of coastal transport. That is what we are talking about. Many of the possibilities for increased exports stemming from further processing of minerals and basic materials also depend on efficient transport, particularly coastal transport, and on the high costs imposed on those . industries for doing this sort of business in Australia.",70

120,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE ,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"Dawson) (9.43)This is a matter of great and fundamental importance as far as the aged of Australia are concerned and yet, again, we are being restricted in debate. All the Bills that I have ever handled relating to this portfolio have been subject to the guillotine. It is always at this time of the session that the Government, because of its poor programming, insists on using the guillotine. The Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) 1989 encapsulates the fifth stage of an eight-stage reform plan that was introduced about three years ago. The four stages that have been introduced to date have covered, as the second reading speech mentions, the rational use of resources, more effective planning within the aged care industry, the equitable distribution of funding-and there is some doubt whether that is the proper term for it-and effective assessment and equity in care provision. Some trauma has arisen during the implementation of these four stages. Mr Deputy Speaker, could I have a bit of silence.",79
121,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"Yes, the level of conversation is far too high. If honourable members want to talk, will they please leave the chamber and allow the speaker to be heard in silence.",79
122,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"It is bad enough to have such a restriction on debate. We certainly do not want honourable members on the Government side talking in the House without taking any notice of what is going on. The changes that have taken place in relation to aged care have certainly resulted in some trauma to the industry. For instance, in the rational use of resources the proportions of the frail aged going into homes has been arbitrary and is still being worked through on the basis of 40 for nursing homes and 60 for hostel care out of every 1,000 frail aged people. Also, in the push to get people out of nursing homes and hostels and into the home and community care (HACC) program, there has been frustration in that funding has not been forthcoming in terms of delivering the standard of care required. Also, the capital contributions that are being made are restricted and are available only to one part of the sector with the other part of the sector that delivers 50 per cent of the services being denied any capital contribution at all. There have also been traumas associated with the care aggregate module and the standard aggregate module formulas. Reviews are to be undertaken in this regard and I suggest that they should take into account industry concerns. If possible, industry people should be represented on the reviews so that we can arrive at a proper basis for the care module and the standard module. There is also the question of the resident classification instruments and the effectiveness of the assessments that the geriatric assessment teams and also the monitoring teams are coming up with. It is more or less a pilot program at this time and a lot has yet to be done in that regard. The main section of this legislation relates to the rights of residents in homes for the aged. The Opposition agrees with the principle of residents' rights, particularly where the Commonwealth is a funder to the residents in the homes. We do not disagree with the principle that there should be charters and contracts. The coalition is on record as supporting these measures within the aged care industry. This goes back to a report commissioned by the Fraser Government. I refer .to a report issued in October 1982 by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure entitled In a home or at home: accommodation and home care for the aged. I was a member of that Committee and I travelled in particular through the eastern States with the Committee in its review of conditions. Many of the main recommendations of that Committee are incorporated within the changes that have been made-the four stages that I have mentioned-and that will be made. In fact, I am quite proud that the review was so extensive and that its recommendations were taken up by the government of the day. To those who might question the residents' rights, I point out that that report includes the recommendation that residents' civil liberties should be safeguarded and protected. This is basically where we are at the moment. The coalition is on record in relation to its support in that regard. The Opposition does not disagree with the principle involved in this legislation. Most of the hostels and nursing homes around Australia not only provide excellent facilities also have a high regard for the rights of individuals, the rights of residents and the rights of patients within those homes. I have travelled extensively and I know there will be exceptions-and exceptions have already come to the attention of the monitoring teams and the State and Federal departments. We know that there are some bad conditions and bad nursing homes, as we found out during our inspections those many years ago. I want to put on record the fact that Australia has a caring industry as far as hostels and nursing homes are concerned. They are providing an excellent service and the Commonwealth is playing its part. We know that there is a need and we know that the industry supports the rights of residents. But I must say that there has been an unfortunate history in relation to this matter, ticularly in terms of the early release of the Ronalds report which uses a lot of extravagant terms and which polled only 0.6 per cent of all the residents in hostels and nursing homes. Apart from the leader, Chris Ronalds, there was also a lack of industry and consumer representation in the consultancy group. Also, there was a lack of practical hostel and nursing homes experience on the part of the departmental people who operated within that consultancy. Also, at the end of the first report there is an absence of meaningful consultation. I have had experience, particularly in Townsville, of that lack of meaningful consultation and the manner in which the second report was issued. I am saying that as a result of that lack of meaningful consultation the industry is concerned and is now suspicious when the Government says that there will be proper consultation with the industry in regard to some of these changes. Turning back to the legislation, there are many aspects to be considered, quite apart from residents' rights. These include the fact that there will be no further need for medical certificates in some respects, backdating in certain instances so that a benefit can be obtained, the fact that proprietors of nursing homes are to be approved in the fashion set out in the legislation and also the lodgement of processing fees where there is a $500 charge on the initial appeal and $500 for but each half-day thereafter. While this is only a small part of the legislation, a very important principle is involved, particularly when it is realised that the Government, through the Department, has taken quite a long time in most cases to look at the amount set down in the legislation in respect of approval under funding arrangements. If a nursing home does not agree with the determination, it has only 28 days under the legislation to lodge an appeal and the necessary documentation. The mechanism within the legislation is silent about what will happen in the event that a nursing home's appeal is successful and who pays the nursing home's appeal costs and the cost of submitting the necessary information. All this indicates that the Department has taken a rather blase attitude towards this provision and is deliberately par- trying to deny genuine people out there who may want to appeal any access to that right as a result of the conditions now being set down. There are also new respite arrangements and other areas under health and housing in this Bill which will be addressed by other shadow Ministers and other Opposition members. I will deal quite specifically with the rights of residents and the fact that this is enabling legislation. I am aware that a major national organisation has approached the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) in the belief that the enabling legislation should be delayed. In other words, consultations should go on with the industry and between the residents and the people concerned and, when the principles have been laid down and the contracts have been worked out, they should come before Parliament so that both Houses can have meaningful input. This will enable the Government and the Minister to set up a process whereby the Minister draws up the contract, the agreement, the charter and certain other things and then puts them to the House in the form of regulations. Some of the provisions are not in that form. So the matter is left to ministerial direction. What happens in that regard is that the Minister automatically puts it over to the bureaucrats and the legislation, the principles and the contracts result from bureaucratic input and not from the Minister and certainly not from this Parliament. I am saying that because of the lack of meaningful consultation and the 'I'm an individual' approach there is a concern in the industry that this will not occur. It has been suggested that the outcome standards for Australian nursing homes were built around the same premise that there would be consultation with the industry. A booklet entitled 'Living in a Nursing Home' is now the handbook for monitoring teams. I have heard of some dreadful results from some of the monitoring teams, and I have actually been inside one of the homes that have been assessed. There is inconsistency in the monitoring teams between one home and another. There is also a lack of experience which indicates that, irrespective sultations that occurred when setting out these standards, the actual delivery of the assessment leaves a lot to be desired. I fear that in the same way anything that is formulated in respect of the contract and the charter might suffer the same fate. As a result of the Chris Ronalds report there had to be an immediate report for the Commonwealth in the form of a practical guide in respect of the duty of care, because in many cases the Chris Ronalds report conflicted with the professional duty of care of the nurses involved in a caring situation. This report, commissioned by the Government and delivered by Tracey T. A. MCDonald and Philip W. Bates, gives many examples where there is an actual conflict between the duty of care and the right of individuals in residence and where they cannot be delivered in certain circumstances. In fact, I believe that the Government was rather startled by that report. It is a very honest assessment of where there can be a conflict between a charter of rights and professional duty. As I have said, the report was the result of failures in the Chris Ronalds report to address that type of thing. There has been a call for the deferral of these enabling sections. One must wonder why the Government is rushing in at this stage of the session and pushing this Bill through. I will deal more specifically with the legislative process, and I indicate that in committee the Opposition will move certain amendments. I will deal with some of the areas that are of concern. I begin with clause 4 and the charter of residents' rights and responsibilities. This clause sets out various criteria and provides by instrument a statement of rights and responsibilities of residents and approved hostels. This is subject to a regulation, but the unfortunate part is that if it comes before this House it is either accepted in full or rejected in fulL There is no means by which the charter can be taken up and examined by this Parliament-by the House or the Senate-and debated and amended if necessary. We propose that this not be subject to regulation but that it be subject to formulation by the Minister and brought back before the House where it can be debated and amended if necessary. That is the import of the Opposition's proposed of the con- amendment in this regard. There are other aspects in connection with the agreement, where the position is worse still. The Minister has the right to determine a common form of agreement, and that is not subject to any parliamentary scrutiny at all. We intend to move amendments in that regard also because we believe that the agreement should come back before this House. We can also talk about the aspect of publication of certain hostels. Again, the islation does not make clear the standards by which this will be done, but basically it is in the Act and, while we do have some concerns in this area, I merely mention it in passing at this stage. I refer also to the of the principle of approving operators by regulation, and here we have considerable concern. For instance, in this clause if the Minister neglects to provide the principle it will not come before the House. Again, we suggest that in this regard in particular this should also be subject to the principles formulated by the Minister and it should come before the House for debate and amendment if necessary. Again, we are considerably concerned about this clause in respect of its omissions and the questions we must ask in respect of what should happen. There is also the aspect of the intention to revoke the approval of an operator and how this leaves a nursing home without a duly approved operator in charge. Does it mean that the approval can be transferred from husband to wife? The legislation has been drawn up very hastily and we have many questions in that regard. Clause 26 deals with the approval of a nursing home. The Opposition has the same concerns as to how this provision will be effected, and we will address that matter in the committee stage. One provision about which we are concerned and which is contrary to the recommendations in the report relates to community visitors. As we understood the report, it was always intended that community visitors would be allowed into homes on the basis that they would be friends of the friendless-residents or patients in nursing homes who had no visitors from one year's end to the next. It was thought compassionate that, if no relatives were visiting a resident, a visitor could come in. The way in which the Government has drafted the Bill in this instance is very devious. The visitors to be allowed are not designated in the legislation; no-one knows who they will be or whether they will have a capacity of concern and compassion in entering the home and meeting the residents. No-one knows whether they will be members of Lions clubs from out of town, Apexians or social workers. Another aspect is that these visitors will leg- also judge the quality of the care received by people in the nursing home. Will the people designated to come in have the capacity to make that sort of judgment? This provision in the legislation is particularly terms worrying. We would like an understanding from the Minister at the table, the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel ( Mr Simmons), that consultations will be held with the industry. Such consultations are absolutely necessary not only with the industry but also with concerned people in the communities. The standards to be set must be considered. The question must be answered as to why the legislation contains something quite foreign and not included in the report. The provision to which I am referring in fact offends against the main principle in the enabling legislation-to give the individual rights. As we understand. it, the people who will now, by law, be able to come into nursing homes will be the geriatric assessment teams, the monitoring teams, inspectors and community visitors. They will have the right to visit all residents and to talk to all staff. Documents must be produced, and nursing arrangements and the medical history of individuals must be available. All documents are to be available. That sort of provision would be the greatest offence against a person's civil liberties that I can imagine, particularly when that law of enforcement and interference is being given to people yet to be designated and about whom we would have some concern. I now refer to clause 28-MONICA",79
123,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"Mr Millar)Order! I remind the honourable gentleman that he is not free to anticipate the committee proceedings by clausal reference, but he is free to allude to these matters in general debating terms.",82
124,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"I will refer, then, to the agreement relating to nursing homes. Again, we have the problem that there is no regulation. We believe that the Parliament should have the right to make determinations on what that agreement should be, particularly when it affects so many in the industry and individuals as well. Again, this provision is an open chequebook to the bureaucracy to set up whatever it wishes without the Parliament having any right to examine the matter. The charter for the rights of residents falls into the same category. We have major concerns about all these areas. We are saying that, by regulation, the situation is either all or nothing. What we propose is that the Minister will have the responsibility to consult with all sections of the industry. Although it is not spelt out in the legislation, the Minister must consult all the national organisations, 110t just those of his own choosing. I understand that one organisation has been refused that type of entry at this stage of the consultations. I refer to the geriatric association, the Australian Nurses Federation, the consumers, and the representatives of the relatives. Consultation must be held with the States and local government, and we will ensure that this action is taken. I hope that the amendments we propose will be debated in the committee stage. The Opposition sees it as the responsibility of the Minister to report back to government and not hide behind regulations and the bureaucracy. If there is no hidden agenda in this legislation, what I have proposed should be the course followed. We are discussing in this case the quality of the care of our aged. We are talking about the rights of an individual to be absorbed into a higher quality of care, and that is what is intended. I am sorry that I must cut short the time of my speech, and the debating time for this Bill will be affected accordingly. However, the other matters will be taken up in committee.",82
125,Mrs JAKOBSEN ,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"Cowan) (lO.06)-It is a great pleasure to be able to speak on the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill, which I believe is one of the most important Bills to have come forward in terms of aged care since I have been a member of this House. The Government has shown a great commitment to the area of nursing home care in particular, and the provision of proper and accountable care of our ageing population. I recently had. the pleasure of visiting one of the nursing homes in my electorate of Cowan and having tea with the administrator, senior nursing staff and a large number of residents. That particular nursing home, Warwick Village, is very well run, and the residents seem to be happy and well cared for. Certainly a large number of them took the opportunity to chat with me and ask me to take up matters on their behalf, matters totally unrelated to the conditions of the nursing home. My discussions with the residents were not supervised by the staff in any way, so I am very confident that the people there are satisfied with the nature and style of the care, as well as the quality of care that they receive. In fact, they lauded the quality of the nursing home to me and also to one of my staff members who attended the function. Undoubtedly, the same situation applies in relation to an Italian nursing home, Villa Terrenzio, in Marangaroo in my electorate, which I have visited on a number of occasions previously. I take the point of the honourable member for Dawson ( Mr Braithwaite) that the majority of nursing homes in this country are probably very well run. The point is that it is the exception that proves the rule. We have to legislate to ensure that people in all nursing homes have available to them the sort of counsel that they require in order to ensure that they have proper facilities for their care. These people are very vulnerable and require an awful lot of care from the community, not just from the nursing home. Too often people are put in nursing homes and forgotten, something that we cannot allow to happen. For the Government to show its responsibility and concern for these people is an important step in the right direction. Unfortunately, as I have said, the standard of care in our nursing homes and hostels for the aged is not uniformly high and many residents are afraid to complain about their situation for fear of being penalised or, worse, sent away. At present, being sent away is one of the greatest threats any nursing home can hold over its inmates, or patients-Mr Braithwaite-That is a dreadful word.",83
126,Ms JAKOBSEN,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"Yes, that is right; I was about to say patients or residents. Likewise, relatives of residents may be intimidated by the often unstated threat of reprisals against people in the nursing homes. There are probably some nursing homes of this type. Many of them were discovered earlier when reports were being prepared by parliamentary committees. Perhaps the responsibility of the Government is to ensure that every opportunity is given to people in nursing homes and the relatives of people in nursing homes to complain freely if they feel that the standard of care is inadequate. I firmly believe that residents in all nursing homes will benefit in a number of ways from the Bill we are debating tonight. First, they will have specifically delineated rights and responsibilities. Secondly, they will have an impartial avenue of complaint when they believe that their rights have been infringed upon or their living conditions are inadequate. Thirdly, they will be able to have regular contact with someone from the local community who could be their confidant and friend. That provision is especially important in circumstances where immediate family are not able to visit, for reasons of time, distance, absence or apathy. Whilst the honourable member for Dawson made a statement about the importance of these visitors in country areas, I would say that, given the nature of Australia and our demographic spread, there would be a great number of people in nursing homes quite a long way from their families and sometimes in other States and that, therefore, visiting is not always possible and people are very much left alone. That has always concerned me. I think that we do not actually take enough care of our own elderly. I would like to see that position reversed, but in the absence of that we should certainly be making sure that these people have an avenue, a person to go to whom they trust or who can come and see them if they are not well enough to leave the facility. Amongst other things, this Bill provides for a charter of residents' rights and responsibilities and an agreement between a resident and a proprietor of a Commonwealth funded aged care facility, based on that charter. The charter is a broad statement of principle which will emphasise rights of choice, access to services, rights to independence, participation and involvement in all aspects of daily life, and access by the resident to his or her own records. The Bill strengthens the legislative provisions for preserving those rights by improving access by authorised persons to facilities, residents and staff, as well as seeking to make available information about the standard and general nature of services provided by a particular nursing home or hostel so that consumers, the elderly or their friends or relatives, are able to make informed choices about suitable care. One of my constituents was trying to find a place for her mother to go and stay. She went into a nursing home and had a look around. In the end she could not send her there, not because the· nursing home was inadequate, but because it was too cold. Those sorts of things seem very trivial except when one knows that one is going to be virtually leaving a loved one, or a parent, in that condition, possibly exacerbating any illness, arthritic condition, or whatever. It might seem a very small point, but even the temperature of these places can be crucial to a decision that a relative makes as to whether he wants a member of his family to reside there. The impetus for the changes that we are talking about in this Bill was our Government's decision in 1986 to embark upon a comprehensive strategy to reform residential aged care. This policy was based on a number of parliamentary and other reviews of residential care services and foreshadowed a series of policy and legislative changes to occur in eight stages, ending in 1996. The first four stages of the reform strategy have now largely been completed. They focused on helping nursing homes and hostels to develop a wider range of options to meet the needs of aged people and to provide services as efficiently as possible to give residents the level and standard of care which they need. The fifth stage of the strategy concentrates on protecting and promoting the rights of elderly people who live in nursing homes and hostels. To ensure a sound basis for this particular stage, the Minister for Housing and Aged Care ( Mr Staples) commissioned a consultant, Ms Chris Ronalds, to ascertain the major rights issues affecting residents of hostels and nursing homes. The final report of that consultancy, entitled Residents' Rights in Nursing Homes and Hostels, followed extensive consultations across Australia on the earlier issues paper I'm still an individual. I would just like to quote briefly from the foreword by the Minister in this report. The first paragraph states: The report was commissioned as a result of the Australian Labor Government's firm commitment social justice: enhancing people's rights, ensuring the benefits of a growing economy are distributed equitably, and improving equality of opportunityoccurs in short, giving all Australians a fair go. The second paragraph states: People who operate nursing homes and people who work in nursing homes have a very difficult duty. The work demands continually high levels effort and attention to the health and personal of very frail, old and often, confused people. I think it is important to read quotes because no-one doubts, I least of all, the dedication of most staff in such homes, but unfortunately it is the existence of the exception that causes the difficulty that we confront as a government. As a consequence, the consultant, Ms Ronalds, also had a brief to examine the attitudes and approach of nursing home and hostel proprietors and staff to residents of those facilities. The report identified four problems. were: residents' feelings of isolation and boredom; the lack of control that they feel they have over their own lives; the absence of information about available services; the fear of retribution if any complaint made. These problems should concern both service providers and the community in gen1973. eral. The residents' rights report suggested that there are a number of advantages of charter. A charter provides residents with sound basis for any negotiations with manprove agement around particular issues. It also vides a sound basis for the quality of which management is endeavouring to proment vide. It is a useful tool for informing dents about what they can expect in a facility and for educating new staff members on nature and type of facilities they have joined. 1988. As most members of this House would be aware, elderly people in our society are frecare quently seen and treated as a group rather than as individuals. Hence, the title of the issues paper referred to earlier. They are thought to be without influence and entirely dependent on the good will of others. Through these attitudes, and worse, the worth of older people in our society is devalued and their self-esteem is considerably reduced. They may even become more vulnerable harassment, and sometimes actual physical violence. Of course, we see this in our community, although frequently it is covered up to even when it is occurring in the home and that not in a nursing home. So I do not blame nursing homes for every little problem that with elderly people. Sadly, many older people have accepted this very negative view of themselves and have become resigned to being ignored, isolated and lonely. As a society we cannot allow this situation to conof tinue. Government has a responsibility to needs enforce rights and to educate and inform people regarding those rights. That is what both those this Bill will do. The residents' rights amendments go a long way towards enabling the frail aged in nursing homes and hostels to be protected. They address major concerns identified by the residents themselves in consultation with the consultant. I believe that these reforms are very necessary and desirable. I commend the Bill to the House and congratulate the Minister on his forethought and foresight in These bringing it forward.",83
127,Dr WOOLDRIDGE ,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"Chisholm) (10.17)In speaking to the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) and 1989, I will confine my remarks to part 5 is and part 6 of the Bill. Part 5 relates to amendments to the Health Insurance Act The first amendment relates to Medicare entitlements of diplomatic representaa tives. This is the second time in 12 months a that the Parliament has been asked to apamendments to Medicare eligibility. proThe Opposition has no objection to the care amendment, but wonders why the Governcould not have got it right in 1988 resiwhen it last made amendments to Medicare eligibility under the Community Services and the Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) . The second amendment relates to Medibenefits for dental services. The Opposition supports this amendment, which removes the requirement that dental practitioners must perform oral surgery in a hospital in order for those services to attract Medicare rebates. This amendment is in line with standard professional practice and will remove a possible area of discrimination in relation to the payment of Medicare benefits to for dental services. The third amendment relates to definition of 'officers' of the Health Insurance Commission. This amendment sets a new definition of the term 'officer' as an employee of the Health Insurance Commission quite distinct from the General Manager, member or commissioner of the Health· Insurance Commission. The Opposition supports this clarifying amendment. The fourth area of change relates to pathology laboratories. The Opposition would welcome clarification from the Minister for Housing and Aged Care ( Mr Staples) as to just what is intended by this amendment, which redefines the term 'proprietor' in relation to a pathology laboratory. The amendment sets a proviso that Medicare benefits for pathology services will be payable only where a pathology laboratory has at least one proprietor who has effective control over the staffing, equipment and premises and can ensure the maintenance of appropriate standards. In the explanatory memorandum to the Bill, the Government has argued that the corporate structure of some pathology laboratories makes it difficult to identify the actual operators of the services. The Opposition wants to know how, in a situation where a pathology laboratory is operated by a corporation or by a number of equal partners, anyone person can be held more responsible for the operation of that laboratory than anyone else. The Government's record in relation to pathology is nothing to be proud of. Twelve months ago the Government chose to accept and implement an ill-conceived pathology services table put forward by the now defunct Pathology Services Advisory Committee. This move heralded a period of unprecedented turmoil in relation to pathology rebates, and the table underwent about four changes before it was finally stabilised in August this year. While not opposing the amendment, the Liberal and National parties would welcome an assurance from the Government that the adoption of this amendment will not plunge Medicare rebates for pathology into chaos as has been done previously. We would also like to know why the Government has not consulted the Australian Association of Pathology. Practices until today and has not contacted the Royal Australian College of Pathologists at all on this amendment. The further amendment in relation to pathology, that requests for pathologists to provide written confirmation of services delivered can be requested only by the General Manager of the Health Insurance Commission, is not contentious and the Opposition supports it. The fifth area of change is to the vocational register of general practitioners. The Opposition is pleased to see that the Government has honoured the commitment which it gave in August this year to replace the Minister's power to make changes by way of determination with a requirement that any alterations to the professional body-that is, the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners-be made by way of regulation subject to parliamentary scrutiny. However, this does not mean that we are happy with the proposed vocational register, which we believe to be discriminatory against women. Nonetheless, we welcome the Government's effort to address one of the areas of concern which we have raised. The sixth area relates to health concessions for recipients of formal training allowance. The Liberal and National parties do not oppose amendments here to extend to recipients of the formal training allowance the same health care card and pharmaceutical benefit scheme (PBS) concessional benefits as are available to people in receipt of unemployment benefits. The seventh area in part 5 of the Bill is health program grants. The Liberal and National parties do not oppose amendments to give the Health Insurance Commission, as well as the Department of Community Services and Health, a role in processing applications for health program grants. The eighth area is counselling of practitioners on admissibility of evidence. This amendment provides for officers of the Health Insurance Commission who are charged with responsibility for counselling health care practitioners on the admissibility of evidence to have relevant professional skills as a medical practitioner, dental practitioner or optometrist. We do not oppose this amendment and we recognise that counselling and advice given by officers of the Health Insurance Commission will be of greater value if it is given by people with experience, expertise and same respect in the field. The ninth area in part 5 of the Bill deals with the secrecy provisions of the Health Insurance Act and the National Health Act. This· amendment comes about as a result of the transfer of the administration of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme from the Department of Community Services and Health to the Health Insurance Commission. Obviously, it makes sense to facilitate an exchange of information between these two bodies and we do not oppose the amendment. Part 6 of the Bill relates to the National Health Act 1953. The first part deals with a special patient contribution arrangement under the PBS. This amendment relates to those areas where a dispute arises between the Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Authority and a pharmaceutical manufacturer on the price of a pharmaceutical item. The amendment provides a formula for calculating a special patient contribution to be paid for any prescribed quantity of products and avoids the current trap of payment rates being fixed to quantities prescribed. The Liberal and National parties do not oppose this amendment as we are committed to seeing patients' medication expenses subsidised under a high quality pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The second area of part 6 of this Bill relates to overpayment for pharmaceutical benefit scheme items. Current legislation does not permit the retrospective adjustment of patient contributions for a PBS item in circumstances where patients are unable to demonstrate their eligibility for a concession at the time medication is provided. This amendment will make it possible for the secretary to the Department to grant a retrospective adjustment in cases where, for some avoidable reason, the patient could not establish his concessional entitlement at the time of the dispensing of the medication. We do not oppose this amendment as we support the right of patients to have medication dispensed at an appropriate subsidy level. I foreshadow now that in the committee stage I will be moving an amendment to part 6 of this Bill that will read: Clause 2, page 1, after subclause 2 insert the ing-MONICA",85
128,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,HEALTH LEGISLATION,Mr MilIar)Order! The honourable member is not at liberty to address the province of the Committee of the Whole on a clausal basis. He is free to make reference in general terms to the issues he wishes to raise.,87
129,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I have circulated an amendment that will have the effect of ensuring that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal (PBRT) determination has no effect and I foreshadow that that amendment will be moved in the committee stage. The amendment that I propose is consistent with other amendments put forward by the Liberal and National parties to resolve the current debilitating dispute that exists in relation to the PBRT's determination of 28 August. There have been a number of interesting developments since we first attempted to have the Government once again examine its action. The Minister responsible for the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, the Minister for Housing and Aged Care, has consistently maintained that the Government could not overthrow the PBRT's determination. For example, on 5 September in this House he stated: The Government recognises that the PBRT's decision cannot be overthrown by either the Government, the Pharmacy Guild of Australia or any other body. That was contradicted by his senior Minister, the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett), on the Sunday program the Sunday before last, when he said: . . . no doubt the Government could simply have rejected an independent umpire's decision. Mr Simmons-Give the full quote.",87
130,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"The Minister can say it is rubbish, but those are his words. More recently, last Friday the PBRT itself announced that it would advance its planned February 1990 hearing to 29 November this year so that all parties could present evidence about the impact of the August determination. On Monday this week Mr Justice Wilcox of the Federal Court of Australia ordered that the Tribunal's decision be referred back to it and, within a period of one month, it must publish a statement of reafollow- sons for making its determinations, which it should have already published. The fact is that the Minister and the Government have consistently failed to address the pharmacists' legitimate concerns about the negative impact of the implementation of the PBRT determination, which will reduce pharmacists' dispensing incomes by 23 per cent and their profit by 60 per cent. The Government asserts that the average subsidy provided to pharmacists is $100,000 a year. In fact, no subsidy whatsoever exists. The PBS subsidises patients for their medication expenses. It does not subsidise pharmacists, but reimburses them for delivering goods and services on behalf of the Commonwealth. On any objective examination of the facts the Government should go back to the very beginning of this determination and start again. On any objective examination, pharmacy in Australia is more efficient than anywhere else in the Western world. Firstly, it delivers prescriptions at half the price of any other Western country. It is efficient. Secondly, the ratio of pharmacists to population in Australia is in the middle of the world average. To say that oversupply is evidence of overpayment is absolute nonsense. In addition, the fact that Australia has a smaller number of dispensing outlets other than pharmacies than in other countries biases the figure. Thirdly, there is already significant evidence of consolidation of pharmacies in inner suburban areas. In 1970 in inner suburban areas there was one pharmacy for every 2,155 people; today there is one pharmacy for every 2,997 people. Fourthly, pharmacies have no restrictive work practices, no overmanning and no restrictions on new technology. Computer technology introduced last year has led to significant productivity. Fifthly, award wages in pharmacy are 50 per cent below the rate paid by Commonwealth employed pharmacists. Any of these facts argues for a pre-l November figure fl.r pharmaceutical dispensing. Sixthly,· the figures used by teh PBRT are simply wrong. The figures that were presented to Cabinet are Guild Digest figures. Firstly, those figures are dated. They are for the year ending June 1988, whereas in the subsequent year, 1988-89, pharmacists' gross remuneration has been decreased because of a reduction in wholesale rebates and a doubling of the dispensing volume. Secondly, the figures are not the Australian average. The Guild Digest sample size has been declining over recent years because there has been an increased proportion of larger pharmacies reporting. The income reported has increased because the samples reporting are different. The Government is trying to compare apples with oranges and it will not work. Thirdly, the figures presented to Cabinet showed that pharmacists' incomes had increased by 97.3 per cent whereas average weekly earnings had gone up 48.9 per cent and the consumer price index (CPI) by 52.2 per cent. Any fourth form economics student could tell us that income equals revenue minus expenses: revenue does not equal income. Over the same period pharmacists' expenses have gone up 28 per cent more than the CPI, due largely to lunatic decisions made by State governments such as my State Labor Government in Victoria. What has been the Government's response? We have seen a very interesting circular which has been sent out by the Department of Community Services and Health to all members of the Labor Party. It is made up of talking points to constituents. It. shows what they should say to their constituents about the pharmacists. It says that the pharmacists have inflated ideas of what they should be paid, that they are doing okay and that we should look at how many of them there are. I have already stated that we are at the world average. If one takes into account other dispensing outlets in other countries, we are under the world average. The paper goes on to say that the Government has offered the pharmacists a deal two to three times better than the Tribunal gave them, but they were greedy and stupid and they knocked it back.",87
131,Mr NA BROWN ,HEALTH LEGISLATION,Who said this?,88
132,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"That is what the Government is telling its members to tell their constituents. Again, the fact is that the Government was offering to roll over the pharmacists with a one-tonne truck. Now it is offering to roll over them with a fivetonne truck. They should be speaking out loudly, and they are. It says that they are no better than the pilots. The pharmacists are asking not to have their incomes cut. They are not asking for an increase. They are asking not to have their incomes cut. All this sort of rubbish that is coming out of the Department of Community Services and Health is just talk. It is empty talk. On the Sunday program last Sunday I watched Professor Fred Himmler of the Australian Graduate School of Management saying that the 1980s has been the decade of inactivity and talk. This is an example of more inactivity and more talk. The Minister is simply wrong. He was wrong when he told Caucus two weeks ago that the head of Amcal would be coming out in support of him. He was wrong then and he is wrong now. I can commend the Government on one thing. It has achieved unity of the pharmacists. I held a meeting of all the pharmacists in my electorate one Sunday in June. It was a shambles. They divided into three groups. The Guild argued with Amcal, Amcal argued with the Pharmaceutical Society, and the Pharmaceutical Society argued with everybody. I could not see how a group such as that could achieve anything. But the Government has managed to unite them, and that is quite an achievement. The Government should not think that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal announcement last week is going to save it. There is a problem with pharmacy but the problem relates· to things such as the safety net, which is indiscriminate and does not target medications to those who need them. There is no evidence that patients receiving medications are entitled to them and there is a significant opportunity for fraud. That was highlighted by the Auditor General earlier this year, but nothing has been done about it. The Minister has the opportunity and the ability to objectively examine the fact that the figures are wrong. His own Department keeps records of average scripts dispensed per pharmacy. They can be examined against the figures in the Guild Digest. He will see that the figures are different. If he does that he will see that the pharmacists have a fair and a just case. With the amendment that I have foreshadowed, the Minister for Housing and Aged Care will have the ability to show whether he has any fairness and justice.",88
133,Mr SNOWDON ,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"Northern Territory) (10.35)-1 will not take up the time of the House by responding to the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) . .As the honourable member is aware, the Minister for Housing and Aged Care ( Mr Staples) and the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) have responded in an appropriate way on a number of occasions to the arguments which he has put tonight in the House. I would like to refer to those aspects of this legislation which refer specifically to nursing homes and hostels and, in particular, to the charter of residents' rights. All the amendments in the aged care area should be seen as part of the major reform process being undertaken by this Government. As you are aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, this process is designed to introduce a fairer and more equitable system for the aged in our society and to ensure that our frail aged are treated with the dignity and respect that they deserve. In this respect, the legislation before the House is symptomatic of the Government's social justice approach to the development of policy. The development of social justice in the development of policy and in policy implementation has been a feature of the Hawke Government since 1983. I say for the benefit of the shadow Minister for community services and aged care, the honourable member for Dawson ( Mr Braithwaite), who is in the House, that the approach taken by this Government on social justice is significant in that it demonstrates, when one considers the policies which are being proposed by the Opposition, the chasm which exists between the Government and the Opposition in relation to issues of social justice and equity. I remind the House of the parameters which define the social justice strategy of this Government and which can be seen in the legislation which is passed in this House on a daily basis. The fundamentals to that social justice strategy are that economic resources be distributed more equitably, that civil, legal and industrial rights be strengthened and made more equal, that there be fairer and more equal access to essential services, and that there be more opportunity for the community, especially clientele, to be involved and participate. I think that the charter of residents' rights which is being proposed in this legislation encapsulates all four of those failures of the social justice strategy. It is· something of which this Government can be justly proud. I would like to compliment the Minister responsible for the development of this charter and the work that has been undertaken to develop it. In this context the Government has sought to address the needs of those in our community whose plight and rights have been traditionally overlooked. If one refers to the comments which have been borne out in the representations made to the Government on this issue, there is no doubt that in many areas those of our senior citizens who have been living in nursing homes and hostels have in some instances had their rights severely abused. I am glad to say that in the context of my own electorate, particularly in Alice Springs, where I live, the Old Timers Nursing Home, which is on the outskirts of Alice Springs, and the Hetti Perkins Aboriginal Hostel have admirable records in the way in which they deal with their clients. They are extremely important in the fabric of community services within central Australia. That is also true of the other hostels and nursing homes in the Northern Territory. The key element of the amendments is the endorsement of the user rights initiatives and that a charter of re$idents' rights and dent provider contract be implemented by 1 July 1990. These initiatives are based on the consultations undertaken in the user rights consultancy which led to the issues paper I'm Still an Individual. It is significant to refer to the guidelines for that consultancy. Its objectives were, in the first instance, to obtain first-hand information and views from consumers, consumer representatives and potential consumers; to identify the major user rights issues as seen by consumers, consumer representatives and potential consumers; to establish the priorities of consumers, consumer representatives and potential consumers on these issues and to obtain information and views from service providers and relevant trade unions, professional associations and State and Commonwealth agencies involved in the area. These objectives had been developed in recognition of some of the special needs that had to be addressed. in the course of the consultancy. These special needs were, firstly, people with dementia; secondly, Aboriginal people; thirdly, people from a non-English-speaking background; fourthly, people with intellectual or physical disabilities; and, fifthly, people from isolated areas. It is significant that the clientele of the Old Timers Nursing Home to which I referred earlier would encapsulate those five criteria. It is a tribute to the way in which that facility and the Salvation Army hostel in Darwin-two nursing homes with which I am familiar-have dealt with the significant issues involved in dealing with people who have traditionally lived in a different cultural situation from ours. The clientele of both those places comprises people from different cultures. They range from Aboriginal people who have come from very traditionally oriented communities to non-Aboriginal Australians who have come to Alice Springs from elsewhere. On the other hand, Hetti Perkins deals solely with an Aboriginal clientele. The staff and those responsible for the management and administration of those facilities require a particular sensitivity to deal in an appropriate manner with the full range of their clientele. I am happy to say that the reports that one receives on these facilities in northern Australia show that they address these concerns in a way which by and large a resimeets the needs of their clients. Of course, the issues paper I'm Still an Individual led to the document, which has been widely distributed and discussed in this House, on residents' rights in nursing homes and hostels. In dealing with the principles that are essential to the understanding of the report, it is worth enumerating them. The first is that every resident of a nursing home or hostel has the right to be treated as an individual. Secondly, information is the central basic component of decision making if prospective residents and their families are to become involved actively and effectively in the decisions that affect their lives. Thirdly, a person's sense of involvement in and control of his life can be achieved only through consultation and participation. Fourthly, the rights of a person are not reduced by the capacity of the person to exercise them on his own behalf. Those principles are integral to a community such as ours dealing.in a sensitive and just manner with those older members of our community who are unfortunately required to live in nursing homes or hostels. But they also apply to those members of our community who choose not to live in hostels but to stay at home. It is important that we regard the residents' rights as a way in which we can provide those older people in our community with the opportunity to be recognised as individuals and to have encapsulated in the administration of those institutions those rights that those of us not· living in those institutions regard as fundamental. I was struck by an article written by Deborah Setterlund in the journal put out by the Commonwealth, New Times. older Australians. It is worth contemplating some of the things that she addresses in that article. Mr Beale-Your time is up.",89
134,Mr SNOWDON,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"Mr Deputy Speaker, you should tell the honourable member that the two previous speakers from his side of the House spoke for 20 minutes. I will continue without the rude interruptions of the honourable member opposite, who clearly has no appreciation of or care about this subject. This article identifies the need for the sorts of residents' rights proposed in this legislation. We need to recognise that older people have a right to be treated as individuals and to be justly treated. Because they live in a nursing home or hostel they should not be denied the appropriate rights that we who do not live in those institutions regard as fundamental. Deborah Setterlund states: Older people themselves can talk, and already are talking, to one another about their expectations for a good old age and the limitations they may unnecessarily place on themselves. Older people can continue to demand information about services and take every opportunity to voice their concerns and wishes. They can organise to advocate for one another in achieving their desired lifestyles. Health care staff and community members need to examine the 'aegist' and sexist assumptions that we all hold. No one group or profession is immune. If we reflect on that, we will see that it.is totally correct. She continues: Relatives of residents can show they understand the contradictions inherent in the care roles of Staff may not need to defend themselves from suggestions for improvement if they believe that the frustrations and conflicting demands of their work are recognised. If we want elderly people to be valued in. our society, we must aim to dissolve the barriers between residential facilities and the community in which they exist. We can start by examining our own fears and attitudes towards hostels and nursing homes and the people who call them home. That is what this legislation does. I am pleased to support it and I commend the Minister for the work that has been put into it.",91
135,Mr BEALE ,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"Deakin) (l0.48)-The Community Services and Health Legislation . for Amendment Bill (No.2) includes some amendments to the First Home Owners Act 1983. I will take the few minutes that are allowed to me by the Government, as a result of its disgraceful mismanagement of the House by the guillotine that it has imposed on us,' to talk briefly to these amendments. We do not oppose the amendments that have been put forward to the First Home Owners Act, but one of those amendments seeks to remove a perceived inequity that currently exists in favour of migrants and of Australians who have owned houses overseas in terms of application for the first home owners scheme. The amendment seeks to extend from three months to 12 months the time period that an applicant under the first home owners scheme must be a resident in Australia before becoming eligible for benefits under the scheme. One reason I draw this to the. Government's attention is that the coalition's Economic Action Plan, which has received such widespread acceptance throughout the community, specifically refers to-Mr Snowdon-Ha, hal",91
136,Mr BEALE,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"It is all very well for the honourable member for the Northern Territory to cough like that. He said that I did not have any understanding of this legislation. Instead of scuttling off like a rodent, he should stay here and listen to my speech. The Opposition's Economic Action Plan, in referring to benefits under social security, states: Residency Requirement of 12 months for Benefits. staff. Migrants coming to work in Australia (excluding refugees) should be expected to support themselves for at least 12 months. Illegal migrants should not be entitled to any benefits including legal aid. The reason I draw attention to this is that the Government has widely criticised that aspect of the Opposition's Economic Action Plan. It has widely criticised the fact that we are imposing a residency requirement of 12 months before people become eligible for social security benefits. Why should the ernment criticise that aspect of our Economic Action Plan when this Bill, through the amendments to the First Home Owners Act, is applying exactly the same criteria that we apply in our Economic Action Plan? The Government has criticised our 12-month criterion when, in this BiII, it is applying exactly the same criteria as those outlined our Economic Action Plan. This is another example of the Government stealing the Opposition's policies, and adopting a cynical approach. The Government is so tired, arrogant and out of touch with what is going on that it has completely lost the ability to develop policies of its own, and the only thing it can 1974. do is selectively pick the Opposition's policies as outlined in its Economic Action Plan. The only positive contribution that this Government can make is to adopt the Opposition's policies. If that is the Government's only course of action, it might just as well step aside and let the Opposition get on with it, because we will certainly do a better job than it is doing. The amendments to the First Home Owners Act and our Economic Action Plan show that we, and only· we, have the answers to the country's economic problems. Our answers include-and I invite the Government to adopt these policiesderegulation of the labour market, fewer government regulations, a lower overall burden of taxation, a program of micro-economic reform including action, at last, on the waterfront, coastal shipping, the railways, communications and other aspects of infrastructure, and a program of privatisation. If this Government wants to make an honest attempt to resolve Australia's economic difficulties it should not be cynical, and lectively adopt aspects of the Opposition's Economic Action Plan, it should be going the whole hog. The Government knows that it no longer has the answers for the resolution of Australia's economic difficulties and that the Opposition, alone, has the answers. In looking at the amendments to the First Home Owners Act and seeing the criterion that the Government has adopted in terms of the residency requirement, and in knowing that that criterion is simply lifted from· the Opposition's Economic Action Plan, this Gov- Government has demonstrated how b!\okrupt it is of ideas. It is time for this Gov-rn­ ment to be gone and let a real governfllent get on with the job of solving Australia's economic problems.",91
137,Mr FITZGIBBON ,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"Hunter) (10.54)-I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak in on the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2). The. Bill is comprehensive, and covers a number of amendments to the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act 1954, the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Amendment Act 1989, the First Home Owners Act 1983, the Health Insurance Act 1973, the National Health Act 1953 and the Nursing Homes Assistance Act . Dr Woods-Rivetting stuff.",92
138,Mr FITZGIBBON,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"It certainly is rivettingstuff in this omnibus Bill. I will not digress as the previous speaker, the honourable member for Deakin ( Mr Beale) did, but will confine my remarks mainly to the major purpose of the Bill which is to enshrine in legislation the rights of residents in nursing homes and hostels. Since coming to office in 1983 the Hawke Australian Labor Party Government has embarked on the most comprehensive review of aged care, and as a result of that continuing review has implemented a number of changes designed to improve the quality of life for our elderly citizens. The report entitled Residents' Rights In Nursing Homes and Hostels identified many areas of concern to elderly residents of nursing homes and hostels. Elderly residents saw themselves with few rights; they saw themselves without the right to speak up against se- any complaint about their particular nursing home or hostel; they suffered feelings of isolation and boredom; they felt that they had a lack of control over their own lives and there was little information provided to them about available services. In other words, they were the forgotten members of our society and were virtually voiceless, accepting in a number of cases what were clearly unacceptable circumstances. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Deakin, the tail end of whose speech I just managed to catch, went on at great length .about how this Government. 'Yas lacking in Ideas and how the OpposItIon would suddenly bring a series of benefits to this community. The Opposition has not been able to spell out policies which would achieve, to any degree, the benefits it claims to be aiming for. It is illustrative of just how well the Opposition performed when one cpnsiders the situation that aged people found themselves in before the advent of this Government. This legislation is very progressive. It will benefit the elderly in nursing homes or hostels. It is designed to bring major improvements into the lives of those peopleimprovements which would not have eventuated under the policies espoused by those who sit opposite. In my electorate of Hunter we have several splendid nursing homes and hostels. From my many visits to these homes and hostels I am very pleased to be able to say that because the residents in my electorate have a quality of life, they are happy and have purpose and enjoyment in their lives because they are cared for by dedicated staff, and I take this opportunity to pay tribute to these dedicated staff members who serve the residents in nursing homes and hostels in my electorate. But this is not the case in all nursing homes and hostels, and by implementing a charter of residents' rights and responsibilities, and a resident-provider agreement by 1 July 1990, all residents of nursing· homes and hostels throughout Australia will be able to enjoy the good conditions that exist in my electorate of Hunter. I believe the community visitors scheme which will enable residents to have greater access to. their local community and which will provide them with information, support and advice, is an excellent scheme, and although it will be initially implemented in Queensland and Victoria, I am certain it will not be too long before the scheme is operating nationwide. I see great merit in the legislation now before us and I believe that it will do much to protect residents and overcome problems that have been identified in a certain number of nursing homes and hostels. Nursing homes and hostels will be able to promote their facilities. This will serve as an incentive for the few low standard facilities to lift their game and provide a better service. As stated in the second reading speech, the publication of information about residential aged care facilities is a major step forward in promoting the residents' right to know about the facility they live in. Also, importantly, it will raise the public awareness of the care provided for elderly citizens in their community and the high quality of care provided by most nursing homes and hostels. I am also pleased to see that this legislation provides for the back-dating of approval of a domiciliary nursing care benefit in certain circumstances. In my electorate of·Hunter-and I am sure it has occurred in other electorates-there have been one or two instances where an application has been held up or lost and the domiciliary nursing care benefit has been allowed only from the date of the fresh application. It is also pleasing to see tighter control on approvals for nursing home operators. Those not up to scratch will not receive Commonwealth funding. Another good point in the legislation relates to the introduction of a lodgement fee of $500 and a further processing fee of $500 for each half-day a nursing homes advisory committee has to meet to consider appeals. This is a good step. It will put an end to the number of vexatious or protest appeals that the Department of Community Services and Health has had to investigate since implementing a number of changes to the way nursing homes and hostels are ·run. Nursing home operators with genuine claims have their rights protected and the fees will be refunded in full where a request for review is wholly or substantially successful. This will contribute to major saving of taxpayers' funds. I agree with the thrust of the First Home Owners Act, that migrants and other Australian citizens who have been resident overseas will now have to reside in Australia for a period of 12 months before lodging an application for assistance under the scheme. This is quite fair and equitable. It is also fair and equitable that foreign diplomatic residents and their staff in Australia are entitled. to Medicare benefits where the residents and staff of our diplomatic service are entitled to benefits in the host country. In the time remaining to me I will comment briefly on the establishment of a vocational register of general practitioners. Having read the Senate Hansard debate of 7 September, I note that the Senate Select Committee on Health Legislation and Health Insurance reached a unanimous agreement for the establishment of a vocational register of general practitioners. I am therefore disappointed that the Opposition in the other place saw fit to reject the recommendations of the Committee despite the fact that Senator Peter Baume and Senator Glen Sheil, who are both doctors and highly respected members of their profession, were members of that Committee. The majority of the medical profession including the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners supports the establishment of a vocational register of general practitioners. Even the Australian Medical Association has indicated it is prepared to work with the Government and have an input into the register. I did note, however, one area of concern to me in the Senate debate relating to the eligibility of women doctors who wish to work part time or wish to stop work to have a family, but I am sure that this aspect will be covered adequately in the legislation. In concluding, I reiterate that this Government has done everything in its power to improve the rights, the conditions and the quality of life of our elderly citizens in nursing homes and hostels. The position when we came to office was quite lamentable and nothing that we have done has been open to meaningful criticism by the Opposition and the Opposition agrees with uS'. I know that the people in nursing homes in our electorates are most appreciative of the efforts of this Government. It has substantially increased funding for aged care to $7.8 billion, including social security pensions for the aged. I am delighted that the 30 nursing home beds at Abernethy in my electorate of Hunter are to remain in the electorate rather than be transferred elsewhere, and I am pleased by the decision of the State Minister for Health, the Hon. Peter Collins. I congratulate him on taking that decision. I still have a few problems in. Singleton connected with the Elizabeth Gates Nursing Home but I am hopeful that these problems can be resolved. I should add that the problems are related to the upgrading of the nursing home and not to the quality of care of the patients there. Unfortunately, it is a fact that many nursing homes throughout Australia are regarded as fire hazards because of the need to upgrade them to meet fire safety conditions, and this is causing problems. I am delighted that the Federal Government, on a couple of occasions, has come good with contributions of many hundreds of thousands of dollars to upgrade homes such as Benhome at Maitland to enable it to meet the Board of Fire Commissioners' requirements. I am also delighted that the Federal Government has provided some $2m for the provision of an extra 76 hostel beds in Cessnock. My time has expired and I conclude by congratulating the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett), and the Minister for Housing and Aged Care ( Mr Staples), for the work they have done during their term in office.",92
139,Dr WOODS ,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"Lowe) (l1.07)-ln the 2-1minutes allowed to me because of the incompetence of the Government in organising its business and applying the guillotine, and the inability of two Government speakers, the honourable member for Hunter ( Mr Fitzgibbon) and the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Snowdon), to abide by the spirit of our agreement and going over time with their speeches, I will try to address some of the major points of the Bill before us tonight-that is, to enable the residents' rights initiatives to be implemented in nursing homes and hostels. To the extent that the Bill hopes to make sure that the most vulnerable groups in our society, that is, the aged and the sick, have their rights protected and enforced, it is to be applauded. But, as the honourable member for Dawson ( Mr Braithwaite) and other colleagues have pointed out, there is united concern from both the nursing home industry and residents and their relatives about the amendments. It follows from the I'm still an Individual report and the final report Residents' Rights in Nursing Homes and Hostels, which basically claimed, according to the author Chris Ronalds, who polled only 0.6 per cent of all residents, that residents are bored and lack variety in their daily routine, that their food is of poor quality, that they are forced to wear pooled clothing, that they are not allowed to smoke or drink, that they are victimised and intimidated, and that they have no choice in their way 'of life. The report recommended that contracts be initiated, and this legislation is a consequence of that recommendation. In the limited time available to me tonight I will not go into the details of the inadequacies of that report. It is entirely inappropriate to most nursing homes. Although there are occasional bad apples in the nursing home industry, the vast majority of nursing homes are of superb quality and are run by caring matrons, caring nursing directors and caring proprietors. There is no doubt at all that, following discussions with residents, the national association has drawn up a charter of residents' rights which is fair and equitable to to all. We do not need legislation. Following the release of the report, almost overnight hundreds of frail aged people have become scared about going into a nursing home. They are worried about the care that they will get in a home. Hundreds of people have contacted me about the report. They claim that their comments were misconstrued, their emphasis was changed and, according to some of the proprietors, some of the interpretations of their statements bore no resemblance to the situation as it stands. There is no doubt at all that this amendment as a result of the recommendations in the report is entirely inappropriate to conditions in Australia. For example, it will not allow dangerous patients to be appropriately cared for and looked after. It is clear to me that the amendment in regard to this matter, which the Opposition will seek to make to this Bill tonight, is very reasonable and should be agreed to. This view is supported by the Australian Nursing Homes Association, the Australian Affiliation of Voluntary Care Association, the National Association of Nursing Homes and Private Hospitals and other organisations.",94

H. time.' "". Several of the agreements, both in the hostel area and in the nursing home area, are subject to ministerial discretion and are not subject to regulation. We believe that, particularly in areas of agreement, it should come back to the Parliament. The amendments seek to lay the gist of the agreements before both Houses so that they can be debated, amended and then passed, that is, subject to scrutiny by the Parliament. Then the agreement would be in place. In this respect we have looked at the charter of residents' rights and responsibilities under the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act. Where that is not subject to a regulation we are also proposing that it be subject to parliamentary scrutiny by both Houses. It should be laid before Parliament; which should have the opportunity to approve the charter with or without amendment. This will provide for debate. This also applies to the further resolution of.the charter of residents' rights and responsibilities under the nursing homes section. We propose that the principles that the Minister is enabled by this Act to lay down should also be subject to approval by both Houses. That would make sure that all references in this regard have the approval of Parliament. We are doing this because we are far from satisfied. We certainly, agree with the thrust of· the legislation as far as residents' rights are concerned; but, whilst the Minister has said that he will consult, there is concern within the industry, and all those people party to this, that effective consultation will not take place. This then puts the onus on the Minister-MONICA",95

Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a third time. SOCIAL SECURITY AND VETERANS' NA AMENDMENT BILL (No.4) 1989 Second Reading Debate resumed from 2 November, on motion by Mr Howe. That the Bill be now read a second time.",97
147,Mr CONNOLLY ,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"Bradfield) (11.25)The coalition is not opposing this legislation, but will be moving a second reading amendment in principle condemning the Government for, among other things, its failure to change the direction of its social policies to meet the needs of the Australian community, and also for failing to create a level playing field for various classes of annuities and superannuation pensions. I will not go through the key social security changes contained in the legislation in detail because they are all on the record. However, in relation to age pensions, indexation will be introduced from 1 July 1991 and the single rate of pension will be increased by $2 from the date of indexation in July 1990. Effectively this will mean that age pensions will be raised to at least 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. It is interesting to note that the Minister for Social Security ( Mr Howe)-via his own political propaganda piece, the Age Pension News, which has been sent out to all pensioners around Australia on at least two occasions-proclaims this as a great achievement. I only wish the Government would stop doing it because I keep getting letters and phone calls from irate pensioners complaining about having received the jolly thing, not least to say how much it costs. I would estimate that it probably costs $lm by the time the Government has paid for the stamps, the propaganda and everything else that goes with it. So far each issue has had some dubious comments to make which are hugely inaccurate. Nevertheless, this dubious document proclaims that this is a great achievement, but I have not found a single pensioner applauding the fact that this particular Labor promise, which was made back in 1982-83, has taken some seven years to materialise. The Age Pension News also gives considerable coverage to the initiative of the Government announced at the time of the Budget for a line of credit secured by mortgage on a pensioner's principal residence. The sad thing is that, whilst the Government allows people to borrow up to $40,000 on their houses without affecting their pension entitlements, nobody can afford it because of the high interest rates that are currently in place. Furthermore, I understand that, with the exception of Victoria which has had a similar scheme in place for some years, virtually no bank in Australia has been prepared to take on this particular offer. In fact, the home equity conversions are not offered by the Government, so pensioners would have to obtain the loan from a bank or other financial institution. Many pensioners would not be awarebecause the Government is certainly not telling them-that at current bank lending rates a loan of $40,000 would accumulate to something over $lm over 20 years. While that might sound extraordinary, what it really means is that unless a pensioner is at least 70 years of age-assuming that such a pensioner would have a normal number of years of life-banks or lending institutions must take these matters very seriously indeed. This will become an alarming problem for many people, because no-one knows how long he is likely to live and what the value of the home may be in future years. Of course, the Department of Social Security has given no warning about the potential heavy interest rates to pensioners, and consequently many people who thought that they were getting easy access to funds which they may well require in fact have found that that was not the case. One of the key retirement income changes contained in the legislation will mean that the portion of an annuity payment or refunded superannuation payment which represents a return of capital will be excluded from the pension income test. The coalition has some concerns about the equity of this proposal and this is dealt with in our second reading amendment. The major concern is that it appears that this legislative change would treat pensions paid by superannuation funds in a different way from an annuity purchased from a life office or friendly society. Leading industry groups such as ASFA have argued that the proposal distorts the choices which may be available to an individual by providing a substantial incentive for an individual to roll over his or her superannuation benefit and to purchase an annuity from a life office rather than take a pension offered by the superannuation fund itself. The new rules for reasonable benefit limits proposed by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission to give a free choice between taking a pension from a superannuation fund and purchasing an annuity. If the revised treatment under the income test were implemented as currently proposed, it would substantially remove this freedom of choice from low income earners entitled to social security pensions. The coalition does not propose to amend this part of the legislation at this stage, but we will monitor the legislative impact of the change to see just what, if any, discriminatory effect it is having in the selling of annuities by life offices over normal superannuation funds. This Government loudly claims to have created a level playing field in the retirement income area, but yet again it appears to have created a situation of two types of income being treated differently under the same income test. I refer now to the bereavement package. From 1 January 1990 special temporary allowance and funeral benefits will be absorbed into a bereavement payment payable for 14 weeks to the surviving member of a married pensioner couple. Since funerals now cost between $1,500 and $2,500 each, it can be well appreciated that the size of the old benefit was simply inadequate to meet the substantial increases in costs over recent years. The coalition's policy in this area goes even further than the Government's. In our retirement income policy we are committed to extending the full married rate of the pension to the surviving partner for up to six months after the death of a spouse, which is certainly more generous than the proposals contained in this legislation. Rent assistance is also covered by the and it involves twice yearly indexation commencing in March 1991. As I have said on other occasions, the sad fact of the matter is that poor people, especially those who are totally dependent on the pension and who do not have their own home and therefore are in many cases, especially in large cities, held to ransom in a sense by the availability or affordability of accommodation, are very sensitive to the question of rent support. Of course, the Opposition supports this increase, but we make the point that merely increasing rent assistance will not in the longer term overcome the fundamental problem of the shortage of reasonably priced accommodation for people who need it. I refer now to the unemployment benefit and the job search allowance. In August 1989 there were 30,218 persons over the age of 55 who had been unemployed for longer than 12 months. This represents some 6.3 per cent of the total unemployed. This .legislation contains a number of measures aimed at this group. As many of the changes specifically relate to people who have been on unemployment benefit for longer than 12 months, they are by definition at odds with the coalition's policy, which is to cease unemployment benefit and Jobsearch allowance payments after nine months. Consequently, our objective in government will be not to repeal these programs but where possible to bring them forward to an earlier period of a person's unemployment. Where our approach and that of the Government fundamentally differ is that until very recently the Government has been running an essentially reactive program, whereas the Opposition wishes to run a singularly proactive program emphasising that people from the early period of unemployment should receive the maximum level of support through training, counselling and active job search. Up until very recently people have been literally left on unemployment benefit for as long as 10 years and currently, there are over 30,000 people who have been on unemployment benefit for in excess of three years. The Government is deluding itself, as the evidence of its Newstart program proves, by virtue of the fact that many of these people are simply not available for the labour market, and the fact that many people Bill, suddenly discover that they are available when they are approached by the Department suggests that possibly they have already been employed for some period while at the same time claiming benefit. Some of the key changes in the unemployment area include the fact that from 1 January 1990 the rate of unemployment benefit payable to a single person aged 60 and over who has no dependants and has been on benefit for more than six months will be increased to the single rate of pension. This is an acknowledgment of the fact that people who are in older age groups undoubtedly face greater difficulties in finding employment at that stage of their life than younger people. For unemployment beneficiaries over the age of 55 and on benefit for longer than 12 months, the work test will be modified to allow full time participation in Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) approved training courses or voluntary work for up to 13 weeks at a time or 26 weeks in a year. There are various other 'changes along these lines which again we would endeavour to change to fit in with the new package of proposals now before House. Newstart will be extended to benefiindexation. ciaries aged 55 or more, allowing participation for up to eight weeks a year in CESeveryone approved voluntary work and short training course of up to four weeks duration. I would like to make particular mention of the homeless youth initiatives contained in the Bill. From 1 January 1990, the sixso, week waiting period for the young homeless allowance (YHA) would be generally rehorses-something duced to two weeks. In cases involving mestic violence, et cetera, there would be waiting period at all. The rate of YHA would be increased by $7.50 and indexed uary 1990 to bring it into line with the independent rate of Austudy for 16 to 17particular year-olds. It is our intention, of course, increase access to these arrangements along lines similar to those proposed by the ernment. The coalition fully supports these moves to address the plight of the homeless youth of Australia. The Government's initiatives for homeless youth have been seen by some not welfare organisations as insufficient lated, nevertheless they are a start. On basis of the Burdekin report, there is quite clearly some distance to go. As indicated the Burdekin report, genuine assistance to this group requires the close integration program delivery from a range of different departments such as Social Security, Educathe better. tion, Health and Housing' and Aged Care. The steps taken in this Bill represent the beginning of a long undertaking to try to find some long term solutions to the tragedy that is youth homelessness. I would like now to focus on some of Minister's remarks made during his second reading speech. First and foremost, let restate the coa:lition's commitment to indextions's ation of pensions and benefits. tion's position is that all coalition policies are subject to the Economic Action Plan which has been released and which has been given very wide support by the Australian people. It contains no reference to indexaThe tion of benefits. It follows that government policies or proposals that are not specifically mentioned in the Economic Action Plan and that are now in force remain unaffected. Therefore, there is no intention that, in government, we will depart from Labor's existthe ing arrangements or announcements on Our commitment to indexation is there for to see. If the Government wishes to continue to clutch desperately at straws to try to find some hole in our Economic Action Plan by falsely claiming that it is in fact not our policy, may it continue to do but the facts of the matter are that it will not be believed. Instead of flogging dead of which it is making an doart form-Government Ministers should be no trying to come up with some genuine initiatives to help Australia out of the social and to 1 Janeconomic mess created by Labor. I think it was absolutely fascinating in that context that, on the thirteenth of to this month, the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) wrote a letter to all of his Ministers, a copy Govof which I have in my little hand and in which he made the following point: I would now like to invite you to develop firm proposals for a fourth term agenda. In doing so I would encourage you to work up concepts that do constitute wish lists. The excellent fiscal record and beof this Government must be maintained. the Obviously the Government wanted the letter to drop off the back of the proverbial truck, in because the fact of the matter is that this Government is bereft of new ideas; it is dead of in the water; and, for the sake of Australia, the sooner it goes from the treasury bench, In introducing the legislation the Minister said, 'Today's social security system offers incentives and opportunities'. And so he went on. They were noble words indeed. In fact, they were quite similar to his statements the during the joint press conference with the Treasurer ( Mr Keating) when they failed me miserably to poke any holes in the coaliEconomic Action Plan. At that time The coalithe Minister said: We have made a series of changes to toughen up the approach to unemployment benefits within a positive framework in which we've opened up opportunities to move into the work force. Minister likes to make these sweeping generalisations, but examples abound which raise doubts as to their validity. Let me give a few examples. In the city of Sydney supermarket, retail and service employer groups have been complaining as late as 22 October about finding it so difficult to find enough workers to fill their job vacancies. The New South Wales Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) has at least 12,000 vacancies on its books, including 2,000 in retailing, 1,200 in hotel work-whether that is still accurate in the context of what has happened to the tourism industry in Australia because of the shambles caused by the pilots strike remains to be seen-and no fewer than 3,400 clerical positions. Yet the Minister claims his Government has created all of these incentives and opportunities for people to re-enter the work force. With more than 145,000 people receiving unemployment benefits in New South Wales alone, the coalition and the taxpayers of this country have a right to know why the CES has failed to fill no fewer than 12,000 vacancies. In his second reading speech the Minister also stated: Administrative procedures have been constantly improved to minimise the risk of payment abuse. Is the Minister referring to possible rorting of the system? For a man who is on record as saying during an interview on A Current Affair -)flly recently that there is absolutely !10 rortIng of the social security system,. this IS a remarkable change in position. Yet within weeks we find the Government and the Minister crowing - n this House about toughening up processes In the last Budget. The Minister, in outlining his unemployment benefit proposals, said: The Opposition argues that all long term unemployed people should be removed from unemployment benefit and placed on special benefit-or nothing. Like most of the Minister's remarks on this issue, what he says is based on an absolute refusal to accept any attitudinal or behavioura- change. He wants the status quo to remaIn - orever; apparently he wants people to remaIn on unemployment benefit for up to 10 years, when the evidence is absolutely clear that a person who has been unemployed for 10 years cannot be in the work forc-. The Minister, above all people, should reahse that the employment market in Australia consists of people who are in employment and people who are available for employment. A person who is not available for employment should not be getting unemployment benefits. The coalition and the Australian taxpayer do not go along with the attitudes of this Government and that is why 84 per cent of people interviewed said they support the approach taken in our new policy. Where the Minister seems to want to operate in an inactive society, the coalition in government will implement policies for an active society-precisely the opposite. The new ideas that the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) so desperately seeks from his Ministers are obviously not forthcoming. The coalition through its Economic Action Plan, will fili that very needed policy gap. The coalition strongly supports the emphasis placed by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development on the achievement of an active society for the 1990s and beyond. We believe that, by placing our policy priorities on attaining a more active society, we will be able to give more individuals, regardless of their background and phy's-cal and ec?-omic .status, greater oppor"" tumtles to participate In the mainstream of the Australian community through employment. In government, we will remove the existing impediments through a more flexible labour market and wage system which should enable significant numbers of additional people, who are currently locked out of the labour market and forced to the fringe of s?ciety, to gain training and job opportunities. We must have a more flexible working environment with the capacity to transfer receive skills to workers who are unable to find employment in their traditional industries, and the ability to utilise the capacity of older workers who otherwise will find themselves thrown on the scrap heap of society at a relatively early age and forced there by the constrictions of a union based industrial relations system which has been foisted on this country for far too long by Labor governments and Labor dominated trade unions. In government, we will legislate to ensure that age alone is not a barrier to employment, something that this Government despite its claims to be looking after pe-ple has totally ignored and refused to do. Thnine-month unemployment benefit policy is a cornerstone of a proactive approach to a fundamental problem. The indefinite receipt of unemployment benefits should never be seen as an adequate alternative to employment. Unemployment benefits were introduced as a temporary income support measure between jobs. Today this intention has been distorted by the way in which the Labor Government has administered this program. The provision of unemployment benefits for an indefinite period in fact reduces the urgency of the job search, and there is ample evidence to bear that out. It is a strong coalition belief that welfare dependency is doing as much material and psychological harm to the poor as poverty itself. Our policy clearly recognises that the present welfare system, and particularly the unemployment policy of the present Government, is not working as efficiently as it should. If that was not the case, why has the Government started making fundamental changes in the last six months when it has had the chance to do so over the last seven years?

Unlike Labor, we are not afraid once again to set full employment as an objective of policy. This can only be achieved with our determination to see higher productivity as a basis for wage increases. This is the only way to halt the decline in living standards and falling real wages which Australian workers have experienced for too long under Labor governments. Jobs, not welfare, will be a coalition priority. That is the key to regaining self-respect and a place in the community. When referring to his retirement income initiatives, the Minister implied that we were not serious about implementing a long term retirement income strategy. This is desperate scaremongering of the worse kind. Let me remind the Minister of a few facts. We were the first parties in government or in opposition to create a comprehensive retirement income policy for all Australians, to put it on the table and let people react to it. The Government did react-it borrowed most of it in its own policy. Labor has followed our lead and at last we have the foundations, which we support, for a bipartisan policy for retirement, which we will implement in government. Despite this bipartisan approach, there remain some important differences and some new and positive ideas which this Government is incapable of grasping. Unlike Labor, we have set our target at universal retirement savings for the entire work force. Unlike Labor, we have offered retirement savings accounts which will help people in part time, casual and temporary employment, especially women. For the first time, they will have the opportunity to save for their retirement and· they or their spouses to obtain tax deductions even when they are out of the work force for family reasons.",102

161,Mr CONNOLLY,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"This is no tax rip-off. This is an attempt to help people whom the Government will do nothing to help. Unlike Labor, we want to encourage people to work beyond retirement age if they wish. Unlike Labor, we will introduce a deferred pension plan so that people who wish to work beyond normal retirement age can do so and, if they qualify, receive a pension bonus when they finally retire. In short, we will create a flexible retirement system which covers the needs of all when, having given a lifetime of work to Australia, they seek nothing more than security in their old age. To achieve greater self-provision we will allow benefits at retirement up to $125,000 tax free; remove the capital gains tax on superannuation funds; and liberalise the assets test to ensure that no-one in genuine need will be discriminated against. This policy of this Labor Government has increased the tax on superannuation by nearly 1,000 per cent in five years. Does the Minister know what his Government has done? It has put people on incomes of less than $30,000 in an absolute no-win situation, yet both the Minister and the Treasurer ( Mr Keating) have the gall and the effrontery to come here and tell people downright falsehoods: that everybody should be in a superannuation scheme because it is a good thing. It is a racket for the Government to get its filthy little hands on their savings.",103

170,Mr CONNOLLY,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"I withdraw. Mr Deputy Speaker, the reforms which we have outlined represent our overall approach to retirement planning, which will be essential in encouraging people now in the work force to save for their retirement and to invest in Australia's future development. We all know that domestic savings in this country are extremely low. They have become a lot worse during the past eight years of a Labor governmentand, regrettably, because of its pusillanimous attitude and its intention of bringing forward tax on superannuation, this Government has effectively taxed out of long term saving a significant part of the potential market, which, sadly enough, are the very people who should be involved and actively participating in savings through various retirement benefit arrangements. Therefore, I move: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House: (1) expresses its disapproval of the Government's failure to change the direction of its social welfare policies to meet the needs of the Australian community; (2) condemns the Government for its failure to create a level playing field for various classes of annuities and pensions; (3) expresses its strong concern at the wide-ra\lging cutbacks and complex changes imposed by the Government on veterans and war widows since May 1989; (4) reiterates its support for the Veterans' Children's Education Scheme as being a scheme of compensation and as such falling in arate category to the general Austudy and (5) expresses its concern at delays and inconsisthe encies in the determining system leading wide-ranging variations in determinations, particularly by the Veterans' Review Board.",103

172,Ms MCHUGH ,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"Phillip) (11.50)-Originally I thought I would get up and start answering all the crazy things that were said by the honourable member for Bradfield ( Mr Connolly), but by the time he had spoken for 20 minutes I was tired of listening. Does he honestly think that he can stand up say anything at all? I have said all this before in speeches. People have a lack of faith· the political process because they hear policharity; ticians making speeches without really saying anything. Those opposite just stand there and mouth words again and again that have nothing to do with the facts, that are the opposite of the truth. They just stand there and churn it out. After I had heard about 15 minutes of the honourable member's speech I felt that I could not be bothered replying to all the things that he said; If the honourable member opposite goes out in the next few months and tells the Australian public that sort of garbage he be laughed out of court as he was when he tried to interpret policy on child-care. he tried to say something substantial he came out with a very profound and clear exposiable tion of what Liberal, true conservative policy is on an issue such as child-care. He was then told that he had better change his mind and the Leader of the Opposition, the EmptyHere cock), got up and said that no-one meant that at all. The honourable member for Bradfield then made it very clear what thought of welfare. He described the welfare mentality very well indeed. He either says stuff like that, which has to be refuted mediately by every member on his side the House, or stands up and just mouths utter pile of nothingness. What he said was unbelievable. Now that I have got that off my chest, I a sepwill refer to some of the matters that have scheme; been raised. The honourable member began by sneering at the Age Pension News. Does not know that the one thing pensioners to want is information? One thing they are grateful for-they are pleading for it-is information. A number of people have rung office and said, 'I thank the Government for that. Can you ring the Department and thank it?'. If pensioners are offered any inat all they are extremely anxious to get it. The honourable member talked about the sweeping generalisations of the Minister for Social Security ( Mr Howe). His generalisations do not have any factual basis at all. He talked about welfare dependency. Members of the Opposition speak about tragic cases, and the people who should be on welfare, or they expound the sort of Reagan mentality in about how they really ought to be helped by it is not really the Government's responsibility to look after people. Michael Stutchbury in the Australian Financial Review talked about the underclass of soup kitchen dependants. In government we have got people off dependency and into jobs. We have got 1t million people into jobs. The honourable member talked about the Opposition's new unemployment benefit proposals. The Government has reduced the number of people on the unemployment benefit from 635,000 to 363,000. In my electorate when I will was first campaigning to be a member, when those opposite were in government, the unWhen employment level got up to 12, 13 and 14 per cent; now it is 3 per cent. The honourmember talked about people with welfare dependency. It makes me sick to have to listen to these people mouth this stuff. With regard to the Opposition's record on the unemployment benefit when it was in it was so lax that it abolished the work test. It removed the requirement to lodge personally the continuation of benefit he form. They did not have to front up themselves. People could send their cousins along to lodge a form. The Opposition removed imthe requirement for registration at the Comof monwealth Employment Service. We have an actually made a saving to the taxpayer-the person for whom the honourable member for Bradfield pleaded-of $5 billion in the fare area. The honourable member talked about the Opposition having proactive programs. What will the Opposition do for these people whom the honourable member for Bradfield says we are leaving on the unemployment benefit, the people for whom we have found jobs by way of all of these programs? The Opposifour tion will abolish Skillshare. In my electorate it is so successful that there is a 60 per cent take-up rate of people in full employment. That is what I mean when I say that the honourable member stood there and said nothing. The words just came out. He access. tually said, 'We will be proactive. You left people on the scrap heap'. We have got into work. The figures and the facts are there, in programs such as Skillshare. What will the Opposition do? It has announced, 'We will abolish Skillshare'; The numbers people in receipt of the unemployment bencurity efit have dropped in every category, certainly in the long term unemployed category as well. The honourable member talked about the economic mess. When we came to govpolicy ernment we had to try to clean up the ecohas nomic mess created by the projected $9 billion deficit. We had a lot of problems. now have a $9 billion surplus. I want .to talk about those parts of the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs LegisNext lation Bill (No.4) which deal with the Govsions ernment's new retirement incomes policy. am glad to be able to do so because it fits with our rejection of the Opposition's second reading amendment. The Opposition in its amendment actually expresses disapproval at our failure to change the direction of our social welfare policy. What we have been doing over the years under the Minister for Social Security is getting a direction, studying what is needed, setting up a real review of the system, working out what needs to done, and gradually getting more and more programs into place. At this stage so programs are in place, and we want - to proeffectiveness. ceed with them and build on them. The retirement incomes package is a perfect ample of the way in which we have prothe ceeded . in government. The honourable member for Bradfield actually said that we should be changing direction. We have given the country a direction, and it is working. welThat comment by the honourable member is the most annoying thing that he said. This Bill is the culmination of a long process of reform-a process that is working. I want to talk about the specific aspects of these reforms and the way in which the retirement incomes policy was formulated. That deserves a lot of comment. One of the principal elements of social justice is participation-that is, the opportunity for Australians to participate fully in personal development, community life and decision making. Added to this, of course, are the basic principles of equity, equality and acThe evolution of this piece of legislation embodies those four basic principles. It emthem phasises the absolute commitment of our Government to strive towards the achievement of a socially just Australian society. I refer now to the process and to particiof pation. In 1986 the Minister for Social Seestablished the Social Security Review. The team was headed by Professor Bettina Cass and was given the enormously important work of undertaking the most extensive review that our social security system ever seen. The Social Security Review provided a framework for the public debate We that was to follow. The recent statement by the Minister for Social Security-Better Incomes: Retirement Income Policy into the Century-outlined the major concluof Professor Cass's review. They were: I the age pension should remain the cornerin stone of equity and adequacy in the retirement incomes system; any major changes in retirement income policy need to be gradual in view of the long term expectations, plans and commitments involved; improvements in arrangements for retirement income will need to occur within the context of the present age pension and superannuation systems; incentives to work and incentives to save must be be maintained and improved; and arrange.ments should be as simple as possible, conmany sistent with the need for equity and The next stage in the evolution of the exGovernment's retirement incomes policy was process of public consultation and this was where participation really came into force .. The points outlined by the Social Security Review in its issues paper set the basis for these consultations. Over 400 submissions were received from many organisations and individuals. Consultation with those Australians who would be immediately affected by the policy was also a crucial part of its development. The Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) established a retirement incomes task force consisting of 11 back bench members of the Government to take the policy out to the people and to listen to their expectations. As one of the conveners of the Prime Minister's task force, along with the honourable member for Grayndler ( Mr Leo MCLeay), who is now the Speaker, I can vouch for the success of these public consultations. Over 40 meetings were convened across Australia to listen to the views and the comments of the elderly themselves. Thousands took up the opportunity to participate in the shaping of the retirement incomes system that they would be living under for the rest of their lives and people about to retire came along also to give us their views. Further public forums were held by organisations such as the Australian Council of Social Service, the National Women's Consultative Council and the Australian Pensioners Federation. The outcome is that the reforms contained within the proposed legislation here are the result of an extensive consultation process that began three years ago. When we talk about direction we mean working out what needs to be done and gradually getting it into place in a way that will be sustainable, that will last. So this Bill is a culmination of that process of reform. If that reform is to be sustainable and long term, the process that the Government is undertaking is absolutely necessary. Future conservative governments-if ever they come into being-will find it virtually impossible to dismantle such social policy reforms, probably the most comprehensive since the Whitlam Government, because of the public consultation process that has led to this Bill being debated before this House. Briefly, I will give the details of that retirement incomes policy and leave my colleagues to discuss other sections of this magnificent piece of legislation before us tonight. I remember coming into this place to listen to the second reading speech of the Minister. I felt that this was the major reason-there are lots of reasons-for having been in government. It was one of those times when one has a sense of achievement, that one's Party in government has achieved something for the people of Australia. When I was sitting here listening to the second reading speech I was just overwhelmed by the fact that something good was happening, yet this extraordinary list of amendments has been put up. The details of the retirement incomes policy are as follows: consistent with one of the. major findings of the Cass review, at the very heart of the Government's policy is the undertaking that the Federal Government will always provide, through the age pension, basic support for those who have not had the opportunity or means to save during their working lives. But, at the same time, it is a policy that aims to encourage people to save for their retirement through superannuation. As a result of this retirement incomes policy pensioners will receive a special increase on top of indexation next April. The single age pension will, therefore, increase by at least $11 a week and the combined married rate by about $18. Rent assistance will be doubled-let us be perfectly clear about what is happening here because a lot of money is involved-to $30 a week by this time next year and then indexed for inflation. We have yet to see the Opposition's commitments on indexation. The income test free area is now 100 per cent tax free for married couples and will become tax free for single pensioners in July 1990. From July 1991, for the first time ever, the income test free area will be indexed. From 1995 no full or part rate age or service pensioner will pay any income tax. I reckon that is magnificent. This will be a major benefit for superannuants and those approaching retirement. An improved and simplified bereavement package will assist many older people in a major crisis period. Tax deductions for superannuation contributions will be substantially increased to encourage people to start saving for their retirement now. More women will be encouraged to join superannuation schemes. Better advice and information will be made available about social security, taxation, savings and investments. Already the financial information service for pensioners has begun and people are rushing it. This will be the most expanded service that has ever been set up by the Government. I want to remind people that the setting up of that service was a suggestion put to the task force members as they went around the country. It was suggested by those people we listened to. All the details of the retirement incomes policy that I have just listed are the result of that consulring tation process; the result of a process that has been going on for a long time; and the result of a direction that has been discovered and stuck to and worked on. It is unbelievable that the Opposition expresses disapproval at our failure. to change direction. I have total confidence that, with the help of the consultation process with the Australian public, we will be able to stay in government to see that direction through. Wednesday, 22 November 1989",104
173,Mr TIM FISCHER ,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"Farrer) (12.07 alition a.m.)-I support the excellent comments made by the honourable member for Bradfield ( Mr Connolly), who led for the Opposition in this debate on the Social curity and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No.4), which is key legand islation. I respond to the honourable member for Phillip (Ms MCHugh) by saying that obviously she has become rather excited lowing the successful doorknock of her torate last weekend by the pharmacists, which will see Charles Copeman become the next member for Phillip. To address a particular point she raised in respect of Skillshare the coalition's highly successful and well ceived Economic Action Plan, I point out the House that in that plan we give a very firm commitment to boost the Jobtrain scheme. This is something the honourable duced member has cunningly ignored. However, highlight that point to the House in rejecting her comments about Skillshare. A classic comes from the honourable about that. member for Petrie ( Mr Johns). I understand he may be speaking in this debate tonight. The House will recall that some little time ago in the context of the debate on this legislation the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) called a veteran service pensioner in South Australia a 'silly old bugger'. The honourable member for Petrie, who is speaking in this debate, has written a form letter which says: Dear . . . I am disappointed at 'your attitude to the Government and the Prime Minister. Do you realise that the Prime Minister not only had every right to be annoyed with the man from Whyalla but he would have been quite justified in suing him for slander. That rude and ignorant manthe honourable member for Petrie is referto digger Bob Bell, the veteran service pensioner who was called a silly old bugger by the Prime Ministernot only did not understand how well pensioners have benefited under Labor but he accused the Prime Minister . . . I will not dwell on it, but it is rather interesting that the honourable member for Petrie is now backing the remark of the Prime Minister, for which the Prime Minister apologised, in respect of a particular veteran service pensioner. In the second reading amendment the cohas quite properly moved-and I will deal more with the veterans' affairs components because the honourable member for Bradfield has adequately covered the social Sesecurity components-we express our very strong concern at the wide-ranging cutbacks complex changes applied by this Government since May 1985. I am pleased to see the Minister for Veterans' Affairs ( Mr folHumphreys) in the House. He knows, and elecother Labor members have accepted, that there are nine specific cutbacks on a list which has been agreed to by both sides of the House as having occurred since May and 1985. There were 10 on the list but, to its recredit, the Government rectified one of to those-the Defence Force retirement and death benefits 2 per cent reduction. I have always given that acknowledgment and rethe list of 10 cutbacks to a list of nine I cutbacks. Many veterans from Portland and Bendigo, where I was over the weekend, and right across Australia are very concerned, Also in this Bill there is a situation emerging where the Government is taking away further from the particular status of the veterans' children education scheme. That is a scheme of compensation. The move to link it more closely with the general Austudy scheme does cause a great deal of concern to many veterans' organisations because it removes the key role of the veterans' children education scheme, which is one of compensation. We have seen increasing delays in the determining systems, which has caused havoc for many veterans. I will deal with this in more detail in the context of clause 88 of the Bill. This Bill embraces a number of Budget improvements in both social security and veterans' affairs. I acknowledge that. It then goes on to deal with some veterans' affairs only aspects. Interestingly enough, one of those must be close to the classic of all time. I refer to clause 130 on page 124 of the Bill. It states: Section 21 of the Principal Act is amended: (a) by omitting from paragraph (IA) (a) 'in this subsection called the determining body' and substituting '(in this subsection called the ""determining body"")' . . . They are exactly the same words. In the second part of the amendment there is one additional set of single quotes and a bold representation of the phrase 'determining body'. It is classic drafting. It deserves a raspberry. It is obviously required because of errors made in previous legislation. I particularly want to turn to clause 88 of the Bill. I have discussed this with the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, veterans and veterans' organisations because it deals with a complex situation. In the 1988-89 Budget the Government announced two new measures for veterans, with special reference to disability pensions. Firstly, it announced the new scheme, the extreme disability adjustment, and, secondly, the lowering from 100 per cent to 70 per cent of the eligibility criteria for the totally and permanently incapacitated (TPI) pension. The Government brought forward its legislation. It passed Parliament and was proclaimed in December last year, applying from December 1988. The Veterans' Review Board, in its wisdom, earlier this year granted a number of claims under this new scheme A, the extreme disability adjustment, and new scheme Brelating to the improved TPI criteria, backdating beyond December 1988 payments to the veterans involved, beyond, in effect, the very existence of new scheme A and new scheme B. Clause 88 seeks to put beyond doubt that the exact commencement of new scheme A and new scheme B was, in fact, December 1988. The matter has been tested in the Federal Court of Australia. In Walshe v. Repatriation Commission a ruling was given that the original legislation should apply and that the determining system should interpret it as applying from December 1988 onwards. This creates a circumstance where some veterans-the Minister may be able to tell the House the exact number but I understand it may be around 40-have been allotted entitlements in arrears of December 1988 which are now deemed to be incorrectly allotted and, by a Federal Court determination, to be outside the scope of the original legislation. In these circumstances I think it is proper that I ask the Government to make it very clear in the House tonight and to give some assurances in relation to these changes. Firstly, where the veteran would have been eligible for a TPI pension on the more stringent 100 per cent criteria, nothing in new clause 88 precludes the determining system from providing that and in fact backdating it prior to December 1988 if need be or if an individual case arises well beyond December 1988. I believe that that is the situation from a reading of the explanatory memorandum and clause 88 of the actual amending legislation. I believe that that needs to be stated in the House here tonight so that it can be relevant to the further consideration of the legislation in the Semite. Secondly, I ask for an assurance that the payments to those who have qualified for the new s-heme A relating to the extreme disability adjustment or the new scheme B relating to the 70 per cent disability pension as a factor for granting of TPI will continue inasmuch as the determining system has so determined from December 1988 onwards and that they too will not be detrimentally affected by clause 88 and the question of the arrears determined and applying prior to December 1988. I think those two assurances are not unreasonable. As I understand the position, clause 88 will not in any way undermine those two aspects, which are quite complex but which need to be addressed for the Parliament to make a proper determination on this matter. If the House moved for and deleted clause 88, or if the House inserted a commencement date of, for example, 1 March 1990, those steps may not achieve the purpose which some would hope they might. The Repatriation Commission has already been to the Federal Court and has succeeded in knocking out the arrears by gaining an interpretation that the original legislation clearly provided that the two new schemesscheme A and scheme B-in effect commenced only from December 1988. Some people who have fallen into this special category have been granted a determination by the Veterans' Review Board of quite substantial amounts. I understand that as much as $10,000 has been granted to some veterans who have got up in terms of the quite extraordinary determinations of the Veterans' Review Board which do not seem to have a degree of consistency in this matter. What will the Government do about those? In relation to that, I put to the Government that the position of those who have got up under the determinations of the Veterans' Review Board since December 1988 for new scheme A and new scheme Band prior to the Federal Court determination in Walshe v. Repatriation Commission should be very carefully considered by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, that the question of repayments where they arise should be very carefully considered by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and that the question of hard- day). ship in relation to the veterans who acted in good faith-and the fault is not with them; it is with the Veterans' Review Boardshould be very carefully considered by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and the Government. Indeed, I inject into the debate in the circumstances the not unreasonable statement by the National President of the Returned Services League of Australia that in fact the Government should wear the cost and the wherewithal arising from the mistakes made by the Veterans' Review Board. In respect of the veterans' affairs aspect of clause 88, I seek those two assurances. Thirdly, I ask: What is the Government going to do about those who have fallen between the two stools and have qualified for new scheme A and new scheme B since December 1988? Finally, two other matters deserve comment. I give credit to the Government for clarifying the entitlement to a fortnight's pension where a veteran dies during a fortnightly pay period. The Repatriation Commission will not need to pursue the recovery of a few days pension because the definition will be changed so that a veteran will be eligible for the disability pension for the full fortnight during which he passes on. The Bill also greatly increases the penalties for the misuse of the term 'ANZAC'. This is wise ahead of the seventy-fifth anniversary of ANZAC Day and the special pilgrimage to Gallipoli, which the coalition supports, involving some 60 World War I veterans, eight school children associated with Legacy, eight war widows and many others, including many Royal Australian Air Force nursing personnel who will be necessary to cater for the health of those very senior and very special Australians. It is fantastic that some 306 veterans have applied to participate ip that special pilgrimage to Gallipoli. I support the second reading amendment moved by the honourable member for Bradfield. I. regret the need to track through clause 88 in detail but it is necessary because of the complexity involved and the need for absolute clarification. Debate (on motion by MrJohns) adjourned.
