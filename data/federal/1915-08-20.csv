During the discussion of the measure the Attorney-General said that saddlers'; income would be taken to mean reand ceipts, less, amongst other things, money and outgoings expended in earning the income. Has he arrived at a clearer definition of this word?",5

8,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"I direct the attention of the Minister for the Navy to a matter which has been mentioned in the Legislative Assembly of Western Australia, and about which I have been asked to inquire; I refer to the complaints in regard to the inadequate water supply at the Blackboy Hill military camp, near Perth. It has been stated that only three water taps are there available for the use of some 3,000 men, and that the seven shower baths cannot be used by the men between the hours of 7 a.m. and 5 p.m. Will the Minister kindly look into the matter, and if he finds that the complaints are justified will he remedy the grievances at the earliest possible moment ?",6

Mr JOSE PH COOK - I wish to ask the Prime Minister what motive the Government have for deliberately keeping back public reports and documents, such, for instance, as Mr Anderson's report on the Post Office, details of the sugar arrangement promised weeks ago, and Mr Justice Rich's report. These three, which occur to me at the moment, have been promised for some time, but we canthe honnot get hold of them.",6

30,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Can the At torney-General state when we may expect the memoranda regarding the sugar agreement that he promised to furnish about three weeks ago ?,7
31,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I am sorry I haye been unable to make the statement available, but . the Prime Minister was quite right in saying that it is a business arrangement, and that the interests of the Commonwealth ought not to be prejudiced by a premature disclosure.

33,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I do not think it makes any difference whether people in vest in this or any other loan. The law regarding old-age pensions would have to apply generally in that matter, because the war loan is exempted from income tax only. We cannot alter one law by passing another on a different subject, so that I do not think such investments as the honourable member mentions would be specially affected. PAY OF WOUNDED SOLDIERS.",7

36,Mr SPEAKER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I have received from the honourable member for Wentworth the following letter:I beg to inform you that I propose to move the adjournment of the House to discuss an urgent matter of public importance, to wit, the permission given to Mr Julius Blau to visit BILL. the United States of America, and the subsequent importation of quantities of 4,711 Eau de Cologne. Five honourable members having risen in their placesQuestion proposed ",7
37,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Wentworth) [10.54] Since I asked the questions in reference to this matter, which made the papers available to honourable members, the At torney-General has given Mr Julius Blau notice of his intention to move for the estreatment of his bond. I therefore do not propose to touch in any way on the question of the bond or the merits of the case which will shortly be heard - My remarks will be directed in the form of friendly criticism against the action of the Government in permitting Blau to leave Australia in face of the repeated protests of the Defence Department and their subsequent action in allowing him PENSIONS. to import goods in spite of constant warnings from all over the country, and, in fact, all over the world, that they were in reality of enemy origin. Blau is an Austrian subject, naturalized in Australia only comparatively recently. He addressed his first request for permission to leave Australia to the New South Wales Commandant, who forwarded to tha Minister at Melbourne a report strongly advising that the man be not given the permission sought. Shortly afterwards, on 4th January, the New South Wales Commandant followed this up by submitting to his Minister a case against Blau for infringin g the provisions of the Enemy Trading Act, and recommended that he be prosecuted. The document is the strongest I have seen yet in this connection, and if the Attorney General has no objection, I shall read if in full . It was submitted prior to permission being given to Blau to leave Australia. It has nothing to do with the case pending, and I take it that my honourable and learned friend will not object to my reading it With reference to my 97/4/186 of 4th December, concerning Mr Blau's application for permission to travel to America, further correspondence to and from Mr Blau shows that instead of allowing Mr Blau to leave, it appears to ine that the Attorney-General might be consulted with reference to taking action against Mr Blau under the Trading with the Enemy Act 1914. The case against Mr Blau is as follows:It is thought that Mr Blau has committed a breach of section 3(1) of the above Act, as defined by section 2 (A ) , in that he has done prohibited by the King's proclamation, published in the Gommonwealth Gazette, No. 72, of 12th September, 1914, or the similar provisions published in Gazette, No. 53, of 7th August, 1914. (1) It is probable that a search of Mr. Blau's books will show a breach of paragraph 5(1) of the said proclamation. See Appendix 2, from which it appears that Mr Blau proposes to make payments to Cologne, via America. (2) Mr Blau has committed breaches of paragraph 5(7), in that he has attempted, directly or indirectly, to obtain from an enemy country, or an enemy, goods, wares, or merchandise; and that lie has attempted, directly or indirectly, to trade in goods, &c, coming from - an enemy country, or an enemy. Sec Appendices 2 to 6, particularly noticing the statement of the New York house in Appendix 2, that steps had been taken to obtain supplies from Germany to make up in America, and forward to Australia; the cable of an order vid Rotterdam, Appendix 3; and the discussion of ways of shipping to Australia after receipt of Blau's letter of 19th August, Appendix 4. It is contended that the attempt to convert these goods from enemy to neutral property (Appendix 5) is such a colourable transaction for the purpose of evading the law that any Mr Kelly. British Court would sweep it aside; that the Dutch intermediary is, in fact, only an agent, although he is called a principal. Mr Blau is now getting supplies from America, as suggested in Appendix 2. (3) It is also contended that Mr Blau's intended journey to America is for the purpose of committing a breach of the law, as declared in the second paragraph of the preamble to the proclamation, as he clearly proposes to have commercial or financial transactions with a person resident or carrying on business in Germany. (See Appendix'1.) The Appendices attached hereto arc only extracts from the original documents, which have already been forwarded by the Censor, Sydney, to the Deputy Chief Censor. The marginal numbers are the reference numbers of the Censor, Sydney. I should be glad to know what decision i» arrived at, and would suggest that an early prosecution of this or some other suitable case would greatly assist the local efforts to pre1 vent enemy trading.

38,Mr BAMFORD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"On a point of order, I should like your ruling, sir, as to whether the matter before the House is one of urgent public importance, seeing that the Crown Law Department is quite competent to deal with it .",8
39,Mr SPEAKER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The Standing Orders provide that if a certain number of honourable members rise in their places to support TEEe honourable member who desires to move the adjournment of the House to discuss a subject of urgent public imacts portance, that of itself constitutes a sufficient ground of urgency. I have no discretion in the matter.",8

41,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I rise to order. The honourable member is dealing with certain actions of a man named Blau, and the policy of the Government in connection with importations made hy Blau, and its attitude towards Blau generally. I informed the honourable member, and I now in f o rm you, Mr Speaker, that instructions have been given to take proceedings against Blau, and I say no more than that. It is for you, Mr Speaker, to say whether, in the circumstances, it is proper to proceed any further with this motion. It is perfectly obvious that it cannot beopen for honourable members to pre-judge or anticipate in any way the proceedingsof the Court in regard to this matter. I desire to say quite frankly, that, although the matter is in the hands of the Crown Solicitor, the case is not l e g all y sub j u d i c e . Nevertheless, the first steps towards a prosecution have been taken, and the m a n will be proceeded against.",8

I said at the outset of m y remarks that I did not propose to touch on that case at all . raisin g is, a f t e r t h is protest came from the Defence D e p a r t m e n t , a f t e r - the strong recommendation to the Minister to proceed against B l a u for enemy t r a d in g , did the Minister proceed to take a n y action?

The Militar y Department had not prepared the formal papers for this man's departure, although urged hy the Attorney-General, in a personal letter, to do so. In justice to the Attorney-General, I should like to say that he intended to exact a bondsufficient to insure that the operations of Blau in America would not be such as would in any way detrimentally affect the Empire. But with the merits of that bond I do not propose to deal now.",9
48,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I propose to deal with it , though.",10

KELLY - - I could not give my 1 opinion of what the bond is worth without discussing the pending case; but there - is no occasion for heat in this matter. I should like to now trace this matter to the deck of the steamer Sonoma at the time when this man Blau turned up for departure. The report from Sydney, dated 18th January, readsCaptain Bowie Wilson attended the departure of the Sonoma. On his arrival the Provost-Marshal introduced him to Mr. who said he was looking after Mr Blau's interests with respect to his getting permission to leave by the Sonoma. Mr. Captain Wilson a wire from Mr Hughes stating that permission would be given, and also a letter, dated 14th inst., stating that the nccessiiry permit had been posted, but Mr. stated that the papers had not arrived. Mr then introduced Mr Blau, and it was pointed out to them that Mr Blau had not got the necessary permission, and that the Minister of Defence was the person required to give that permission. A general discussion then took place, during which Captain 'Bowie Wilson, not knowing who Mr. asked Mr what his connection was with the business of Julius Blau and Sons, ancl whether lie was Mr Blau's secretary, to which Mr replied that lie was not in the Imsincss, but was interested in this visit of Air. Blau's to America, in which statement Mr 1 Blau concurred, and that he had interviewed   him that if Mr Hughes was satisfied that he  The report continuesIn view of the apparent decision of the Attorney-General that the evidence referred to in my 97/4/186 of 4th inst. cloes not amount to enemy trading, or attempting to trade with the enemy, I would suggest that a copy of the opinion on the case bo forwarded for the guidance of those officers who are looking after this section of the work of the Staff in this District. I tliink that this is necessary, as the officers concerned, two of whom are barristers by profession, were of the opinion that the evidence disclosed a very clear case. It is impossible for tliese officers to carry out their duties properly without some knowledge of. what the Attorney-General wishes to be proved to constitute an offence Blau reached America. While he was there warning began to flood upon the Customs Department from all parts of the world that the goods which were sought to be imported were really of enemy the bond origin. The attitude that the Department adopted was that if the goods were accompanied by the usual consular certificate they must be admitted. A prominent firm in Sydney wrote to the Customs Department, and pointed out that the goods were bearing the same trade mark as were borne by the enemy goods i m ported prior to the war, namely, "" 4711,"" which was, in Australia, the registered property of Ferdinand Muhlens, of Cologne, and that there must either be some f r a u d of origin involved in the i m portation of these goods, or some direct f r a u d against the Australian Trade Marks Act. The attitude of the Customs Depart< ment was a tribute to the ingenuity of red tape. It said, "" It is not for us, but for the aggrieved party to take action."" showed to Heavens! Why the "" aggrieved party "" is Ferdinand Muhlens, of Cologne, whose agent, Blau, was importing these goods! Not only that, but actual invoices and catalogues of the German f i r m , proving the fraud, were placed in possession of the Government. I have here a catalogue issued by the f i r m of Ferdinand Muhlens, of Cologne, with photos of the hranch facwas,"" tories, and on the thir d page appears a beautiful illustration of the New Y o r k branch of the German house! Further, in the possession of the Goveniment, before Blau went to America, was a letter from the American house to Mr Blau, the Sydney agent of the same Home house in Germany, describing the house in Cologne as the "" Mother house.""",10
51,Dr MALONEY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,As it is.,11
52,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"As it is. In spite of this fact, these goods arrived, and, by the same political instrumentality as had brought about the importer's permission to leave Australia, - were passed through the Customs. The Minister will say, as he said to me before I submitted this motion, that this shipment was accompanied by the ordinary consular certificate.",11
53,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,So it was.,11
54,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Then let me tell honourable members what one of the honourable gentleman's own officers says on the question.,11
55,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,No report was sent in dealing with what the honourable member is about to say.,11
56,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The Minister will find the report I am ahout to read amongst the papers; I have seen it myself. It is a report by Geo. A . Mitchell, Customs Officer, Sydney,' dated 6th July this year, and presented to Mr Synan, the Crown Law Officer, who was conducting some inquiry for the Attorney-General. This man states in paragraph 7 of his reportAn examination of the attached copies of invoices shows that .a correct British consular certificate of origin has not been obtained. Mr HUGHE ' S - I think the honourable member is wrong- I think a report has been obtained.",11
57,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I am quoting the report of an officer of the Customs, which was provided for the honourable gentleman's own information. It is true that there is a further report by R. O'Loughlin, dated 21st July, 1915, amongst the Customs papers, hut it does not contradict that which 1I have read. It is as follows: The invoice bore a declaration vised by the British Consul that the goods were of American manufacture. This report does not say that the declaration was made by the Consul-General, but that some other person's declaration had been vised-ha d heen seen-by the British Consul in America. I do not know the ordinary forms, and I am not in a position to speak of them; but between the reports there is no inconsistency; one states that the usual form had not been obtained, and the other is careful to say that the declaration had been vised, not "" made,"" by the Consul-General in America. These goods were landed here, the first shipment by the Barotse, and the second last week; and I have moved the adjournment of the House today in order to in sure that no further shipments shall he landed. Yesterday, in conversation, the Attorney-General said, "" Y o u may rest assured that no further goods will be i m ported."" But, last night, the Minister of Trade and Customs showed by his attitude that, so far as he is concerned, he is still of a different opinion, namely, that these goods will have to he admitted. There are two points I desire to make. In the first place, goods bearing an enemy trade mark ought not to be admitted to Australia under any conditions, whatever be the nature of the declaration that accompanies them. That is a rough and ready way of stopping enemy trade. Could there be a more abominable thought than that a man should, despite repeated warnings, be allowed to go to America, and, as a result, send money to Germany, where, perhaps, it would be used in turning out, in the adapted works of the "" M o the r House,"" some of those ghastly poisons that have heen spread over the field of battle?",11
58,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,They seem to be capable of doing that.,11
59,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"They are quite capable, and that sort of thing ought to be stopped now. A great deal of the trouble has, I think, occurred because there are too many Departments handling tliese matters. The Minister of Trade and Customs, apparently, does not even know of Mr Geo. A . Mitchell's report in Sydney.",11
60,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"If it were a report to the Attorney-General, I certainly would nob know of it .",11
61,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"He r e are goods coming to Australia which are said to be not accompanied with the usual certificate, and one Department pigeon-holes the papers, and does not hand them over to another Department, so that the proper thing may be done when the goods arrive! There is another consideration. I have carefully refrained from mentioning any names outside those purely official, and for obvious reasons. All of us are liable to commit indiscretions, but I say with all my strength that we ought to be particularly careful against backing any enemy influence, or the influence of any enemy subject, in the carrying on of external trade during the war.",11
62,Mr FENTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"You cannot make any accusation against the Attorney-General in that connection, for I think he has been extra strict!",12
63,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I am not making accusations against any one, but am, I think, on the contrary, behaving very decently under the circumstances; indeed, I doubt whetlier the honourable member for Maribyrnong would be so considerate as I am. If a member has a constituent interested he might be forced into a position where he felt compelled to do something of the kind, by, perhaps, formally sending the matter on; but if a naturalised alien of enemy origin is not a constituent, a member has no real necessity to espouse his cause, and all of us ought to be particularly careful in the future to see that we do not mix ourselves vip in this sort of representation. In all friendliness, I say to the Attorney-General that I think the Censor, and the Censor's staff, are really the best judges as to who can safely be allowed to leave any particular port. In this case they did prepare a strong case against the man, and submitted it to the Attorney-General, but, apparently, the honourable gentleman was so concerned with representations as to what the man's intentions were, that he let him go, despite the protests of the staff in Sydney. It is a pity the thing has happened, and I deem it my duty to bring the matter up. Obviously we ought to allow no dealing from now on in enemy trade marks, and, secondly, we should be very careful indeed before we depart from strong recommendations made by the Censor's staff as to who ought to be allowed to leave Sydney, Melbourne, or any other port. particular instance, the case submitted against the man was, in my judgment, the strongest I have yet seen. I am not a lawyer, and my yiew may not be worth much, but, so far as my lay mind can appreciate the facts, it is the strongest case of enemy trading since the war broke out. No action was taken, and the man was permitted to go to America. Subsequently the Department asked the Attorney-General for an opinion why the case had failed, and he would not, or could not, give one.",12
64,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"That is not so. I did not give an opinion. Blau's case was considered most carefully with the aid of the ordinary machinery that is used in all cases. We have had hundreds of cases, and wherever there has been a good chance of prosecution we have prosecuted.",12
65,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"All I can say is that I myself asked the permanent Secretary of the Crown Law Department, Mr Garran, why the Attorney-General's opinion did not appear on the papers, and he told me that an opinion had not been given in writing, but that his impression was that the Attorney-General had given his verbal opinion that the case was not strong enough for a prosecution. I am grateful to honourable members for hearing me out, and I hope that the ventilation of the matter this morning will prevent any repetition of such cases.",12
66,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [11.25] - I am sorry that the honourable member for Wentworth has brought this matter up, but since he has done so, it is necessary that the facts should be stated. I should like to say at the outset that I have never had any doubt since Mr Blau returned fro m America, that he violated, and deliberately violated, the spirit, if not the letter, of his sworn declaration and his undertaking to me that his object in visiting America was "" to purchase machinery for the manufacture of ' 4 7 1 1 ' in Australia."" I have no doubt whatever, either that this "" 4711,"" samples of which honourable members have seen, is, for all practical purposes, a German product; or that, at any rate, part of the benefits and profits will go to Germany. I leave that part of the question with the expression of my opinion that I am not at all satisfied that these importations are either necessary or In this for the good of the country. I now come to the position of Mr Blau, and the circumstances under which he was permitted to go to America. The honourable member stated that, because the Censor was of the opinion that Mr Blau should not be allowed to leave Australia, I should have followed his advice. I cannot for one moment admit that the government of the country is to depend on the advice of the Censor or any otlicr of f i c i a l ; the government of the c o u n try must be c a r r i e d on by the Government. siderable at t e n t i on to this case, and I acted in regard to it on the settled p o l i c y that has been pursued by m y D e p a r t m e n t from the beginning. The object of that p o l i c y is to establish by every inducement at our disposal new industries in t h is c o u n try . This m a n , in as t at u to r y declaration, made on the 31st December, set out the in t e n tions of his v is it to A m e r i c a , to purchase m a c h in e r y to establish an in d u s try for making "" 4 7 1 1 "" in Australia. I invite honourable members to note the contents v e ry c are full y . They illustrate very clearl y the k in d of men we have to deal with . This is the one case in w h i c h , since I took office, I have accepted statements of this kind as reliable. The results are before honourable members. Mr Blau, in his declaration, said:I , Julius Blau, of No. 233 Clarence-street, Sydney, in the State of New South Wales, Commonwealth of Australia, merchant, do hereby solemnly declare and affirm that 1. I am the managing director of ""Julius Blau and Sons Limited,"" a company duly incorporated and registered in New South Wales under the Companies Act 1890 on the 8th dav of October, 1910. 2. The whole of the capital of my company is held hy myself, my wife, my two sons, Oscar and Robert, and my son-in-law, William James Curtis, barrister of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. 3. I am a Hungarian by birth, and with my eons all duly naturalized British subjects, some considerable time prior to the declaration of war between England and Germany. 4. My present financial position is that there is standing to my credit at the Bank of Australasia head office, Sydney, over six thousand pounds (£6,000). My business, stock, and plant is of a value exceeding ten thousand pounds (£10,000). Book debts, value five thousand pounds (£5,000). Liabilities, n i l . 5. The object for which I am about to visit the TJnited States of America is for the purpose of obtaining the necessary plant for the manufacture of perfumery and soap, and to engage a skilled chemist, to my approval, who will not be an alien enemy subject. 6. The class of plant will comprise the necessary machinery for manufacturing the above commodities, and, in particular, for filling, cleaning, and corking bottles, distillation equipment complete, mixing, drying, crushing, and stamping plant for soap, and the general accessories of and incidental to such factory. 7. The amount of capital to be invested in the plant will be approximately three thousand pounds (£3,000), and the amount of capital to be invested in the industry generally will be over six thousand pounds (£6,000). 8. The factory should, subject to the delivery of the plant, be ready to t u rn out the completed product during the month of April, 1915. I gave very con- 9. My reasons for stating that the perfume ""4711 "" can be made here in accordance with the original secret formula is that I , personally and alone, in Australia, have the knowledge and control of this secret formula. 10. The amount of cash which I will carry with mo to America will be fifty pounds (£50), and a letter of credit not exceeding two hundred and fifty pounds (£250). 11. All goods purchased by me in America will be paid for in Sydney, and the documents relating to these transactions may be inspected by the authorities if required. 12. I hereby guarantee that no German influence, capital, or interest of any sort or kind whatsoever will be employed in connection with my operations in America or the proposed business in Australia. 13. The new business will be an extension of and carried on by my present company, and will be entirely owned and controlled in Australia. 14. I hereby guarantee that during my absence from Australia. I will not myself, nor as the agent or representative of others, nor will I , directly or indirectly, permit or sanction any other person on my behalf to communicate with an alien subject, nor make any arrangements whereby any enemy subjects may benefit or participate in any profits or benefits arising or accruing out of any venture or business in which I am or may hereafter be concerned. 15. That I will in al l respects conduct myself as a loyal subject of the British Empire. And I make this solemn declaration as to the matter aforesaid, conscientiously believing the same to be true, and by virtue of the provisions of the .Oaths Act 1900. That was his statutory declaration. It is a quite clear and unambiguous pledge to establish an industry for the manufacture of "" 4 7 1 1"" in Australia. Subsequently, I insisted upon a bond being entered into that he would carry out this undertaking. The amount of the bond was fixed at the amount of his capital. The bond was to be in the terms of the declaration. After some demur, this was done, and on the 1st March Messrs. Laurence and Laurence, solicitors, in Sydney, cabled Mr Blau to the effect that a bond for £6,000 in favour of the Commonwealth Government had been executed by his company in terms of his statutory declaration.",12
67,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,But it was not executed in the exact terms.,13
68,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"It was not. But it ought to have been. There was an unauthorized interpolation, as I shall show. The terms of the bond, as wired by Mr. Garran, the Secretary of the Attorney General's Department, to our Sydney office, repeats the terms of the statutory declaration. The bond was made out by Mr MCHutchison, the head of the Sydney branch of my Department, in the terms of the statutory declaration, and was signed by Mr Blau's representative in the presence of his solicitors; hut it was sent, .not to Mr MCHutchison, from whom it came, but to Melbourne to Mr Castles, C r o w Solicitor. Thus it went from a man who had never seen the bond when signed to one who had never seen it at all. In this way the interpolation was not detected. The opening paragraph of the bond as prepared by Mr MCHutchison was typed, and read as follows: Whereas Julius Blau, the managing director of the said company, has applied for permission to visit America for the purpose of obtaining plant for the manufacture of perfumery and soap, and engaging a skilled chemist, and permission has been granted to him This was how the bond as drawn up by us read; but there was interpolated in writing by the partners in the Blau firm, or by their solicitors, after the words "" skilled chemist,"" the following words: and for the importation of - perfumery and soap manufactured in America.",13
69,Mr GREGORY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,What is the the bond in those circumstances?,14
70,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"That remains to be seen. Honourable members can readily understand how this occurred. The bond was drawn by my Sydney office in the terms of our instructions, and it was signed by Mr Blau's representative in the presence of his solicitor, and was then sent to my Melbourne office, which, not having seen the bond before, accepted it in good f a it h as that which had originally been sent for signature. These are the and they speak for themselves. and still am, of opinion that it was a most desirable and sound policy to encourage the manufacture of this article here, and I never contemplated, never approved, i m portations being made. Our policy was the very negation of that, namely, that the article should he made here. In order that I might see that Mr Blau carried out the terms of his bond, we communicated with the British Consuls in New York and San Francisco; also Mr Neilsen, and private inquiry agents were employed, and Mr Blau's movements were watched throughout his tour.",14
71,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,That does not appear on the file.,14
72,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Yes , it does. The reports disclose these facts. Coming now to the importations of "" 4711."" On the l l t h May I received a communication from the Melbourne Chamber of Commerce inclosing a copy of a letter sent to the secretary of the chamber, showing that Mr Blau was giving people to understand that he had received permission from the Commonwealth Attorney-General to import "" 4 7 1 1 "" Eau de Cologne from the New Y o r k factory. I had never given any such permission. I was not aware that any importations were to be' made. If I had I should have stopped them. I minuted this letter as follows:Inquiries to be made re this matter. Sample bottle to be obtained. Customs to be asked for particulars of shipment. Blau to be asked whether he did say that Federal Attorney General gave him permission to import. Mr Blau wrote hack to say that he had not said it . Time passed, and I assumed that no attempt would be made to import. But a week or two ago I was notified by the Department of Trade and Customs that a shipment of "" 4 7 1 1 "" Eau de Cologne had arrived. I did not think that worth of that shipment should be admitted, and I said so. However, I am concerned now with m y own action in the matter, after I learned that Mr Blau had imported goods. It is not a question of whether he was successful or unsuccessful in his efforts to get these goods in . The mere fact that he did not succeed in getting the goods admitted would have no effect on me. It is enough that he acted in direct contravention of his undertaking. I am satisfied that he never had the intention facts, of carrying out his undertaking to go to I was, New Yor k for the purpose of obtaining plant for the manufacture of "" 4 7 1 1 "" in Australia, but that he went there for the deliberate purpose of making arrangements for importing it . On 3rd August last I wrote Mr Blau to this effectI have to direct your attention to the following facts with regard to your recent visit to the TJnited States of America:On 30th Novomber last you, being a naturalised British subject of Austrian birth, made an application to the Federal authorities to be allowed to visit America. You represented that the primary object of your visit was to secure the requisite machinery and plant, and to obtain a skilled chemist, for the purpose of manufacturing Eau de Cologne in Australia. You also personally interviewed me, and clearly represented that the object of your visit to America was as stated above. On the 31st day of December you made a statutory declaration, in which you declared, inter alia, as follows:"" The object for which I am about to visit the United States of America is for the purpose of obtaining the necessary plant for the manufacture of perfumery ancl soap, and to engage a skilled chemist, to my approval, who will not be an alien enemy subject. The class of plant will comprise the necessary machinery for manufacturing the above commodities, and, in particular, for filling, cleaning, and corking bottles, distillation equipment complete, mixing, drying, crushing, and stamping plant, for soap, and the general accessories of and incidental to such factory. The amount of capital to be invested in the plant will be approximately three thousand pounds (f3,000), and the amount of capital to be invested in the industry generally will be over six thousand pounds (£0,000). The factory should, subject to the delivery of the plant, be ready to turn out the completed product during the month of April, 1915. My reasons for stating that the perfume "" 4 7 1 1 "" can be made here, in accordance with the original secret formula, is that I , personally, and alone, in Australia., have the knowledge and control of this secret formula. . . . I hereby guarantee that no German influence, capital, or interest, of any sort or kind whatsoever, will be employed in connection with my operations in America, or the proposed business in Australia. The now business will be an extension of, and carried on by, my present company, and will be entirely owned and controlled in Australia. I hereby guarantee that during my absence from Australia. I will not myself, nor as the agent or representative of others, nor will I , directly or indirectly, permit or sanction any other person on my behalf to communicate with an alien subject, nor make any arrangements whereby iiny enemy subjects may benefit or participate in any profits or benefits arising or accruing out of any venture or business in which I am or may hereafter be concerned. That I will in all respects conduct myself as a loyal subject of the British Empire."" On the 18th day of February last Julius Blau and Sons L t d . entered into a hond for the Bum of six thousand pounds (£0.000), the condition of which was that you, during your absence, should "" not engage or employ any enemy influence, capital, or interest of any sort or Idnd whatsoever in connection with your operations in America or your proposed business in Austi'alia; a.nd should not, directly or indirectly, communicate with any enemy subject, or make any arrangements whereby any enemy - subject might directly benefit or participate in any profits or benefits arising out of any venture or business in which you might be concerned; that you should conduct yourself in - all respects as a loyal British subject; and that the new business in connection with which you were visiting America should be conducted as an extension of, and be carried on by, the said company, ancl be entirely owned and controlled in Australia."" Notwithstanding those representations and your statutory declaration and bond, you made no arrangements for the manufacture of Eau de Cologne in Australia, and, so far as I know, made no attempt to make any such arrangements. On the otlicr hand, you did make arrangements for the importation of Eau de Cologne from the United States. A shipment of this has arrived. The bottles are absolutely identical in get-up and appearance with the get-up, appearance, trade mark, ancl label of those made in Germany, with the sole exception that in lieu of the name and address of Frederick Muhlens, of Cologne, is the name and address of Muhlens and Kronf, New York. 1 It is apparent that the conditions of the bond have not been fulfilled, and I propose to take action upon the bond forthwith. Yours truly , W. M . HUGHES, Attorney-General.",14
73,Mr SPEAKER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The honourable m e mber's time has expired. Several Honorable MEMBEES - Let the At to r n e y - G e n e r al have an extension of time .,15
74,Mr SPEAKER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I am put in a d if f i c u l t position every time as i m i l a r situat i o n arises. E i the r the standing order should be altered, or-an extension of time should be given to the honourable member speaking, in the usual way. However, as it seems to be the desire of the House that the At to r n e y - G e n e r al should proceed, he m a y do so.",15
75,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I shall not trespass f u r the r upon the time of honourable m e m bers. Mr B l a u ascertained in some w a y w h at m y p o l i c y was, namely, the encouragement of industries in Australia , and he made representations to me w h i c h I accepted in good f a it h . I took every precaution that was open to me to see t l i a the carried o u t his promises, but I am now p e r f e c t l y satisfied that he made no honest at t e m p t to do so. I believe, on the c o n t r a r y , that he went to A m e r i c a for the sole p u r pose of m a k in g arrangements for i m p o r tations, never at any time h a v in g a n y real in t e n t i o n of d o in g a n y t h in g else.

The o n ly e x t r a o r d in a r y t h in g was that I should have i m a g in e d that , in . any circumstances, he could act in any other w a y . However, it is m y in t e n t i o n to proceed against him on the hond. What e v e r m a y be the technica l p o s it i o n of Mr B l a u as an i m p o r t e r of American goods, I do not tliink that these goods ought to be admitted, because, as has been pointed out in this letter of mine to him, and'by the honourable member for Wentworth this morning, they are, to all intents and purposes, the product of the Cologne firm. I shall confer with the Minister of Trade and Customs with the view to seeing whether it is possible to take such steps as are necessary to prevent the importation, but I should like to say that the certificate of the British Consul has been given that these goods are of American origin. The statement that the goods are of American origin must be considered, but my opinion was not come to lightly, and will not be altered lightly.",15
76,Mr ORCHARD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Why was no made of the important interpolation in the letter sent by the honourable gentleman ?,16

Mr . Blau was introduced to me under the most favourable auspices by men for whom I have always had the greatest respect. I had not the slightest reason to suspect any malign intent, and until the contrary has been proved Is'hall not believe that there was any, so far as he was concerned. I do not accept mere assertions. Mr Blau was told that he could go away under certain conditions. complied with those conditions ostensibly, and he furnished a certificate regarding goods brought here with the sanction of the Department. I be proved that those goods were of German origin, let the full penalty of the law be exacted, but it is not enough merely to say that they were of German origin. The country is not to be roughridden by the Defence Department because its officers choose to suspect everybody. One of the leading citizens of Sydney was arraigned not long ago for transactions which he could not avoid, and in which he became involved before the war broke out. We cannot accept the dicta of the Defence authorities unquestioningly. The officer referred to by the honourable member for Wentworth was most offensive to me, and had he not worn the King's uniform something different might have happened. I do not know if he is a personal friend of the honourable member.",16
79,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I do not think that I have ever met him. Certainly I cannot place him at this moment.,16
80,Mr CARR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Fro m the way in which he behaved on the occasion, he might have been the Dictator of Australia. I should not have had anything to do with the matter had not the Attorney-General consented to Blau's departure. I had no facts placed before me beyond the statements of personal friends, whom I mention had reason to trust, and as consent had been given to Blau's departure, it was surely the decent and honourable thing to stand by him.",16
81,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Why did the honourable member assume that there was going to be trouble at the steamer?,16
82,Mr CARR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I had the word of theAttorney-General that everything was right.,16
83,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Then there was no reason to go to the steamer.,16
84,Mr CARR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Blau had not received his papers, which were to be furnished by the Department. I was innocent of all that was taking place, but understood that everything was right.",16

I understand that developments occurred after the consent was given, which may have thrown a new light on the subject. f it can But to these I had not been "" made wise,"" and I have not yet been "" made wise to them."" The fact that a man is of alien origin is not primd facie evidence of traitorous tendencies when he is a naturalized subject, and it is not a reason why he should receive other than the treatment of a citizen. If the case were otherwise, there are men in office who would have to be dismissed, and we could not render homage to our r i g h t f u l Sovereign the K in g ; because no one is more closely allied to German families, than he is.",16

88,Mr CARR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"A member's friends come to him knowing that he has the ear of Ministers. All I did was to introduce Blau to Ministers. I had no brief for him, but he was well spoken of to me, and I introduced him to the At torney-General and to the Minister of Trade and Customs, and, incidentally, to the Minister for the Navy, I think.",17

90,Mr CARR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I take it that an honourable member is entitled to introduce to a Minister any one who is creditably presented to him who wishes to interview the Minister. That was my part in this matter. I should be very sorry indeed were it discovered that traitorous conduct had taken place, but I fail to see what other course I could have pursued. I was satisfied in my own mind that a man of alien origin, who was properly naturalized, was finding himself in considerable and apparently undeserved difficulties. Should the contrary be the case, the law must take its course, and I should be sorry for having had anything to do with the matter.",17

95,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"It is our duty as Australians to deal with that matter, but its discussion involves legal questions into which I shall uot enter now. The Customs Department accepts the sworn declarations of British Consuls residing in neutral countries as to the place of origin of goods sent here from those countries. Of course, if Parliament were to say that nothing should come fro m a neutral country about the origin of which there was any doubt, the position of the Customs Department would be an easy one. No doubt was thrown upon the Consul's declaration in the case under discussion.",17
96,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Tlier e was Mr George Mitchell's special report.,17
97,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"T he night before the papers were made available, I said that if the original invoice and the consular certificate were required, they would have to be obtained from Mr Blau, being his property, though I understand that we could get them again by the exercise of the powers given by the Customs Act . The Customs Department doea not wish to facilitate enemy trading, but it cannot hold up goods which are the production of neutral countries. The Customs Act gives power to prohibit the importation of articles, and if there were> doubt as to origin, this provision could be put into force; bufc we must accept consular certificates to the effect that the goods to which they relate are of neutral manufacture.",17
98,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,In this case the Consul did not swear that the goods were of American manufacture.,17
99,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Yes ; he swore'that they were bond fide of American manufacture. His declaration was to the effect that he was satisfied that they were of American production. On one of the bottles which the honourable member for Wentworth has produced, the words "" Made in America "" are blown.",17
100,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,That statement refers to the bottle itself. ,17
101,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I think that the British Consul in New York would not declare that the goods were of American production if they came from Germany.,17

110,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Possibly ; but as the person in charge of the prosecutions for trading with the enemy is a Customs official, I suppose that Mr Mitchell thought that, when reporting to him, it was not necessary to send a duplicate of the report to the head office. struction has been issued that before any other shipment of Eau de Cologne, 4711, is handed over to Mr Blau, or to any one in Australia, care must be taken to ascertain that not only the bottles in which it is contained, but the scent itself, has been manufactured in Great Britain or in an allied or neutral country.",18

These are the points which have struck me from Ministers' own admissions: first the admission of the Attorney-Genereport ral that, notwithstanding that he firmly convinced in his own mind that Blau was a fraud , and was going away for sinister ends",18

It was for that reason gave him permission, but since t - have come to the conclusion that he did not intend to do anything of the kind.",18
117,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I am glad to be corrected, but there is still the other point that the honourable member should have set aside all the declarations made to him by his officers, and by the officers of the Defence Department after full and complete investigation, and still given the man permission to go.",18
118,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"If it had been possible to get him for trading with the enemy, we should have got him, but we could The in - not.",18
119,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I sympathize with my honourable friend in view of the fact that he had a good and pertinacious supporter, equally insistent, and pleading in perfect good f a it h that Blau should be given this one chance at any rate. But the trouble was that he took the advice given to him by liis friend and ignored the whole of the official advice of the Department. That appears to have been the first mistake made, but others equally mysterious followed. The I believe honourable member knew for a long time before any of the goods came here that they ought not to come. Did he communicate with the Customs Department in the matter ? Apparently not, because the Minister of Customs appeared afterwards to be as innocent as Dehe was before, although the Attorneyto General had the knowledge in his pos",18

121,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Eve n the Minister of Customs acted right in the teeth of the advice of his own responsible officers.,18
122,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The Sydney officer did not report to the Minister of Customs; he reported to the Attorney-General. There is Mr JOSE PH COOK - Why did he direct to the Attorney-General, was aud not through his own Minister? Why did he keep his own Minister in the dark concerning this very important matter while he kept the Attorneythe oppoGeneral in the light?",18
123,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I could not say. I do away for not know that that is so.,18
124,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The Minister of Customs I has just said that he never heard of the then I report until this morning.,18
125,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"All I know is that, as soon as I heard of it , I asked Mr Mills not to let the goods in . Mr JOSE PH COOK - Altogethe r apart from enemy trading, this matter throws a strange light on the interorganization of the Departments. Apparently a Minister may he kept in ignorance by his own officers concerning great international matters. Another singular point is the alteration of the bond, which even the Attorney-General knew nothing about. The alteration was made in the bond by an officer in his own Department in Sydney. Mr ' HUGHES - I take the responsibility for that. It might have happened to anybody. The alteration was made very cunningly.",19
126,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I understood that it was done by the Crown Solicitor in Sydney.,19
127,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"My office in Sydney drew the bond, and handed it to the solicitor. Blau signed it in the presence of his solicitor, and it was then sent on to Mr Castles instead of being sent back to the man who drew it . Consequently we never noticed the interpolation.",19
128,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Who made the alteration in Sydney ?,19
129,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The solicitor, or, I lieve, Blau himself.",19
130,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Then I understand that the Attorney-General's own officer was totally ignorant of the alteration which was made by Blau and Blau's solicitor ?,19
131,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,That is so.,19

134,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,B l a u was away in America at the time.,19
135,Mr CAKE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The honourable member should be fair.,19
136,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Fair ! I think we ought all to be fair to a gentleman of this k in d ! If we are fair to him we ought to take care that he is placed beyond the possibility of doing anything of the sort again. The trouble is that we have been too fair to him. The whole proceeding is most infamous, and there has been an almost inexplicable concatenation of blundering in both the Departments. 1 should regard the alteration of the bond as an act of criminality - Of course those responsible may plead that Mr Castles, to whom it was sent, should have seen the alteration, and noted it if he did not agree with it .",19
137,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Her e is the telegraphic bond. This is what they had to sign.,19
138,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I have no doubt about it . There has been blundering in both Departments on the part of officers who certainly ought to have known better, and the matter ought to be inquired into from that point of view. If Ministers are to be made the playthings of officers in this way, and to be held responsible for official blundering twice or tli rice repeated in one single in stance, no Minister will be safe, and the whole affair throws a curious sidelight on the organization of the Departments themselves. However, let us be thankf u l that this kind of thing is at an end. It is the clearest of all cases of enemy trading, and we may hope that now it has been exposed, and the details in quired into and investigated as they have be- been this morning, an end will be put to similar cases. There is too much of this kind of thing going on in all the countries that are at war, and the only thing to do is to follow it up and hunt it out. Both Ministers may regard themselves as singularly unfortunate in having been treated in this way concerning important documents by high officers in each of the I ask the At - Departments. It is unfortunate that the Attorney-General let the man go away in Will he still the face of the reports of the officers who were investigating the matter. They may have been a little too downright and peremptory with my honourable and learned friend, but I have no doubt that they had full y satisfied themselves that the man was after no good, and reported accordingly.",19
139,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"As I said, the only reason actuating me in giving him permission to go was that he proposed to establish an industry here.",19
140,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The curious thing is that the Minister of Customs tells us that the industry is already established in Australia.,19

143,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"That is only a trade mark. Mr JOSE PH COOK - The fact remains that when the Attorney-General decided to let Blau go, the officers of the Defence Department were so satisfied in their minds of the clearness of the case that they remonstrated, and urged him to reconsider the matter. went, and then followed the other succession of blunders, which can only be regarded as very unfortunate indeed. I trust that the discussion this morning will make a recurrence of such cases impossible.",20
144,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Wide Bay-Prime M i nister and Treasurer) [12.15] - I am not sorry that the discussion has taken place. As th© honourable member for Wentworth knows, immediately he brought forward the case 1 said frankly to Him and to the House that every paper would be made full y available, and every facility given for investigation. The Government and Ministers have been attacked from two points of view in regard to these matters. On the one hand we have been told that they are strict and unfair in applying the law relating to enemy subjects. We have been attacked mostly on the ground that we are treating well-meaning men too harshly. Today we have an allegation of the very opposite character in regard to a case in which the Attorney-General has undoubtedly shown a great desire to treat generously a naturalized citizen of the Commonwealth who has been living in our midst for a long time.",20
145,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,He told me he was a native of Hungary. If he had said he made. was a native of Germany he would not have received permission under any circumstances.,20
146,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"There is a good deal to be said for Hungarians in one sense, but there is nothing to be said for ourselves as a Government if we do not take care to protect ourselves against every person, no matter what may be his count r y of origin, who is seeking to advantage himself at our expense. I make no statement of what my judgment and opinion are regarding the man who is the subject of this discussion today. The evidence produced is not such as I should have expected to follow from the kindly act performed by the Attorney-General, and later by the Minister of Trade and Customs. Blau was treated with great generosity and consideration, and in ret u r n he has altered documents. He has imported goods which bear the certificate of the British Consul in America.",20
147,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,That is questioned.,20

149,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"He has produced a certificate from a British Consul in America, and such a certificate is as good as law to us. A Government who would hold up such a certificate, unless they were in the possession of absolutely clear evidence to justify their action, would be guilty of an offence of a serious nature.",20
150,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Does not the right honourable member think that no goods which bear an enemy-owned trade mark should be permitted to be imported?,20
151,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"That would probably be a sound principle to operate on, but would the honourable member apply it in regard to. material from a neutral count r y contained in bottles or packing cases such as had formerly contained goods of enemy origin? A very difficult point is involved, although in general the principle the honourable member has suggested might operate.",20
152,Mr KELLY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Y o u must either abolish enemy ownership of a trade mark or prohibit its use in Australia.,20

155,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The Attorney-General, like myself, has few spare moments, and his opportunities of looking into documents are limited. It seemed a mistaken and insufficient act on the part of the Customs officer if he advised the Attorney General in regard to these goods, and not advise his own Minister. Such a course discussed. must lead to endless difficulties, although - when points affecting the law relating enemy subjects are involved the docuto ments must reach the Attorney-General, because it is the duty of the Law Devernment partment to determine the liberty of the deal, individual.",20

What has transpired since warrants the contention I then made. I will not say that the involved is not one of great public our importance, but whether the motive in bringing it forward was entirely disinterested I am not prepared to state. To Demy mind, this question is to some extent judice, and as the Attorney-General has stated that a prosecution is about to instituted, the matter will be threshed conout much more openly in the Court, and It is receive greater publicity than by the discussion this morning.

170,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," The answers to the honourable member's questions are1. It is understood that G. and C. Hoskins Ltd. can supply some of the steel required by the Small Arms Factory, but that the quantity needed annually is not large enough for them to undertake the business. In this connection attention is directed to the following evidence given by Mr C. Hoskins before the Parliamentary Committee on Public Works in May last :"" Wc have not supplied any steel to the Small Arms Factory for the manufacture of rifles. Mr Wright did interview me, and we would have been very pleased to have made the steel he uses, but we found that his requirements were so small that it was not worth our while to consider the proposal. The least steel we put through our furnaces in one charge is from 30 to 50 tons. If one charge would supply the factory with steel for three years the business would not be worth catering for. Another consideration is that our steel is basic, whilst for most of the factory requirements acid steel is preferable. We could supply some of the steel the factory used if its requirements were larger. I understand that the Government are thinking of enlarging the factory, which will then require a larger supply of material, and that may put a different complexion on the proposition. Wc would like to get that trade if we could."" 2. No. 3. No. 4. Messrs.

TROOP TRANSPORTS: VICTUALLING.",23
179,Mr JENSEN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Yesterday I promised the honourable member for Lang to make a statement as to the treatment of our troops on the transports, with particular reference to the food provided. I may tell the House that the agreement that we Govern- had with the shipping companies is the most stringent that could possibly be drawn, and that it is all in favour of the troops. Honourable members will see, from the statement that I shall make, what the soldiers are given fo-r breakfast, dinner, tea, and supper, and must come to the conclusion that everything is of the best, f it for any person to sit down to. In proof of this several menu cards that have heen sent back to me by soldiers are attached. The statement is as follows:In compliance with your instructions, I beg to submit the following report regarding the victualling of troops on board H.M.A. Transports :The vessels which are engaged in the transportation of troops from Australia can be classified under two heading, viz. :ORCHARD) (a) Vessels owned or chartered by private companies; and (b) ""Prize"" ships, i.e., German vessels which were seized in Australia on the outbreak of war. In the Cifcie of the transports which are privately owned, the victualling of the troops is arranged for by the owners or agents of - the vessels, and a certain sum of money per head is paid by the Commonwealth Government for this service. The amount in question differs in the case of officers, non-commissioned officers, and men, and the scale of diet differs accordingly. In order to insure that the interests of the Commonwealth ancl the welfare of the troops will be conserved, the owners or agents of every transport which conveys troops from Australia to Egypt and other places are obliged to enter into a legal contract with the Minister regarding the victualling of the troops. An extract from the agreement referred to (which is known as the Victualling Agreement) is as follows:"" 1. The owners shall provide and carry out the victualling of officers and female nurses (if any) (hereinafter referred to as the first class), sergeants (hereinafter referred to as the second class), and men (hereinafter referred to as the third class) conveyed in the said ship in accordance with the following terms and conditions :(a) 1. The victualling for the first class Khali consist of breakfast, luncheon, dinner, and tea, each such meal having a suitable and well-kept table liberally ancl amply supplied with articles of diet of the best description and quality equal in every way to the meals provided in first-class passenger ships; 2. The victualling for the second class shall consist of breakfast, luncheon, dinner, and tea, each such meal having a good and respectable table equal in every respect to the meals provided for second-class passengers in passenger ships; 3. The victualling for the third clas3 shall consist of breakfast, dinner, tea, and supper, liberally and amply supplied with articles of diet thoroughly good, well (where cooking is necessary), and of wholesome quality, equal in every way to meals provided for third-class passengers in passenger liners. The Example Menu set out in Schedule "" A "" hereto shall be the standard ancl basis required for the victualling to be provided for the third class. The supper required to be provided shall consist of biscuits, butter, and cheese, as therein set out.

Due precaution is taken that the proper amount of provisions is placed on board, and the master of each vessel is responsible to the Naval Board for the victualling of the troops in the same manner as the owners of the privately-owned transports are liable under the victualling agreement. In order to guarantee that the quality of foodstuffs placed on board transports in Australia is up to standard, all the provisions placed on board for the use of troops on the Mr Jensen. undermentione d of the following articles : Ko. of Days each Week Article.

Whenever a transport calls at a port in a State other than that in which provisions have been placed on board, the master of the transport is obliged to produce to the Inspectors of the Public Health Department at that port a certificate to the effect that the provisions on board have already been examined and passed by the Inspectors in the State in which the goodB were shipped. This procedure reduces to the absolute minimum the possibility of foodstuffs of an inferior quality leaving Australia in troopships for the use of troops. Payment for the victualling of troops conveyed from Australia is made on production of a certificate signed by the Commanding Officer of the troops to the effect that the victualling has been carried out in an efficient manner, and in accordance with the terms bf the Victualling Agreement. Tliat the owners of the transports have loyally carried out their portion of the contract is evidenced by the fact that not one single case has been reported in which the necessary certificate of the Commanding Officer of the troops was not given. The Department of the Navy does not provide for the victualling of invalided troops back to Australia in vessels which did not leave these shores as transports. This is, presumably, arranged for by the Imperial Authorities, but when the troops return in a vessel which was requisitioned in Australia as a transport, the Victualling Agreement, of course, still holds good, and must be observed. Complaints recently appeared in the press regarding the victualling of the returned invalid troops on a certain vessel. The vessel in question was not one of , H . M . A . transports, and I am not aware what arrangements regarding victualling were made at the port of embarkation.

Before concluding, I desire to place on record the very valuable assistance which has been rendered to the Department of the Navy by the inspectors of the Public Health Department in the various States. These officers have been most careful and painstaking in the course of their investigations, and the satisfactory manner in which the troops have been victualled is, to a large extent, due to their strict surveillance over the quality of the foodstuffs placed on board.

180,Mr MATHEWS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Melbourne Ports) [12.26] - During the five years I have been a member of this House I have never taken so early an opportunity to speak on the Budget or any financial statement, though I make no apology for speaking today. I should not have risen at all but for the fact that for some time the Conservative press, and Conservative politicians outside, have been advocating what they call "" economy."" I have listened to the right honourable member for Swan, who is an ex-Treasurer, to the right honourable Parramatta, who is Minister, and to the honourable member for Balaclava, who is the future Leader of the Opposition and the past State Treasurer, and, of course, they having given us th© benefit of their experience, we have to give some consideration to their words. I have never had the pleasure or honour of being a Prime Minister or a Treasurer, either in this or any other Parliament, but, in common with those I Dinner. represent, I have had a most unfortunate experience in suffering, owing to the want of financial knowledge and administrative capacity on the part of those gentlemen. The whole trend of their contention is that we must economize, and the whole of the press of Australia is preaching the same message.",26
181,Mr RILEY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,""" Sack "" the workers!",26
182,Mr MATHEWS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Thos e honourable gentlemen commence only at one end of their economy, and that is at the end where the workers are. But tliese exMinisters are blind-the y have never gained from experience. In the interval between the financial crash, during the regime of the Patterson Government in Victoria in 1893, and six or seven years ago, this State managed to resuscitate itself to a degree. But it was through A . M . TllEACT, the cheese-paring policy of the Patterson Government and succeeding Governments and Contracts. that this State was thrown into a condition of financial chaos. The crisis was just as keen in every other State, but the smash and its consequent terror in Victoria were occasioned by the Patterson Government listening to silly cries for economy-crie s from fools who knew no more about business than a child unborn. . Private firms were encouraged to economize, and as a result we had the financial crash. A time of crisis is a time for a Government to be bold, and assist the community, rather than to take steps which will have the effect of dragging it down. The honourable member for Balaclava, when Treasurer and Premier of Victoria, suffered from the legacy of the unjustifiable parsimony lef t by preceding Governments. This silly policy of saving completely disrupted the State railways system.",26
183,Dr MALONEY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,There were more accidents in Victoria than in New South Wales.,26
184,Mr MATHEWS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Of course. Six or seven years ago we had a bountiful harmember for vest, but in the spirit of "" economy "" the an ex-Prime permanent way and rolling stock had been allowed to deteriorate to such an extent that the traffic could not be handled. The very man that the State Government brought from America to carry out the policy of economy knew that he was impairing the efficiency of the railway system, but he did what he was told. In the right honourable member for Swan we have one of. the old order of Treasurers, and he contends that we could do without taxation on the present occasion if we were to economize. honourable member for Balaclava, however, that he advises care in the exercise of economy. In 1893, owing to the unfortunate policy then adopted, I , along with thousands of my fellow Victorians, was driven to other States for a living-al l owing to that s ill y - I was going to say damnable-syste m called Those at the head of affairs are supposed to be men who understand finance and business, but they starved the workers of Victoria, and ruined business men by the thousand. In 1893 the harvest was so plentiful that wheat was selling at Is. 7d. and Is. 8d. per bushel, and yet there was penury and misery in our midst owing to the causes I have indicated. In a time of crisis, a Government vrorthy of its name should look to the interests of the people, and not cast them aside to starve. It should not disrupt business, but should foster it by a bold policy. Consider the difference between New South Wales aud Victoria. The crisis was just as bad in New South' Wales as in Victoria, but when the - crash approached the "" dear old m e n "" in the Upper House in New South Wales sat up all night and passed a Bill which saved the situation, and the Government of the State, realizing the stress that was coming upon the State, and that the credit of business men was disappearing, adopted a bold borrowing policy which made credit so good in New South Wales that thousands of people left Victoria for that State. Victorian Ministers did not possess the sense to abandon their cheeseparing policy and adopt a hold policy, and the only thing that saved Victoria was the discovery of gold in Western Australia. For eight or ten years the gold-fields of Western Australia kept the people of Victoria from starving. The figures in the financial statement before us are appalling. A f t e r increasing our annual expenditure from £15,000,000 to £24,000,000 we find ourselves approaching an expenditure of £80,000,000. I do not talk lightly of this expenditure; I regard it with all necessary seriousness, and I know that it will take all the genius of the Treasurer, and all the support of the people of Australia, to bring us through the time that is ahead of us, but what a senseless proposal is the suggestion that when our total expenditure is close upon £80,000,000 we should lop off the £3,000,000 provided I will say for the for works.",26
185,Mr SAMPSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,That was not suggested. The right honourable member for Swan merely proposed that the expenditure upon works should be transferred from revenue to loan.,27
186,Mr MATHEWS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Honourable members talk ahout economy, and the first ""economy."" economy they would practise would be to wipe out projected works.",27
187,Mr SAMPSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The honourable member is wrong in making that statement.,27
188,Mr MATHEWS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"There is nothing new in the suggestion. For generations similar proposals have heen put forward and carried out, just as they will be put forward in the future by members of the political opinion of those on the other side of the Chamber when any financial crises occur in our history. Out of an expenditure of over £75,000,000, they seek to lop off the proposed expenditure on works. It is such a small amount when compared with the vast expenditure of the year, that lopping it off would have no more effect upon the financial situation than the bite of a flea on an elephant's neck, while at the same time it would bring misery, not only to the workers who support us on this side of the Chamber, but also to the business men who always vote for those on the opposite side-the y would feel it just as acutely as the workers. Economy is necessary, and the money that we might save by lopping off expenditure upon works could easily be saved by a careful consideration of the expenditure of the balance of the total estimated expenditure for the year. Millions of pounds are wasted. The fact that I sit behind the Ministry does not prevent me from criti cising their actions or their administration. Much economy could be exercised in regard to the enormous amount of money that has heen spent by the Defence Department. I can give dozens of cases where money could he saved, and where it would be true economy to do so. The Department has allowed scoundrels to buy horses at £16 per head, some of which have had to be sold afterwards for 5s. That is one instance in which economy should be practised. The Government are spending millions of pounds upon defence stores. Let them watch the expenditure on stores. In this House on a previous occasion I exposed the rather peculiar system under which these stores are regulated, and I make the assertion that we are heing robbed of hundreds of thousands of pounds during the course of this war.",27
189,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Does the honourable member know it from his own knowledge?,28
190,Mr MATHEWS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The honourable member was in the House when I brought the matter up. The money that is being wasted without giving us corresponding efficiency in regard to the training of our new brigade and our reinforcements is appalling. During the recent three weeks' recruiting rush, men whose physical incapacity was apparent to any person running along the street were accepted and sent into camp, and fitted out with overcoats, underclothing, & c , only to be let go at the end of three weeks. A thousand men have been sent hack from the front who have cost us hundreds of pounds each. I asked a question last night in regard to the medical fraternit y at the front. These men are fools, and not fit to hold their positions, because they have. 3ent hack from the front dozens of men who are hut sufferers from the ordinary complaint of gonorrhoea. stand that any doctor should be able to cure this complaint in Egypt, without having to send back to Australia as criminals men who have cost us hundreds of pounds each. Here is another direction in which economy could be exercised without any need to lop off the expenditure on works. Men with ordinary ailments have been sent hack from the front as unfit, though during the recent recruiting campaign men with worse complaints have been accepted. Hundreds of men have been sent back from the front because they requisition. could not be made as obedient as the British Tommy is. These men, if they had had their opportunity at Gallipoli, would have assisted in making a name for Australia, but these asses sent them back. There was an affray in my constituency. Men on their way to the front, with the desire to emulate their fellows at Gallipoli, were brought down by boat from New South Wales, and what was more natural than that they should expect to he permitted to come ashore at Port Melbourne? But the adjective asses who run the Defence Department muddled matters, and the men could not get leave, and so they revolted. We cannot handle Australians as the British soldier can be handled, because the Australian is not reared to it . Ye t how did the Department punish these men? What did the Minister of Defence say that he would do to these men who were in revolt? He said, "" I will not let them go to the front "" - afte r all the expenditure incurred in training them. At Seymour I saw men who would fight brick walls if they could not get Germans to fight, yet after expending all this money on training these men, our silly system says, "" We will not let them go to the front, "" in order to punish' them. If the Defence Department was run by individuals who knew how to handle men, and who would take hints and suggestions from those who come forward and give them, they could economise, but they do not need to be told anything, because "" they know everything."" Our medical arrangements in our camps are so abominable, so inefficient, and so glaringly inefficient that I cannot understand how any one visiting the camps has not conceived some method by which things could be done better. When the honourable member for Nepean in this I underChamber made his statements with regard to the Liverpool Camp, many people thought he had struck a mare's nest, but we have the same thing in Victoria in every camp. In February last I endeavoured to get the Defence Department to spend a few hundred pounds on improvements at Broadmeadows, but they would not do it , and afterwards had to waste thousands of pounds at Seymour. There is either inefficiency in management, or the men who are managing the camp at Seymour cannot get the supplies that they For instance, there is a square platform and a round tent, and when the rain falls on the platform outside it runs under the tent and wets the men inside. The latrines had no supports, so that men fell into them; and the men were allowed to go four days without being paid. But when I told the Minister of these things, all he said was that the men ought to be at home with their mothers. That is not the way to run the show. One can complain and give hints and suggestions, but they are never accepted. My belief is that if honourable members opposite had been in office, the same set of circumstances would have occurred.  member know that ?",28
191,Mr MATHEWS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"When Senator M i l len was Minister of Defence he tried as hard as ever a man could try to carry into effect what I desired, but it was not done. We have also the case of the Melbourne Show Grounds, where the men ought never to have been put. If the Department was not prepared to make provision for all the recruits that came forward, it should have made arrangements to let the men sleep at their homes and d r ill during the day. That would have been a sensible arrangement, but the Department never accepts suggestions. The men were sent to the Show Ground, and placed in buildings where horses had been stabled, and, even when they were accommodated in large rooms, only those who slept close to the walls could hang up their clothes, while those who happened to be sleeping in the centre had their overcoats, their ordinary clothing, and their kits turned into floor cloths. When I suggested that lines should be hung, on which the men could put their belongings, the Minister of Defence said that it would be in f r a dig for a soldier to hang up his clothes, and that he should put them on his bed. But, hang it all, these men had no beds.",29
192,Unknown,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m.,29
193,Mr MATHEWS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"It is well known that the equipment of Militar y and Naval Forces lends itself to jobbery. A colonel and a captain who had just returned to New Zealand from the front have been punished for peculation, and in every army in the world, notwithstanding frequent exposures, wrong-doing of this kind seems to occur. It is taking place in our midst today. I have seen overcoats in which the material which was purchased for 5s. 6d. per yard was cheap at the price, and others in which the material paid for at the same price was not much better than the felt that is used for putting under carpets. If the information that I have received is correct, there is nothing short of corruption in the fitting up of the transports, for which the firm of Cohen and Company is employed by the Naval Department. The State workshops were tried for the work, but the cost was found to be enormous, even greater than the present cost. The present contractors are paid on a percentage. They purchase materials at wholesale [221] prices, and receive 10 per cent, for management on their outlay on materials and wages.",29
194,Mr FENTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Do they supply plant? ,29
195,Mr BURCHELL,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Does not each car* penter provide his own kit?,29
196,Mr MATHEWS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I think that each carpenter supplies his own k it , and that the plant used is very small, but its use is charged for. According to the infort mation supplied to me, the supervision is anything but what it should be. I have been told that the firm gets a double percentage; that it has received as much as 12 per cent, from other firms from which it has purchased material.",29
197,Mr JENSEN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,All these discounts go to the Naval Department.,29
198,Mr MATHEWS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,That was not the original arrangement.,29
199,Mr JENSEN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,That arrangement ap« plies from the fitting up of the first ship. Every penny received in discount on purchased material goes to the Naval Department. The arrangement is retrospective.,29
200,Mr MATHEWS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I am pleased to hear that. The men employed on this work know me personally, and I have been told by them that a lighter filled with timber was in Hobson's Bay for four or five days. Expenses were piling up all the time, but there was no one to take charge of the timber. I understand that much of it was wood not used for fitting up transports, but that eventually it got into Cohen and Company's yard. I believe that it was charged to the Department.",29
201,Mr BOYD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Does not that suggest that all this work should be done by contract ?,29
202,Mr MATHEWS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,No . I understand that the present system is cheaper than the ordinary contract system.,29
203,Mr JENSEN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The work done by Cohen and Company is the cheapest that has been done for the Department.,29
204,Mr MATHEWS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I have been in formed that tables used in the sick bays had been bought from Messrs. Craig, Williamson .Proprietary Company for £ 1 0 10s. each for which £ 3 would be a fair price. I have been told, too, that timber bought in one yard has been transferred to another yard and bought again there. The Minister and I had a talk over these matters, and he says that my information is wrong, but to my mind, Messrs. Cohen and Company are not considering the interests of the Department. -- Mr JENSEN - I shall be pleased to show the honourable member a copy of the new agreement which has been made with Cohen and Company. It is retrospective, and applies from the Eebruary last. . Mr MATHEWS - I am glad that the levying of a double percentage has been stopped, and that the agreement is retrospective. I believe that, with economy, the fitting up of the transports would not cost more than £4.500, although it now costs about £6,400 per vessel. My remarks show that I am ready to attack even a Government of my own party when I believe it to be in the .wrong. True economy means the getting of full value for the money spent. would not be economy to create industrial chaos by throwing men out of employment - import frozen meat from the Territory,",29
205,Mr JENSEN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I have been pleased to hear the honourable member's remarks, and' if , after seeing the new agreement, he has any complaints to make, I shall be glad to hear them.",30
206,Mr FENTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Has the honourable member anything to say regarding post-office stores ?,30
207,Mr MATHEWS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"No ; but my father was a master tailor in the army, and had charge of commissariat stores, and for years I was in the way of hearing of the peculations that prevailed in connection with army equipment.",30
208,Mr BOYD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,We shall not get satisfaction until we have a Supply and Tender Board.,30
209,Mr MATHEWS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"There is a Supply and Tender Board in Great Britain . What is needed is supervision by men who cannot be corrupted. The faul t I find with Ministers is. that, when complaints - are made, they are always fearful of being blamed personally. Of course, they have to trust their subordinates just as private employers have to do. If a private employer is cheated by subordinates, he suffers, and Ministerial responsibility is enforced by removal from office, which is very often an absurd way of dealing with the case. Ministers, when shortcomings are exposed, should at once make a thorough inquiry,- and they should see that proper economy is practised. In the past, however, the method of squaring the ledger has been to retrench in a manner creatine industrial chaos. £3,000,000 which has been referred to is a very small part of the £75.000.000 to which the expenditure for the year will amount, and Ministers would be unworthy nf their positions if they created 1st depression by trying to save that amount. The honorablo member for Henty knows that the Patterson Government put back Victoria for a decade by the economy which it enforced. Later our railways could not handle good harvests when they came, and orders had to be sent abroad for engines. - Mr BOYD - That was false economy.",30
210,Mr MATHEWS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"E x a c t l y . I hope that the Government will not reduce the expenditure on the East-West Railway or on the Northern Territory Railway by It one cent. Had the Northern Territory Railway and the Freezing Works been finished, we should have been able to without fear of the introduction of the tick pest. The Government must take a firm grasp of public affairs, and determine that there shall be no depression, if it can be helped. It is the duty of the Government to foster industry. This cannot be done by the false economy of the past, which frightened private persons, and prevented them from spending. As soon as the Government begins to be careful, private individuals tighten their purse-strings. I trust that no Government that I mav sit behind will be guiltv of economies such as those suggested by the right honourable members for Swan and Parramatta.  strange to hear the honourable member for Melbourne Ports suggesting that there should be no public or private economy, seeing that only a few days ago the Prime Minister gave us a very interesting homily on the benefits of private economy. It would have been rather a good thing if the Prime Minister had applied to himself the advice he gave to citizens. He cannot expect the public to take his advice unless he sets the example in high places. His actual words wereI rlo not l i m it the nossibilities of finding"" money for ourselves to tens of millions, or even to a hundred millions, if the people so determine: but T do say that the necessities of the Commonwealth demand economy from its people in every walk of life. As a member of the House and a citizen The of Australia, I have a right to demand that the Treasurer shall apply those principles to the Government of the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth spent in 1912-13 £21,000,000 odd; in 1913-14, £23,000,000 odd; in £23,000,000 odd, and the estimated expenditure for 1915-16 is £26,488,000. We thus have an increased public expenditure at a time when the citizens are asked to economize-a n extravagant in crease amounting to the colossal sum of £3,230,000. We make no complaint as to the estima'ted war expenditure of £48,000,000, provided efficiency goes with it , and for every pound spent we get a pound in value. Under those conditions we should not mind if the amount was doubled, because we are bound in common with the rest of the Empire to take our part in the war, and must find the necessary money to bring it to a successful issue. W i th interest at 4A per cent., and a sinking fund of £ per cent., the sum of £1,920,000 will be required by the end of the financial year. circumstances, the Government have no right to propose an income tax to bring in £4,000,000 before the close of that period, and, as a matter of fact, there will be two collections within that time. £4,000,000 will be levied in respect of the year 1914, and we shall have to pay another dose in respect of 1915, so that the Government purpose taxing the people to the tune of £8,000,000 for war purposes to meet a bill of £1,920,000. in raising the necessary money for war purposes by way of loans, Treasurybonds, or inscribed stock, and i l is quite right that we should call upon the people to pay income tax to the extent of the £1,920,000 for interest and sinking f u n d , but beyond that we should go very cautiously in the way of taxation - If the Treasurer had kept his expenditure down to what it was in the previous year, he would have .effected a saving pf £3,230.000; If he had cut it down by another million he would have .saved about £4,250,000, and there would have been no need for Federal income taxation.",30
211,Mr FENTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"You should read. Mr . Watt' s speech. - Mr . PIGOTT - I.hav e my own opinlasts. ion; and dare to express it - The expenthe diture incurred by the' Treasurer is : per'cent. over that of the previous year, sahd.this.'at a time-of war, when; - ) . 1915-16. 2 .6031 surer announces that every individual in the Commonwealth should practise economy. The total income of the United 1914-15, Kingdom is £2,300,000,000. She is finding a £200,000,000 loan for the Allies, and her war expenditure for the coming year is £730,000,000, or £ 1 6 2s. per head of the population. The income of Australia is £218,199,000, and our war expenditure is £48,000,000, or £ 9 12s. per head of the population. It therefore cannot be said that we are spending too much for the purpose. If twice as much bad to be spent in the prosecution of this just war, I should be behind the Government in spending it . All my criticism is of their peace, and not of their war, expenditure. A great deal has been said regarding economy in public works. When war was first declared, the country was in a state of chaos, and the Government were perfectly justified in keeping all the works going to provide employment. In the",31

The Government wer© abundantly justified in keeping the eastwest railway and the works in the NorI believe thern Territory and the Federal Territory going wben the war broke out, but conditions have greatly changed, and it is time the Government mobilized their industries, and put men to work where their labour will be of the greatest benefit, not only to themselves, but to the Empire) The Government have been repeatedly criticised in regard to the conduct of the Small Arms Factory, and it was only recently that they installed a second shift. The sooner they introduce three shifts the better. We must increase our out> put of munitions, and the number of shifts worked, and in the same ratio d i minish the expenditure on public works which are not reproductive.",31

When Australia had a record harvest a few years ago, almarked though there was no war in progress at solid that time, and Australia had not sent £98 120,000 troops to the front, we were comcompanies pletely at a loss for labour. I maintain that the harvest and shearing operations the will absorb the whole of the surplus profitable labour of the Commonwealth this year. production Now, of all times, is the time when we concentration should endeavour to develop our exports. Whether it be munitions, wheat, wool, hides, or anything else, the more we can send abroad the more money will be ceived, and the more readily will we be to discharge our liabilities.

Otherwise the position of affairs regarding mining industry is satisfactory.

A great - many business people in the cities have operated in the same way. have started in a small way have, year after year, put their profits into their businesses, which have gradually grown to large dimensions. An investigation would show that that is the history of some of the most successful enterprises in Melbourne and Sydney. wealth which is being reinvested in enterprises is to be taxed by the Government. If a man does not put his wealth into business, how does he spend it? Perhaps, by sending his children to good private schools, thereby relieving the State of the cost of their education. Perhaps he has a well-kept garden, and employs skilled gardeners. He keeps a motor car and buys o i l , naphtha, and motor accessories. He employs milliners, florists, tailors, aud many other tradespeople. A hundred and one enterprises are kept employed by the expenditure of this so-called idle capital. If the Government seize that wealth, hundreds of persons who were provided with employment by its expenditure will be deprived of their means of employment. I think the Government are to be congratulated on inserting a provision to exempt the undivided profits of companies, but I would also urge them to - consider the position of investors abroad. Take the case of the Broken Hill Pro. prietary Company, for instance. is a Melbourne list of 365,680 shares, and a London list of 815,648 shares. The shareholders on the London register will be required to pay the full amount of taxation. So far as they are concerned, there will be no exemption of undivided profits. They will be called upon to pay taxation on the profits made in Australia, and also the profits made in England, and the States also will impose taxation.",32

If the year terminating 31st December, 1915, were substituted, the Government would receive the money in Men who ample time. Australia has experienced a most disastrous drought, and the return of income for the year 1914 is not a fair basis for taxing the income earned during the present year, especially in the case of those people who are engaged on the land. During a conversation with a But that banker in the Riverina district a few days ago, he informed me that in the Hay district alone the pastoralists had lost about 50 per cent, of their sheep and cattle, and there has been no increase from lambing. Yet those men are to be taxed on the basis of their income during a successful year. They have lost their stock, and have no wool, and to tax them in this way is manifestly unfair. Perhaps it is advisable to make ""the tax payable on the revenue earned during the calendar year, because the State collects income tax for that period, and it will be convenient to prepare one return for both Federal and State taxation, but the Government would be acting more justly if they imposed this income tax for the current calendar year. The reason given for choosing the period ended 31st December, 1914, is that the particulars of income for that year are more easily obtainable. But the census papers sent out state that taxpayers are also to give an estimate of their income to 30th June, so that, after all, they are compelled to make two sets There of returns. Apparently the idea of the Government is to obtain two taxes in stead of one-to raise £8,000,000 in order to find £2,000,000 with which to pay the interest on the war expenditure.

The farmer has to pay duty on all the implements be employs, and yet has to bear this additional taxation of 10 per cent. Only the other day the New South Wales Government increased the taxation on the farmer, in one direction, from 2d. to 6d., and our primary, producers there have also to pay 'for the maintenance of Pastoral Protection Boards, for rabbit destruction, and so on, involving considerable expense. In many cases the cost of enclosing properties with netting, and digging out all cover, amounts to £ 1 5s. or £ 1 10s. per acre.

224,Mr SHARPE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"There would be nothing to eat in New South Wales if it were not for the rabbits.  New South Wales is worth £700,000, as regards the carcasses, and £400,000 in the case of the skins. The pastoral, agricultural, and dairying industries together are wortli £124,500,000. However, I should now like to refer to the note-issue, from which it is the expressed intention of the Prime Minister to pay for the loans. A comparison of our position in this connection with that of other countries may be interesting. Up to May, 1914, the note issue of the Bank of England was £29,500,000, while in 1915 it was £38,000,000, with Treasury notes to it is in the the extent of £40,0.00,000-an increase of £48,500,000. The note issue in the Old it? Country at the present time is £1 12s. 6d. per head. In Australia, before the war commenced, the note circulation was £9,882,000, and the Prime Minister stated the other dav that the figure was now £34,635,223, showing an increase of £24.752,900, or £7 per head, as against £1 12s. 6d. at Home. The difference between this country and Great Britain is that the latter has foreign investments to the extent of £3,000,000,000 or £4.000.000,000, of which £1,000,000,000 is held in the United States of America. In France, in 1914, the note circulation was £237,000,000, while in 1915 it was £456.000,000, showing an increase of £219.000,000, or £11 8s. per Head; in Germanv. in 1914, the note circulation was £110,000,000, while in 1915 it was - £303,000,000, showing ' an increase of £193,000,000; in. Russia, in 1914, the note circulation was £161.000.000, while in 1915 it was £319.000,000, showing ap increase of £158,000,000, or £2 13s. per head. It will be seen that Australia comes a very good second - to France in the matter of. the note circulation - per capita. France has £1,500,000,000 i vested in foreign countries; while Ausneeds tralia is a debtor country to the extent £350,000,000, and yet we stand second the list in regard to note circulation.  for our indebtedness?  have assets, besides investments returning purposes. interest. I admit that when a country at war there is a greater demand for curreap rency owing to the increased buying and selling that is going on. Business a certain extent conducted on a cash basis, and. further, many cautious people, in time of war, are inclined to hoard their money. Such was the experience in France during the Franco-German war, when many millions were hoarded; but when the Germans took possession, France was able to pay an indemnity of over £200,000,000. We may take it that what has occurred i u other countries under similar circumstances is now occurring in ary products. Australia; and, therefore, the Governize ment, to a certain extent, are justified issuing these notes. We should be very careful, however, not to exceed a fixed amount, because the notes will have to be retired at the termination of the war. we are engaged. A little while ago I directed the attention of the Prime Minister to the treLast mendous cash reserves which are accumuterim lating in the United States. Trade ances are very much in favour of should that country. Exchanges are always in their' favour. I suggested that would be a good idea to send some reprethe sentative from Australia who would get into close touch with the different finanbank cial brokers in the United States, and see if the Commonwealth could not get some of this money, which is so much needed here, in the shape of a loan. The averpressed age excess of exports over imports i United States of America for three years before the war, was £100,000,000, but i the first four months of this year it was £119,000,000, and if it continues at same ratio it will amount to £357,000,000 for the year, or an excess over the previlimit ous average of £257,000,000. Thus can see that money is accumulating at tremendous rate in America. France and Great Britain are contemplating floating a loan of about £70,000.000 there, in order to balance exchanges. Canada has already approached the same financial market for a loan, and it would not be derogatory on the part of a young n - country like the Commonwealth, which its own resources for developmental of purposes, to send a representative to on America with a similar object. I believe that he would be gladly received. Even if we had to pay more interest, it would be better to bring money here than tff drag it out of. the people of Australia, who need all they have for developmental Our trouble is that we have is to pay £31,000,000 abroad before we any benefit from the money we raise, because our exports are short of our imis to ports by £6,000,000, and we need £12,000,000 to pay our troops overseas, and £13,000,000 for the interest on State, as well as Commonwealth, loans. Therefore I urge the Government to do all they possibly can not to waste a grain of wheat, but to see that the ships are here, so that every grain that can be taken overseas is shifted, as well as every ounce of wool, or any of our primI urge them to so organlabour that all our primary produci n tions may be kept moving, while, at the same time, the manufacture of munitions of war and arms is undertaken for the carrying on of the great conflict in which",34
225,Mr FLEMING,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Robertson) [3.20] month the Treasurer made au in statement concerning the finances, baland one remark which he made then arrest the attention of every man even distantly interested in the finani t ces. That remark, which was this-that difference' between expenditure and income had been balanced by the issue of notes-seem s to be the keynote to the financial statement, which is now before the Committee, because there is exin it that fatal facility for obn the taining money which always leads to looseness. It is just the same as the posin tion of a person who, for the first time, obtains control of a cheque book, to which the he has not been accustomed. The money seems to go in a thousand ways, and the is reached so speedily that he wonwe ders how it has come about. The Treaa surer's statement of a few days ago seems to show the effect of that looseness which always follows from the too easy obtaining of money. He told usThe revenue actually received was £22,411,710, or £861,200 less than the estimate. The Customs revenue exceeded the estimate by £613,247, but tliere was a shortage in land tax of £746,222, and the probate dutieB amounted to only £39,646, whilst the estimate was £1,000,000, being a shortage of £960,354. Defence revenue was in excess by £211,389. These figures seem to indicate that the whole matter had not received due and proper consideration before the estimate was put forward, because in every case the result has been different from what was forecasted. In regard to most of the items of revenue, if we take the statement of the Estimates of the current year, we find the Treasurer expressing himself as full of doubt. He does not seem to know his position. He has taken up the same attitude of looseness that was apparent in his previous statement. About a week ago, when he was asked the cost per head of the recruits going to the front, he stated that the estimated cost was 25s. per head per day, but during the course of the financial statement delivered last week he told us that it was 14s. If that marked difference applies in regard to the daily cost of the recruit it must run into an enormous amount of money during a week and during a year. Then, when the Treasurer was questioned about what he was paying the British Government for the loan, he said that "" he did not know."" We cannot altogether blame him in that regard, but it seems to me that some definite business like arrangement should be entered into with the British Government, or that they should give us something approximate, if not an absolutely definite statement as to the amount of interest the Commonwealth will have to pay on these loans. Otherwise it is quite impossible for the Treasurer to give anything like a fair estimate of the expenditure for the year. Further on the Treasurer saidIn March last, the States were advised that the British Government would not object to their raising loans in the London market, and were informed that, uncler the circumstances, the Treasurer of the Commonwealth would not insist on strict compliance with the clause of the agreement under which they undertook not to borrow otherwise than from the Commonwealth. We have been told over and over again that the States were to be limited in borrowing by the agreement they into with the Commonwealth, yet now we are told in the Treasurer's that there is to be no restriction-that the British Government have the States that they can do as they please, and the Commonwealth ment have given them liberty to follow Mr Fleming. on those lines. Wherever we look, there is uncertainty in the situation-absoi lutely nothing on which we can act. I do not know whether honourable members have had the experience of being on a colt that has bucked off the bridle. I have. When I read the statement from the Treasurer, I felt that he was in exactly the same position. In the first place the colt does not know what he is going to do, and in the next place the rider does not know what the colt is going to do, or what the colt is making up his mind to do. The Treasurer, like the colt, does not know what he is going to do next. No doubt, under present circumstances, we cannot altogether blame him, because the position is not wholly due to his fault. We are living in unprecedented times. As Shakespeare says, "" The times are out of j o in t . "" But I find fault with the fact that there is absolutely no solid ground on which to work, and we have lost control; we do not know where we are. The Estimates seem to be the merest guesswork. How can we deal with the finances of the country when everything is so nebulous ? We need some definite statement, something on which we can estimate what our expenditure is to be. I have already pointed out that we should have some definite agreement with the Imperial Government as to the rate of interest we are to pay. Further on in the course of his financial statement, when the Treasurer was talking about the total amount of loans, the honourable member for Balaclava interjected, "" Is it clear that there are no """"conversion loans covered by those figures?"" The Treasurer replied- The Secretary to the Treasury says that none of the money is for conversions. The' amounts astound me. We asked only for loan figures; but I have no direct statement to the contrary of what the honourable member suggests. The Treasurer in control of the finances of the Commonwealth brings down a financial statement, and yet does not know what it means; he does not know whether there are any conversion loans entered contained in a certain portion of his statement. He says that the amount of statement the loans astounds him , as well it might do; but what is our position when he caninformed not tell us whether any conversion loans are included ? How can we go before our Govern- constituents and tell the people that we are trying to manage the affairs of the country in a business-like way, and to keep the Commonwealth solvent, when we are not given a definite statement as to our position in regard to what money is being spent, and as to what loans are in cluded in the figures presented to us)",35
226,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Did not honourable members ask the Treasurer for a rough statement of the position of affairs),37
227,Mr FLEMING,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"They may have done so when I was away at recruiting meetings, but if they asked for a rough statement they must have emphasized the word "" rough,"" because this is an exceedingly rough statement. It is so rough that it is absolutely of no use. rougher than the colt that has bucked off his bridle.",37
228,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Did the member expect to have a Budget sented 1,37
229,Mr FLEMING,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"No ; but we expected ai the very least to be given some solid ground on which to find a footing. Speaking of the Australian Notes Fund the Treasurer told us that the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock, in which the Commonwealth notes were invested, amounted to £3,830,000, and the Commonwealth Treasury-bills, £1,887,657, or a total of £5,500,000. The majority of the people believe that this is a business-like action, whereby we are making money. The future position becomes even more uncertain in the figures laid down. Not only have we the expressed doubt of the Treasurer as to everything that he has put forward, but he also brings forward the statement that we have lent £5,500,000, leading the people to believe that this money is out earning interest, whereas it is only lent from one Department to the other, the Commonwealth having to find the interest which is here to the Australian Notes There is invested in New South Wales over £5,000,000, in Victoria £3,000,000, in South Australia over £1,500.000, in Western Australia over £2,500,000 and in Tasmania £1,000,000, or about £13,000,000 in all. The people are led to believe that the Commonwealth is earning interest on this money, but, as a matter of fact, the position is that the citizens, as taxpayers, of the Commonwealth have found the money, and are lending it to themselves as citizens of the States. These statements are calculated to deceive the public, [222 ] and to lead to financial trouble. The interest earned by these advances is £811,467, but as a matter of fact the Commonwealth is merely paying interest to itself, or getting it from the people in their various civic capacities. Unless the people are made to understand how their income is made up, they must find themselves in a fool's paradise. The honourable member for Calare spoke of the in vestments which the people of certain countries have made in other countries. In 1914 Great Britain in vested £25,000,000 in the Argentine, £14,000,000 in the United States of It is America, £13,000,000 in Mexico, and £12,000,000 in Australia and in Brazil. It used to be a saying that "" Trade follows honourable the flag. "" That idea is largely exploded. preWe know now that trade follows investment, and it is a severe commentary on our management of affairs that Australia can attract from Great Britain less than half the sum that goes to a country which has not nearly its potentialities, and is under a foreign flag.",37
230,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Do not investments depend upon the rate of interest offering T,37
231,Mr FLEMING,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"If we cannot pay as good a rate of interest as is paid in the Argentine, there is something wrong with the handling of the affairs of this country. The Argentine can afford to pay high rates of interest because it encourages primary production in every way, and it is time that we did the same. It is only in that way that we shall increase the in flow of capital, and be able to pay the high rates of interest which must prevail for some years after the war.",37
232,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Apparentl y the honourable member thinks that the higher the rates of interest the happier the country.,37
233,Mr FLEMING,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"If the Minister of credited Home Affairs cannot see further into this Fund. matter of finance than his interjections suggest, I shall not discuss the subject over with him.",37
234,Mr KING OMALLEY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The rate of in terest in the Argentine was only 4 per over cent., but it is higher now.",37
235,Mr FLEMING,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"At any rate, the money that is going there should be coming here, and the rate of interest only partly explains the position. The At torney-General last night made a comparison of the direct taxation of the people of the United Kingdom and of the people of Australia; but it was not a fair comparison, because it left out of account the tremendous amount that we pay in Customs taxation which they do not such pay. As to Defence, I have had the pleasure and honour to he assosome ciated with the recruiting campaigns Victoria and in New South Wales. Strangely enough, Victoria has supplied more men than New South Wales, and New .South Wales more money than toria. Men in my estimation are worth more than money, and we wish to know why New South Wales, which has a larger population than Victoria, has not so full y performed its obligations in this spect. We know that the arrangement of the military districts makes the New South Wales figures smaller than they should be, and increases those of Victoria ; but that does not full y account the difference. There can be no doubting the enthusiasm of the people of both States, and, to my mind, the difference between the recruiting results is due - organization.",37
236,Mr OZANNE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The success of the cruiting in Victoria was largely due the prevalence of unemployment here.,38
237,Mr FLEMING,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"In Victoria, as i New South Wales, a large number of cruits came from the drought-stricken areas.",38
238,Mr TUDOH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,A great many came from my electorate.,38
239,Mr FLEMING,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I am not comparing the recruiting in Sydney and Melyards bourne: I do not think that there ground, was much difference between the reare sults obtained in the two capitals. In my opinion, what happened i New South Wales was due to lack of proper organization; and it is time the Federal Government took the matter in hand, and co-operated with the States in a universal movement. Some of the speeches delivered at recruiting meetings in New South Wales were calculated to our Defence Forces. <do harm to the cause rather than good. T do not wish to mention names, or to blame any party, but some of the speeches were of the most damaging kind. .there is co-operation between the Commonwealth and the States, and proper organization, we cannot expect the results that we would like. Another matter of importance is the manner in which military authorities are handling the mount question. I have already drawn attention to the fact that some of the horses that are being sent abroad are not as men should be asked to trust their lives to. Most of the horses are good, but are absolute wasters. Although it in may not be possible to get none but good horses, the military authorities should know how to look after the horses which they get. I represent a district in which Vicis the Hunter Valley, which contains some of the richest country in Australia. Militar y horses have been sent to that country in such a poor condition that, notwithstanding the good feed, they have redied before they could benefit from it .",38
240,Mr FENTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Is the district cold 1,38
241,Mr FLEMING,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The nights are somefor what frosty, but, everything being taken into consideration, no better' climate could be obtained. My electorate is the greatest horse-breeding district in Austo tralia, and is notable for the horses it produces. The Government did wisely in sending horses there, but many of them rewere too far gone to benefit. As to evidence of neglect, I can .state positively that the horses are sometimes sent out with their shoes on. Recently n I went to the horse depot at Ascot, where rethe management is on a par with the general management of the Department regarding horses. On the Maribyrnong Estate there is, perhaps, three-fourths of a mile of a 6-ft. paling fence, which is in many places falling down. The palings are broken off for 10 or 15 at a stretch, and lying ""on the with the nails sticking up. These the places through which the horses pass, and a better method for crippling n them could not be devised. That was the state of affairs at the horse depot, that and when I asked what was the cause I was told "" d i v i d e d authority."" I do not know whether the matter has yet been attended to, but it is on a par with the whole of the management of the horses for",38
242,Mr KING OMALLEY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,What do those Until roosters know about horses?,38
243,Mr FLEMING,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The Government should put in charge of the whole scheme some one who knows all about horses, and make him responsible for the horses the throughout the Commonwealth. There reare some curious tales abroad about the buying of horses, but when they are chosen and become the property of the Commonwealth they should receive proper treatment. The loss going on tlirough bad handling is enormous, and I have no doubt the same applies to other departments. When in New South Wales recruiting I was told, on the best authority , that now the State bakery, owing to some mishap to its machinery, has broken down, the bread for the troops is being baked by a German named Lindenberger. Sir Joseph Carruthers recently stated in the Legislative Council of New South Wales that no German should be allowed to supply liquor or food to people in Australia. He is no alarmist, but a caref u l man, who makes most cool and calculated statements, and such a statement from him should induce the Government to pay closer attention to what is going on. The whole position regarding the treatment of enemy subjects in Australia is absolutely unsatisfactory. There are in our midst 35,000 or 36,000 enemy subjects, of whom only about 2,000 are interned. In addition, a number of their descendants are just as bitter as the old people, so that it is safe to say there are 40,000 enemy subjects in this country who constitute a decided menace to the community, and the Federal Government are doing nothing to keep them in their place. Some of the girl employees of a flour manufacturing company in Sydney were ordered out to take off Belgian buttons they were wearing, because the manager was a German. The manager of a printing establishment ordered the girls in his employ to put away the Belgian flag because he also was a German.",38
244,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,The manager of one of the largest firms here made them take down the flags that were hanging up at the establishment.,39

The whole administration of the Defence Department seems to be unsatisfactory. The recruiting camthe paigns have been successful in regard men in Victoria and in regard to money in New South Wales. Victoria could unsiasm, doubtedly have given much more money, and New South Wales could give more men, and the recruiting movement could [222]- 2 also be worked up in the other States. The time has arrived for the Defence Department to go into the whole matter with the State Governments, letting the people know frankly and clearly how many men they want, and how many they can handle, because there is undoubtedly an impression abroad that more men have offered than the Department can> handle. It is freely reported that manymen who have offered as recruits have been told to go home for three weeks or a month, because they would not be wanted for that time. If the Department cannot handle more than a certain number they should announce honestly that they do not want more than a cert a in proportion every day or every week. The present method is only making for dissatisfaction. In New South Wales men came from Orange to Lithgow, where they were supposed to be sworn in as recruits, and when they arrived there was no one present to meet them. They were not told where they were to go, nor were they given any assistance. Believing that they would be immediately sworn in and either sent home or passed into camp, they came unprovided with pocket money, and many had to sleep for the night wherever they could find a bunk. Some had to sleep on the railway station or walk about the town all night. Is that the way in which to encourage recruiting and to get the enthusiasm which is necessary if we are to make our young fellows realise that we know their worth ? The whole system requires working up from the central administration. In New South Wales there is no system, and the present Government absolutely lost control when they allowed the State Governments to step in and, in some cases, conduct a recruiting campaign Goin an inefficient way. If an agreement were entered into with the various State and the whole procedure were systematized, we should have a steady and constant stream of recruits, instead of a big number today and noneto-morrow, or a great number this week and none next week, so that the Department is at a loss to know how to handlemen. The people should know what, to number of men is required, and then we should have a steady and growing enthuand an increase of men when they were wanted, and the whole system would redound to the credit of Australia in a way which is utterly impossible in the present state of affairs. We have sent good men to the front , and we know that - there are still plenty to go, but we shall not obtain them and send them for th in the full glow of patriotism and enthusiasm if we do not handle them better than they have been handled in the past. From the points of view of neither defence nor finance have we risen to our responsibility, or established an organization such as would point the road to success. We are fighting the most highly organized people on the face of the earth. We do not wish to be over-organized as the German people are, and to destroy in our men that individuality which stood for so much, when our soldiers were making history at the Dardanelles. Rut we* do need to co-ordinate all the forces of the Commonwealth and the States so that we can make the fullest use of our resources and opportunities.",39
246,Mr KING OMALLEY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,We are ossified.,40
247,Mr FLEMING,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"We are, and 1 will, here and now, state the reason. We are proclaiming this to be a National Parliament, and we are pretending that we are trying to do things without party spirit. merely play-acting. We know that before any proposal is brought into the House for debate it has already been settled. What is the use of our pretending to be sitting as a non-party and National Parliament when every proposal is settled before it reaches the floor of the House? We are fooling the people; we are a sham, a mockery, a delusion, and it is time that the people knew it . Personally, I do not believe Parliament should ' go into recess. We should continue the session, for even though matters are cut and dried by the time they reach this Chamber, we can still voice our sentiments and let the public know how affairs are progressing. In my opinion, our affairs are being conducted in & slip-shod fashion. It is common knowledge that the British people have always been slow beginners, but, to use a racing term, they are good finishers. We have been slow to get things into going order to meet the tremendous task that is still before us after twelve months of war, and, if we are to be true to our traditions, it is time that we woke up and began to "" put in our finish. ' 1 Progress reported. PAPER. The following paper was presented: Liverpool Military Camp, New South Wales - Repor t on, by His Honour Mr Justice Rich. (l«th August, 19154 Ordered to be printed. ADJOURNMENT. ORDER OF BUSINESS. MI. FISHER (Wide Bay-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [3.57] - In movingThat the House clo now adjourn, I ask the assistance of honourable members to close this portion of our proceedings on Thursday week. I understand from the Leader of the Opposition that that will be a convenient date.",40
248,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I express no opinion on that. I understood we were to adjourn next Friday.,40
249,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"That seems impossible. Tbere are certain Bills, including a small amendment of the Constitution, to be passed next week. It has to pass this House and another place. Obviously that cannot be done next week There is a considerable amount of other work to be We are done, and I shall require the passing of another Supply Bill . A number of honourable members wish to leave at the end of next week, and it is not the intention of the Government to bring forward any strong party measures in these times. I hope that arrangements can be made to meet the convenience of as many members as possible, provided that sufficient members remain to carry on the business properly. I take this opportunity of saying that an event is impending of which honourable members are aware, and we shall relieve as many members as possible for that occasion, everything will be done by the Government to preserve the rights of individual members, and especially of members opposite. The length of the adjournment will be such as to suit the convenience of honourable members. The Government have no desire to get into a lengthy recess for any purpose whatever.",40
250,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,How long is suggested ?,40
251,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I tliink we might very well adjourn on the same conditions as on the last occasion, when it was left to  vene Parliament at any time deemed necessary. In a time of war Parliament might need to sit at any time, and it is better to leave the arrangement as flexible as possible. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Will such an arrangement comply with the provision in the Constitution as to' annual sittings ?",40
252,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,I think there is no doubt as to that. The former arrangement was made when there were six lionorable and learned members on the front benches.,41
253,Mr WATT,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,Then it must be questionable !,41
254,Mr FISHER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The point has not been tested in the High Court; a question might even be submitted whether or not we have any right to sit here at all, and I should have grave doubts as to the decision. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 4.4 p.m.",41
