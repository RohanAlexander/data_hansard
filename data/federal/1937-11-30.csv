The majority of honourable members present have had experience of the manner in which I have discharged the duties of Speaker, and on that account I feel that the honour which they now do me is greater than that which they did me three years ago. The Standing Orders are the rules that have been laid down by this House for the guidance of honourable members in the conduct of its business. It is my function to interpret those rules, and to see that they are observed, so that the business of this chamber may be conducted smoothly. I cannot perfectly, or even satisfactorily, achieve that purpose unless I have the help of all honourable members.

NA SIR GRANVILLE RYRIE .",15
14,Mr LYONS,DEATH OF T HE HONORABLE," It is with deep regret that I refer to the death, on the 2nd October last, in Sydney, of Sir Granville Ryrie, a former member of this House. Born at Michelago, which is within comparatively short distance of the Federal Capital, on the 1st July, 1865, first entered Parliament in 1906 ber for Queanbeyan in the Legislative Assembly of New South ""Wales. His the service in the Commonwealth Parliament Granville extended over a period of sixteen years, first as member for Nort h Sydney f r o 1911 to 1919, and later'as member for for Warringah from 1919 to 1927. As a appreciation young man he served in the South A f r i War, in which he was severely wounded. In recognition of his service, he was awarded the Queen's medal with four clasps. Shortly after the outbreak of the Great War in 1914, he proceeded overseas with the 2nd Ligh t Horse Brigade, and was subsequently appointed to the command of the Australian Imperial Force in Egypt with the rank of Major-General. He was honoured by H is Majesty the King on three occasions by the award the decorations of C.M.G., C.B., and KCMG . Shortly .after the termination of the war he attained ministerial office in the Hughes Ministry as Assistant Minister for Defence, and in 1927 he was appointed to succeed the Right Honourable Sir Joseph Cook as High Commissioner for places, the Commonwealth in London. Sir Granville Ryrie's record of public service, which I have briefly reviewed, is an inspiring one. He was a very sincere thereon. man, possessing an intense love for his native country. H is interests were many, but he was specially devoted to the pastoral industry with which he had been closely associated from boyhood. His comrades in the Australian I m perial Force pay tribute to capacity for leadership, and to his forceGeneral, f u l , but genial and likeable personality. Those associated with him in the ministerial and parliamentary spheres testify to his very capable service. He remembered by them as a loyal and trustLord worthy colleague. Sir Granville Ryrie rendered service to the Commonwealth in his capacity as High Commissioner in London, and in all his work he served Australia with distinction. He well merited the prominent position which is retained ifr. Li/mis. a of him - in the memories of the Australian people. To his widow and family he we desire to offer our sincere sympathy as memi n their loss. I move-h y leaveThat this House expresses its deep regret at death of Major-Gcneral the Honourable Sir de Laune Ryrie, KCMG., C.B., V.D., a former member of the New South Wales and Commonwealth Parliaments, Assistant Comm monwealth Minister, and High Commissioner Australia in London, places on record its of his distinguished public service, and tenders its profound sympathy to c an his widow and family in their bereavement.",15

H is very distinguished career was crowned by his appointment as "" the representative of Australia in the important office of High Commissioner in of London.
