2,Mr LYONS,BRITISH CONSTITUTIONA L,"Wilmot-Prime Minister) [10.33] - It is not the intention of the Government to submit any business to the Parliament today, or to reply to questions without notice. I ask leave to make a brief statement of the reason for the recall of honourable members. Leave granted.",12
3,Mr LYONS,BRITISH CONSTITUTIONA L,"Shortl y after the Parliament rose last week, the possibilities a serious constitutional problem relating to the suggested marriage of His Majesty the King became apparent. The position is still uncertain, though we all profoundly hope that a crisis may be averted. In. the circumstances, it seemed wise to the Government to recall honourable members, as we would desire to be in a position to consult the Parliament without delay in relation to any course of action which proved to be necessary. As the matter stands, and pending His Gracious Majesty's decision, parliavenience mentary discussions could do nothing harm. All that I need say as to the particular issues involved is, that the Commonwealth Government concurs in the decision of the Government of the United Kingdom not to legislate for something in the nature of a morganatic marriage. In a state of affairs so delicate, so fraught with possibilities of good or for the futb.ro of all of us, a respectful and sympathetic silence in Parliament is the best contribution we can offer to a happy solution. May' God strengthen His Majesty, and guide his decision aright. ADJOURNMENT. Motion (by Mr LYONS) proposed - That the House do now adjourn.",12
4,Mr CURTIN,BRITISH CONSTITUTIONA L,"Fremantle) [10.35] The Parliament has been called together today so that the Government might consult with' it on a matter of supreme moment to Australia and to the other dominions comprising the British Commonwealth of Nations, as well as to the CRISIS. United Kingdom itself. That consultation, I think, should commence with a full, complete, and unfettered intimation to the Parliament of the whole extent-of the communications that have passed between the Prime Minister and the Government of the United Kingdom. OPPOSITION MEMBERS - Hear , hear.'",12
5,Mr CURTIN,BRITISH CONSTITUTIONA L,"All the facts, so far as it is possible for the Parliament to have them given to it at present, should of now be made available. The Opposition holds strong views upon this very difficult and, as the Prime Minister has said, delicate matter. To begin with, it says that there must be no coercion, by Ministers of this dominion, or - of any other dominion, of the King, in the choosing, of his wife. OPPOSITION MEMBERS - Hear , hear!",12
6,Mr CURTIN,BRITISH CONSTITUTIONA L,"The King, on the other hand, must not ask Parliament for any special legislation to suit his conin the choosing of a wife. He hut must choose his wife from among those ladies who may lawfully be married to him as the law stands at present. In . respect of any matter involving legislation, the King must accept the advice of his Ministers of State. Furthermore, we would object to the King or to the Parliaments, in the King's choice of a wife, arranging to confer upon that lady a lesser status than that of Queen. ill OPPOSITION MEMBERS - Hear , hear!",12
7,Mr CURTIN,BRITISH CONSTITUTIONA L,"The King must not be permitted to alter in any way the of the lady whom he would choose to be his wife; because he is the King, his wife should and must be the Queen. Furthermore, the King must be fully prepared to accept all the natural and logical consequences of his marriage. If there silence. be children of that marriage, then they must come in the first line of succession to the British throne. The Opposition will leave the King unfettered in the choice of his wife. It will not agree that name. his selection in that matter should be impaired by any influence of any sort. But the King must accept full responsibility to his conscience and to the' Empire the choice that he makes. We shall not interfere with him, but we shall not conthat venience him, in the choosing of wife. This Australian Labour .party hopes that the present King will remain upon the throne of England. OPPOSITION MEMBERS - Hear , hear!",13
8,Mr CURTIN,BRITISH CONSTITUTIONA L,"It desires to remain, as it will remain, loyal to King Edward VIII .",13
