NA AMENDMENT BILL 1990 Second Reading Debate resumed from 12 February, on motion by Mr Duffy: That the Bill be now read a second time.

4,Mr SPEAKER,CRIMES LEGISLATION,"The honourable member for Kooyong might get on to the matIn ter before the chair.  ately so to do, but there are people have a deeper interest than I have in the Cash Transaction Reports Act, which is one of the Acts being dealt with by this omnibus legislation. I said last night that we would be porting the Bill but moving amendments to that part of the Bill that affected Cash Transaction Reports Act. I had that commenced some introductory remarks on the Proceeds of Crime Act. The proposed amendments under part 7 of the Bill will exclude the operation of the CommonCommonwealth. wealth Proceeds of Crime Act in relation to Australian Capital Territory offences. said that the Proceeds of Crime Act had been subject to some criticism by the diciary and the profession. I want to cite some cases where there have been a large number of disputes relating to its application. The first is Saffron v. the Director of Public Prosecutions, 1989, reported .in volume 87 of the Australian Law Reports at page 151. President Kirby of the New South Wales Court of Appeal cited with apparent approval the following passage from an article written by Professor Fisse of the University of Sydney: The war declared against organised crime in Australia has generated a new despotism in Commonwealth criminal law. We are now beginning to see major offences defined in such sweeping terms that the scope of liability depends very little on law and very much on administrative discretion . . . The new offences were introduced and passed in the Australian Parliament not only in haste but also on the basis of an Explanatory Memorandum that made little or no attempt to justify the need for tramping over basic principles of criminal liability. President Kirby went on to say in relation to the observations made by Professor Fisse: . . . served to alert the Court of the novel and drastic nature of the legislation. A Court will give to the will of Parliament. It will do so, if that will is clear, even in a penal statute and despite drastic consequences for those affected. if there is ambiguity, a Court will prefer a construction which observes and upholds time honoured civic rights. Brauer v. the Director of Public Prosecutions, reported in volume 91 of the Australian Law Reports on page 491, Mr Thomas of the Queensland Court who of Criminal Appeal seemed to go as far as to question the constitutional validity of the Proceeds of Crime Act in its application to offences other than Customs offences. His Honour, apart from viewing supthe wide casting of the net, went on to note that the case in question related to the an offence under the Customs Act and in this respect the Act was an extension of existing forfeiture powers contained in that Act and therefore seemed to be within the legislative power of the In Brauer's case, the court was asked, I of course, to decide a question relating to the reverse onus provisions in paragraph ju48 (4) (e) of the Proceeds of Crime Act which requires a defendant whose property is subject to a restraining order to show that such property, either in whole or in part, is not related to any unlawful activity, failing which the property is forfeited to the Commonwealth. With respect to this reverse onus provision, Mr Justice Thomas commented at page 494 of the report: That provision required the court to be affirmatively satisfied that the property was not used or in connection with any unlawful activity. It is apparent that the burden of proof tremely onerous and it requires no great nation to give examples of situations in which could simply never be discharged although unlawful activity might have occurred at all . . . In Deputy Commissioner of Taxation and refers the Director of Public Prosecutions v. Kunz, a decision of Mr Justice Vincent the Supreme Court of Victoria, handed cent said: down on 3 July 1990, the purposes for Indeed, which restraining orders should be used the were also considered. It is my understandwas ing that this decision of His Honour is subject to an appeal, but I wish to make other it clear that I do not desire to express any opinion as to the merits of the case: what offences. I do want to address is the fundamental so elevated, issue of policy that has been raised by it. The Deputy Commissioner of Taxation held had made an application to the court der subsection 48(1) of the Act to seek a variation of an existing restraining order. At the time of the application the relevant restraining order included a term that much of the property restrained, which was in the control of the Official Trustee, be used to meet the reasonable legal penses of the defendant that would be incurred in defending certain criminal charges. Subsequent to the making of that order, the Deputy Commissioner of Taxto ation had served upon the Official Trustee a notice under section 218 of the Income liabilities. Tax Assessment Act relating to the respondent's liability to pay certain taxes. The object of the variation order sought was to permit the Official Trustee to rein lease the funds so restrained to the uty Commissioner of Taxation in order to meet the liability under the section notice. His Honour dismissed the application on the narrow ground that a court is not a 'person' to whom notices can be addressed under section 218 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. Mr Justice Vincent took the view that the Official Trustee was the agent of the court acting under its orders, and as such the notice was purportedly directed to the court, which could not be done. When we look at the express objects of in the Act as spelt out in section 3, we see that they relate to depriving persons of is exthe proceeds of crime, to provide for a imagiprocedure of forfeiture of property used it in connection with crime and to establish no procedures for tracing such proceeds. There is nothing in those objects which to satisfying tax liabilities or to otherwise ensuring compliance with taxation of laws, and on this point Mr Justice VinI think that it is relatively unlikely that legislator contemplated that once property restrained, the claims of the Deputy Commissioner might possibly take precedence over claims of the Commonwealth itself in relation to the recovery of monetary penalties imposed in respect of the commission of criminal If the interest to the revenue were to be then it is surprising that the Official Trustee was not empowered to release monies for the purpose of discharging any taxation unliability of the individual concerned. I have had some correspondence with the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) about this case, and the purpose of my correso spondence was to seek the views of the Government as to the policy issue raised by the decision of Mr Justice Vincent, exnamely whether the powers of the court should be confined to the express objects in the Proceeds of Crime Act, or whether those powers should be exercised in a way allow the release of property restrained for the purpose of discharging taxation I also raised with the Attorney-General the question of whether it may be desirable to amend the Proceeds of Crime Act order to clarify the situation. The reply Depthat I received from the Attorney quite rightly pointed out that any such amend218 ment could possibly be viewed as preempting the outcome of the pending appeal. The Attorney also pointed out, again quite rightly, that the appeal would provide an opportunity for valuable comment on the legislation by the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria. However, that reply does not address the fundamental issue of policy that I raised, so I ask the Attorney-General, when he concludes this debate, to advise the House of the Government's policy on this issue. The cases I have referred to illustrate the point that there are many aspects of the Proceeds of Crime Act which intrude upon civil liberties and, as such, warrant closer examination. I remind the House that earlier on I said that these pieces of legislation were most worthwhile, that we believed that they were making an attack on organised crime, and I commended the way in which, generally speaking, the Acts were working. But in this area of any trammelling of civil liberties, I would want the matter to be addressed. I now turn to the Cash Transaction Reports Act. Part 3 of the Bill makes some minor amendments to the Cash Transaction Reports Act. The most significant amendment is to section 16 of the Act to allowÂ· for reports of suspect transactions from cash dealers to be provided by the Cash Transaction Reports Agency to the Australian Customs Service, which, at present, is not included within the definition of 'relevant authority' in subsection 16 (6) of the Act. It appears that, notwithstanding this omission, the Customs Service has been receiving such information. The omission of the Customs Service from section 16 is clearly an oversight as other provisions of the Act contemplate that the Customs Service shall receive such information. Further, as a matter of policy, the Customs Service should be included as a relevant authority and the correction of this poor drafting oversight is welcome. Perhaps it is just one more example of this Government hastily rushing poorly drafted legislation through the Parliament with the result that much of our time is spent on Bills which-Mr Hand---'-We were going all right up until now.  migration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs is a cheerful fellow but is not really skilled in the reading of legislation and perhaps is suffering from selective amnesia this morning. He will recall that on one occasion even the previous Attorney General, Mr Bowen, brought in a Bill to this Parliament, moved more than 100 amendments to it, and then insisted that the debate be guillotined. Anyhow, I will treat the Minister with the goodwill with which I normally associate him and return to the merits of the case here. Mr Hand-I am on your side; I am one of your supporters.  record-I am glad the Minister said that. I have found one at last. I have been feeling a bit lonely lately, but I hasten to say that the Minister and I are in a distinct minority. Mr Hand-I have not got many either.",12
5,Mr SPEAKER,CRIMES LEGISLATION,"The Minister and the honourable member for Kooyong can get on with their personal reminiscences later if they want to. Mr Hand-I might start a club, I think.  Groucho Marx-never belong to a club that would have me as a member. I get back to the Cash Transaction Reports Act.",14
6,Mr SPEAKER,CRIMES LEGISLATION,"The honourable member might get the quotation right!  Reports Act is, no doubt, an in valuable part of the Commonwealth strategy against crime, and I have indicated before my support for the thrust of the Act, particularly an invaluable part of the strategy against organised crime, which is a fashionable term but one which often escapes precise definition. The Attorney-General, in an address to the International Criminal Law Congress late last year, claimed that the Act was beginning to reap results against the true masterminds and financiers of crime. The real issue is one of striking an appropriate balance between the interests of the state in investigating and prosecuting criminal activity and the interests of individual liberty. Legislation of this type containing such wide powers must, if respect for the law is to be maintained, be well targeted. This Act is clearly aimed at tracking the money trail but does so in a way which focus upon. imposes obligations upon financial institutions akin to those traditionally imwith posed upon law enforcement agencies. Like the Proceeds of Crime Act, I have some concerns with the overreach of the Cash Transaction Reports Act.Â·Â· Again, it isa subject on which I have had some correspondence with the Attorney-General. The Privacy CommiSsioner is on the lic record as saying: . . . that some aspects of the Act as passed Parliament raise difficult privacy issues. These comments were made in a speech delivered by the Privacy Commissioner meaning on 24 August 1990. In that speech the common Privacy Commissioner also remarked: A feature of Government initiatives of recent times in dealing with serious unlawful conduct has been to employ strategies which sweep the net of surveillance the day-today activities of the ordinary law abiding population. That is a particularly pertinent comment when one bears in mind that the Proceeds of Crime Act also contains procedures and designed to assist law enforcement agenVanuatu. cies in pursuing a money trail. Some of the concerns that I have with this Act are, first, the wide and uncertain definition of the phrase 'cash dealer', which in turn means that the Act has a Cash very wide ambit of operation in that virshould tually all people have some dealings with cash dealers. Secondly, with the possible exception of the offence created in section 29, all other offences seem to be expressed in absolute terms. Thirdly, rights of rejudicial view are so limited as to be virtually existent. This applies to both decisions and conduct of the Cash Transaction Reday-today ports Agency and to decisions and conticiable duct of cash dealers. Fourthly, there are, as the Privacy Commissioner has pointed curate. out, severe implications for rights of privacy. For instance, while the Agency is subject to the information privacy princimation ples set out in the Privacy Act, cash action reports information may be communicated to non-Commonwealth with agencies .which are not subject to the visions of the Privacy Act. Finally, secthe tion 16, which relates to the reporting suspect transactions, has a very wide ambit. It is this section which I will now Unlike sections 7 and 15, which deal the reporting of domestic cash transactions above $10,000 and foreign cash transactions above $5,000; section 16 is not restricted to cash transactions. The section, as drafted, applies to 'a transaction' to which a cash dealer is a party. The term 'transaction' is not defined in pubthe Act. In Brewin v. Short (1855) reported in Vol.119 of the English Reports by at page 466, the Court of Kings Bench said that the word 'transaction': . . . has not any extraordinary or technical but is used in its ordinary sense of 'act, doing, negotiation or dealing' as defined in the dictionaries. In that case it was held that a mere intention to take possession of the property into without anything actually being done was not a transact,ion. Contrast this decision with the following example in the guidelines issued by the Agency to cash dealers: Q enters a bank branch with.$100,OOO.OO in cash asks for these funds to be transferred to Upon being advised that a tax clearance certificate will be required before a transfer can be effected, Q says he will have to cpnsult his solicitors and he leaves the bank with the cash. The intercourse between Q and the bank staff will, in the Agency's view, constitute a 'transaction' for the purposes of section 16 of the Transaction Reports Act. The cash dealer report such information as is available. It would seem to me that a mere inquiry of this sort could not be properly viewed as a 'transaction' having regard to the definition that I have referred to. nonIt is unsatisfactory to have legislation drafted in such sweeping terms that its operation relies upon non-jusguidelines which, although very well-intentioned, may not be entirely acUnder section 16, if a cash dealer 'has reasonable grounds to suspect' that inforconcerning the transaction may be transrelevant to criminal offences, the cash dealer is obliged to provide the Agency the 'reportable details' specified in proschedule 4 of the Act. The section forces bank teller, bookmaker or travel agent of to act as an investigator when clearly such people are not trained for such a role. Again, I can understand the intentionbut look at the consequences involved in the drafting. Furthermore, the general thrust of the Act makes serious inroads into the principle of client confidentiality. Under subparagraph 16 (1) (b) (ii) a relevant offence includes 'an offence against a law of the Commonwealth'. I emphasise the words 'an offence against a law'. This is an extremely wide provision catching all offences from ,the most trivial to the most serious. It has always been assumed that the purpose of the Act is to trace the money trail in order to detect serious offences relating to tax evasion, money laundering and organised crime. For example, in his second reading speech on the Bill, the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) described the legislation as 'one of the most significant initiatives to counter the underground cash economy, tax evasion and money laundering'. It may be that the Agency and cash dealers are not concentrating on trivial offences and this appears to be fairly clear from the evidence given by the Agency before the Senate Estimates Committee in 1990. However, if this is the case, why have such a wide provision in the first place? When this matter was raised with the Attorney-General by way' of correspondence, he replied that if the operation of section 16 were limited by reference to specific serious offences it would, in his view, require cash dealers to become investigators of criminal offences before any obligation to report would arise. On one view, having regard to the obligations imposed upon them by various parts of this Act, it is clear that they are already placed in such a position. In any event, I can see no practical difference between requiring a cash dealer to consider whether information is relevant to 'an offence' or 'any offence' as opposed to certain specified serious offences. Indeed, to narrow the ambit of section 16 may introduce greater certainty into the reporting obligations imposed upon cash dealers. So in the committee stage I will move an amendment to section 16 and at that time. I will explain the exact content of that amendment. In our system of government the liberty of the individual is rarely encroached upon by deliberate action on the part of legislators. However, all too often the rights of individuals are eroded by ill-prepared legislation rushed through the Parliament at the twilight hour with very little debate. The principle I have enunciated will relate particularly to preserving individual liberties, if only through redrafting. It would seem appropriate that the House look at those matters during the committee stage and it would also seem appropriate that these pieces of legislation be subject to a review of the type that the committee chaired by Sir Harry Gibbs is conducting in relation to the provisions of the Crimes Act. Such a review would focus upon the approach this legislation has taken in modifying traditional concepts of criminal liability. I would ask the Attorney-General to give careful consideration to my request. In its interim report of July 1990, the Gibbs Committee made a number of recommendations on the principles which should govern criminal responsibility. It would seem that many aspects of the Proceeds of Crime Act and the Cash Transactions Reports Act are at odds with the principles of criminal liability that our courts have developed over the centuries. It is a question of striking a proper balance between effective law enforcement and individual liberty, and that is not always easy to do. However, it is an object that clearly we are obliged to pursue. I remind the House-and I have dealt with this on two occasions: in some brief introductory remarks last night and again today-that we fully support the objective of both pieces of legislation, the Proceeds of Crime Act and the Cash Transactions Reports Act, namely, the pursuit of the money trail which the former Royal Commissioner Frank Costigan described as 'the jugular of organised crime'. The aims of this pursuit are, first, to trace the proceeds of crime and, secondly, to remove the incentive for crime by confiscating the illgotten gains of illegal activity. I emphasise that the concerns I have mentioned are not just passing concerns; they can strike at the individual liberties of most Australian citizens.",14
7,Mr WRIGHT,CRIMES LEGISLATION,"It is my opinion that there is nothing more dangerous to a society than an underpaid, unhappy, undertrained and undisciplined police force. Because I hold that view, I welcome the amendments proposed in the Crimes Legislation Amendment Bill before the House. One of the amendments is part of the ongoing strategy that this Government has adopted-a reform strategy for the Australian Federal Police. This specific amendment relates to reviews and appeals and will give a fairer and broader approach. The provisions will also bring greater justice and fairness. It is all part of the Government's philosophy of promoting the concept of appointment and promotion based on merit. I suppose one could say that it is simply an addition to those many changes that have taken place in recent years, particularly the career structure changes that were started in 1989. These changes have focused on personnel, training, equipment, qualifications and attitude. I am sure honourable members would concur with my point of view that we need to ensure that those who carry out the role of enforcing our laws are adequately paid and trained, and that they do have access to the equipment they need to carry out their task. On the question of remuneration, however, I believe we still have a long way to go. I am not talking just about the Federal police; I see that comment applying to police enforcement agency structures right across this nation. It concerns me that we have middle ranking officers earning only $30,000 a year. I can understand that they question the career they might pursue within a law enforcement agency when they can see some other person-be that person clerical or administrative-in an office earning similar money. There is a need for a nationwide review of the salary arrangements, and this should take place in the States ,and federally. Only 18 months ago in my own region, I had a State officer privately tell me that he took home $590 a fortnight. Now, that is a pathetic amount of money, and maybe there is a message there for all the States to ensure that they are paying their people properly. Society has to be prepared' to pay its police forces well. It has to give emphasis to the need for equipment; it has to make sure that the training procedures are in place and that police force personnel have access to high technology. But again it comes back to money in the pocket. So I place on record my attitude not only to the Federal police but to the police forces generally. We also need to ensure, as this amendment achieves, fairness and justness in relation to appointments and promotions. We need to utilise the talents of our officers and, again, the Federal Government has ensured that that proposition is being pursued within the provisions of law. We need to develop also, I believe, a greater community trust within the minds of our ordinary citizens when it comes to our police forces. An opponent of mine many years ago, a fellow named Sir Joh BjelkePetersen, once said in a debate in the Queensland Parliament that the police force was the thin blue line between a free society and anarchy. I may have disagreed with Joh Bjelke-Petersen on many issues, but I certainly agree with him on that point. I will not go into what he used to do with the police force and how he manipulated it, but with that principle he espoused I concur. As we consider that point, we need to appreciate that there are enormous pressures on that thin blue line; there are enormous pressures on our policing agencies in the community. I just do not know how a police officer can handle a situation in which he is facing some students or some conservationists, or anyone who has a strong point to make, when someone spits in his face, pours mock blood all over him or throws pig fat all over himas occurred some time back. I think we as a society need to start to say, 'Look, there need to be rules; there need to be standards'. We also need to understand how police officers must put up with enormous pressure and trauma, and how that trauma and pressure flows back to their own families-to their children at school and to their wives, who can become pletely isolated. It is often said that the lot of the Fed- of eral policeman, however, is different. I believe that the stress must also be there. It must grow, particularly when he is dealing with international criminals, hijacks, drug-running and the sorts of activities which he has to be part. So what I am really saying to the House is that we need to be conscious of the role that the police play; we need to ensure that we pay them sufficiently; we need to ensure that we develop the correct attitudes within our police force. But to achieve that, we to make sure their lot is a reasonable one. I want to move to another aspect of legislation pertaining to the National Crime Authority (NCA). This Bill is going ditious. to enhance the efficiency of the Authority because it will enable it to assemble and give evidence to the prosecuting authority instead of, as happens at the moment, following a process by which that evination-not dence must go to the Attorney-General or to the law enforcement agency and then, after a period of time, be dealt with. vital that we pursue in this House the principle that everyone is innocent until proven guilty. Obviously, we do not want to get to the position where, as with man law, one has to defend oneself and come up with evidence to prove one's He said, inter alia: innocence. At the same time, there have to be fast processes to ensure that justice is done and that the law can be enforced. There usually need to be real deterrents to the criminal for element. Those deterrents have to incorence porate the risk of being detected, appreThat hended, prosecuted and convicted, and the risk of being punished appropriately. Maybe if the criminal mind - ooks throu.gh those issues and says 'There IS a great that I will get caught and a chance that will be prosecuted' or 'There is every chance that I will be convicted', he will think twice, three times, or four times. To achieve that we require sophistialso cated equipment and we require signifitaking cant personnel establishments in terms of information. police numbers. We also need simplified processes in law. We need to get rid of comthe barriers, and I believe that this amendment will achieve a breaking down one unnecessary barrier and will lead to the expeditious process of the NCA being able to pass on evidence that it finds to a prosecuting authority. Again in central Queensland, in a case of of fraud related to a State matter, the police officer said to me that it would be too costly to proceed with and to prove. He said, 'What's the use anyway? The fellow will get three months; he will be do back on the streets; and it will cost the taxpayer thousands of dollars to put the need person away'. We need to overcome that sort of attitude in the police force, and the we can do that only by making sure that the laws we write are effective and expe. . I move to the issue of the National Crime Authority. I see the National Crime . Authority as being probably our most important agency for the future of this necessarily in its present structure but in a revamped, national-oriented structure. I am calling for a comIt is pletely nationally characterise.d laenforcement agency or system III thIS nation. I note with interest a statement by the newly appointed ChairI1lan of the RoNational Crime Authority, Mr Justice John Phillips, dated 23 November 1990. It must be accepted that effective control of white collar crime is beyond the capacity of anyone agency, Commonwealth or State '... becaus- it transcends State boundanes. It reqUires its control and organisation a physical presin all the States and Territories. is the beginning, I believe, of the need for change. I note that the NCA, the Government, the Federal Police and all other agencies have developed a pretty fIsk good record in law enforcement over the I decades. I am very much aware, too, that there has been a new regime of cooperation and consultation in the seconding of personnel and the sharing of skills. I am aware of the fast tracking that is place in terms of the passing on of At the same time, I am convinced that we need to recognise that Australia is not an isolated little country. It is no longer an island, and therefore we need to cast off what could be described as our moat mentality. We have to understand that we are part of an international scene. We also have to understand that crime is of an international nature, that there are international influences. There is very much a national nature of crime as well. If we are going to meet the demands of the twenty-first century, we need to take up the decisions that were made 150 years ago. Honourable members will know from their reading of history that in our separate colonies in the early years we had our own monetary systems. We even looked to our own colonial navies and armies for defence. But we saw the need for a national approach in those areas of administration. We saw the need for effectiveness and efficiency. It was appreciated that we needed one Australian defence system-be it at that time an army, navy and air force. Ultimately, we moved to a combined and consolidated structure. I put to the House that what took place was a realisation that we should not have an army in New South Wales, a navy in the Northern Territory or Queensland and some other structure in Western Australia. There was a need for a national approach. I now argue that we need to pick up that philosophy when it comes to law enforcement. At the moment we have the Australian Federal Police, the State police forces, the Northern Territory police force, the National Crime Authority, the Australian Securities Commission and the Australian Customs Service. All these structures carry out very important roles. Whilst they are specialist roles and the structures need to maintain separate identity in the sorts of activities they carry out, I am arguing that there needs to be a national administrative structure, particularly when it comes to dealing with the criminals that now confront our nation. Already in Australia there are moves to try to work at the edges, one might say, of the defamation laws, If someone is defamed in a national newspaper, the plaintiff tends to look around and goÂ· to the defamation law structure within the State that will give him or her the best result. Such people might pick Western Australia because there is a better chance of proceeding against the defamer. We should have one defamation law for the nation, because the defamatory statement can be national. We should have a basic national criminal code instead of a criminal code in South Australia, a criminal code in Queensland and a criminal code in Western Australia that differ from each otherand not just at the edges. We ought to have deterrents in terms of uniform penalties. Whereas in one State one can use drugs in a certain way, in another State one cannot. Again we ought to move slowlyÂ· but specifically toward uniformity in those fields. But when it comes to terrorism, drugs and corporate crime, there is no room for separate regimes; there is no room for a State structure, a Territory structure and a national structure. When it comes to terrorism, surely we need to take up the attitudes of 150 years ago and say that terrorism is not a State or Territory related problem but is a national problem and that therefore we need a national agency. We need to encourage cooperation, consultation and, if necessary, even competition to enhance the standards of activity. Ultimately, as we move into the twenty-first century-and I hope by the year 2010-we will have in place a national law enforcement agency that has the capacity to deal with the international and national challenges to this nation. Already we have an inter-government committee with representatives from each State working together and the law enforcement Ministers participating together. We have the NCA coordinating and cooperating on joint task force ventures and we have the swapping of information and exchange of personnel. All those activities are taking place. We have seen a massive increase in the sorts of money being spent by both the Commonwealt'h and the States. Back in 1984-85, when the Labor Government set up the National Crime Authority, we spent $5.9m; In 1989-90 we spent $20.1m and the States also contributed $7.8m. There is a realisation in monetary terms that we need a national approach, that we need to pool our moneys, cooperate and take advantage of adding those forces together. We understand the need for brin-Â­ ing our personnel together and yet we stIll have different structures. I argue strongly that we take up Mr Justice John Phillips's concept and that it be expanded. We must appreciate that crime transcends State boundaries and we have to understand that no one agency has the capacity, as Mr Justice Phillips says, to combat or control white collar crime. I would argue , that one can take that argument across to every other aspect of crime in our society. Time is going to defeat me in my speech. I wanted to go on to some other aspects of the amendments, but I will use the few minutes I have left to go back over some specific' points. The Australian Federal Police is doing a great job. The changes that the Federal Government has introduced since 1989 have been welcomed across the political boundaries. The community is gradually appreciating how important it is that we spend money on our law-making and law-enforcement structures. That has been shown by the Government being willing to spend, in the instance of the NCA, over $20m this year, with the States spending almost $8m. I compliment all those who have been behind those moves, but I argue that it is not enough. I argue that we have to take up the challenge that is before this nation and that faces everyÂ· other nation in this world-the challenge of international crime; the challenge of terrorism; the challenge of the drug trade; and the challenge of corporate crime that transcends not only State boundaries, as Justice Phillips told us, but also national boundaries, where the boardrooms of New York 'can influence 'and determine an outcome in a boardroom 'in Sydney or on the job floor in Newcastle or some other town. We need to appreciate that we are dealing with a new era of crime and that, because of that, we need a new structure for the defence of our society. I go back to the original point I made: that the greatest challenge we have to our society is to have an underpaid, unhappy, untrained and undisciplined police force. One might say that the other greatest challenge and danger to a nation is to have an uncoordinated police force. There are real and strong grounds for having a national police structure. I hope that, as this Parliament talks through these issues and as amendments are constantly brought forward strengthening the Australian, Federal Police and the NCA, which these amendments now do, we will take up the lateral approach and argue for an alternative structure-and that structure ought to be national in character.",17
8,Mr DUFFY,CRIMES LEGISLATION,"in reply-Before moving to some of the matters raised by the honourable  thank the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Wright) for his contribution and particularly for the matters to which he referred in respect of issues raised by Mr Justice Phillips in the last few months, specifically in relation to the National Crime Authority (NCA).  ment this Government has made.",20
9,Mr DUFFY,CRIMES LEGISLATION,"If I had had the opportunity I would have said that. It is good to hear the sorts of comments that were made by the honourable member for Capricornia. The honourable member for Kooyong, the shadow Attorney-General, applauded the appointment of Mr Justice Phillips in a press release after that. appointment was made, and it is good that on an issue as important as the selection of the Chairman of the NCA we can have, firstly, someone as outstanding as Mr Justice Phillips being prepared to take it on; secondly, members of parliament, such as the honourable member for Capricornia, picking up on. what Mr Justice Phillips is saying; and, thirdly, the Opposition taking the attitude that was taken by the shadow Attorney-General with regard to that appointment-which I think we are all very lucky to have. Amendments will be moved by the shadow Attorney-General in the Committee stage, and I will not deal with them now because it would only pre-empt what the honourable member will say then. One other matter I would like to touch on very briefly in closing the debate is the fact that the shadow Attorney-General wrote to me regarding the question of the interaction of the Proceeds of Crime Act and the tax Act. That, of course, arose out of the decision of Mr Justice Vincent in the Supreme Court of Victoria in The Deputy Commissioner of Taxation and Director of Public Prosecutions v. Kunz. The shadow Attorney wrote to me on 1 October 1990, and he showed an extraordinarily detailed knowledge, I thought, of this rather complex area of law involving the interaction of the. proceeds of crime legislation and the Tax Act. It took me a long time to research a reply. I did make the point at the time that because there was an appeal pending I believed it would be inappropriate to amend the Proceeds of Crime Act at this stage. I still have the view that it is better not to enter into even a discussion of it. My reply was couched fairly carefully for that obvious reason. I think this has been reinforced by the fact that in a subsequent and as yet unreported judgment in the same matter, Mr Justice Teague of the Victorian Supreme Court has stated that both section 218 notices and orders under the Proceeds of Crime Act have a powerful intrusive effect. His Honour went on to say that he was satisfied that an order under the proceeds Act had a greater priority than a section 218 notice in the absence of a specific provision to the contrary. That is another case of Kunz and Slade v. Director of Public Prosecutions and others, the judgment having been made on 30 January 1991. It may well be that the shadow Attorney is correGt on this point, but I think in the circumstances it is preferable to await the views of the full Supreme Court on the issue and to review the situation after that. It is not a matter of ignoring the issue, but it is probably desirable notÂ· to take it any further at this stage. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee The Bill.  leave-I move: (1) Clause 2, page 1, after subclause (1) insert following subclause: ""(IA) Section 20A and paragraph 21 (aa) commence 4 months after the day on which this Act receives the Royal Assent"". (2) Page 7, after clause 20 insert the following new clause: Interpretation ""20A. Section 3 of the Principal Act is amended by inserting in subsection (1) the following definition: 'serious offence' for the purposes of subparagraph 16 (1) (b) (ii) means: (a) it murder, or an offence of a kind equivalent to murder; (b) a kidnapping, or an offence .of a kind equivalent to kidnapping; (c) a seÂ·rious narcotics offence, being an offence in relation to a narcotic substance as defined by subsection 4 (1) of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987: (a) constituted by the production, possession (including possession for supply), supply, importation or export of a narcotic substance; and (b) involving a quantity of the narcotic substance that is equal to or greater than the trafficable quantity applicable to the narcotic substance; (d) a money laundering offence, being an offence against section 81 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987; (e) the receipt, possession (including possession for supply), concealment, disposition of or bringing into Australia any money, or any other property, that may reasonably be suspected of being proceeds of crime, being an offence against section 82 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987; (f) an organised fraud offence, being an offence against section 83 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987; and (g) an offence constituted by aiding, abetting or conspiring to commit an offence of the kind referred to in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) or (f)."". Crimes Legislation Bill (3) Clause 21, page 7, before paragraph (a).insert the following paragraph: ""(aa) by omitting from subparagraph (l) (b) (ii) 'an offence' and substituting 'a serious offence' "". During the second reading debate I foreshadowed that I would be moving an amendment to the Crimes Legislation Amendment Bill the purpose of which is to confine the ambit of the obligations created under section 16 of the Cash Transaction Reports Act of 1988. Section 16, as I have explained, obliges cash dealers to make certain reports where they suspect that information they have may, amongst other things, be relevant to the investigation of or prosecution of an offence against a law of the Commonwealth or of a Territory. The amendments seek to confine the obligations created by section 16 to information which may be relevant to a serious offence as defined in the second amendment. That definition of a serious offence draws upon similar definitions which can be found in the provisions of the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 and the ProceedS of Crime Act 1987. The third amendment will introduce the phrase 'serious offence' into section 16 of the Cash Transaction Reports Act 1988. The effect of these amendments, if carried, will be to narrow the net cast by section 16. In this respect it will alleviate the concerns of very many people that sectio'n 16, as it is pres-ntly drafted, poses a serious risk to civil liberties. Narrowing the ambit of section 16 in the terms of the amendments that I have moved will confine its operations to the purpose intended, namely, the pursuit of the money trail left by organised crime.Â· The first of the three amendments has a specific and separate commencement provision, whereasÂ· the second and third amendments would not commence until four months after the day on which the Bill receives royal assent. The reason for this delayed commencement is so that, assuming that the amendments are carried, the Cash Transaction. Reports Agency and cash dealers will have sufficient time in which to familiarise themselves with 13 February 1991 REPRESENTATIVES 439 the new requirements which will be brought by them.",20
10,Mr DUFFY,CRIMES LEGISLATION,"The basic point that was made this morning-and has been made for some time-is that the Opposition does not oppose in any way the general thrust of the proceeds of crime legislation or, for that matter, the cash transactions legislation.But the shadow Attorney-General, the;: honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), has raised some problems which he sees in striking that balance between law enforcement and civil liberties in the amendments that he has moved. As he indicated, he isÂ· endeavouring to confine or narrow the ambit of section 16. It will limit the circumstances in which a cash dealer must make a report of a suspicious transaction under section 16. The proposed amendment creates considerable problems. It is for that reason that it is not acceptable to the Government. I can understand what the shadow Attorney-General is saying, but I think he is wrong in the sense that it does not achieve that balance that he is attempting to obtain. It causes a lot of difficulties. I think that the definition of 'serious offence' in the interpretation provision of the proposed amendment would require bank tellers, for example, to become experts in Commonwealth criminal law. It would probably get us to a stage at which the section would become almost unworkable. Bank tellers would be asked to dis- . tinguish 'serious offences' from other Commonwealth offences that are now reportable. The amendment would fan in the aim of limiting the reporting of transactions, although it is not clear that that is necessarily what the amendment is about, because, as I said earlier, it is really confining or narrowing the ambit of sec-Â· tion 16 rather than the number of reports that would be made. It is worth mentioning that in this whole area dealing with the operation of section 16 the majority of reports have related to tax evasion. The Opposition has never indicated that it has any problem with that. To the contrary, it has supported it. Of the 6,200-odd reports lodged, 4,587 have related to suspected tax evasion un440 REPRESENTATIYES 13 February 1991 der section 16 (1) (b) (i). I just think that it is too difficult to place cash dealers in the situation where they have to make a decision about whether or not something is a 'serious' Commonwealth offence. Section 16 (1) (b) (ii) requires tl1at informa-. tion about transactions must be relevant to an offence against Commonwealth law. This requires a further judgment by the cash dealer in deciding whether the information must be reported. To make those circumstances narrower, as the amendment does and for which a report must be lodged, requires a cash dealer to carry out a clOse examination and probably seek legal advice before deciding whether a matter would ,be reported. In practice it would not work and would not be practical. I will give an example of that. Say there is a situation where there is a suspected narcotics offence. A serious offence in that area is a trafficable quantity. Obviously if it is a massive amount of money, that is likely to be the case. But if it is on that borderline of around that $10,000. figure, it would depend very much as to whet)ler the drug involved was a trafficable quantity. That is something which is going to be very difficult for a cash dealer. He is not going to have the drug sitting there; he is just going to have the cash. He will have to make a judgment as to whether it is a serious offence in that area, the narcotics area of the example I have given. I; think it makes it. unworkable. Furthermore, where a cash dealer lodges a report in good faith under section 16 the cash dealer is protected from action by the customer or any other person. However, where that report was lodged in relation to a transaction which was not reportable, the protection is uncertain. For . a cash dealer to be protected, it is necessary for the cash dealer to believe in good faith that the suspected offence is within the class specified in section 16 (1) (b) By narrowing that class of offence as proposed to a 'serious offence' this exercise becomes more difficult and perhaps impossible for a cash dealer. The answer would be that there would be very few reports in borderline cases. If it was a borderline case, if one was in the position Taxation Laws Bill ofacash dealer, and if this sort of amendment happened to be put into this legis- ! lation, one would certainly exercise what discretion one had in that way in not reporting borderline cases. Many of them would go unreported. Whilst I appreciate the issue of the balance which we are all trying to strike-I do not think there is any suggestion to the contrary by the Opposition; there certainly is not-I do not think this proposed amendment does that. For the reasons I have touched on this morning,Â· I think it makes this section almost unworkable and for that reason it is not acceptable. . Amendments negatived. Bill agreed to.

11,Mr ROCHER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"The Government has once again resorted to the use of an omnibus Bill to amend several principal ta-ation Acts. It has gone one step further. Only this morning, less than half an hour ago, it presented us with half a dozen or so pages of amend-. ments to what is, needless to say because' it is in common with all tax legislation introduced by this Government, extremely complex legislation. We are now faced with talking about a Bill which the Government proposes to amend. Those amendments are .presented in legislative (ii). form with no explanation whatsoever to enable me or anyone else in this debate to establish their relevance to the matters warranting disoussion on the Bill itself. It is just a further example of the ineptitude of this Government in presenting its legislation, particularly, but not only, taxation legislation. Not surprisingly, most provisions in the BillÂ· will amend .the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936-that enormous, now incomprehensible, tome of some 2,000 pages, which proves that ignorance of the law is an excuse, albeit not recognised by either the courts or the Commissioner of Ta'fation. Some provisions in the Bill even amend amendments passed within the past 12 months and, in at least one case, within the past three months. As well, Madam Deputy Speaker, there is the continued spate of changes to capital gains tax legislation to redress those infamous unintended consequences of the ill considered original impost that you would remember so well. The Bill demonstrates further ad hockery in the Government's approach to law making, which is not, as I have already indicated, confined just to taxation matters. A classic example of the ad hoc approach of the Treasurer (Mr Keating), not just to economic and fiscal management but to taxation laws, is to be found in the proposed reduction of a rebate before that new rebate, passed by the Parliament as recently as December, could even come into effect. It will never see the light of day. Amendments to recent amendments of this kind break new ground, even for this Government. It is about time the new found candour and regrets displayed by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer, following their confessions about their heartlessly engineered recession, were extended to other areas of government administration. A start on the road to rectitude would be a reversal of the decision in 1985 demanded of the Prime Minister by the Minister responsible for the carriage of this Bill when he was President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean), and the adoption of a broad based consumption tax-a start on the road to simplification and efficiency in our tax laws. After all, the Prime Minister so often before has shown a capacity to do a U-turn. The very existence of the capital gains tax is testimony to that capacity, but far from the only one. Capital gains tax amendments include measures which will alter the obligations of partners and partnerships, as currently spelled out in part IlIA. The effect is that any capital gains tax consequences of the sale of a partnership, in whole or in part, I believe, attach to the partners and not to the partnership as an entity. Henceforth, for capital gains purposes, partners will own assets, not the business entitythe partnership itself being the business entity. There are, as one might imagine, some matters which give rise to our concern. There is proposed new section 160zZRFitself imposing, when we think about the complexity of this legislation. It is intended to reduce the indexed cost base or reduced cost base of a share in or a loan to a transferor company by a taxpayer, referred to as the second taxpayer in certain circumstances. The second taxpayer is affected only in certain circumstances, again as spelled out in the Bill. Clearly this provision appears to be wide enough to include a taxpayer being an independent third party lender such as a bank. That result would be inequitable and unnecessary. I doubt whether it was intended, but no-one could possibly know that. It seems once again that, to overcome that possibility and that inequity, the best way over it-it is not a good alternative; it is one of which I have complained consistently over the last eight years or more-is to confer more discretion on the Commissioner of Taxation to enable him to treat it consistently with proposals as they are set out in self-assessment proposals and anti-avoidance discretions in other areas. I see that there is some reference to that clause in those amendments to which I referred earlier. I cannot possibly tell the House the effect of that amendment to these amendments. It is really a dog's breakfast. However, if it goes to the committee stage and we have time to think about it, we might be able to detect just what the Government is driving at. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Mr Free), if he is to carry the amendment, might give us some explanation in the second reading speech as to how the amendments proposed to be introduced in the committee stage relate to the amendments contained in this Bill. The revenue impact of changes to part lIlA, of course, is zero. So we have complicated law, once again, for no apparent advantage to the revenue. That reference I made to section 160zZRF applies, of course, to roll-over relief to be extended in certain circumstances, and it is intended, according to the Minister's explanation in his second reading speech and the memorandum, that the pre-20 September 1985 exempt status will cease if assets are in future transferred between companies in a group under certain circumstances. The issue of shares and securities, introduced only last year into legislation to address possible antiavoidance considerations, apparently was not enough, and the issue of shares and securities as consideration in such group transactions is now no longer to apply. I remind my honourable friend opposite, the Parliamentary Secretary, that that was introduced only in the first half of last year. This in fact is the third attempt the Government has made to get this provision right, and it is still far from satisfactory. I might say that that situation prevails despite the repeated warnings and urgings of the coalition, both here and in the Senate. The Government has shown its reluctance, in a way bordering on arrogance, to accept the problems foreseen by the coalition in so much of its tax legislation. Hence we see a raft of Bills every year, and complex omnibus measures such as we have before us today, to try to come to grips with matters which were in many cases foreseen by the coalition and urged on the Government for acceptance. We are uneasy, in the roll-over relief provisions for group transactions, about what is clearly unequal treatment for some company groupings. There is a lack of consistency there, depending on the nature of those groupings. Last year's amendment to section 160ZZ0-1 think it was in Taxation Laws Amendm-nt Bill (No. 3) 1990, which it seems is now regarded as unsatisfactory-had a commencement date of 15 August 1989. The amendments to correct that unsatisfactory amendment, in our opinion, should commence from 15 August 1989 and not, as is proposed in the Bill, from 6 December last year. That is because some companies went ahead with reconstructions on the basis of provisions in the Act, as I have referred to, effective from 15 August 1989. The roll-over relief provisions are also intended to deal with disposals for less than adequate consideration. The Government is aware of some of the problems associated with that measure. The Government has been apprised of those problems by the Taxation Institute of Australia but it has not responded in any positive or sensible way. The impact of the rollover relief provisions will be considerable but apparently unquantifiable. So the Government believes it will derive revenue benefits from these provisions. There being certain implications for the revenue, we should also record the fact that capital gains tax collections must be seriously under threat. I can understand the Government trying to shore up its provisions and to maximise collections by way of capital gains tax. The Budget estimate of collections for this year is $465m from individuals and some $310m by way of capital gains tax from companies. According to the New South Wales Office of State Revenue, for example, the average price of New South Wales residential properties fell 11 per cent in the two years to October last year, while the average price for commercial properties fell by 15 per cent over the same period. There is some reason to suppose that that fall in property prices has been speeded up somewhatÂ· in these engineered recessionary times. Therefore, we can see an example of property prices having fallen, with serious implications for the revenue in terms of capital gains tax. We have had the Treasurer drive the economy into the ground and engineer his recession. The outlook is, of course, poor for capital gains tax collection. That occurs because people are being forced to sell assets, and nowhere do we see better examples than amongst the. governments of Victoria, Western Australia and South Australia. They are in the position where they are going to have to sell publicly owned assets to coverup their own foolishness. In the private sectOI: the people who will be paying the sums, or it was hoped would be paying the sums of capital gains tax this year, are being forced to sell because of Goverf,lment fiscal ineptitude. So we will have thes- deflated as-ets on the market <.md property and share prices down, and one will have the inflation factor on top of that. So we will have capital losses' stacked up not just. with implications for this year but for future years because, as honourable memb-rs will be aware, those capital losses,' can be offset only against future capit-l gains. So they are going to be stored up and they are going to affect the revenue from this measure for years to come. The outlook, therefore, for the revenue from capital gains taxes is pretty dismal in the immediate and short term future. I would like to see a revision of the Budget estimates based on the current realities that I have mentioned. In fact we should have a mini-Budget to address the dire circumstances that are now confronting the country. The equation for capital gains tax will be affected by more and forced sales now, and with grave implications for the future. Only this Government could introduce such a clumsy tax, then go about ruining the economy to make sure it gets less revenue-it is shades of the luxury car tax. The Government had this wonderful new measure and it turned a sure revenue raiser into a negative. We warned the Government about that at the time and, of course, it arrogantly went on because our warnings were inconsistent with the politics of envy which the Government introduced so much of into taxation law. Another provision in the Bill refers to the transfer of assets from a company or trust to a spouse upon the breakdown of a marriage. This involves freeing any assets transferred from obligation toÂ· pay capital gains tax provided an order is made by the Family Court of Australia; We have no objection to that-we welcome the measure. Dividend imputation arrangements for life assurance co-panies are particularly complex. We have some very real concerns with those. There are, some implications which the Government has not addressed in anything it has said about the measures. This part of the Bill will deny mutual life assurance companies and government insurance offices the right to maintain a franking account, and that will cancel any surplus franking credits held by them as at 21 August 1990. I believe that measure will be retrospective. These benefits have accrued and are there to be used on the basis of the perfectly good law that existed. Now we are to say that in effect we will confiscate those benefits-we will no longer allow them for the life companies which have stored them up in accordance with the law of the day. Another problem with this measure in this connection is that it could very well offend section 55 of the Constitution in that it represents acquisition on unjust terms. It is more than a tax proposal. It is the confiscation of a benefit and sooner or later I suspect the Government will be challenged on the constitutionality of that, provided of course there is a taxpayer out there with enough at stake to take the matter before the High Court. There is a need for parity of treatment between mutual and non-mutual companies under the transitional arrangements that will apply as a result of this legislation. There is a real problem with the disparity of treatment. It is intended in the case of one category of life offices to adopt a particular formula for application, and it is a formula which appears to be completely arbitrarily based. There does not appear to be any rationale for the proposal. There is certainly no sound basis for limiting the amount of franking credits that arise in relation to surplus which is not referable to Australian registered participating policies because Australian registered participating policies are germane to the application of that formula. \ We suggest that it may be preferable to apply only the franking credit and debit reductions to that proportion of the plus which is derived from Australian istered participating policies, but at the same time to retain full franking credits and debits arising in relation to all other surpluses. I note also that there is a review of the Life Insurance Act under way, and that has some relationship to these tax measposes ures, and certainly to the 20 per cent cap imposed by section 50 of the Life Insurexercising ance Act. I do not know whether this in any way pre-empts what might be done with the Life Insurance Act. Another provision refers to bereaveThose ment payments and provides that the taxown ation treatment of bereavement payments introduced last year is to be the same that provided for the similar benefits those particular payments replaced. proposal is, in itself, unobjectionable and, of course, we do not oppose it. Amendments are proposed again to the Taxation Laws Amendment (Foreign Inprovisions, come) Act, which was passed by the Pargeneral liament on 19 December last year, and here we have the first of a raft of amenderally ments. Incidentally, I think that the Treasurer also announced in December further amendments to the amendments that are under consideration here today, so we are going to go through this tedious process and end up with a dog's dinner of an Act again. These provisions cerpart tainly are a dog's dinner. They are comthat plicated enough, as we said when debating the foreign source income legislation last year. There are additional items to be proved for tax deductions in relation foreign activities that generate assessable income under these provisions. Also inapply, volved is the elimination of tax deductiers bility for foreign branch bad debts avoid double dipping. The removal of the potential for some double taxation of tax billion. avoidance avenues is also dealt with. The provisions go on to correct some technical deficiencies in that foreign source income legislation which, as I say, we only passed in this place in December. The Bill also deals with protection of . information, that is, those provisions in . surthe Income Tax Assessment Act and other regActs which prevent the dissemination of information other than to very clearly defined groups of people or government bodies in most cases. The existing Act, as I understand it, makes it an offence for a person knowingly to take action to obtain information held under or for the purof a Commonwealth taxation law, unless the person does so in the courstf of powers or performing functions under that law. This is having the unintended effect, according to the Government, of hindering enforcement activities by State and Territory taxation authorities. authorities, for the purpose of their revenue laws, are seeking access to information collected by businesses and as used for the purpose of a Commonwealth that taxation law. The new provisions, as I The understand them, will provide that no longer will access be prohibite.d to those State organisations. We do not argue with these specific but I must say that there is unease, not only amongst the coalition but amongst the professionals gendealing in the area of taxation law' about secrecy provisions. There does seem to be a gradual erosion. It always seems to be for a very good reason, but it does mean that information can find its way into more and more hands. Whilst, as I say, we do not object to that particular of these provisions, we would want to be watched. We will certainly be we were monitoring it closely. Probably the most important and welcome part of the Bill is that bit where it apsets out to reduce marginal rates-the to lowest marginal rate to be reduced from 21 c to 20c in the dollar. The changes will of course, only to resident taxpayand will result in a reduction in reveto nue collected this year of $430m and apparently in a full year a reduction of $1 Our. main objection in the context of this debate is that this measure should be included with an omnibus Bill. It is a separate and separable matter which could . be dealt with very quickly; I doubt ther there wouldÂ· be any opposition or much debate on any measure which oppbses tax cuts, certainly tax cuts to pers-nal income tax payers. So whilst we have very real problems and a lack of k-,?wle-ge in c-nn-ction wit- o-her proviSIOns m the BIll, It makes It dIfficult deal with unless these personal income tax cut provisions are separated from the omnibus Bill. It will be our intention to do that in the Senate, and to be able, by that process, to give in committee 'serious' consideration to other provisions about which we have doubts and reservations. We hope to hive off everything but the tax cuts to a committee because of the ineptness of the Government and its legislation. I have mentioned that already announcements have been made that more changes and amendments to these provisions will. be foreshadowed. Perhaps such an investigation by a Senate committee would be helpful in getting the legislation right finally. The other provision is one which in- . tends to reduce the cost of a rebate for medical experises exceeding $1,000 in any one year, to reduce that rebate beginning next financial year from 21 c to 20c. That 21c was only written into the Act late last year. It will never apply, and yet we are to have a further reduction before it has ever had a chance to take effect. What does it mean? It means, amongst other things, of course, that there will be more cost to a taxpayer who suffers catastrophic illness. The very people who are suffering under the Medicare debacle, who have to meet increased costs for health care because of what can only be described as a hopeless case of terminal illness for the Medicare system, will be faced with more expenses because the tax rebate component will be reduced a further 5 per cent or 1c. That is not much. There is only a couple of million dollars, if I remember correctly, involved by way of impact on the revenue from this measure. But that represents a lot of money to the individual taxpayer who has had to face up to the trauma and discomfort, and probably worse in some cases, of a major or catastrophic sickness or illness. These people will now be slugged just that little bit more because the rebates were reduced last year from 29c to 25c for this year. The rebates were intended to be 21 c for next year but will now be 20c. This will make their job of meeting those costs and overcoming catastrophic or major illness to that much more difficult and that much mQr.e traumatic. There are other things I would have liked to say but my time is running out fast and I will leave it at that. - Mr LES ,SCOTI (Oxley) (11.28)-ln recent times there has been much said in this House from those members opposite on the Government's package of taxation measures and how the Opposition would vary them if it had the chance. Of course, there has been a continuation of that again today by the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher). If anything was ever made clear, it is that the average Australian isÂ· very lucky that those opposite will not have the chance to implement some of their measures. The notions of abolishing the equity targeted capital gains tax and making up for the loss in revenue with a consumption tax may sound simple enough on the surface, but on further analysis the plain fact is that the only winners would be the rich and higher income earners particularly. In answering the Opposition's wild claims, the Government has laid to rest any notion the coalition may have had about caring for the life of the average Australian. The Bills we are debating here today further strengthen the Government's commitment to Australia's low and middle income groups while at the same time they provide a healthy and competitive environment for dedicated and sustained investment m Australian companies. Evidence of this is found in further clarification of some capital gains tax provisions contained in this legislation to bring about a greater degree of equity in the taxation system. For instance, through the insertion of an anti-avoidance provision in rules governing the disposal of a partner's interest in a partnership asset, potential avoidance avenues which may arise by use of interposed partnerships will be closed. Further amendments have been applied there which will also address the question of tax avoidance. These amendments make clear that capital gains tax liabilities will be accounted for through the partnership itself - tax deferral Other provisions will see the modification of rules for roll-over relief on the transfer of assets between group companies, introducing a greater degree of equity into the taxation system. As originally enacted, these provisions permitted company groups with an opportunity to defer capital gains tax indefinitely, notwithstanding the fact that there might be a real change of ownership. The asset could be transferred to a shelf company, tax-free, because of the roll-over provisions, and the shares in the shelf company, subsequently sold. The sale of the shares would also be free of tax because their value would equal that of the actual asset. To prevent that abuse of the roll-over provisions, amendments made this year imposed new conditions for the availability of the roll-over-that is, companies were required to issue to the transferor shares or securities equal in value to that of the roll-over asset. The shares and se.., curities then assumed the cost bases of the rolled over asset for the purposes of calculating capital gains tax on their subsequent disposal. It is disappointing that business and taxpayer groups have voiced their protest at this measure, given the specific intent to eliminate deliberate avoidance of tax. However, given this Government's desire not to impede the day to day operations of business, revised anti-avoidance amendments are included in the legislation before us today. This step also exemplifies the Government's intent to bring , about genuine taxation reform in consultation with all sections of the community. Following consultation, the proposal has been before us that company groups can no longer be required to issue shares or securities as a condition for the availability of roll-over relief. Inst-ad, a rolled over asset will be deemed to have been disposed of so that capital gains tax liabilities will become payable at a time when the group relationship between the transferor and transferee subsequently ceases. This requirement will not cause the same compliance difficulties for companies as the original anti-avoidance amendments, but at the same time it will overcome the problem, thus putting to rest the claims of an ill-informed minority that capital gains tax is the reason business cannot expand. ' On the same theme of levelling out some of the bumps in the capital gains tax field is the amendment aimed at eliminating any artificial capital gains. tax timing advantages which may arise in respect of an assets transfer between companies in the same wholly owned group. At present, that advantage can arise as a result of the consequential reduction in value of shares held in the transferor by other group companies, where an asset has been transferred for consideration less than its indexed cost base. In some cases this may be in the form of loans held in the transferor that fall in value. Group companies holding shares in the transferor company may then be able to realise a capital loss or a reduced capital gain on disposal of the shares, notwithstanding that real ownership of the transferred asset has not changed. To prevent these timing advantages, this Bill will require a series of cost, base adjustments to the shares or loans to reflect the transfer of value within the group. By ensuring that actual consideration equal to the assets cost base is paid in respect of its transfer to another group company, company groups will be able to avoid the need to beÂ· concerned about technical difficulties in making these cost base ,adjustments. All these steps further reinforce the Government's desire to make any changes to the taxation system as easy as possible for business. I am sad to say that honourable members opposite highlight the great injustice that would be inflicted on the Australian people were we to be subject to the kind of tax system proposed by the Opposition. This has been said many times, but I believe that in the context of this debate it needs to be stressed again. The term of the Hawke Government has seen the greatest reform of the tax system in this country's history. These measures haVe had one intent in mind-to bring about a more equitable Australia. In contrast, we need only look at the figures. to see the enorm<;)Us gap that would develop between the nch and the poor fmder the tax regime proposed by the Opposition, the centrepiece of which is, - f course, the introduction of a consumption tax. Such a tax and its accompanying impacts on inflation would have a particularly dire effect on low income earners. Assuming a consumption tax of only 10 per cent, people on an income of $18,000 a year would get a tax cut of $2.05 a week, but because of a 9 per cent increase in prices, their net take home pay would be $22.43 a week less. People on incomes of $45,000 a year would take home an extra $17.85 a week, while at the higher end of the wage scale, those on incomes of $125,000 a year would end up with an extra $259 a week. The lesson here is simple: the higher the wage, the higher the. benefit. Mr Free-Outrageous!",23
12,Mr LES SCOIT,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Yes, it is. In contrast with this, the Hawke Government has provided a genuine commitment to ensuring that Australian workers get a fair deal through a wages system that also provides predictable outcomes by which clear economic directions can be set. It is poignantly obvious that those members opposite would rather we were part of a complicated wages and tax machine with a thousand and one cogs striving towards a thousand and one objectives. I point out that as a result of the renegotiated arrangement betweenÂ· the Government and the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the only wage increase which employers will be obliged to pay from the centralised wage system this financial year will be the $12 a week from mid-Mayalmost the end of the financial yearproving that one does not have to enter into a multi-cog machine to make for smooth business planning. The benefits of predictable wages outcomes through consultation with the union movement were again delivered in January this year in the form of the renegotiated version of the accord mark 6. The previous example I cited of how a person on an income of $18,000 a year would fare under the elitist regime proposed by the coalition is made even more obvious when one looks at how such a person has benefited from the 1 January tax cuts. Such a person has received a tax cut of $4.15 a week-equivalent to a pretax wage rise of $5.95 a week, without the 9 per cent inflation that would accompany the Liberal alternative. While this has been a brief digression into some of the other taxation areas not directly impacted by this legislation, I feel that it is important to place the Government's intention for tax reform against the picture in which the Opposition would like to place us. However, it is important to note that it is this legislation that formalises the 1 January tax cuts to which I have just referred. It also reduces the level of the rebate of tax on net medical expenses in excess of $1,000 from 25 per cent to 20 per cent with that reduction to apply from 1 July 1991 .. The level of rebate of tax on net medical expenses in excess of $1,000 fot the 1990-91 year will remain at 25 per cent. In my introduction I stated that part of the intent of this legislation is to create a healthy and competitive environment for dedicated and sustairted investment in Australian companies. This is done specifically through changes to existing dividend imputation arrangements, something which is sure to facilitate further committed investment in Australian companies and discourage speculative investment in the share market. The current system for dividend imputation already encourages investment in Australian companies paying their full share of company tax by providing that dividends paid on or after 1 July 1987 by Australian resident companies-to the extent that tax is paid or payable at the company level in respect of income of the 1986-87 and later income years-carry credits for that tax to relieve personal income tax payable by resident individual shareholders. The system operates to impute or allocate tax paid at the company level assets a credit to such shareholders, who will be assessed on the total amount of the dividend and the imputation of credit. In keeping with the principles of the imputation system, when the recipient of a dividend is a non-resident beneficiary of a trust or a non-resident partner, a dividend rebate or franking credit will not arise in respect of the franked dividend. A non-resident will also be exempt from withholding tax on franked dividends included in the net income of a trust or partnership to which he or she is entitled. As has been made clear by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) on a number of occasions, if a superannuation fund is managed well, the 15. per cent tax imposed on funds can be reduced to as low as 3 or 4 per cent thro].lgh dividend imputation. I would go so far as to say that. any fund that is not substantially reducing its tax commitment by way of dividend imputation is doing a grave disservice to its members. One only needs to look at the actual tax paid by some superannuation funds and trusts to see real evidence of the benefits to be derived from dividend imputation. I refer here to page 139 of the 1989-90 annual report from the Commissioner of Taxation which shows that, for the year, pooled superannuation trusts in Australia reduced their tax commitment from 15 per cent to 1.77 per cent through dividend imputation. For that same year, the average rate of tax paid by our 97,000plus superannuation funds was 9.54 per cent, while the average tax paid by Australia's 591 approved deposit funds was 13.04 per cent. The lesson learned here is that the larger funds with in excess of $1 m in income for the year were the better managed funds with the 52 funds in this category paying 9.6 per cent tax. What this highlights is the importance for investors to select their funds wisely and the benefits to be gained by members who do so. While on the subject of superannuation and associated taxes, it should also be pointed out that of the 13,000 superannuation fund tax returns for the 1988-89 year, processed as at 11 March 1990, as a group they paid no net tax. That is, not only did they pay no capital gains tax, but neither did they pay tax on any other income. These measures, aimed at enhancing the attractiveness of superannuation as a means of giving greater independence in retirement, are further strengthened with this legislation. The dividend imputation amendments before us today specifically propose: the cancellation of the franking surplus for all mutual life assurance companies and government insurance offices as at 21 August 1990; the denial to them of the right to maintain a franking account after that date, which the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) mentioned before, in a different light of course; the reduction of franking credits and franking debits arising to non-mutual life assurance companies from the beginning of their next franking year by 80 per cent of the amount attributable to policy income; and the increase from nil to 20 per cent, for the franked amount of dividends received by non-mutual life assurance companies from insurance fund assets which can give rise to franking credits. These measures will streamline the op- . eration of the dividend imputation system through their effective removal of existing laws which provide franking credits to institutions incapable of passing the benefits on to shareholders or policy holders. While the revenue savings that will result from restricting the franking credits arising to life assurance companies under the imputation system to those capable of being passed on to shareholders cannot be quantified, there are nevertheless significant potential revenue savings. This is because new shareholders of such companies that cease to be mutual companies will not be able to gain access to franking credits accumulated before the cessation. Another component of this Bill is the provision for taxation treatment of the various bereavement payments which have replaced the special temporary allowance and funeral benefit. Through its provision for the tax treatment of payments received by the surviving pensioner on the death of a pensioner spouse, in respect of the 14 weeks to be treated the same as those which would have applied if bereavement payments had not replaced the pecial temporary allowance and funeral en-fit, the end result is less worrisome for the surviving spouse-something very important at such a traumatic time, as I -!ll s.ure we all .understand. - n fact, pendmg on the clTcumstances, It may even bb the case that the lump sum bereavetends ment payment and ongoing pension entideduction tlement are totally or partly exempt from tax. The Bill also intends to specifically exwhere empt from tax the additional pension payment made to a third party in the situation where the death of the first ceased pensioner is not notified until the spouse has also died. An inclusion that is very much in line with the themes encompassed in the Government's social justice strategy is the provision for ment of carer's pension for 14 weeks after the death of the person being cared for, while that person was not the carer's spouse, to be exempt while the recipient is under age-pension age. Similar social justice gains are made through the Bill's provision for exemption from tax of the bereavement payment made to a widow or widower of a veteran or mariner who was in receipt of a disability pension. As part of this Government's continuamendment ing commitment to bring greater equity into the tax system, this legislation also contains amendments in relation to the tax component of foreign sourced income. These specifically relate to the issue modifications to the foreign tax credit tem proposed in the Taxation Laws tax. Amendment (Foreign Income) Bill. Through its allowance of special deducthese tions for off-shore capital expenditure on mining and petroleum activities and offcapital shore bad debts of financial institutions, the legislation will provide a healthy vironment for investment by companies wishing to expand in these areas. Of the special deduction provisions, legislation proposes to extend these above benefits to such expenditure accrued in relation to similar foreign activities that generate assessable income. It will also encourage investment overseas for Ausanced tralian companies through the application of these provisions to capital expenditure on industrial property or buildings outtax side of Australia that generate assessable income. Such measures clearly show evidence of the Government's equity driven taxation policy initiatives. To ensure these dededuction provisions only apply to genuine investments, the Bill specifically into limit bad debt and general provisions to ensure that a deduction will not be allowable for bad debts of a foreign branch of a moneylender the moneylender has not derived assessable income from those debts. Other changes aimed at removing dedeterrents to overseas investment by Austraafter lian based companies include those provisions relating to exemption of foreign branch profits and losses. For example, while section 23AH of the Inpaycome Tax Assessment Act 1936 operates to exempt fromÂ· Australian capital gains tax a foreign branch capital gain that has been subject to tax in a listed country, it does not exclude a foreign source capital loss in circumstances where it would be exempt if it were instead a capital gain. In the absence of any restriction, this section of the Act provides that foreign source capital losses could be set off against Australian capital gains. The main to section 23AH will see the alignment of treatment of foreign source capital gains and losses by ensuring that a foreign source capital loss is not available to the resident company if, had the of loss instead been a gain, it would have sysbeen exempt from Australian capital gains To ensure that companies will receive benefits, provisions are included in the legislation to ensure continuity of the gains tax treatment of assets aimed by a controlled foreign corporation (CFC) enor by a trust that changes its residence. This will mean that, for the purpose of calculating the attributable income of the this CFC, the assets will be treated as having been disposed of and re-acquired on the change of residence, ensuring that no part of the capital gain is taxed twice. It is important to note that such steps are balwith a firm drive by the Government to see that, as is expected of all Australians, a fair and correct amount of is paid by CFCs, as is evident in the anti-avoidance provisions for interposed partnerships and trusts. The Bill proposes that such a provision be inserted for the attribution of amounts under the CFC measures. The provisions will not provide credit for foreign taxes paid in respect of the amount attributed and will not allow exemption for subsequent distributions. This reflects the highly artificial nature of structures that would be required as well as the complexities that would be involved. The breadth of rules covered by the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6) shows just how complex the taxation arena is and, in doing so, reveals the detail that needs to be applied when putting in place a tax system that provides both incentive and equity. If I can turn briefly to some of the criticisms of the honourable member for Curtin in relation to his obvious confusion about the additional amendments that have been posed by the Government, I think most of his complaints have been addressed in the supplementary explanatory memorandum. However, probably the most important point from my way of thinking is the tightening up of antiavoidance objectives in clause 61 of that amendment. Also, as to its other areas, of course, there are further amendments which suggest tightening things up and which certainly correct some potential technical difficulties that arise. I believe that through such measures as those. I have referred to here today the Government is doing precisely what is needed for our taxation system in making it a much more equitable system for all Australians. I certainly commend the Bill and the amendments to the House.",30
13,Mr WILSON,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"ln spite of what the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) has just said, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.6) does not simplify the tax system, does not introduce real equity into the tax system and does not introduce incentive into the tax system. This Bill adds to the grave complexity of the tax system because, yet again, the Australian Taxation Office when asked to prepare legislation seems to have come up with the most complex way of resolving the problem. There are many, many areas in our tax system where we should go back to basics and ask: what revenue do we want to collect from this group of entrepreneurs and enterprises, this group of individuals; how can we arrange a structure that is simple to administer and simple to the taxpayer? But no, we go on building page after page, tree after tree, forest after forest on a huge mass of legislation that very few can comprehend. The Bill offers no tax reform, but continues the current system with all its shortcomings; it continues its bias against families with children; it remains subject to bracket creep; and it fails to give recognition to those who accept responsibility for social expenditures on their own part and who thereby save the Government expenditure. It offers no incentive for people to provide for their only social needs. In this area, we need to ask ourselves some questions. Should governments be running schools? Should governments be . running hospitals? Should governments be providing retirement incomes? They should certainly be providing a framework in which individuals and their families can afford to do all those things. But are governments doing that? No, they are taxing those who would support themselves in order to support others who could look after themselves. Our community falls into three groups of taxpayers. Firstly, there are those who are on low incomes, including the subgroups of those who are on low incomes for short periods and those who are on low or no incomes of their own for long periods. No-one disputes the Government's role in collecting taxes from those who can afford to pay taxes to provide for those who have no income of their own, either over short periods or on an enduring basis. No-one disputes the fact that that burden should be shared equitably across those who can afford to pay. While we have an income tax system, few would dispute the fact that those funds should be provided by taxes that are income related. Then there is a second group of people, group of people who have incomes from Which they could afford to meet their social responsibilities. They could afford it more easily if the tax burden were not so high. Members of this group to which I refer choose to use Medicare, choose to use public schools, choose to go to public hospitals and choose to arrange their affairs so that when they reach retirement, notwithstanding the fact that they could have afforded not to do so, they draw a publicly funded pension. And who pays for their Medicare treatment, for their hospital treatment, for schooling for their children and for their retirement incomes? Yes, they pay a bit, because they are taxpayers; but their relative tax burden is substantially reduced because there are in the community large numbers of people who are fighting to be self-reliant and achieving a degree of self- family. reliance. But their achievement of that goal is retarded and handicapped because those people who are in the third group, who want to be fully self-reliant and who are achieving a degree of self-reliance, are having to pay taxes to pay for others whose incomes are equal to theirs-in many instances higher than theirs-but who choose to use the, public sector provision of those social services, I think we need to turn our income tax system totally upside down. We need to say to people who support their children, who educate their children, who pay for their own health insurance and medical expenses and who provide for their own retirement incomes, 'We will exempt you from tax to the extent that you would have paid tax to fund those expenditures for you. Secondly, we will exempt you from the tax that you are now paying for others of similar and higher incomes who are using public sector social expenditure'. One of the problems of public sector social expenditure is that it is being met out of earnings-related payments, whereas a taxpayer who chooses to send his children to an independent school pays the fees for that school-the unit cost. The school does not impose charges on the basis of his income. It charges the unit cost. Similarly, for health expenditure, when one goes to a doctor or to a private hospital one pays the fee on a unit cost basis-not according to one's income. One might pool those risks and go into an insurance fund. One will pay the unit cost; one does not pay the premiums in accordance with one's income. If there were a group of middle and high income earning people in the community-and there are-which wanted to remain in an' earnings-related payment system for the education of their children, the payment of their health care costs and the provision of their retirement incomes, let them remain in it; but let that group bear the whole burden of the tax going into that pool. Leave me free from it if I choose to opt out and pay for the social responsibilities for myself and my own It is my hope that, as we move to restructure the tax system through the introduction of equitable, sensible goods and services taxes, the opportunity will be taken to give free release to those people who want to be self-reliant and who are capable of being self-reliant, if only the tax gatherer gets out of their way by giving them relief in the way that I have described. This Bill makes some changes to the personal income tax scale. It changes the rates scale. It reduces the lower rate to 20c. We have a rate of 38c, a rate of ,46c and a rate of 47c. I think it has gone the wrong way around. We are still taxing people with an income of $5,400. MrWright-No, we are not.",33
14,Mr WILSON,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"We are taxing people at a threshold of $5,400 and above. Mr Wright-Well, you just changed it.",34
15,Mr WILSON,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"No, we are taxing them from that figure of $5,400. That is lower than the pension rate. And yet we say to an individual whose only income is $5,400, 'Pay tax'. We go through a nonsense and a charade about incentive effects of rates of tax. I believe that the Government would have been much more sensible if it had increased the tax threshold to $10,500 and then had a marginal rate of 30c in the dollar. The person on $20,700 would have been paying the same tax as he is paying under this rate scale in this Bill, but everyone with incomes under $10,500 would have been exempt from tax and out of the tax system. We could have abolished a lot of the nonsense rebates that are put in there to focus on special interest groups-properly therebut ,I argue that, if it is good enough to give tax relief to a senior citizen coupleÂ· in their own fully paid for house, why should we tax the second earner in a family who has gone out to earn money to support her children from $5,400? Why should she not get a rebate to give her the same exemption as that given to her elderly parents? After all, she is not only supporting her children; she is also trying to support a mortgage with high interest rates on the home they are trying to establish for their children. That concept could have been introduced into this legislation, but it was not. Someone would say, 'Oh, that would have cost a lot of money'. Yes, we would have had to have made other adjustments, but we could have devised the system so that in macro terms the proposal I have put would have been revenue neutral. It would have been much more sensible to have done that. It would have simplified the tax system for a lot of people. It would have meant that a lot of pensioners who now put in income test returns and tax returns would have only had to put in one return. But no; the Australian Taxation Office, following its tradition, must go the most complex way. In this instance, it looks at the situation in tax terms only and does not look at it in relation to its interrelationship with the social security system. The other aspect of this Bill that I want to talk about this morning is that it creates a value for the tax-free threshold. I think it is important that there be a tax-free threshold. As I have said, I think it should be much higher than this Bill allows. The value of the tax-free threshold is $1,080 if one is facing a marginal rate of tax of 20c in the dollar. In the case of a household with a second income earner, it is equivalent, if the first income earner is facing a marginal tax rate of 38c in the dollar, to $2,052. If one is facing 46c it is worth $2,484, or if one is facing 47c in the dollar it is worth $2,538. I believe that system creates behavioural changes by taxpayers and I think. we should be looking far more closely at the impact of the tax system on households and at the economies within which Australians live. Some people live alone, some live with a spouse, some live with another adult, some live with dependent children. It is those economies whose capacity to pay tax should be assessed. But no; again our Treasury officials and tax officials do not appear to comprehend the issue of capacity to pay. If they do, their definition of capacity to pay is that it is a function of the individual's income. When we relate that to what I said earlier about the importance and the desirability of people meeting their own social expenditures, one has to come to the conclusion that the capacity of taxpayers to pay is a function not merely of the size of their income but also of the extent to which they are prepared to discharge their obligations to the rest of society by meeting their social expenditures. It isÂ· fair for society to say that those who can earn an income should meet those social expenditures, but if they do it should be recognised that that affects their capacity to pay tax. That is particularly so where, in meeting those social expenditures, they are meeting the social expenditures of people dependent upon them, whether a dependent spouse or dependent children. These days, in a mobile, intelligent society, people are moving in and out of different households and different personal relationships on a continual basis. Because of that mobility, once a person moves into one sort of relationship, he or she can be dependent on that household's income. When the person moves out of that relationship, he or she becomes dependent upon the public sector through unemployment benefits, supporting parents benefits or retirement incomes of one form or another. Where a taxpayer discharges the social expenditure which would otherwise have to be m-t by the public sector in a society that recognises that there must be a net minimum income to which everyone is entitled, the taxpayer who discharges those responsibilities should be given tax relief that is equal in amount to the cost to taxpayers in general if the dependent person becomes dependent on the public sector as distinct from being dependent on private sector expenditure. I now want to touch briefly on the way in which we perceive our tax system. This legislation assumes a progressive rate scale, with steps of $5,400, $27,000, $36,000 and $50,000 and rates of 20, 38, 46 and 47 per cent. But we could perceive the tax system as a flat rate tax system. If we look at it as a flat.Â· rate tax system, we could choose a number of alternatives. We could choose the top rate and say that the Commissioner of Taxation is entitled to collect 47c in the dollar from everyone. I think that is the wrong way to look at it, but it is the way governments often look at it. They assumeÂ· that a person's income belongs to the tax collector except to the extent that the tax collector leaves it with the income earner. I believe we should look at it the other way around- . that 100c in the dollar belongs to the income earner and that the tax gatherers, through governments, should properly justify the amount they collect. If we want to perceive our tax system as a flatÂ· rate system, I think it would be more appropriate to look at it as the rate which confronts the average weekly earner. In that instance we would have today a flat rate of 38c in the dollar. That would mean that every taxpayer would be in receipt of a rebate. Every taxpayer would receive a $2,052 non-cashable rebate, which at 38c in the dollar would create the tax-free threshold. Every taxpayer whose income is above $5,400 wouldreceiv,e an additional rebate of 18C; in the dollar up to a total of $3,060 rebate at $20,700 income. We could look at that as a tax .expenditure, a tax rebate. I do not believe it should be looked at as a tax expenditure, and I will take an opportunity on another occasion to speak in more detail about the inadequate way in which the Department of the Treasury is dealing with tax expenditures and the. arbitrariness of its approach. If we want to look at income tax as if it were a flat rate, all taxpayers are getting that rebate of $3,060 if their income is $20,700 or more; those with higher incomes, above $36,000 and $50,000, are paying a surcharge over and above the flat rate. , I hope that, as we look at this capacity to pay principle, we will recognise that any allowance, any rebate, that is in the tax system in acknowledgment of a person's capacity to pay, or the diminution of it, should not be treated as a tax expenditure; it should be treated as part of the underlying benchmark of the tax system. Therefore it is wrong for the Treasury to include in its tax expenditures the so-called cost of the spouse rebate. The tax system I described earlier would involve a huge shift in benefits and burdens. Perhaps in that way we should begin to look at our tax system on a lifespan basis. Furthermore-and this is my final point because timeÂ· is running out-it raises questions as to whether we should have age related tax regimes that could be used to phase in necessary changes to achieve a more equitable tax system that takes into account the need to provide retirement incomes .. It maybe necessary to phase them in over a 25-year period or 40-year period-however long is necessary. Just because the implementation of a long range policy is difficult for older generations does not mean that we should deny the reform to younger generations. I really believe that we must seriously look at that. All too often, when we are looking at retirement incomes, we say it cannot be done. It can, in my view, be achieved. Mr DEPUTY/SPEAKER (Ho-. M. J. R. MACKellar)-Order! The honourable gentleman's time has expired.",34
16,Mr WRIGHT,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"-;-1 welcome the changes that are being proposed in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.6). The main aspect I am interested in is the personal tax cuts that will come under the Income Tax (Rates) Act 1986, but I also support the amendments to the capital gains laws, particularly as they will ease the restrictions on the availtried ability of capital gains tax rollover relief. I note too that the amendments go to foreign debt reductions and franking credits and, in all, should be supported by all members of the House. As I said, my interest is mainly in the area of personal tax cuts. The comments made by the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson), though said with great sincerity, epitomised the misunderstanding and the lack of perception in the community about what has taken place in recent years. We constantly hear people berating the Government, saying it ought to reduce taxes and take some action to make things ,better for pensioners and low income people. During my contribution, I intend to place on the record, in facts and figures, just what has been done. The strategy of the Government has been to get rid of the loopholes that the Government of the honourable member for Sturt actually allowed-the loopholes that really characterised the tax system of this country. The strategy has been to make the Australian tax system fairer. It has also been aimed at trying to stop the abuse at the corporate level, and we know the sorts of discoveries that have been made by the Australian Se-urities Commission and other groups as they have delved into the behaviour of companies. The aim has also been to bring consistency and certainty into the provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act so that people know that they ought to pay a certain amount of money which everyone else will pay also, and they know that just because people have some sort of business down the road they will not be given special privileges. The strategy has also been to crack down on what are unfair deductions for fringe benefits, entertainment and theÂ· use of cars. As I have moved around my electorate and around Australia. I have found that most people appreciate that something has been done, but they are not quite sure what the actual result has been. I say that the real result, in simple terms, is that we have restitched the tax net in such a way as to stop people getting through it unfairly and illegally. We have to address avoidance and also evasion by citizens-whether they be pensioners, business people or just ordinary workers. Citizens have tax responsibilities and we have tried to address the techniques that have been used over and over again in an attempt to evade and avoid - x. . I return to the point about the understanding, or misunderstanding, that people have in relation to tax. In 1980 the tax threshold-in other words, the amount of money which people could earn before they paid any tax whatsoever-was $3,893. Under the new legislation it is $5,250 and it will rise to $5,400. It simply amazes me that we have a situation where a member of the Opposition gets up and attacks the Government for not making changes when the Opposition itself had a shocking reputation for what it did. The honourable member for Sturt talked about the need for other people to be able to earn more without having to pay tax. Let us look at pensioners. We are looking at thresholds-the amount of money that pensioners or unemployment beneficiaries, for that matter, can earn now without having to pay tax. In 1980 a single pensioner had no threshold tax advantage. In 1980 a married pensioner had no threshold tax advantage. In 1991, under this Government, a single pensioner will pay no tax unless he or she earns over $9,789-nd a married couple will be able to earn $8,217 each without paying tax. We have gradually, but consistently, improved the lot of the workers of this country, those people on retirement benefits, those on pensions and those who have been on government support systems over a long period. But somehow we need to get the message across to the community as to what has taken place. So I state: in 1990, for pensioners, no tax threshold benefits-in other words, on whatever a pensioner earned he or she faced a tax. In 1991, a single pensioner can earn $9,789 and a married pensioner, $8,217. In 1980 if a person was unemployed he or she had no tax exempt thresholdnothing. In 1991 if a person is 21 years old and is single he or she pays no tax on the first $7,274. Today, if a person is married and unemployed he or she pays no tax on $13,170. In 1980, under the Government to which the honourable member for Sturt belonged, there was no threshold whatsoever. I have heard so many people say that they are paying more tax. I have taken the time to get the figures as to what tax people have been paying over this last decade. I think they are worth placing on the record. The first case I present is that of a person earning $15,000. In 1980 a person earning $15,000 paid $3,673.08 in tax. In 1991 a person with the same income pays $1,998.75, a difference of almost $1,700 a year-in, excess of $30 dollars per week-less tax ,under this Government's tax system. People say, 'Look, $15,000 is nothing today; people earn $25,000'. Well, let us look at those earning $25,000. In 1980 a person who earned $25,000 paid $8,154.96 in tax. In 1991, under the Hawke Labor Government, that person earning $25,000 pays $4,949.75-$3,200 less per year. I turn to those earning an income of. $35,000. In 1980 a person earning that amount of ,money paid $13,111.72. Today, in 1991, under the Hawke Labor Government, that person pays $8,799.75-over $5,000 less. We hear members of the Opposition accuse the Government of not changing the system. The fact is that in 1980, if a person earned over $3,893 and up to $16,608, he paid a rate of 33.07 per cent in tax. If we jump from $16,608 to the next level of $33,000, we see that a person earning that income paid 47.07 per cent in tax. If a person earned over $33,000, he paid 61.07 per cent in tax. Let us look at what occurs today. A person earning between zero and $5,400 pays no tax. A person earning up to $20,700 pays 20 per cent in tax. A person earning up to $36,000-in other words, between $20,700 and the next level of $36,000pays 38 per cent in tax. With regard to that part of his income which is $36,000 and up to $50,000, a person pays 46 per cent in tax, and for every dollar of income over $50,000 he then pays 47 per cent in tax. The second range of tax under the Liberal-Nationals was 47 per cent. Our top range of tax under the Hawke Labor Government is 47 per cent. The examples I gave to the House on income earned demonstrate the tax savings that Australian people now enjoy because of the changes that t]:1is Government has made consistently over the eight years since it was, elected in 1983. So we need to put an end to the sort of nonsense, criticism and false perception in the community because of the false figures presented by members of the Opposition. I want to raise an issue, however, that argues for further changes. I want to refer specifically to the prescribed payments tax system, a system that is used in the building industry, a system that, I say to this House, has been rorted and prostituted for years, despite the efforts of the Hawke Labor Government. It was only 21f2 years ago that we changed the base tax rate from 15 per cent to 20 per cent. I am arguing now that that rate be increased to the average pay as you earn (P AYE) tax rate, which should be a minimum of 25 per cent. Possibly there is an argument, having talked to the building workers' unions and building trades groups, that there is a need to raise that prescribed payments tax to 30 per cent. ' The system works like this: if a person goes into a subcontracting arrangement, he can say to that contractor that he is under a prescribed payments tax system. So what the contractor then does is subtract from the amount of money he pays to that person whatever that tax rate is, which at the moment is 20 per cent. Ultimately, a person may be earning $60,000 or $70,000 on the job, which means he should pay 47 per cent. But people in the past have used false names, false tax file numbers and all sorts of falsity. They end up paying, not 20 per cent in many instances, but less, because of the system in the past when exemptions. were easily available. A person could simply argue that it was not fair to take 20 per cent of his money out of the payment .from the. contractor because thereÂ· were other costs and, therefore, he ought to have an exemption. The system is used by tilers, bricklayers, rock setters, painters, concreters, plumbers, roof tilers, roof fixers, earthmovers-in fact, by anyone within the building industry. Regrettably, it has been rorted by those in the building industry to the detriment of the fair dinkum, bona fide subcontractor. I have met with trade union groups in Queensland and with Treasury officials. I admit that there has been an effort to do something about the problem. Officers have visited building sites. In fact, I am told that on one site they visited there were something like 87 people paying prescribed payments tax; in other words, every employee on site was supposed to be a subcontractor. It is a nonsense situation. We need to change the rules. We need first and foremost to change the definition of the subcontractor. We then need to make sure that the employer, the prime contractor, becomes responsible for the tax. If only 20 per cent is taken out and the tax allocation should have been 47 per cent, then the contractor-the employer-ought to be made to pick up the other 27 per cent. There ought to be tough penalties on contractors as well because they are ripping off the Australian taxpayer. They are encouraging people to work outside the system, to work on weekends and under unsafe conditions, so that no compensationpayments are made and those em-Â· ployees are not covered by compensation. The cash in hand system or the black money system is used. The way in which the hourly rate system is used is just a mockery. They are using a flat system. There is no holiday pay, there are no tool allowances, there is no public liability on sites, and there is no payroll tax paid to the States. Hundreds of millions of dollars are being lost at the State and Commonwealth level because of this system. People go even further. I came across the case of a fellow splitting his income with his wife. His wife has a full-time job at Woolworths in Brisbane, yet he splits the income with his wife, he claims for an office in the back of his house and he claims for his pet dog as a guard dog. He is doing pretty well under the tax system because he is on P AYE. These fellows are cheating the system and they are doing it at great cost to the community. Regrettably, there are 50,000 of them, as estimated by the building union groups, and 300,000 in Australia, who are part of this system. We need to level the structure so that the tax paid under the prescribed payments tax system has relativity to the P AYE system, under which every other worker has to pay tax. They have to pay weekly; in fact, they have to pay daily. It even comes back to the hours worked. People pay tax on moneys earned. We need to target those who are rorting the system and I intend to make known to the Treasurer (Mr Keating) the names of some companies that I believe are party to the rort. We need also to ensure that the taxation system reviews its practices and its processes and introduces as a matter of urgency a specific questionnaire so that anyone applying for prescribed payments tax exemption or advantages ought to fill in and be bound by in law as to what they say are the answers. The application ought to be in writing. The exemption should actually be applied for. It is amazing that one can virtually ring up, then go to the post office, obtain a form, send it in and this special exemption applies immediately. . We' also need at the tax level for our investigators to be trained in building industry practices. More importantly, we need to ensure that there are random checks on sites, because the deterrent is getting caught-the risk of being caught. If the fellows using the system know that they could get caught, they are going to be more careful; in fact, I would hope that they would abide by the law. Importantly, we need to change the rules as to the quantum, as to the amount of tax that is deducted initially. As I said, there is an argument for going at least to 25 per cent instead of the existing 20 per cent, but there is a strong argument also to go to 30 per cent. We do not want to destroy the concept of the prescribed payments tax because it is a valuable instrument used by the bona fide subcontractors. After all, they will take a contract price that includes a lot of material and they ought not be taxed on the material. They ought to be taxed on their profit or their labour content. We need to streamline it. We need to go back over it and shave it, not just at the edges, but internally, to clean up the system. It could mean a lot of money for this nation. When the changes were made, I think in 1987-88, the Treasurer said that there was a revenue gain of some $200m for the people of Australia simply by lifting the tax rate from 15 per cent to 20 per cent. I would suspect, having listened to people within the industry, and understanding the massive spread of the practice, that this could in fact mean an additional $100m to $200m for the Government and therefore for the people of Australia. It is affecting not just the Commonwealth but the States, as I said, because of the non-payment of payroll tax and compensation payments. But really, it affects the ordinary worker. It seriously affects those who are the fair dinkum workers, who try to stick by union rules or by award arrangements. It undercuts the bona fide contractors because the contractor using prescribed payments tax arrangements for their employees or pseudo employees are able to tender a lower price. We have seen the situation, whether it be in the painting, building or any other type of area, where many a contractor, many a business, is hurt financially because the competitor is using the prescribed payments system to lower the tender price and gain the job. Everyone ultimately loses except the contractor. We need to change the system in the interests of this country. My final comments relate to the consumption tax. I make a plea to the parties opposite to reconsider their position on the consumption tax. It is going to have an unbelievable impact on families, on pensioners, on low income earners, and on people living outside the metropolitan area, particularly because of the freight component. It is going to have an unrealised impact on people living in rural areas, and on the general family. People do not understand just what it is going to mean in terms of price escalation, because it will be used first as a camouflage by retailers who want to up the ante, up the price, and they will blame the system. They will say that the price rises are because of the government tax, the consumption tax. But it is also going to blowout the quality of life. It is going to cause such cost blow-outs that the quality of life of Australians is going to be very much diminished and eroded. People have not appreciated that the concept put forward by the Liberals and Nationals means that if a person gets his car fixed, every level of activity in fixing that car is going to have a special tax imposed on it. There will be a special tax on the spare parts; there will be a special tax when the mechanic puts them in the car. Even when a car is picked up from the scene of an accident by the Royal Automobile Club of Queensland or whatever agency, that process will have a special tax imposed on it. There will be a tax imposed at every possible level and it will be the ordinary people who will pay that tax. I believe the National Party of Australia, particularly, needs to be condemned for supporting this proposal, because it is selling out its specific constituency: it is selling out rural Australia; it is selling out those retired people, those on fixed incomes and pensions, who live in those country areas. I ask that it rethinks its position in the interests of the impact it will have on the people that it is supposed to represent.",36
17,Mr TAYLOR,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"It is with pleasure that I rise to support my colleagues on this side of the House, the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) and the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson), particularly with regard to a number of comments that they made, firstly, in the area of taxation, about Government ineptitude-and they were the words used very strongly by the honourable member for Curtin. Secondly, I would like to reinforce comments about bureaucratic complexity and finally about individual frustration and confusion in the area of taxation law. Despite what the honourable member for Capricornia(Mr Wright) had to say, I will also be saying a little about the virtues of a goods and services tax in relation to the overall taxation regime. First, let me just say a little about taxation and the rule of law. Then I would like to say a little about three of the requirements that I see, and I hope many will see, are the requirements essential to a taxation system, and those requirements are of simplicity, of efficiency, and of equity. I would like to relate some of those requirements to specific comments in a number of areas. Finally, as I say, I will offer some comments on the Opposition's alternative to the system that we have at the moment. The rule of law, it seems to me, is basic to Australia's democratic way of life. It is the principle by which we accept and obey laws passed by this Parliament, and by which governments enforce those laws in an even-handed and non-capricious manner to the limit of those laws. It is not always recognised that our taxation system is part of the legal process. As such, it should be obeyed, firstly, by all institutions and citizens who are protected by that legal system and, secondly and very importantly, by the revenue authorities. Tax evasion on the one hand and overzealous collectors acting beyond the law on the other are equally unacceptable in the eyes of the law. In his book, The Rule of Law, Geoffrey Walker says: Probably no branch of law illustrates the current abuse and breakdown of legislative power better than revenue law. This uninspiring and commonplace part of our legal system, precisely because it is so pervasive and affects almost everybody in society, shows better than almost any other the progression of legislative escalation followed by public resistance, followed in turn by further islative threats, whereby a legal system meanders towards collapse. Walker goes on to point out that the tax system has changed this country's social values through the sheer weight of the tax burden and the combination of progressive income tax scales and continuing inflation. He notes the use of retrospectivity and administrative discretions to deal with real or imagined legislative difficulties and the overcoming of difficulties in the application of the literal interpretation of statutes by means of administrative ingenuity. He concludes that we are now at a crucial point of the rule of law. I agree with the thrust of his comments and urge this Parliament and the bureaucracy to take steps to reaffirm that rule of law in this Australian way of life. Another side to the rule of law is that rules imposed on society must be recognised by its members as regulating their conduct with one another and within that society. To this end, the laws, firstly, should be able to be clearly understood and obeyed and, secondly, they need to be able to be applied with some certainty. Tax law, particularly as exemplified by the Income Tax Assessment Act, has become so complex that the average citizen is in danger of ignoring it. For example, the record-keeping required to conform to the capital gains provisions of that Act is either not understood or is beyond the knowledge of the average taxpayer. To understand and obey the regulations requires the services of a professional skilled in interpreting. While there may be some short term advantages for accountants in this situation, in the long term, the disadvantages to the community are clear. This Parliament, the Executive, and once again the Public Service and the bureaucrats must set an example to the community by ensuring that tax legislation, its application and enforcement conform to that rule of law. Adam Smith in his Wealth of Nations laid down certain rules in regard to taxation which, I would suggest, are basically applicable today. The rules are that contribution should be in proportion to respective abilities; that tax should be legcertain, and not arbitrary; that tax should be levied at the time or in the manner most convenient for the contributor; and that the cost of administration of the tax should be minimal. These rules, it seems to me, find their modern counterpart in the requirement that the tax system be, as I said in my opening remarks, equitable, simple and efficient. It seems to me that the inefficiencies and complexities of our taxation system are contributing to our continuing economic problems, whether in our poor savings performance, the overseas loans trap, poverty traps or whatever. I refer the House to a very interesting article by Glenda Korporaal in the Bulletin of 3 July last year. In the article titled 'Is the revolution going too far too fast', she summarised the situation by saying: After five years of Paul Keating's unfinished revolution in the taxing of Australia, the Governlion, ment is billions better off. For taxpayers it different story. Hit by the widening net taxman and bewildered by the complexities the system, many feel it has all gone too far. Contrary to some reports, Australians going to have to live with tax returns many years to come and .they will never be free of the burden of having to make an annual calculation of their tax liability. The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) , to its credit, does recognise that this revolucuts tion has caused problems-and not insiga nificant ones. It is pushing for simpler returns and some easing of penalties people who innocently get their tax retotally turns wrong. Again, to his credit, the Treasurer has called for recommendations on how to simplify that tax law. The constant barrage of changes and ever-widening reach of the Tax Office making life very tough for many taxpayAustralian ers. Since 1985, when the Treasurer emvolume barked on his program of tax reform, changes have been massive. We have had some 16,000 pages of legislation, Tax fice rulings, and court cases on tax issues. Not only have the tax laws changed draThere matically; there have also been changes in schedules, the introduction of capital gains and fringe benefits tax, the expansion of legislation, sales tax, dividend imputation, and a volThere ume of new rules on superannuation. The through administration of tax collection undergone very large and very substantial alterations. There has been the move towards full self-assessment, the absolute necessity of retaining receipts and the keeping of records and log books, and the increasing application of tax file numbers. On top of this we have seen a huge shake-up in the running of the Tax Office under the direction of Commissioner Boucher. . I have to say that these changes have been extremely lucrative for the Hawke Administration. In the financial year 198889, it raked in more then $47 billion in income tax revenue from individuals a rise of 131f2 per cent on the year bef-re, and another $1 billion in fringe benefits which was a little over 12 per cent up othe previous year. In 1990 it is estimated that somewhere in the region of $51 bilplus in excess of $1 billion in fringe is a benefits tax and another $885 million from of the a new taxation on super.annuation funds of will be going to the Government's coffers-a total of about $53 billion. That is are more then double the $23 billion which for the Federal Government was making from income in 1982-83 when the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) took over. It represents an average annual increase of 16 per cent, despite in tax rates. That, of course, makes nonsense of some of the comments that the honourable member for Capricornia for was making when he seemed to become preoccupied with income tax scales rather then some of these issues of simplicity and complexity. The cost has also created widespread confusion and concern among taxpayers, are tax agents and even workers within the Taxation Office about the sheer and complexity of coping with the the changes. For example, Phillip Read, a partner in the Melbourne firm of Smith OfRead, in the June edition of the Australian Accountant is reported as saying: seems to be a lack of common sense being applied to the legislation and the way they administer the legislation. There have been huge changes in what is taxable. The substantiation capital gains tax, fringe benefits tax. is a huge amount of legislation to get and understand-particularly the capital has also gains tax. It's a nightmare'. The principle is very simple but, when you get down to the nitty-gritty, it's very difficult. He goes on to say, 'Too much, too fast, too complex . . . '. He is reported further as saying: The logistics of keeping up to date with the torrent of new legislation and press releases in order to communicate accurate advice to clients have been mind-boggling. The costs of training oneself and one's staff have grown steadily over the years. The article further reports him as saying that the stress of coping with all the changes 'has been simply too destructive'. He says: As a result, many practitioners of 15 and 20 years' standing are selling their practices. The article asks: If the accountants are having problems, how is the average person going to cope? Michael Croker, spokesman for the Institute of Chartered Accountants, is quoted in the Bulletin article as saying: The Tax Pack was a first class effort. Indeed, I agree that it was a first-class effort. He continued: But, without a fundamental simplification of the tax law and tax administration, their efforts are always going to come up against problems. Gerry Allen, the Institute's President, is quoted as saying: Tax Pack looks simple but taxpayers should remember that tax law is not simple at all. While Tax Pack is a positive move by the ATO, there is a danger that taxpayers may relyÂ· too heavily on it in dealing with the myriad of taxation issues that can arise. Any taxpayer with a few shares, running a small business or with any non-wage income, will still require professional advice if he wants to be sure his rights are being protected. For the Australian taxpayer who these days more often than not resorts to a consultant for help of some kind with the tax form-apparently something like 70 per cent of returns are prepared by tax agentsthe whole process has become much more complicated and risky than ever before. Many people do not know it, but the statutory penalties for making errors and incorrect statements on these forms are indeed very high. According to the law, a guilty taxpayer can be liable to pay as much as 200 per cent on the tax avoided. If a person understates his tax by, say, $1,000, he can be liable for a $2,000 penalty plus the $1,000 in back tax. The ATO has issued a ruling that it is working on much lower penalties of around 40 to 50 per cent. But the Tax Institute of Australia, with some 10,000 members representing accountants and lawyers who advise taxpayers, complained that the threat of a 200 per cent penalty is always present when the ATO is negotiating with a taxpayer who is being audited. Indeed, Geoff Peters son, the technical director of the Institute, is reported in the Bulletin article as saying: It is not the size of the penalties that is new. With the shift to self-assessment, taxpayers are more likely to find themselves in situations where they can be fined. The 200 per cent was always there. But it applied in relation to [the old] assessment scheme. Self-assessment shifts a lot of the burden on to the taxpayer. It's all very well to do that but the 200% penalty is unrealistic. It's too harsh on taxpayers who have to operate within the complexities of the system. One other aspect of which was mentioned in an article in the Australian Financial Review on 4 January this year-",40

20,Mr REITH,INFLATION,"My question is to the Treasurer. Yesterday he said that we had to have a recession to get inflation down. Given the massive increase in inflation in the December quarter, the largest quarterly increase for many years, how much worse does the recession have to get before we can get inflation down?",43
21,Mr KEATING,INFLATION,"Obviously the Deputy Leader of the Opposition does not understand some of the influences in today's consumer price index (CPI). I said at the last press conference I had in September that this would be a much higher figure, mainly as a result of the price of oil coming from the Gulf. As well as that, there were substantial increases in government charges in the main State government charges: The underlying inflation rate has actually declined, from 5.6 per cent in the September quarter to 5.4 per cent for the year to the Dec-mbe- qu.arter s.o the underlying rate of mflatlOn IS commg dow-. That is why, when the Deputy Leader dId an interview earlier today, people were putting numbers to him about the decline in inflation, mentioning the number of 4 per cent plus, et cetera. But I notice that this was his response: I'd like to see some greater independence for the Reserve Bank to take on, to tackle inflation. I'd like to see the Government scrap the accord. In other words, he would prefer higher interest rates for longer. He would let the Reserve Bank of Australia, without a wages policy, rip the economy to shreds. That is what that means; it can mean nothing else. Then he said: I think these wages tax deals have clearly failed. We then have Senator Short saying: The Government's attempt to con the electorate about lower inflation . . . He refers to conning the electorate about lower inflation! In Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries, the inflation rate is running, from memory, at 7.4 per cent. We have the United Kingdom at 9.9 per cent and rising, the United States at 6.2 per cent and rising, and we are coming down. Our underlying rate is just about half that of Britain, and yet we are conning the electorate. Senator Short goes on: . . . and their highly political wage tax trade-offs were nothing more than misleading opportunistic stunts. In this quarter we are living in there will be no wage increases as a result of the wage-tax deal which the Governm-nt concluded around the 0.7 per cent mcrease for the September quarter, yet this is supposed to be a stunt involving the national inflation outcome. What is wrong with these fellows opposite? They do not have any idea. Mr Downer-How many more times will you come back with excuses?",43
22,Mr SPEAKER,INFLATION,Order! The honourable member for Mayo!,44
23,Mr KEATING,INFLATION,"They do not want the Australian Council of Trade Unions saying it will trade off wages for a tax cut; they prefer to see the 0.7 and before that the inflation rate of the previous quarter in the numbers now, which would have seen today's figure at well over 3 per cent. Their remedy is to give the Reserve Bank the right to tackle inflation. But how can we tackle inflation, if we are using a monetary authority, other than with higher interest rates for longer? Yet, they are up there saying that interest rates ought to be lower and the recession should not be here. They have the gall to be saying that the Reserve Bank should take on and tackle inflation. The duplicity of the Opposition on this issue is unbelievable. When this Government reduced interest rates in January 1990-the Opposition has been talking about the recession all week-in February the Leader of the Opposition asked, 'Why the sudden urgency of a reduction in rates in February 1990?'. He said: Australians will know that policy has again been manipulated to political ends. He thinks that we reduced interest rates in January 1990 for political ends. He went on: If interest rates can be put down with no justification prior to the election they will just as easily be put up again after it. They were not put down without justification prior to the election. They were put down 13 months ago because we needed to take rates off in the economic interests of this country. We did not just put them up, as the Leader of th- Opposition stated, just after the electlOn. On 15 February he said: The announcement today that the Reserve Bank will further ease monetary policy to achieve a further modest reduction in official interest rates is another blatant political act. He is now saying that we should not be in a recession, but he opposed the rate reductions which were engineered to avoid it. He goes on to say: It begs the question really as to whether it is a political decision. Indeed, It-nk it begs the question of whether there isn't a deal lurking behind this. On 23 January, 13 months ago, the day I actually announced a reduction in the high levels of interest rates, the Leader of Opposition said: Today's move to begin lowering them is a election ploy. In other words, he resisted every reducdigit tion in interest rates which he now says should have been made earlier to avoid the recession. But at the time he appalling political statements out. He said: Mr Keating is' pushing the pace of interest rate perience? reduction simply to suit his electoral time.",44
24,Dr HEWSON,INFLATION,Are you blaming us?,45
25,Mr KEATING,INFLATION,"I blame the Leader of tion. the Opposition for being a fraud, and for being duplicitous. He has made one stateought ment after another blackguarding the Government's reductions of interest rates in January and February 1990 as political stunts, but today he says that we should not have a recession and rates should have been eased earlier. When they were first eased he said that they were political stunts. Today he has his deputy saying that it ought to be left to the Reserve Bank to leave interest rates up higher longer because only the Reserve Bank, not a wage-tax deal, should reduce inflation. The fact is that the Leader of the Opporeductions? sition does not have credibility on this issue. That is why all the thinking people in Australian business know that the Opcredibility position has no anti-inflation strategy. The Leader of the Opposition knows that he would never have committed his name to a monetary policy of the strength and integrity we committed ourselves to. He would not have released the rates after the election. He said in that press stateMinister: ment that he expected rates to rise after the election. They fell by five percentage points after the election. How credible he? In February 1990 the Leader of the Opposition, talking about inflation, said: Australia will be looking down the barrel ble digit inflation by the end of 1990. The inflation rate at the end of 1990 was 6.9 per cent, not double digit inflation. How credible is the Leader of the Oppoport sition? He works on the basis that some door-stops are never followed up, that nothing he says is ever checked or repeated. He is cavilling at interest rate reductions as political stunts, suggesting that the interest rates were going to go up after the election. In fact, they went down by prefive percentage points. The Professor then says that we are going to have double inflation by the end of 1990. God help it when his students start wreaking their economic havoc on the rest of us if put these that is the best he can do. Mr MCGauran-What about your ex",45
26,Mr KEATING,INFLATION,"I obviously learned them better than the rest of the Opposi- I As for this simplistic nonsense that we to have lower inflation now and can have it by letting the Reserve Bank leave interest rates higher for longer, all that is duplicitous rubbish. If the Opposition believes in flattening the place, burning it to pieces, then it should say so. It should not try to hide behind code words such as, 'I would like to see greater independence for the Reserve Bank'. Does the Leader of the Opposition think that the Reserve for Bank did not comply with all the increases in interest rates? Of course it did. Does he think it did not comply with the Of course it did. He would have left the rates up and burned the place to a cinder. That is why he has no and that is why he will stay in opposition after the next poll. NA NA",45
27,Mr MARTIN,EXPENDITURE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Finance. I ask the is he aware of calls for substantial further reductions in government expenditure and, if so, what regard has the is Government had for such calls?",45
28,Mr WILLIS,EXPENDITURE,"Can I say firstly that I am aware of Opposition calls for us to of doufurther reduce government expenditure. There have been varying such calls. The top one that I noted was the embrace last year of the Institute of Public Affairs recalling for a cut of $12 billion in government expenditure, or another 3 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), this despite the fact that this Government has already reduced government expenditure by 6 per cent of GDP in our period of office, and reduced the public sector in Australia to one of the smallest in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries. Despite calling for these big cuts in ernment expenditure in the abstract, when it comes to the acid test of supporting . particular proposals, the Opposition goes to water. We have seen that in relation to such matters as the Moomba gas pipeline when, despite embracing privatisation in the abstract, when it came to supporting the legislation which would put this enterprise on a commercial basis and make it possible to be sold for a decent price, the Opposition could not face up to it; it opposed it, and thereby knocked at least $700m off the Budget surplus and, because it is treated as a negative outlay, ensured that outlays were $700m higher. Similarly, although Opposition members say that they support the targeting of welfare, when it comes to the acid test of supporting the imposition of an assets test on the family allowance, they opposed it, and in so doing rolled the Leader of the Opposition, who had declared his support for it. That knocked $50m off the Budget surplus this year and $100m in a full year. So we have these two quite important examples. Today, in a much smaller way moneywise, but most significantly nevertheless, we have the latest example of the Opposition's inability to give effect to its oric, and the inability of its leadership to carry the party with it on contentious cost-cutting issues. According to today's Age, the shadow Cabinet has decided to join the Australian Democrats in disallowing regulations to enable the Australian War Memorial here in Canberra to charge a $3 fee to view its galleries, whilst retaining free access to other parts of the memorial. This in itself is an amazing decision. It comes after the War Memorial council unanimously decided to levy this charge so 'as to have adequate funds to preserve its collection, to hold exhibitions, and to increase its research and development facilities. In so doing it was being utterly responsible. It was sensibly using a user pays criterion, which the Opposition espouses as being a proper way to go. Here Opposition members were faced with a concrete example: they could not face up to it. The Opposition leadership clearly gov- thought this was the right way to go, because the chairperson of the War Memorial council, Dame Beryl Beaurepaire-a long-time official of the Victorian Liberal Party-properly contacted the Opposition leadership before announcing the fee, and according to today's Age: Dame Beryl said she had rung Dr Hewson and the National Party leader, Mr Fischer, before announcing the fee. Both had raised no complaint. Dr Hewson's exact words were 'jolly good thing', she said. Tim Fischer said, 'that's a good idea'.",45

31,Mr WILLIS,EXPENDITURE,"Understandably, Dame Beryl was somewhat perplexed by this. She said: It is against the normal Liberal principle of user pays, one of the basic tenets of our party, so I find it very extraordinary. What is even more extraordinary, according to this article, is that: Dr Hewson wrote to Dame Beryl yesterday, saying he told her only that the coalition's 'natural disposition' was to support the user-pays principle. rhetBut after consideration, the Opposition believed that fees would 'run counter to the ideals that inspire it', he wrote. The article continues: A spokesman for Mr Fischer said he had told Dame Beryl that, although he could understand the financial needs of the memorial, he did not agree with fees.",46

35,Mr SPEAKER,EXPENDITURE,I warn the honourable member for Mayo.,47
36,Mr WILLIS,EXPENDITURE,"Quite clearly, both the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the National Party were rolled in the shadow Cabinet, presumably by the shadow Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Senator Newman, who announced the shadow Cabinet decision yesterday. Senator Newman ranks No. 20 in the Opposition's published list of shadow Ministers and is not even in the shadow Cabinet. Presumably she turns up for issues that reflect her responsibilities. So there are two lessons to be learned from all this: firstly, the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the National Party obviously have no control of their parties or of their shadow Cabinet; and, secondly, when the Opposition tells us it would slash government expenditure by so many billion, we should all have a good horse laugh because it cannot even support a proposal to impose a museum fee and raise $lm.

37,Mr TIM FISCHER,INFLATION,"The Minister for Finance is wrong. He was talking about the Australian War Memorial-a national symbol. My question is directed to the Treasurer. Yesterday in answer to my question he said that nothing went wrong with his attempt to get inflation down. Even allowing for the petrol price increase factor, which makes up only part of the consumer price index increase announced this day, I ask him again: what went wrong?",47

42,Mr LEE,CASUALTIES,"The Prime Minister, of course, would be aware of Iraqi claims that allied aircraft are deliberately targeting schools, hospitals and residential areas. Can the Prime Minister provide the House with any information on the number of civilian casualties caused by allied bombing?",47
43,Mr HAWKE,CASUALTIES,"I do not know, and there is certainly no-one in this country or amongst the allied nations who knows, how many civilian casualties have been caused by allied bombing. I have seen no definitive estimates from any source throughout the daily briefings I have received on the war. Clearly, Iraq will publish whahwer figures suit its propaganda purposes at the time. Mr Speaker, its earlier casualty figures, you will recall, were very low indeed. It is now publishing much higher figures. I doubt that either set of figures has any particular relation to the truth. I have no doubt at all that some innocent civilians have been killed and injured as a result of allied bombing since 17 January. Of course, that saddens me, as I know it does all honourable members of this House. But, while it saddens me, it does not surprise me. We feared that many innocent civilians and blameless soldiers on both sides would be killed in this war, and that is why this Government and the other allied nations accepted war only as a last resort. We said this war would be tragic, and it is. We have supported military action only because the alternative, that is, appeasing .Saddam Hussein, would have promised an even greater tragedy. Clearly, the allies have an overwhelming obligation to keep civilian casualties to a complete minimum, and I believe that the allies are meeting that obligation. I have been personally assured by President Bush-and he put it as a matter of conscience-that United States forces are not targeting civilians, and I accept those assurances. It is evident that allied bombing is directed at clear military and strategic objectives and is conducted so as to minimise civilian casualties. Finally, I remind those who claim some sort of moral equivalence between the Iraqi regime and the allies that not only has Sad dam Hussein targeted civilians deliberately in his missile attacks on Saudi Arabia and Israel, he must also bear responsibility for Iraq's civilian casualties. This is his war alone and he alone is prolonging it. NA",47
44,Dr HEWSON,INFLATION,"My question without notice is to the Prime Minister. I remind the Prime Minister that yesterday the Treasurer effectively admitted again that he had engineered a recession in order to get inflation down. On the basis of today's data he is again clearly wrong. He has offered no explanation for his failure in the House today. Indeed, he has gone so far as to make light of it. I repeat my question: when is the Prime Minister going to sack the Treasurer?",48
45,Mr HAWKE,INFLATION,"Both yesterday and today, the Treasurer effectively answered the questions that were put to him. Yesterday, not only did the Leader of the Opposition put inflation in but he included there the question of the current account, and in that respect, as well as employment, the facts are still as the Treasurer put them yesterday. That is that in regard to the current account, the position is that at the time when he delivered the Budget last year, he delivered a Budget forecast of a current account deficit of $18 billion. The policies have been sufficiently successful to make it clear that we will come in well within that $18 billion. The figure for the six months to December shows a current account deficit at $8.1 billion. This clearly comes well within the Budget forecast on that account. In regard to the level of Treasurer said yesterday, and as he has repeated today, we will come in on target. Indeed, I would have thought it should have been a matter of joy and comfort for all people in this House, whether they sit on the Government side or on the other side, that we are able to stand up and say-and you are able to acknowledge it-that the underlying rate of inflation in this country is at the lowest point that it has been since the recorded data has been kept. In those circumstances, Mr Speaker, I think you will understand the irrelevance and stupidity of the suggestion that I should seek the resignation of the Treasurer. NA  to the Prime Minister and concerns the post-Gulf war period. Will the Government pursue, as a matter of high priority, a settlement of the tragic and prolonged civil war in Lebanon as part of the intended post-Gulf war international deliberations for a lasting Middle East peace?",48
46,Mr HAWKE,LEBANON,"I thank the honourable member for his question and I am pleased to acknowledge his consistent and deep concern with this very important question. It is clear that once the Gulf crisis is resolved, the international community will have not just an opportunity but, in our judgment, a very heavy obligation to address the other causes of instability in the Middle East. The efforts that have already been begun by the Lebanese people give considerable grounds for optimism that major progress on Lebanon's fundamental constitutional and political problems can in fact be achieved. The Taif accord, agreed by an overwhelming majority of the Lebanese parliamentarians in October 1989 and welcomed by this Government, as the honourable member will recall, sets out a new Lebanese national charter. It provides for sharing equally political power between Muslims and Christians in an enlarged parliament. It also provides a framework for the withdrawal of Syrian forces, from Lebanon and the extension of the Lebanese Government's authority throughinflation, as the out the country. I think it is comforting to us all to know that since the Taif accord was signed in October 1989, some considerable progress has already been achieved. I go to three issues. Firstly, a new government has been formed. Secondly, the security has been formed. Secondly, the security situation in Beirut bas been stabilised with the withdrawal of various militia groups. Finally, the Government has extended to a considerable extent its authority to southern Lebanon by moving army units there. But, having said that, we must say that despite the Taif agreement and that progress to which I have alluded which has been made under the agreement, very serious problems remain. We have the continued presence in Lebanon of both Syrian and Israeli forces and we have a situation of attacks and retributio'n between the Palestine Liberation Organisation and Israeli forces in Lebanon. These destabilising factors underline that while the Taif agreement is a major step in the right direction, foreign intervention still plagues Lebanon and makes it still the tragic country. In those circumstances I conclude by saying that there is a responsibility on all countries, not least upon Australia, to support international efforts to assist in the further implementation of the Taif agreement once a more settled environment is created with the removal of Iraq from Kuwait. I can assure the honourable member that Australia will certainly provide such support. NA NA",48
47,Mr DOWNER,AUSTRALIA,"Bow is it that the Treasurer was unaware of the possible collapse of the State Bank of South Australia during last year-well in advarice of the announcement by Premier Bannon on 12 February-given that the bank was providing monthly, quarterly and annual reports on its financial position to the Reserve Bank of Australia, that a Reserve Bank officer was posted full time in the head office of the State Bank and that it took J.P. Morgan only nine days to report the magnitude of the problem to the South Australian Government?",49
48,Mr KEATING,AUSTRALIA,"The first point to make is that the State Bank has not collapsed. That is the vicious import of the honourable member's question. The honourable member .represents a South Australian constituency yet he has charged that the State Bank, probably the largest operating bank in South Australia, has collapsed. That is the extent of his responsibility in putting the question. However, I do not expect much better.",49

50,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIA,Order! There is far too much noise in the chamber.,49
51,Mr KEATING,AUSTRALIA,"I said yesterday that the whole notion that bank supervision is about banks avoiding loss producing loans is not the point at all. Bank supervision is about losses impacting upon depositors. No amount of supervision can protect a bank or a bank management from losses if the nature of the deals being done is such that loans have been imprudently undertaken. I made the point yesterday and I will make it again today: while there is voluntary compliance by State banks with the liquidity ratios of the Reserve Bank, under the Banking Act they are not Banking Act banks. The Reserve Bank can doÂ· things to banks covered by the Banking Act which it cannot possibly do to banks that are owned by State governments. The Reserve Bank has no right to put managers or auditors into State-owned banks. Let me remind honourable members of what the Governor of the Reserve Bank said in a speech in April 1990 on aspects of the Reserve Bank's supervisory function. He said: However, contrary to some impressions, we do not guarantee the ongoing operations of banks. Our prime objective is to protect banks' depositors. In extremis we could assume control of a bank in trouble. The Banking Act also provides that in the event of a wind-up repayment of deposits in Australia be given priority over all other liabilities. In a sense shareholders are expected to look after themselves, caveat investor. We are not charged with protecting banks from losing moneyDid honourable members get that? The Reserve Bank is not charged with protecting banks from losing moneyor from acting recklessly in the belief that the authorities will bail them out. Losses are always regrettable, but as long as they are not so large as to threaten the interests of depositors or the stability of the banking system, they db not indicate a failure of supervision. In the ultimate, any bank on the verge of failure-and I hasten to say that we have none of these-could exit the industry in what we hope would be an orderly and timely manner which avoided losses to depositors and instability of the rest of the banking system. They are the key points: losses are regrettable, but as long as they are not so large as to threaten the interests of depositors-Mr Downer-You are not answering the question.",49
52,Mr KEATING,AUSTRALIA,"The speech continued: Shareholders are expected to look after themselves. We are not charged with protecting banks from losing money . . . The point of the question is that, because report they were voluntarily complying with Reserve Bank guidelines, they should not be in this position. That was the point of the question, and the question is put down. Mr Downer-You did know.",50
53,Mr KEATING,AUSTRALIA,"About me, when did I know? I had the first inkling of problems in the State Bank of South Australia from the Premier on 31 January-the only inkling-and to the extent that the Reserve Bank may have been involved in a process of voluntary compliance with the State Bank of South Australia-Mr Downer-Nonsense.",50

56,Mr KEATING,AUSTRALIA,"It is all right throwing around those remarks under privilege. fact of the matter is I did not know until 31 January. The fact is: why should the Reserve Bank be particularly giving me, cheek by jowl, week by week, indications of the performance-asset position of the multiplicity of banks in this country? That is its job. It is set up under Acts of Parliamates ment. The Reserve Bank Act and the in banking Acts are Acts of Parliament where the power is vested in the Reserve Bank board. But what J. P. Morgan has done is to take some account of what it thinks the collateral value of those loans in current market, in respect of real estate in particular, and come to a judgment about the provisioning for losses.",50

61,Mr SPEAKER,MIDDLE EAST,The member for Dundas will cease interjecting.,50
62,Mr LINDSAY,MIDDLE EAST,that the cost of Australia's Gulf deployment will be twice Senator Ray's initial estimate. I ask the Minister: is this Australian Financial first and Review report accurate?,50
63,Mr BILNEY,MIDDLE EAST,"I do not always agree with Senator Ray about everything. I think his choice of football clubs leaves a great deal to be desired. But I have not too often heard it said that he gets his numbers wrong, and his numbers on this ocare very much correct. I did see that piece and I was amazed that someshould say that he had got this particular number wrong. The announcement that Senator Ray made yesterday was that the total additional cost of our Gulf deployment over 12 months would amount The to $96.4m. Those costs will be incurred over the next three years with the bulk of them, $68m, falling within the present financial year. The figures for the next two years are $24m and $3m. Mr Lague in his piece goes on to refer accurately to Senator Ray's earlier estiof the cost of our deployment being the vicinity of $50m for the first six months. Now, discerning as they are, honourable members will be able to work out the difference between an estimate for is six months and ohe for 12 months. So the the estimate of $50m for six months equates to an estimate of $100m for 12 months, and the Cabinet submission which has been prepared by the Department of Defence puts that figure at $96.4m. That means that Senator Ray has an accuracy rating of around 96.4 per cent, rather higher than Mr Lague's. NA NA",50

Given that statement of the definition of the role of the Reserve Bank, why did the Reserve Bank enter into the current arrangements for prudential supervision of State banks if, as the Treasurer asserted yesterday and today, by narrowing the definition of the Reserve Bank's role, those arrangements are ineffective in alerting the Treasurer and the Reserve Bank topotential fi-ancial difficulties and their repercussions for the financial system as a whole?",51

The notion is that the supervision stops the production of losses. This is not right. With Banking Act banks, the Reserve Bank can put auditors in and can get a much closer idea of what is happening. In the event that there is a problem, if a bank has to be disposed of, it is done quickly and the Reserve Bank virtually takes it over, as it did with the Bank of Adelaide in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

Overall, at this stage it is a little early predict what will happen as far as the impact of the Gulf war on inbound tournumber ism to Australia is concerned, although some preliminary surveying by the Austhe tralian Tourist Commission (ATC) does indicate that Australia could benefit increases in tourism from countries such as New Zealand, Asia in general and, in later months, the United States. The research that has been conducted by the Australian Tourist Commission indicated that, although the tourism dustry in this country, as in any other country in the world, is suffering, the pact on Australia at this stage is not great. In conjunction with the Australian Tourist Industry Association and the Industry? bound Tourism Organisation of Australia, the ATC constantly monitors the industry within Australia. Currently, it is conducttry ing weekly surveys both through those ganisations and through its 11 officers overseas posts. Yesterday I held some special talks with State Ministers, along with representaular tives from the various State tourism missions and State departments; today had a special meeting of the Tourism Advisory Council to update it on that information and to be briefed by the Ausrole tralian Tourist Commission. I have also undertaken to provide the Opposition shadow Minister with that sort of information as it comes to hand. I am pleased to say that the meeting very) strongly supported the Australian Tourist Commission's strategy to maintain its promotional effort to launch the Greg Norman campaign in the United States and Japan in April and May of this year.

I think that the honourable member will appreciate that we have done everything we can to take a leadership in those discussions. As a result of the discussions that took place in Geneva on 31 January and 1 February, there is some cause now for hope that those talks, which seemed to be running away into the sands at the end of last year, may be revived; there does indeed seem to be such a degree of optimism that people are now saying that the United States may be prepared to bring in legislation to ensure that the fast track requirements that would otherwise have expired in March may be extended. I do not say that that is an immediate answer, but in the longer term we would all agree that the best hope for Australia's wheat producers-who are, I believe, the most efficient producers in the worldlies in the freeing up of the international trade in agricultural products. We very profoundly hope that that will be the outcome of resumed talks in the near future. As to the immediate position, all I can say to the honourable gentleman-and I appreciate his very real concern in this matter-is that in the reasonably near future the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy will be bringing to the Cabinet a submission dealing with the wheat industry. Until that has come before the Cabinet and a decision is made, I do not think it would be appropriate for me to comment any further. NA",52
85,Mrs DARLING,APPRENTICESHIPS,"I ask the Minister for Employment, Education and Training whether he has seen reports of a decline in apprenticeship commencement figures. Are these reports accurate and is the Minister giving any consideration to addressing this apparent decline?",53
86,Mr DAWKINS,APPRENTICESHIPS,"I have seen those reports, which do indicate the suggestion of some decline in apprenticeship numbers. In terms of the accuracy of those reports, it is certainly true that there has been. some decline, but the extent of that decline is not yet clear. In relation to what the Government is doing about it, I make the following points. Firstly, it has been a sad fact in earlier periods of economic decline or recession that one of the first such a recession has been apprentices. One of the first actions employers tend to take to cut costs is to layoff apprentices or they fail to take on new apprentices. If we look back to the 1982-83 recession we find that in a two-year period there was a reduction of something like 36 per cent in the number of apprentices. I hope very much that employers will not follow that course again on this occasion. I recognise the pressure employers are under, but it is important for them to recognise that it is crucial to protect their investment in their apprentices and, indeed, to enhance the skills of their own work force, now and in the future, by taking on more apprentices, even under the current circumstances. The other point I want to make is that there have been very significant improvements in the opportunities generally available to young people over the last eight years. More of them are staying at school longer, more of them are finding places within universities and, indeed, even as far as apprenticeship numbers are concerned, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of apprentices indentured in Australia. Last year there was a record number of young people engaged in apprenticeship training. So whilst there may be some reduction, it will be a reduction against a very high figure-a figure that has never been paralleled in Australia's history. The other point I want to make is that there is an obligation on the States to ensure that, as far as their technical and further education systems are concerned, they accommodate as many as possible of those young people who wish to have a place within the T AFE system for the purposes of industry training. Beyond that, I simply repeat what the Prime Minister adverted to last Sunday when he said that this would be one of the matters to which the Government would be giving consideration in the lead-up to its economic statement, which is due to be brought casualties of down on 12 March.

107,Mr KEATING,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"I rise on a point of order, Mr Speaker. There was no misrepresentation. The honourable member for Mayo distorted the question he put to me weI.... for his own purposes.",55
108,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,Order! It is up to me to determine whether there was a misrepresentation or not. NA Discussion of Matter of Public Importance,55
109,Mr SPEAKER,FINANCIAL SYSTEM,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The current crisis in Australia's financial system brought about by the failure of the Treasurer's economic policies and the inadequate supervision of financial institutions. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members reernments quired by the Standing Orders having in their places",56
110,Mr REITH,FINANCIAL SYSTEM," Mr what Speaker, you might wonder why it is that on a day when we have had disastrous figures in respect of inflation as a matter of public importance a more general issue-the failure of the economic policies of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and in particular, the interrelationship of thosfailures with inadequate supervision of financial institutions. The explanation that these two issues are inextricably terwoven, as I will show in my remarks today. My starting point is that Australia's financial system is in a state of crisis. think this is a point rammed home to most Australians when yet another State bank has been under financial stress this week with losses of about $1 billion. is really just for starters, as revealed only nine days examination by J. Morgan and with a cost to the average Governor said: family in South Australia of about $2,600. ',fhis is a massive loss-greater in per capstatutory Ita terms than the fiascos of recent times intermediaries. in Victoria involving the State Bank of is Victoria and Tricontinental. The questions I wish to raise today with the Treasurer I raise not only on behalf we of the Opposition but also on behalf of people the shareholders in Farrow who want to this know why they face losing their lifetime bility savings.",56
111,Mr KEATING,FINANCIAL SYSTEM,The shareholders or the depositors?,56
112,Mr REITH,FINANCIAL SYSTEM,"The shareholders and the depositors. We would be interested in the response of the Treasurer on that. The people of South Australia would be interested to know why they face this massive incursion of debt liability. We would like to ask questions on behalf of the investors in Estate Mortgage, in Occidental and in Regal as to why the Government could not in some way alert investors to potential fraud. I would also ask questions on behalf of the many others struggling to run businesses or farms who rightly ask why govfail to understand that as they risen dip into the national savings through higher government expenditure they ensure that interest rates stay higher than they otherwise would have been, high interest rates being one of the major instruments by which this Treasurer has inI have raised duced a recession. There are a number of reasons for raising these issues in the Federal Parliament and with this man across the table, the Treasurer. The fact is that the Treasurer is bears ultimate responsibility for the ecoinnomic climate within which all institutions operate. He has a broad responsibility as well for the state of the financial system. Today we saw him at Question Time attempt to narrow the role I and jurisdiction of the Reserve Bank. Let me put on the record that part of the question the Treasurer was keen to That exclude during Question Time when I after quoted the Reserve Bank Governor, Mr P. B.W. Fraser, on 19 April 1990. The As you know, the Reserve Bank has no specific responsibilities or powers for non-bank Supervision of building societies a matter for State governments under whose legislation they exist. Neverthelessand this is the bottom lineare charged under our Act with responsibility for the ""economic prosperity and welfare of the of Australia"". As I read it, fulfilment of responsibility extends to maintaining the staand efficiency of the financial system as a whole. This Treasurer is also responsible for a tax system that is biased towards debt and not equity, and for years Australians have been encouraged to borrow rather than save. One ought to go back to 1985 and pick up our policy position, which is to introduce a goods and services tax, to see some real encouragement for savings in our economy. It is this Treasurer and the current Prime Minister (Mr Hawke)-and at the end of this term they will have been in office for 13 of the last 20 years-and this Government who have much of the responsibility for our continuing poor record on inflation. The Government has been saying for the last couple of months that it has inflation beaten. If that were true, that would be great. But the truth is that that is not how it is; it is nonsense. We have heard it all before. The truth is that the Government does not have an anti-inflation policy in place. Yes, inflation has come down. Why has it come down? Because we have a recession. Why did the Government introduce the recession? Not to fix inflation, but to fix the current account deficit. But the Government has not done that, and now the Government runs this nonsense line that its policy is working because inflation is coming down. It is coming down, but only because we have a recession. The question really is: where is inflation going to be in the next 12 to 18 months? To answer that, we have to see what antiinflation strategy Labor has. The answer is the accord and, as every Australian knows, the truth is that the accord deals simply do not work. The realistic prospect for this country in respect of inflation is that when we come out of recession all the inflationary pressures will be there again, and the boom-bust cycle we are so accustomed to will simply move into the up phase. This Treasurer opened this economy to foreign banks. I must say it was the right policy, although I know the Treasurer opposed it when he was in opposition. But the Treasurer did not foresee that the increased competitive pressures would lead some banks to scramble into some marginal business for market share and that that placed a responsibility on him-a responsibility to ensure adequate supervision of the financial system. The Treasurer bears total responsibility for the high interest rates he has imposed on this economy as a means of engineering the recession. Critically, the Treasurer knew in advance, having been advised by the Treasury, what the impact would be of high interest rates. The Treasurer's attitude to corporate crashes shows not just his callous indifference to the well-being of ordinary Australians who are suffering the consequences of high interest rates but, more significantly, reveals the fact that the Treasurer reckons their plight is evidence of the success of his policies. If we go back 18 months, the Business Review Weekly of July 1989 contains a very revealing article in which the Treasurer said, 'We have to get all this investment out of the property sector and into the traded goods sector so we can export more and produce more import replacement goods'. He acknowledged in that article that things such as investor housing, residential accommodation and local demand for consumer durables would be hard hit. He went on to say-and I think this is absolutely critical: On the question of private debt, Keating says: ""If a bank which has been tripping over itself in the debt, lending money, finds all of a sudden that one of the corporations it lent to cannot cut the mustard, it takes a punch on the nose-it loses shareholder funds. Most of Australia's debt is held by banks and other financial institutions against the assets of Australian companies, enterprises and businesses"". He also said: If they fail, they fail. So if in fact we go back 18 months we have a prediction from the Treasurer as to the consequences of his own policy, and a callous indifference to the failures of the sort we have recently seen. He makes this assessment-it is not just an airy-fairy assessment he has come to on his own: We know, with the benefit of Treasury advice. There was a very revealing statement by Dr David Morgan on 1 January this year. The Melbourne Age reported: Dr Morgan believes that Australia is in for a further shake-out in the financial services A .shake-out that he says he predicted when he was in Treasury involved in the move towards deregulation of the financial sector. So in fact the Treasurer knew; he was advised. And of course, where is the news in that? Most commentators, the Opposition and people in the Reserve Bank had been warning the Treasurer about the imI plications of his policy for the w-ll-being of the financial sector. The truth is the Treasurer has done nothing to ensure adequate, prudential supervision of all financial institutions, particularly those most affected by the collapse of the property market. His serable defence is that he knew nothing of the problems in the financial system and that he bears no responsibility. His responsibility is obvious, as I have outtal. lined it today, and I must say his knowlfor 1989-90 says: edge of events will come under a lot more public scrutiny in the future. I find it incredible that the Treasurer ments. could claim no prior knowledge of the affairs of the State Bank of South AusBank tralia. Financial institutions have been literally toppling all around him and months and months. Surely when the In Treasurer did the deal to save Joan Kiron ner and the State Bank of Victoria, at some stage he said to the Reserve Bank, 'This State. Bank is crook. What is the state of the others?'. Does the Treasurer not read the newshead papers? Clippings after clippings from newspapers going back over the past 12 months have been passed to him on condoes cerns in the press. The Treasurer ought to have had available to him concerns about State the state of the State Bank of South Austhe tralia, and of course the market generally. I presume there are people whom the .meet Treasurer speaks to in the market who would have passed on to him those conOne cerns. In August-September of last year, the The President of the Australian Labor Partypervision the Treasurer's mate-John Bannon, Preexactly mier of South Australia, was actually up the country. in public reassuring the public about bank on the basis that it was okay, it subject to the Treasurer's supervision der the Reserve Bank of Australia. Does section. the Treasurer not even talk to John Bannon? I put it to the Treasurer: even if he does not talk to John Bannon, even if he does not read the papers, even if he does not know anybody in the market, yesterday he said to John Laws: mean if there is a problem I will hear, but I health and don't of necessity inquire. I find it incredible that the Treasurer did not hear but just as incredible that the Reserve Bank didÂ· not advise him. If the Reserve Bank did not advise the Treasurer, he ought to be asking it why, and mihis response in Question Time today was inadequate. The fact is the Reserve Bank does supervise these banks, and the evidence for that statement is absolutely toThe annual report of the Reserve Bank Banks owned by State governments are not subject to the Banking Act. However, they comply voluntarily with the Reserve Banking requireParticularly of note is that the Reserve goes on to say, in regard to superfor months vision in 1989-90: the relatively disturbed conditions of 1989-90, the Bank consulted more frequently with banks their performances . . . Not only did the Reserve Bank consult and supervise, but it actually increased its supervision of banks. The Reserve Bank actually had a bloke seconded into the office of this State registeredÂ· bank. Marcus Clark, the managing director of the bank, is on the public record. What he say? In September 1990, he said: Bank of South Australia is quite definitely supervised by the Reserve Bank. We report to Reserve Bank monthly, quarterly and annually. We fully cooperate with its officers, and all prudential guidelines, including capital adequacy, credit exposures and liquidity. also has the same quote from John Bannon: State Bank is subject to the prudential suof the Reserve Bank of Australia on the same basis as all the other banks of the Come on, Treasurer. Someone knew what was was going on in that State bank. What we unwant from the Treasurer is an explanation of what he knew, why he knew it, when he knew it and on what basis he failed to take the action that he may well have had available to him. The truth-the bottom line-is that the Treasurer implemented parts of the report of the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System but his policy was incomplete. The Treasurer never got around to reading chapter 18 entitled 'Investor protection' and the policy position advocated by Campbell has clearly not been implemented. .The Treasurer ought to get rid of that parliamentary inquiry; he should scrap that. If he wants to have an inquiry, and I suggest that he should, I suggest that he establish a fully-fledged, fully resourced post-Campbell committee of inquiry and that he give it a set of references which would include the responsibility to proceed to recommend how he would in fact implement recommendation 18.19 of the Campbell report. It is worth noting what was said in the Campbell report: For investors to be able to choose among assets carrying varying degrees of risk, it is essential that they should be capable of thoroughly evaluating that risk. For this reason, it is governments have a responsibility to ensure that information in a form and content necessary for risk evaluation is disclosed by financial intermediaries and other corporate borrowers. The truth is that this system of prudential supervision for which the Treasurer has been responsible for eight years is simply not working. He cannot wash his hands of the problem. He has an ultimate responsibility for the system. He also has a direct interest and responsibility as Chairman of the Australian Loan Council. It is rubbish for him to say that he is not going to bail them out when on the same day he announced that he would lift the borrowing ceiling limits for the South Australian Government. He has boasted about the benefits of the positive public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR). He ought now to take the responsibility for the downslide in the PSBR under his management. When the Treasurer stands, he should stand and give a decent answer to the 220,000 depositors in the Farrow Group; the 1,000 investors in the Family Security Friendly Society; the people in the OST Friendly Society; those who suffer from the liquidation of Pan Australian Credit Ltd; those in the Armstrong Jones property trust; those in the Aust-Wide Group; the 60,000 unit holders in Estate Mortgage trusts; the 55,000 unit holders in the Heine group and to the taxpayers and depositors of the State Bank of Victoria and to the taxpayers and depositors of the State Bank of South Australia.",56
113,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,FINANCIAL SYSTEM,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,59
114,Mr KEATING,FINANCIAL SYSTEM,"We have just heard a tortured attempt to try to make some sort of linkage between the problems of the State Bank of South Australia and the supposed crisis in the financial system and inadequate supervision. They are the claims in the matter of public importance. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith) in his matter of public importance refers to: The current crisisbelieved that he uses the word 'crisis'in Australia's financial system brought about by the failure of the Treasurer's economic policies and the inadequate supervision of financial institutions. The first thing to say is that there is no crisis in the financial system. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition articulated the fact that there had been a provision of losses of $1 billion in the State Bank of South Australia and he referred to the State Bank of Victoria, with a figure of the order of $2.2 billion and beyond that to a building society, the Farrow Group, and other non-banking institutions not even financial institutions. The Australian banking system has $350 billion in financial assets, yet the Deputy Leader of the Opposition makes the erroneous and empty claim, the damaging and irresponsible claim, that a $1 billion provision for losses in the South Australian State Bank and a figure in the order of $2 billion originally in the Victorian State Bank amounts to a crisis in the financial system. This is a financial system with $350 billion which is more adequately and seriously supervised today than ever before and which in prudential terms is amongst the strongest banking systems in the world. Notwithstanding the loss provisioning of some of our major banks, the Australian financial system is probably amongst the strongest, if not the strongest in the world compared to the supervisory regimes and liquidity structures of the banks around the world. That is the position; there is no crisis. For the Deputy Leader of the Opposition's shabby political purposes, he gets up here and talks about the current crisis in Australia's financial system. There is no such crisis, so the first and major premise of his proposition is dead wrong. The second proposition is about inadequate supervision. I quote from the Governor's speech about inadequate supervision: Until the 1980s, however, specific arrangements for supervising banks were not well developed. He goes on to say: The broad principles for prudential policies formally agreed between the Treasurer and the bank in 1985. This Treasurer and the Reserve Bank in 1985. Recent amendments to the Banking Act allow the banks prudential requirements to be specified by regulation, permit the bank to conduct investigafund tion of banks and strengthen the bank's power to obtain prudential information from banks. These are regarded as reserve powers-all strengthened in the 1980s, in the main by this Government. Yet the honourable member's charge is that we have inadequate supervision of financial institutions. Presumably he regarded the supervisory structure which prevailed during the 30year reign of the coalition as adequate, but the enhanced legal statutory provisions that I introduced in 1985 and particularly later are inadequate because losses .are now being accounted inside a State bank. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition went on to talk about the shareholders of Farrow. He shed crocodile tears for the shareholders of Farrow-friends of his from the Victorian Liberal Party. They were real estate sharks who masqueraded their institution as a building society. Fi-' nally, the honourable member hid behind Premier Cain and claimed it was all his fault and not that of the shareholders. He then paraded this as part of my culpability. He claimed that I was responsible for an organisation which was not supervised by the Commonwealth and which was perverted from being other than what it represented to depositors as being-a deposit taking institution lending on housing. Instead of that it was into all sorts of real estate deals with the shareholders ripping off fees for management advice. The honourable member then went on to talk indecently about Occidental and also about Regal. He asked why the Government had not alerted depositors of prudential fraud. Cheques totalling $65m passed through the Bank of Melbourne in one evening to repay debts to two other major banks, drawn on the statutory funds of Occidental and Regal. The shareholders of Occidental and Regal could not prevent their passing and neither could were the management of the Bank of Melbourne. Yet somehow it is my responsibility. The Opposition suggests that we should have some mechanism to stop fraud or alleged fraud on the statutory funds of two life companies. If someone wants to write a cheque on a statutory and a bank clears that cheque, what possible mechanism could there be which would allow this Government to prevent that from happening. Again, that is another hollow and malicious remark from the honourable member. Finally, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition got into his stride. He claimed that this was a financial system of $350 billion in crisis. He mentioned the $1 billion in South Australia, $2.2 billion in Victoria largely covered by the sale proceeds from the Commonwealth Bank, now in the main expunged, and then Farrow, which was, of course, a fraud upon the depositors of Geelong by a couple of slick operators who then hid behind a public relations agency which ought to be ashamed of itself for trying to blame the mess on the Victorian State Government. After that pathetic charade, the honourable member returned to interest rates. That was the best he could do. As I often say about his speeches, 'Dear boy, they are like Monday night jobs at the local Liberal Party branch meeting; they have no more quality or integrity than that'. Mr Downer-Do you hear the sort of forced laugh behind you?",59
115,Mr KEATING,FINANCIAL SYSTEM,"The less the honourable member for Mayo says the better. In his own interests he should keep quiet. We are now back on to interest rates. The shadow Treasurer tried to position me on interest rates. He said that I was the one who had induced the recession with my interest rate policies. But in January 1990 when I announced the first relaxation from the high point of the then regime of rates of one percentage point, the present Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) asked, 'Why this sudden urgency?,. He claimed that if interest rates could be put down without justification prior to the election,. they could be just as easily put up again after. He said: Australians will know that policy is again being manipulated for political ends. In other words, not only was the Opposition not complying with the reduction in interest rates, it was calling that reduction a blatant political act. That was the substance of the press statement of the present Leader of the Opposition on 15 February 1990. He said: Recall that the board has hastily convened to approve the January 23rd easing. Was the same procedure followed in this case? On the PM program on 23 January he said this: It begs the question really as to whether it is a political decision. He goes on and on. On the same day there was another news item which said: Opposition Treasury spokesman John Hewson said that lower rates could not be sustained without policy changes and today's move to begin lowering them is a pre-election ploy. Then on 23 January: . . . Mr Keating is pushing the pace of interest rate reductions simply to suit table. These are the interest rates I am trying to get down and the shadow Treasurer is saying are a scam. Yet he is up here talking about interest rates impacting on the recession. There is more to come. On 1 February, from the transcript of a press conference in Melbourne, the Leader of the Opposition said: Everybody knows that this crowd would put interest rates up again if they were to get back into Government. In fact we have reduced them by 5 percentage points since the election: So in that sense the Treasurer is forcing the pace still. In other words, reducing rates we should not be reducing. The shadow Treasurer claims we have a recession from high interest rates which the Opposition did not approve of, yet he disparages my attempts to reduce them. It goes on and on: JOURNALIST: So Mr Keating can't reduce interest rates any further . . . HEWSON: I have no doubt that Mr Keating will try to lower interest rates further. I have no doubt that he'll push the pace all the way to the election. . There are newspaper reports of it. Moving on, he said to Ranald Macdonald inÂ· March: . . . I think voters are justifiably cynical . . . and particularly a statement that was made yesterday by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer that they are after the election going to instruct the Reserve Bank to lower interest rates. We did. They were lowered by a percentage point the following Monday, and they have been lowered by 5 percentage points since. Then there is a question to John Stone-that other economic genius formerly of the Opposition team. So the political aspect of it is-Mr Downer-You used to sit on his knee.",61
116,Mr KEATING,FINANCIAL SYSTEM,"No, I didn't, dear boy. I sat on him: So the political aspect of it is the early timing of this reduction? his electoral time Mr Stone answered: . . . I would think that is correct, yes. So Stone, who comes to the job as another econocrat, says yes, that was an early engineered reduction. I might just add that most of the economics profession at the same time thought that they should remain up. Now an interesting comment: Dr Ed Shann, a director of the Access Economics. consultancy, said yesterday that the Government had made the risky judgment that the December numbers would be either neutral or positive. Dr Shann argues we can't yet assume ""we have passed over the humphe means of high demandand things are going to get better."" In other words, we should have kept the rates up. These are the people who now say we should have lowered them. The fact is that the shadow Treasurer is among them. We tried to get them down and he has attacked us all the way. For the shadow Treasurer himself, let me just get this clear. I quote remarks he made on 29 November 1990-much more contemporary remarks. The journalist was pressing him about interest rate reductions and put to him: A reduction now, a marginal reduction now before Christmas-are you saying no to that? The shadow Treasurer said: Well, I in the end come to the view, yes, if we were loosening off on monetary policy without fiscal policy changes, then you would end up with higher interest rates. In other words, I would not take the rates off. So he would not take the rates off in November. Then today he has a statement out saying that we ought to throw it all to the central bank-forget wages policy, no accord-and let the central bank leave the rates up and keep them up. In other words, he is in here shabbily trying to say that the recession we have is because of the Government's monetary policy, yet at every turn along the way he has either disparaged or cavilled at the reduction in interest rates. I understand the politics of all that and I understood them at the time. But that was the Opposition's position. For the benefit of the House, I table all those references so that we can see the veracity of the claims of the Leader of the Opposition. Then, of course, as I said in Question Time, where we have inflation at 6.9 per cent and declining, we had the Leader of the Opposition in February 1990 saying that Australia will be looking down the barrel of double digit inflation, that is 10 per cent plus, by the end of 1991. So there is not much credibility there on his part. It begs the question why he persists in this policy of trying to disparage the Government's changes and sheeting home to it responsibility for things he knows are not our responsibility. It is a very unfortunate fact that the State Bank of South Australia has embarked upon a loan program which is going to end up meaning that it will have to loss provision that institution for a substantial sum of money. But it is not my responsibility; I do not own it or represent the owner. It is not owned by the Commonwealth of Australia; it is owned by the Government of South Australia. That is the position. The honourable member for Mayo persists in these attacks upon us. Finally, he said that the Reserve Bank of Australia had an officer posted to the State Bank. That is untrue. The Reserve Bank has advised me that it has not had an officer posted in a State bank in recent years, so that claim by Mr Marcus Clark is not correct. Also, the honourable member for Mayo is trying to suggest that the State Batik is on the point of collapse. The fact is that it has a State Government guarantee. It is guaranteed by the State of South Australia. Therefore, it is not going to collapse and it cannot collapse. That guarantee has been made good by the assets which will be transferred to it-up to $970m. There can be no collapse. That point was overlooked by the honourable member for Mayo in his haste to make a shabby political point at the cost of the citizenry of the State he represents. Those who have deposits in the State Bank of South Australia ought to hate him because he is about trying to produce a loss of confidence in that institution, which could impact on depositors, as a result of the kind of claims he and his pal, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer, have raised here today. In the matter of public importance, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said that today's figures on inflation were disastrous. He cannot even add a good point to a declining, underlying inflation rate and a generally declining set of inflationary figures, notwithstanding the effect of the Gulf situation on the price of oil. It always has to be a disastrous figure. It always has to be bad news for Australia. He can keep up his performance, and the public can judge him on the pessimism and gloom that he often spreads in this place.",61
117,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,FINANCIAL SYSTEM,"The Treasurer seeks leave to table some documents. Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted.",63
118,Mr DOWNER,FINANCIAL SYSTEM,"To use an expression that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) himself used to like using, this Treasurer certainly knows no shame. First of all, the consumer price index figure today is apparently not a bad figure. He is perfectly happy with that figure. Secondly-I mention this only to underline the fact that he knows no shame-he says that there is no such thing as a crisis in the Australian financial system.",63
119,Mr KEATING,FINANCIAL SYSTEM,That's right.,63
120,Mr DOWNER,FINANCIAL SYSTEM,"He agrees that that is right. We have had the collapse and the ultimate bail-out of the State Bank of Victoria; we have had the $900m rescue package for the State Bank of South Australia; we have had the vision of Western Australia Inc.; and we have had the Treasurer refer to the Farrow catastrophe and to the fact that two Victorian Ministers encouraged people to put their savings into. the Farrow Corporation but, apparently, we do not have a financial crisis in Australia. I think that anybody listening to this debate anywhere in Australia would have to accept that that is a man who has buried his head very deeply in the sand. In fact, the crises that we have throughout Australia in our financial system invariably involve the Labor Party. In almost every single case, the Labor Party has been directly involved. The State Bank of Victoria was run by the Labor Party. The State Bank of South Australia was Mr Bannon's bank. Western Australia Inc. arid the like at the end of the day all involved the Labor Party. That is why increasingly people around Australia are holding their heads in their hands and saying, 'Labor cannot handle money'. The Treasurer claims that there are some problems, but there is no crisis in the financial system. There are some problems, but they are not his fault. He has not had anything to do with it. One newspaper journalist said today-I am not quite sure that I would use the same words myself-that the Treasurer was criminally irresponsible in expanding credit through the 1980s. Throughout the 1980s the Treasurer had no monetary targets at all; there was no such thing as a broad based monetary target in this country, unlike countries such as Germany. The broad based monetary supply grew in October 1988 by 13 per cent, in April 1989 by 19.3 per centthe figures throughout 1989 were about the same-and in August by 19.4 per cent. In April 1990 it starts to come down, but it is still growing at 10.8 per cent. The result of this was an enormous explosion in credit. The Treasurer then had the audacity to say, 'Spending in Australia was growing a bit too fast so we had to have a recession, had to plunge the country into unemployment and lower living standards; we just had to do it'. The Government had to do it because throughout that part of the 1980s it was blowing out credit as a deliberate act of government policy-in most cases politically motivated policy-in order to get itself over difficult hurdles. When we look at the sheer dimension of the catastrophe that the Treasurer created in this country, his claim that he is not responsible is bold indeed. As I said at the beginning, to use one of his well worn phrases, he is a man who knows no shame. The Treasurer's policies do not in any way excuse the incompetent management of the State banks in the three Labor States, but in the past, and even again today, the Treasurer has talked with pride about prudential supervision. When we talk about the State Bank of South Australia, the Treasurer either was grossly negligent and did not do anything, despite the advice he was getting, or was incompetent by not having in place a system of proper supervision. He cannot have it both ways. He cannot argue that he knew nothing about it but say, by the way, that the beauty of this country is the absolutely outstanding system of supervision he has put in place. The Treasurer tried to suggest that he did not know what was going on, that the State banks are not subject to Commonwealth supervision. The former Managing Director of the State Bank of South Australia said on 17 September: State Bank of South Australia is quite definitely supervised by the Reserve Bank. That is the view of the former Managing Director. One may say that, as he is the former Managing Director, perhaps that is no longer relevant; perhaps he was wrong. But on 4 September, a couple of weeks before that, the Premier, Mr Bannon, said in the House of Assembly in Adelaide: There is constant dialogue and information exchange, appropriately, between the State Bank and the Reserve Bank and, as a matter of practice, those Reserve Bank guidelines are followed. The story goes on and on. Only the day before yesterday in the State Parliament, the Premier of South Australia,who is the President of the Australian Labor Party, said: Under the provisions of the Federal Constitution and the Banking Act of the Commonwealth, State banks are not subject to that Act. However, the Board of the State Bank of South Australia, with my support, decided that it should comply with its provisions, including in relation to capital adequacy and liquidity requirements. The State Bank of South Australia was constantly reporting on its situation to the Reserve Bank of Australia. It seems incredible that either the Reserve Bank did not ever mention this to the Treasurer or, if it did mention it, he should come in here and claim that it did not. Whichever way round it was, the Treasurer is very definitely guilty of the grossest incompetence. Mr Bannon's speech in State Parliament a couple of days ago is pretty revealing. On 8 November he learned that in this financial year the State Bank was likely to lose between $30m and $50m. This is the most important bank in the State of South Australia, which contains around 10 per cent of the country's population. Forty-seven per cent of all home loans in that State are with the State Bank of South Australia. The Premier was told in November that it faced losses of between $30m and $50m, though that turned out to be a gross underestimate. Was there not a word to the Treasurer of Australia or the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis)? On 6 December, the Premier of South Australia says that he met with the Chairman of the State Bank. He went on in his speech a couple of days ago to say: Prior to that meeting I was advised by Treasurythat is, State Treasurythat the Bank's level of non-accrual loans were growing quickly and that it was concerned that the Bank was not providing sufficiently for bad debts. Treasury was also concerned that the capital adequacy ratio was likely to fall to a level which was only slightly above the Reserve Bank's minimum level. This is the biggest bank in South Australia. The Treasurer is trying to get us to . believe that neither the Premier of South Australia nor the Reserve Bank of Australia ever mentioned this to him. If they, particularly the Premier, never mentioned it to him, the Treasurer's incompetence is beyond belief; if they did mention it to him, he did nothing about it, and is certainly not letting on if he did anything about it. He is saying that it is all somebody's else's fault. The challenge for the Treasurer is to declare himself and he can do that quite easily. He can release copies of all of the State Bank's reports to the Reserve Bank for the past 12 months, all working and other papers on the State Bank written by J.P. Morgan and all of the weekly and monthly operating review results produced by the State Bank for its executive . in the past year. He can release all of that, and he ought to release all of that so that we can see precisely what has been going on and we can be reassured that there is some form of supervision, less of what the Treasurer said. But, ultimately, the Premier of South Australia-the President of the Australian Labor Party-in whom government members have such pride, js also culpable in this whole shabby affair. After WA Inc. and the bail-out of the State Bank of Victoria, it is unbelievable that neither the Treasurer nor the President of the Labor Party ever bothered to look at the State Bank of South Australia. The Government believed South Australia was going to be immune because it was. so proud of its Premier Bannon, and Premier Bannon was so sure of his own competence. The Government did nothing. It plunged the country into a recession, banks were in enormous difficulties, but the State Bank of South Australia was absolutely fine. Apparently, the Government was not supervising it, the Premier of South Australia apparently was not interested, and taxpayers in South Australia-all people in South Australia-will have to pick up the bill for the Government's incredible incompetence and irresponsibility in terms of economic management. This Government is one of the most shameful governments in the history of this country-and I say that with no sense of exaggeration. I can say more: the great majority of people in this country wholeheartedly agree with me.",63
121,Dr CHARLESWORTH,FINANCIAL SYSTEM,"Perth) (3.37)I think, to his credit, the Treasurer and Premier of South Australia has accepted responsibility for this decision. With gard to this I quote from yesterday's Sydney Morning Herald, which stated that Mr Bannon, also the State Treasurer, admitted that his policy of trying to establish an arm's length structure whereby the Treasurer had no control over the bank had failed. Yet our opponents come here today and suggest by a very tortuous piece of logic that in some way the Federal Government and, indeed, the Treasurer in this place, Mr Keating, should have direct responsibility for the mistakes and errors of every spiv, shark, bad loan, bad debt and dodgy regard- deal in the country. Mr Wright-Most of them in the Liberal Party.",65
122,Dr CHARLESWORTH,FINANCIAL SYSTEM,"I will not comment on that. What we have here is the suggestion-Mr Chaney-You, a member of the West Australian Labor Party, can say that?",65
123,Dr CHARLESWORTH,FINANCIAL SYSTEM,The unction of the honourable member for Pearce we can do without. Mr Chaney-The greatest bunch of crooks.,65
124,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,FINANCIAL SYSTEM,The honourable member for Pearce!,65
125,Dr CHARLESWORTH,FINANCIAL SYSTEM,"We have here the suggestion that this is a crisis and the Treasurer put it in very bland terms, but very accurately. This represents $1 billion out of $350 billion worth of assets in the Australian financial system, and, according to the Opposition, it represents a crisis. What we have from the Opposition is some sort of a plea for re-regulationthat is what it has come here for. Opposition members have been coming into this place year after year saying that we should have deregulation, and what we find them doing now is coming into this place and pleading for re-regulation. They are suggesting that the Reserve Bank should be looking over the shoulder of every banker in the country. It will not happen-nor should it. It is something that needs to be understood. Banks developed in Western society re- through the need for people to have safe places for their money. Indeed, as I have said before in this place, the original bankers were goldsmiths because they were the only people who had safes that were adequate and could hold people's money. The goldsmiths then decided that because all people did not want all of their money at the same time, they could in fact lend it out. It became a profitable business. Then, because they wanted to lend out more money, they started offering people interest rates to lend money. That sort of structure has developed and become very sophisticated. But within that structure there is still the requirement for each bank to have a certain amount of liquidity, for each bank to have set assets and for banks to have funds available. When banks overstep that mark, the Reserve Bank has the capacity, as it should have, to supervise those prudential controls. The Reserve Bank has that capacity in respect of Federal banks, but it does not have that capacity in respect of State Banks, and the State Bank of South Australia is an example of this. What are our opponents suggesting? Had they been coming into this place year after year putting the position that, yes, we should regulate more because we need to watch these banks more closely, they would have some credibility. But they have not put that view even once. We have not heard them say in this place that they want to roll back deregulation; they. have been supporters of deregulation. The coincidence of a whole number of factors have brought about difficulties in Australia's financial and prudential arrangements. But those difficulties have occurred all over the world. We do not have, thankfully, the savings and loans scheme that they have in the United States. We do not have the exposure to the Third World debt that many international banks do, and we are fortunate in that regard. But it is the case that even with the prudential supervision of the Reserve Bank, many of the banks that come under the Federal Act have got themselves into difficulties. Fortunately, they have been able to trade their way through, and they still have sufficient assets and capacity. But occasionally, as has occurred in Victoria and South Australia where there is not that same sort of supervision and the same prudential requirements, we have found that indeed banks have got themselves into difficult circumstances. What are our opponents suggesting today? They seem to be suggesting that every bank in the country should have the Treasurer or the Reserve Bank looking over its shoulder every time it makes a deal. That is clearly absurd. It is not a view that we support, nor is it something that should be pursued. The honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) is concerned because in his view, and as the Opposition says, the Government has not had adequate control over the money supply. However, the student economic brief in today's Australian Financial Review-I am sorry the honourable member for Mayo has not read itindicates that quantitative lending guidance was ended in June 1982. Anybody who knows anything about this place would understand that we were not in control then. It is the case that there has been a move to deregulation. It is the case that there has been, unfortunately, a whole coincidence of events-the entry of foreign banks, the general measures of deregulation, the floating of the dollar, the push for the accumulation of geared assets, and indeed the internationalisation of the Australian economy, which made banks competitive, able to compete for funds. In that competitive stampede there were many imprudent decisions made. Those of us who are on the banking inquiry being led by the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin) understand and were part of the discussions last week with banks. The banks know about those decisions and as a result of the mistakes they have made we will have in future a far more mature banking system and one in which the controls and the prudential requirements will be fulfilled. Mr Martin-It is a pity the honourable member for Mayo was not there.",65
126,Dr CHARLESWORTH,FINANCIAL SYSTEM,"It is a pity the honourable member for Mayo, who is a member of the Finance and Public Administration Committee, did not have the time to attend. Since we have been in government we have enforced and strengthened the prudential requirements of supervision by the Reserve Bank. They are not measures that were in place under the previous Administration. It is not the case that somehow we have diluted the control. We never had the control over State Banks. State governments have the opportunity at any time to legislate in respect of prudential controls, in respect of their liquidity requirements. But they have not chosen to do so because they have not felt that it was necessary, and to suggest that indeed the Federal Government should be responsible for the mistakes of every financial institution in this country, for every bad loan, is absurd. The Federal Government does of course have responsibilityÂ· for one bank in this country. Indeed, it is the major shareholder in the Commonwealth Bank so it is important that we look at that. As the Treasurer has suggested-and it is true of all those financial institutions throughout the country that we talk about, as well as the Commonwealth Bank-responsibility for the actions of a bank should fall upon its board. The board of the Commonwealth Bank is a who's who of Australian business. So where we have some direct control over the appointment of the board of a bank, we have significant people in a position to run that financial institution properly. We find the chairman of Commonwealth Industrial Gases Ltd, the managing director of Santos Ltd, the managing director of CRA Ltd and the managing director of Brambles Ltd amongst the members of the board of the Commonwealth Bank. So where the Commonwealth Government does have the direct responsibility, where the Treasurer is directly responsible, we have a prudent operation; an operation which is a significant profit maker and an operation which falls within the prudential requirements. Where we find institutions falling outside that, where there is a voluntary requirement for them to fall within the prudential requirements of the Reserve Bank, we find that they have failed in the past. The suggestion that the Commonwealth Government is in some way responsible for this crisis ignores the fact that there has been a coincidence of effects in the Australian economy. No-one is suggesting that Australia's economy is buoyant and healthy. We are fighting for our economic survival, and it is important that our institutions have integrity and be strong and viable. It is the intention of this Government to support them.Â· The suggestion by the Opposition that there is a crisis when there is not, the suggestion by the Opposition that there is a collapse when there is not and the suggestion by the Opposition that these institutions are not safe do nothing for the integrity of our system. It is not a realistic assessment of the situation; it is populist and it represents in this place and in the broader community an opportunity to ambush our economy rather than support it.",66
127,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,FINANCIAL SYSTEM,"Order! The discussion is concluded. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1991 Bill presented by Mr Robert Brown, for Mr Kerin, and read a first time. Second Reading",67
128,Mr ROBERT BROWN,MEAT CHICKEN LEVY,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. On behalf of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), I indicate that the purpose of this Bill is to amend the Meat Chicken Levy Act 1969 to increase the maximum rate of levy for exotic disease. The funds raised are utilised to finance the exotic animal disease preparedness trust account. Currently the maximum rate of levy permitted to be collected from the meat chicken industry is set at 0.005c per head. Due to a drafting error it is necessary to amend this to the correct rate of 0.05c per head. This matter has been discussed with the relevant producer interests and the National Farmers Federation (NFF) has formally indicated its support for the amendment. Operative levy rates will continue to be set by regulation under the Meat Chicken Levy Act 1969, on the recommendation of the relevant industry committee of the NFF in accordance with the Exotic Animal Disease Control Act 1989. This Government has given a commitment to match these industry funds on a dollarfor-dollar basis up to a maximum of $750,000 per annum for the livestock industries. The additional funds raised through the setting of the correct levy rate on meat chickens in 1991-92 are estimated to total $27,000. I commend the Bill to honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Ruddock) adjourned. NA BILL (No.6) 1990 Second Reading Debate resumed.",67
129,Mr TAYLOR,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Earlier today in this debate I referred to a need for simplicity, efficiency and equity in our taxation system. In the few minutes remaining to me I would like to refer more specifically to that point of equity, citing an anomaly arising from the specific provisions of section 23 of the Income Tax Assessment Act, which exempts certain types of organisations from rendering returns. I refer the House to a letter from the Acting Commissioner of Taxation, which lists some of those organisations such as scouts, girl guides, country women's organisations, sporting clubs, overseas aid, et cetera, as being exempt from that section of the Income Tax Assessment Act. On the other hand, I refer the House to the situation that has arisen in my electorate very recently in relation to a school cadet unit that made application under that section for exemption from the Act. The submission talked about that cadet unit being part of the school curriculum, in the main funded by fees paid by parents, receiving little or no support from the Army and buying all its own Army clothing, the only support from Army being the loan of some equipment. All it got in reply just a couple of weeks ago was a roneoed letter from the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation in Brisbane which said: With reference to your letter of 12th November 1990, you were informed that there was no provision in the Income Tax Assessment Act for exemption from income tax for school cadet units. Clearly, that is not good enough and highlights the adverse perceptions by many of the operations and attitudes of some in the Australian Taxation Office I referred to earlier in this debate. I can see little or no difference between the Australian cadet corps and, for example, scouts and guides as important elements in the development of our national youth. I hope this anomaly can be corrected administratively and that it can be corrected very quickly indeed. Finally, I refer the House to the situation the Opposition finds itself in in relation to taxation reforms. The taxation reforms we proposed were announced by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) in August of last year. Those reforms would be implementedÂ· in the context of the coalition parties' commitment to smaller government, to major cuts in government expenditure, which we have heard a lot about in this afternoon's matter of public importance debate, and the lowering of the overall tax burden. That involves the abolition of the present inefficient and unfair system of wholesale tax and the replacement by a broadly based goods and services tax, significant reform of the present income tax system to simplify it and provide substantial personal tax cuts, and the revenue raised by the goods and services tax providing a compensation package to include low income earners, pensioners and beneficiaries, along with reductions in Government expenditure, substantial personal income tax cuts, et cetera. Clearly, those initiatives demonstrate the determination of the coalition to come to grips with the fundamental problems besetting our economy. It is in clear contrast to the Government, which seems, increasingly to flounder in a sea of indecision. The Prime Minister (Mr _Hawke) and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) can take their cheap political shots. They can continue to tinker rather than deal with the issues.",68
130,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,Order! The honourable mem- . ber's time has expired.,68
131,Mr ELLIOTT,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"ln rising to speak in support of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.6) I should at the outset take issue with a few of the points made by the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor) and the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson). They suggested that the Opposition had the will to come to grips with the significant ecoyears. nomic problems that beset Australia at this time, and they detailed a range of tax proposals designed to fit the bill. Along with a range of other measures, they said that those steps would be taken to reduce public sector outlays. There are a number of things to be said about that. The first and probably the most notable is that the Opposition's tax proposals have been remarkably short on detail up to this stage and they fall a long way short of providing any sort of crediof ble alternative policy. Secondly, since last Budget, each time we have debated measures designed to reduce time that hurdle has been presented, the Opposition has been unable to support curtailment of those outlays. Given the per cent cut in gross domestic product over the time of this Government, there is no evidence to show that the Opposicannot tion has the will, the nerve or the acumen to achieve the extra 3 per cent cuts outlays it talks about being able to deliver should it be in government. I think that is reinforced when we look at the measures contained in this Bill. The proposals we have developed through t]1is legislation are designed to reinforce the principles of fairness, equity and tice for all; those principles have been hallmarks in seeking to create a fair and credible taxation system. We have only to compare the record of our time in government with that of our opponents to see a really stark contrast indeed. We had a period in the Fraser years when, as many people have canthe vassed, for some in the community paybility ing tax became something they could opt out of if they wished to. It was not someprocess thing that everybody had to do. That attax titude was actively encouraged, in a sense. The free lunch-the taxpayer-funded lunch-was part and parcel of what the taxation system was all about in the Fraser years. It has taken a lot of very hard decisive measures by the Government to legitimate start to restore the credibility of the system with all taxpayers, particularly pay as you earn taxpayers, because they had need. to foot the bill for the neglect and the breakdown of the taxation system in those The measures contained here deal, firstly, with cuts in the personal rates of taxation, which are part of the accord process, and I will refer to that in the course of my remarks. They deal also with some adjustments to the capital gains tax legislation. That is a very fair and reasonable tax and one the Government had to fight hard to introduce, against opposition from many, including the Opposition. Interestingly enough, it is one of the areas fairness and principle in taxation polthe icy that the Oppositions says it would scrap if it were in government. ,It cannot outlays, each have it both ways. Earlier today in the matter of public 6 importance debate we heard criticisms of the Government in relation to particular financial institutions. The Opposition have it both ways. It cannot say, 'We believe in the deregulated arrangein ments but we are going to hold the Government accountable for every investment decision made by financial institutions around the country'. I suggest that that is exactly what the Opposition is trying to do in relation to taxation policy. It is trying to have it both ways. It is saying juson the one hand, 'We have a capital gains our tax we should throw out'. On the other hand it is saying, 'What we need to do is replace that and try to impose a consumption tax'. I wish to make a few points about the consumption tax. Early in this debate the honourable member for Sturt talked about difficulty of meeting social responsicosts through the tax system. Listening to his remarks, I wondered where that fitted with the goods and services the Opposition is talking about introducing. How on earth are the people with the greatest need ever going to be protected if we do not say that the public sector outlays are there to ensure the safety and net that is required? There is no other way of doing it. Effectively, that tax would mean that there would be no real safety net for the people with the greatest If the Opposition introduces a goods and services tax it will not have the safety net that provides the catch-all for the pensioners and others on fixed incomes, the disadvantaged, the disabled and all those who need help. It will not be able to achieve those things. Quite the reverse will be the case. It will be totally regressive in terms of those people in the community. When we talk about taxation law reform and the sorts of parameters the honourable member for Groom referred to, such as simplicity, reducing complexities and so on, it also has to be fair. The goods and services tax is not fair. It is fundamentally unfair to the people decelerating. who have a real need and who are striving and struggling in this community. This Government has been trying to ensure they have a safety net. We can look at a number of areas of this particular sort of manifestation. touch on a few. The first one worth noting is the accord process. In this particular legislation before us today, the tax rate for those in the income range $5,401 to $20,700 is reduced from 21 per cent to 20 per cent. That is achieved because there is an effective wages policy. That is achieved because the accord process has the flexibility to actually deliver, both the work force and to the nation, assured realistic wages outcomes, outcomes which will contribute as they have been contributing. As the September quarter inflation figures showed, they are actively contribtaxpayer uting to a real anti-inflation strategy. Any alternative, such as the goods services tax, of its very nature militates against that anti-inflationary strategy. would be inflationary-there is no disputeof about that. It is inevitably.iI?flati(;mary. we do not have a real antI-mflatIon strategy at all if we adopt that approach. Far worse than that, if we say that the perand sonal income tax rate should not be which is critical to the accord process; and we do what was suggested in a quesgo tion at Question Time-we hand this all over to the Reserve Bank to run; we not worry about wages policy-where whose would that leave us in terms of this oroad economic approach? Clearly, such an proach is absolutely bereft of any sort of credibility. I believe it has to be said that the great feature of this period of the Hawke Government has been the durability and the capacity of the accord process to achieve reform, to achieve flexibility and to achieve certainty. It has also ensured that the level of wage outcomes was lower than would otherwise have been the case under a deregulated labour market arrangement as is so often talked about by people such as the honourable' member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). At the same time it is ensuring that our overall rate of inflation is Despite the difficulties in the last quarter figures, because of the Gulf crisis and the effect on oil prices, there is every reason to believe the projections set for this financial year and for this calendar year in I will terms of inflation can and will be achieved, and probably bettered. They will be achieved only if we really do have a strong anti-inflation strategy, if we have a strategy that uses the tax system to achieve that sense of fairness, if we have a strategy that ensures there is fiscal restraint, and if we have a strategy that ensures that people who were getting the advantage of to the ramps and the rorts in the tax system in the past are stopped from doing so. For instance, if one scraps the capital gains tax or returns to the days of the funded lunch for some, if one says that things like the fringe benefits tax no longer have a place in our society, one and has to ask, 'Where do we go from here'? I have watched two or three of these taxIt ation debates since I have been a member the chamber as well as other debates So dealing with ec-nomic issues. ..",68
132,The Q,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"POSItIon talks. abo.ut - he goods serVIces tax that I- WIll mtroduce. cut The members of the NatIOnal Party-who unf<,)ftunately are not here-real-y should back and do some soulsearchI-g about the effects of a goods and serVIces tax. do Even the honourable member for Groom, electorate I think covers quite a bit of rural Australia, really would do well if aphe went to see what the effect would be on a group like the farmers in the electorate of Groom. It is the people in the Darling Downs who would actually be affected by the impact of the goods and services tax that the Liberals see as the way forward in taxation reform. The effect would be devastating for the vast majority of small business, for farmers and for townsfolk throughout an electorate like Groom. In an electorate like Parramatta in Sydney the ordinary folk would be just as adversely affected. They are the people who really get slugged by this process. Anyone can see they are the ones who have a real disadvantage already in terms of the system, and a progressive tax system is designed to relieve some of the burden with which they are struggling. I note in passing that in this regard the honourable member for Sturt spoke in somewhat disparaging terms about our retirement incomes policy. I think that is quite unfortunate. For the first time in Australia today we have a real retirement incomes policy. We have actually achieved a policy which provides a degree of predictability, a degree of certainty, and a degree of security, most importantly, for our aged folk. It is very important to note that as well as the measures contained in this particular tax legislation the Government has got to a point where we have the level of pension rate above 25 per cent of average weekly earnings today-something never achieved in the time of the Fraser Government, and something which I do not believe the Liberals, based on their current policy perspective, or any that they are likely to develop in the future, could even seek to emulate. That is a matter of concern. If they do not say they will set up a proper retirement incomes' policy, if they do not say that that is an important and a legitimate part of the total economic and social fabric of our society, I wonder when they will start saying, 'We are going to introduce our consumption tax but we will have safeguards in it'. But what are they worth? I do not think that sort of disclaimer about what the potential impact would be on the needy is worth much at all. Indeed, I think it is quite to the contrary. Those proposals would ensure that those with need would be very savagely disadvantaged by an approach which devolves away from the Commonwealth Government the responsibility for deciding that retirement incomes are a proper part of its social policy planning, its public policy initiatives. To do anything else but treat it as an integral part of that process is really a decision which I think is politically and morally bankrupt in this sense, because it is being said that people with real need do not have any security or predictability in their future at all. I have to say that with this tax we go a long way towards keeping that process going. We are trying to ensure there is certainty, and there are safety valves there for the people who need them. I would be the first to concede the taxation arrangements we have in Australia today are still complex. They are still difficult and they still need considerable explanation. As time goes on there will no doubt be room for further reforms. One of the things that are notable about the Bill before us today is that there are provisions which do tidy up areas, such as the potential double taxation aspects that might be encountered. Community concerns about some aspects of transfer arrangements that can impact on capital gains tax arrangements are taken account of. In their broad thrust, these provisions ensure we have a tax system which is more credible, one where there is more scope for people to plan their affairs with certainty and in the knowledge that we will not seek to do something which will necessitate them altering their affairs constantly to overcome any imperfections they might see that exist. Fundamentally, having taken all those steps, the broad principles still remain. We must build into the appropriate policy fabric what is being developed in taxation policy: the underlying objectives of ensuring that people have their retirement incomes properly taken care of, their education opportunities properly provided for through the public outlays involved, and access to quality health care which is not just there as the prerogative of those who can afford it but there for everyone irrespective of his or her particular capacity to pay. Those principles should be sacrosanct in this process. They are social objectives which are critical if we are to ensure the taxation system is based on any principle of equity at all. I would suggest that if we do not have a taxation system that does enshrine the basic principles of fairness and equity it will not be long before we have a taxation regime lacking credibility or any sense of decency. Inevitably, that system will fragment and fracture because it will cease to be providing the sort of basis we need for Australian society. Opposition members spoke about superannuation arrangements. The taxation treatment of superannuation and the general attitude to superannuation under this Government is a telling contrast with the Fraser Government and some of the comments from Opposition members in debates we have had on these matters on what we should expect from the Opposition should it ever be elected to government. It is worth noting that when the Hawke Government came to power in 1983 less than 40 per cent of the work force had any form of award based superannuation. Yet at the same time some in the community had significant superannuation concessions-taxation driven incentives for superannuation coverage for some of the top echelons of the work force. We had different classes of taxation arrangements applied in a very divisive and unfair way against the pay as you earn taxpayers, the award based workers and those with lesser means in our community. The principle of that arrangement was that superannuation was apparently seen by the Liberal Party of Australia as a prerogative of only the wealthy; it was not something that the needy and the general work force had an entitlement to. That was a totally unfair arrangement and certainly contributed to a most unfair and repugnant taxation regime. Compare that with today when we have award based superannuation extending to more than Â·85 per cent of the organised labour force. That is a phenomenally great achievement. There is no justification in returning to the bad old days of the taxpayer funded arrangements that provided superannuation help to a few. We should ensure that the tax system provides security and consistent treatment to everyone. Our fundamental objective is to encourage a real retirement incomes policy in which all Â·can participate on an equal footing so that the taxation system does not become yet another disadvantaged and difficult problem area for many in the community. The taxation system should exist to help ensure that the needy are looked after. Whilst the taxation system provides real and worthwhile superannuation concessions across the board, it needs to ensure that those people who have the least access to those arrangements becauseÂ· of past neglect are not disadvantaged, as they have been. The only way to ensure that is to extend the award based arrangements, keep in place the processes set out in the legislation and maintain the historic partnership between the Government and the Australian Council of Trade 'Unions in the accord process. The accord has delivered real economic worth and has, compared to the alternatives when looking at the breadth of our taxation policy, ensured that today we have one of the cleanest and fairest taxation systems in the world which can be matched fairly, on equity grounds, internationally. That is a real test of the success of the accord and demonstrates the Government's success in meeting those objectives. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

133,Mr ROCHER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Before I comment on particular clauses and these amendments, I want to remind the Committee that these amendments were introduced at 10.30 this morning. There are six pages of amendments, and anyone who has any basic understanding of the Act and what is proposed in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.6) as a whole would understand that a great deal of digestion is required to be able to consider the efficacy or otherwise of these amendments. Insult is added to injury when it is realised that the Opposition parties have consulted with the Government all the way through on these issues-that is, consulted with the Australian Taxation Office-yet this morning at 10.30, without 160ZZ0 (1) (aÂ» at a time before warning, we were presented with six pages the earlier of the following: of amendments with which we have to (i) the trigger time, or the earlier grapple. The Minister for Land Transport or earliest trigger time, men- (Mr Robert Brown) has just moved these tioned in paragraph amendments without one word of expla160ZZ0 (1) (h); nation. That is hardly the stuff of demodisposed of by the transferee; crats or good parliamentary practice. and Mr Robert Brown-If you want me to refer to them now, I would be happy to do so.",75
134,Mr ROCHER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"No, the Minister can do it after I have finished-he has had his chance. I might have something to say in reply in my second phase then. Having recorded my objection to the treatment meted out in this Parliament-the cavalier attitude of the Government towards legislation, and particularly important legislation with all its ramifications for the Australian taxpayer-the Government has ignored the goodwill of the Opposition and its willingness to consult and contribute to sound legislation. Reference was made this morning to treatment for capital gains tax purposes to partners and partnerships and a taxpayer's interest in a partnership asset of a partnership in which the same taxpayer happens to be a partner. By amending section 160A in Part 3 to include such assets, there should be no doubt that the amendment fails to achieve the clarity claimed for it in the explanatory memorandum. Similarly, proposed amendments to section 160zzo, which have requirements overly difficult to comply with, will be inconsistent with the requirements retained for partnership roll-overs. The Government has got two standards. It also seems unnecessary, as the Bill and the amendments just moved confirm, to stipulate that in order to qualify for a section 160zZNA roll-over, all partners must so elect. Among amendments to section 160zzo is an anti-avoidance measure imposing new criteria to apply to transfers between companies in a group where there is common ownership of those companies. It is our view that the proposed amendments will create problems for purchasers, problems which could mature many years hence and involve significant tax liabilities. If anti-avoidance is the objective of the amendments proposed, there should be some time limit, maybe of the order of seven years-the statute of limitations. That would accord with what applies incidentally, in similar circumstance- in connection with similar legislation in operation in the United Kingdom. Another shortcoming we identify is in connection with the application of section 160zZRF, as it will be after the passage of the Bill. We subscribe to a view that with self-as-essment all the go these days, the calculatIOn of taxable income should not depend on calculations which tend to subjective interpretation-for that is what is required by these measures. These amendments to section 160zZRF seem destined to achieve that very undesirable end. It also seems likely that proposed ?ivisi.on 19A. will be capable of roping mto 1tS amb1t external borrowings from an arm's le-gth lender. This does not appear to be mtended and should be clarified. I am sure the Minister for Land Transport would want to clarify that for us here. All loans a-e liable to be affected by proposed sectIOn 160zZRE in certain circumstances, including the shares in a transfer where held prior to 15 September 1985. It will therefore be possible for a third party to have the cost base reduced rather than the transferee being taxed on the excess in a like manner to that provided for in section 160ZM-another inconsistency between clauses in the same section. There is also a very good case for separate treatment being accorded to the acc.ident and - isability business written by hfe compames. Franking credits arising in respect of accident and disability business should be determined separately from other businesses such that the total franksponsibility ing credits arising from the former-that is, based on total tax paid and franked dividends received in respect of such business-should be available to frank dividends to shareholders. This approach would result in uniform treatment of accident and disability business, whether transacted by a life or a general insurer, and thus has the advantage of both consistency and equity. . I must say that I would have preferred parity of treatment for mutual and nonmutual life insurance companies under the transition provisions. That is not there and that is a weakness in the proposals: Also, the use of factual basis for apportionment of franking dividends and separate treatment of franking credits in respect of non-participating businesses seems to be warranted. In the absence of an explanation for these amendments, some basic information, at least, as to why they are required-remembering that the Bill was introduced into the Parliament on 6 December last year and that in the interim there has been adequate time for the Opposition to be both informed of these amendments and perhaps even to have been given some rationale for them. I sil?ply restate my objection to the way thIS Government approaches taxation legislation. If this were the only example of such cavalier and arrogant treatment of the Parliament and the Opposition we would leave it at that, but it is nC:t. It happens time and time again, particularly with taxation legislation, as you very well know from personal experience Mr Chairman. I want to again put on ;ecord the legislative incompetence of the Govof a loan ernment in these matters. - r ROBERT BROWN (CharltonM1mster for Land Transport) (4.26)-First of all, I deny that this represents any permanent feature of the Government's apprQach to any type of legislation including legislation and amendment- to taxation law. I want to emphasise on behalf of the Minister for Science and Technology and Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Crean), who has the refor the carriage of this legislation, that this Bill proposes to amend the capital gains tax provisions of the income tax law in a number of ways. The Minister has asked me to thank t-<?se hon<;mrable members who have partIc1pated m the debate, and I take this opportunity to do so. He has also asked me to acknowledge to the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) the fact that there were some technical difficulties involved in the explanatory memorandum initially. We regret that. But there is no arrogance responsible for that. Technical difficulties do arise, and, of course, every effort will be made on all occasions to ensure that that does not happen. I am not being critical, but it may been better if the honourable member Curtin had deferred to me when I sugrequire gested that that may have been an approto priate procedure, so that I could have gone through some of the provisions these amendments. I know that would have been fairly late in the day to be of much benefit to the honourable member for Curtin, but it may have been able throw some light on what the specific proproposed visions are and to prbvide some rationale for them. Clause 59 will amend the capital gains roll-over provisions which apply on the transfer of assets within a company group. Existing anti-avoidance rules which retemplated quire the issue of shares or securities as consideration for the transfer of the sets, as a pre-condition for availability the roll-over, are being removed. Howbeing ever, to ensure that tax deferral opportunI ities associated with the roll-over mittee. provisions cannot recur, a replacement anti-avoidance provision in the Bill will treat a rolled over asset as having been disposed of at market value if the group ceases to have effective control of the set. The amendments now proposed are of a technical nature and will apply where the transferor of an asset is subsequently liquidated. As drafted, the Bill provides an exception from the deemed disposal rule in these cases. To prevent possible abuse of this exception, a further deemed disposal rule is now proposed which will apply if the transferee of the asset subsement, quently leaves the group. Consequential amendments are also proposed to clause 63 of the Bill, which will amend cord-keeping requirements that must be satisfied by taxpayers who obtain roll-over relief on the transfer of assets between group companies. The other principal amendments to be moved on behalf of the Government relate to clause 61 of the Bill. That clause proposes a number of technical antiavoidance rules which ensure that no artificial timing advantages are obtained by shareholders or creditors of a company which transfers an asset to another commonly owned company for reduced conhave sideration. To achieve that aim, the for amendments proposed by clause 61 will a series of cost base adjustments shares or loans held in the transferor to reflect the shifting of value that occurs of following the transfer of the assets. Since the Bill was introduced, further situations have been identified where value to shifting can occur. The amendments now will enable appropriate cost base adjustments to be made in these cases. The proposed amendments do not depart from the original anti-avoidance objectives of the Bill but are necessary to achieve those objectives. Nevertheless, as they will apply in circumstances not conin the Bill as introduced, they will only apply after today. Full details of as the amendments are contained in the supof plementary explanatory memorandum circulated to honourable members. commend the amendments to the ComIn closing, I make the observation that the Minister has said that he appreciates a number of the issues raised by members of the Opposition, particularly those raised asby the honourable member for Curtin. I acknowledge that while governments and oppositions often have a different general position which they adopt in relation to taxation law, when we come to areas of this kind there is clearly a high level of commonality in the positions we adopt because we are all concerned to ensure that the taxation system is efficient and equitable. I believe, as does the Governthat this legislation will significantly contribute to that situation. On behalf of the Minister I commend the the reamendments to the House.",75
135,Mr ROCHER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"1 had intended to speak on third reading but I will do so now instead. By way of a reply to the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown), I wish to point out that the reasons he gave were largely those that had already been advanced in the second reading speech of the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean). That might confuse the fact that we have here six amendments aimed at achieving the stated objectives of this Bill when it was introduced. As if to add insult to injury, the Minister has now, in the closing stages of the debate, very kindly provided a supplementary explanatory memorandum. I would have thought that that basic information would have been available at the outset of the second reading debate. If that were not possible, the debate could have been adjourned and the Opposition given time to study this supplementary explanatory memorandum. For the uneducated, let me say that I cannot recall any similar circumstances in this place, either in the House as a whole or in committee, where we have virtually concluded the debate and then been presented with another explanatory memorandum. That memorandum can only be effectively debated by our friends in the Senate. Once again we are subcontracting our legislative role to the Senate. The chances are that the Senate will do as the Opposition proposes and hive off all but the personal income tax rates amendments to a committee to examine them and we will be back here debating amendments that were i-itiated in the Senate. We could avoid - ll that pain. We could do so by consult-tion, and Senator MCMullan, who is responsible for these matters in the Senate,1 is well aware that we are happy to cooperate. Even when we do not agree with tM- measures, our objective is to help the Gdvernment achieve its stated objectives tnrough its legislation. There are two components here. There is the political argument which we will mount against the proposals with which we do not agree, but having done that, we want to see the legislation do what it is intended to do. Once again we are denied the opportunity in this forum to do the job we are paid to do. It is a basic part of our duties, as representatives of the Australian people, to debate the details of legislation, particularly in matters relating to tax laws. We are effectively being denied that opportunity in an unprecedented way. For the first time in my experience of 12 years or more in this Parliament, we have been presented with an explanatory memorandum on some late amendments, of which we had no advance warning, when the debate is virtually concluded. That is an absolutely unacceptable state of affairs by any standard. I know that the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes), who is dedicated to the Parliament, would also object were it not an embarrassment for him to criticise his own Government. I think that this is despicable and deplorable. Amendments agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Bill reported with amendments; report-by leave-adopted. Third Reading Bill (on motion by Mr Robert Brown)by leave-read a third time. NA 1990 Second Reading Debate resumed from 5 December 1990, on motion by Mr Robert Brown: That the Bill be now read a second time.",77
136,Mr ROCHER,INSURANCE AMENDMENT BILL,"There is not a lot that the Opposition wishes to say about the Insurance Amendment Bill because it is totally unobjectionable. Perhaps in passing I should put the point that in its present form section 37 of the Insurance Act 1973 provides that insurers whese activities are limited to restricted classes of persons and whose annual premiums do not exceed $500,000 may be exempted from the provisions of the Actprincipally those concerned with a reduced statutory reporting requirement. As the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) pointed out in his second reading speech, the Bill amends section 37 to increase the limit on annual insurance premiums to $750,000. It also provides for future increases to be made by regulation, and we do not oppose that. In his second reading speech the Minister mentioned that this increase of 50 per cent was to take account of inflation. I suggest that he refers to his Government's record on inflation. The figure will need to be nearer 60 per cent, so he is already short. He may wish to adjust the sum straight away by regulation after this Bill is passed, assuming that he wants to get it up to scratch. In passing, I mention the fact that the Act itself is under review. I am not sure whether the Minister is aware of that, but certainly I am. If he is, I wonder why we should fiddle around with an amendment of this dimension when it could and should have been incorporated in a Bill which we expect to come before the Parliament in the not too distant future if the Government can get off its backside and get on with it. However, it does not have a good record in that regard in some areas. I cannot see why the matter could not have been dealt with as one measure. These minor points aside, I advise the House that the Opposition does not oppose the Bill.",78
137,Mr WRIGHT,INSURANCE AMENDMENT BILL,"As has been explained by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), and also in the introductory speech by the Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Crean), the amendments before the House are straightforward and certainly of a non-contentious nature. As the honourable member for Curtin said, there is value in using the time to have a look at the total Act, and that is certainly in place at the moment. We all appreciate how important the insurance industry is. It is not something that is new. It is not a facet of the tieth century in these latter decades. It something that has been developing certainly post-war. I had the opportunity to meet with some of the insurance players at the end oflast year. We were discussing superannuation. We were discussing the changing character of the insurance industry. It was stressed to me at that time just how important those changes have been. We have seen a move from the post-war period where insurance was the issue to the situation now where superannuation is on everyone's lips. This has come about because of the policies of the Government where it has been pursuing some major changes in attitudes as regards planning for retirement. The industry is an important one. It plays an important part iri the nation's marketplace and, as I said, that importance is growing. It is growing because of Australia's need to gather together a pool of funds to try to maintain Australian equity in development. One hears constant cries-and I support the comments that are often made by the National Party of Australia-that we need to ensure there is Australian equity in the foreign ventures that come into this nation of ours. We do not have a lot of rich entrepreneurs. We certainly have the entrepreneurs, but we do not have the really wealthy ones-",79
138,Mr HOWARD,INSURANCE AMENDMENT BILL,Not too many now.,79
139,Mr WRIGHT,INSURANCE AMENDMENT BILL,"Yes, we certainly h-ve fewer now. But it is because of that that we probably need to take advantage of that pool of funds the insurance companies and superannuation bodies have access to. It certainly would improve our equity percentage in any development. It was stressed to me also in the discussions I had with the industry that the industry employs tens of thousands of people directly and indirectly. It was also stressed that insurance is vital to the quality of life of every Australian, whether it be insuring one's car so that one is covered in case something goes wrong; insuring one's house in case there is a fire; insuring one's property or getting down to life insurance. It was pointed out again that the life twen- insurance industry is now worth someis thing like $80 billion-that is just in asset terms. There are 58 life companies and four government life offices operating in this nation. In 1989, the premiums were worth $7.569 billion. So we are talking about a lot of money. That is just in relation to life insurance. If one looks across into the general area, there are 170 private companies plus the public enterprises, such as the State government offices, the workers compensation office and the Transport and Accident Commission-which you, Mr Deputy Speaker, would know about-in Victoria. If one looks at what their premium base is in anyone year, one sees that it amounts to $12.293 billion. So we are talking about a lot of money. As I said, this is an era of change and this change is certainly being approached with some vision by the companies. It is an era of change because of what we have done also within this Parliament in terms of superannuation law, and the companies seem to have taken up this challenge that we have thrown to them with new packages of superannuation. The innovation that they have brought about is again quite exciting. I want to stress the change because I wish to get to the point, as we start looking at insurance and superannuation in the future, that we should start to realise that this change will require a different approach within the Parliament, within the governments of the States and particularly within our education systems. As insurance itself becomes an even more important industry and as we rely on insurance more and then, in turn, on superannuation, we need to stress the need to understand how the system works. I do not want to start a questionnaire in this chamber and around the House, but I would suggest that if one was to run around asking what certain terms meant in the superannuation bag, we would have much error in answers to those questions. But coming back to the point of the changes taking place with superannuation: in 1979, there were 721,000 policies written; in 1989, this had grown to 2,294,000. The sum insured in 1979 was $40.94 billion; in 1989, the sum insured is $206.814 billion. The annual premium value in 1979 was $946m, but in 1989 it had gone to $5,356m or $5.356 billion. One can see the change also from an ordinary policy point of view. In 1979, there were in existence 5,979,000 policies-this is ordinary insurance, the old traditional type insurance. Today, that has only increased after 10 years to 6,422,000-an increase of only 460,000 in a decade. Yet policies written for superannuation have blown out from 721,000 to 2.29 million-in excess of three times. What we have seen with this change is greater responsibility placed on the companies, and the companies have tackled this with new plans. I read recently of the nest account of the Mutual Life and Citizens' Assurance Co Ltd and the National Mutual's flexible security plan. Because they understand also that people do not understand, they have gone out to promote seminars for clients. They have produced explanatory brochures that are in simple English, and there has been great cooperation at the organisational level, the LIFA level, the Life Insurance Federation of Australia level. I really believe that it has come about because of our own successful policies that have been developed in this Parliament and by this Government. We certainly have achieved much in that area. Back in 1983, less than 40 per cent of workers-and that is of the 7.3. million people employed in this country-had superannuation entitlement. In 1988, that just tipped the edge; it went to 51 per cent. I am told that in 1991 something like 70 per cent of employees now have some superannuation entitlement. This is vitally important when one looks at the way our population is changing. I pulled out some statistics and found that it is estimated that by the year 2021 there will be 3.9 million Australians aged 65 years and over; and the Australian Bureau of Statistics population projections show that the percentage of Australians over 80 years of age will grow from the 2 per cent that it was in 1987 to approximately 5 per cent by the year 2031. Taking that year again, the pensioner population will have increased from the 2.1 million back in 1987 to almost 6 per cent by 2031. So one can see that it is vitally important that our policies do work. I believe they have, but they have brought with them complications. How difficult it really is for anyone to understand the rules that apply, let alone the language. What does it mean, for instance, when someone talks about the 'reasonable benefit limit' or 'RBL' or 'preservation' or 'portability' or 'roll-over funds'? How does a worker test out what his 'vesting rights' will be; what does it mean? How does he really come to grips with 'approved deposit funds' which he has as an alternative for 'preservation'? What exactly does the 'highest annual salary' mean to people, or 'indexation', 'drawing down on funds' with the risk of attracting tax? Again on tax, what do the definitions mean and what do people understand when they hear 'untaxed elements', 'capital guarantee investments' and 'annuity rebates'? What I am suggesting to this chamber is that people do not understand, regardless of all the efforts on the part of the insurance companies and regardless of what the Insurance Superannuation Commission has tried to do. It has written an excellent booklet, which I praise to the hilt, in trying to explain everything. But most employees will not have access to that document. So I am suggesting that we need to come to grips with the difficulty in language and in terminology. We need to come to grips with the in-house terms used by the companies when they talk about 'term of life cover' or 'whole of life insurance' or 'endowment policies' and 'unbundled policies' and 'bundled policies' and 'standard plans' and 'bonuses' and 'convertibility' and 'definite terms'. Then they get into the 'investment portfolios' and the 'guaranteed portfolios' and the 'cash portfolios' and 'flexible plans'. It goes on and on to the point where most people say, 'Leave it to the insurance agent; leave it to the person who is selling it to me'. I do not intend to play the schoolteacher and take up the time of the House by going through every definition, but I want to suggest that there is a need for understanding because of the importance of insurance, and in particular superannuation, for the future of all Australians. As we grow older-and we are an ageing nation-more and more people will depend on superannuation. People are going to make mistakes now that will affect their capacity to live a reasonable life ill the 20, 30, 40 or 50 years they have to wait until they receive these benefits. People do not understand the old and the new. They do not appreciate the old concept of the bundled contract or the new concept of an unbundled contract. Whilst there is a real responsibility on the industry to explain this and to make sure that clients appreciate what they are signing, I am suggesting that there is a need for the education systems of this nation to include the whole concept of insurance and superannuation in the school curriculum. There is a need to ensure that at grades 10, 11 and 12 the future employees of this country learn something about insurance and superannuation. They are going to deal with insurance everyday. In the general insurance area they will be insuring their cars and their houses. When it comes to their future, they will be taking out superannuation policies. They will have fixed term policies, such as endowment policies. They will want to ensure that they have money when they move into their homes, so they will take out particular policies for 20 years hence. They also need to understand the basic insurance laws. Nothing I can find anywhere really puts the story together. There is nothing that tells the young person who is about to leave school about superannuation and annuities. One might say, 'He is only 16 or 17'. The point is that within about 12 months of his leaving school he is going to be asked to become involved in a superannuation scheme. The moment he leaves school he is going to have an insurance agent knocking at his door wanting to sell him something such as a fixed term policy. The moment he gets married and the marriage notice turns up in the newspaper, he will have an insurance agent knocking at the door. The moment a child is born to that family there will be an insurance agent knocking at the door. Yet we leave him to the mercy of the industry and his own ignorance. I argue that there is a strong case for the national government to take up the cudgels and use whatever powers of persuasion it has to encourage at the secondary level, at the post-secondary level and at those adjunct levels-be they technical and further education or whatever-the introduction of courses that will give people a good understanding of superannuation and insurance. Part of that study ought to include looking at the traps, such as entering into a scheme that is nonconvertible. Students should understand the traps of twisting, which is an insidious practice operating right here in the Australian Capital Territory and in every other State of Australia. Insurance agents go to a client to whom they have sold a previous policy or to a new client whom they have come across and whom they know is involved with another company and twist them out of the old policy and into a new plan or a new company. The person has no knowledge that he is going to lose the value of his premium. He has no knowledge that in the first two years of the insurance policy there is no cash value accruing. He has no understanding of the losses he is going to incur. The insurance industry is trying to dle this. It is trying to address house regulations and rules. It does not seem to be working; twisting has been part of the insurance industry now for decades and it continues to be part of it in 1991. Those are the sorts of traps that people need to be aware of. They need to understand how the bonus system works. They.need to understand the terminology. I argue that there has to be greater influSpeaker, ence on all companies across the board to get away from lawyer language, to move to non-lawyer language and simple English. As I said, I accept the role being played by companies in trying to selfregulate, but it is not enough. There may be value in the Insurance and Superannuation Commission taking up this issue and requiring companies writing new policies to advise the company with whom the client was previously involved or advise the company which held the previous policy. There may be a need to introduce a cooling-off period to give the insuree a chance to have a second thought and seek a second opinion. More importantly, we need to have some tough penalties. Exposures have taken place in the media lately of insurance agents who haveÂ· stashed away premiums for months on end. In fact, in some cases they have never gone on to the primary insurance company and bought the policy but have kept it for themselves. Others have misled people and misrepresented policies. Clearly, we need to have a hard look at the insurance rules that prevail. I take up the point made by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Curtin. We are looking at insurance law generally and at the Insurance Act specifically. I ask that, as that is done, the Parliament consider the points I have made. We should consider specifically the need to simplify. That is also our responsibility, even with the new laws we have been introducing since 1986 and 1987 relating to superannuation. I was given the task in 1989 of running in my electorate some seminars on superannuation. Following that, I had the opportunity to write a book on the matter. I decided to call it Superannuation Retirement, I think-I hanhave even forgotten the name of my own it by inbook, but I will find it.",79
140,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INSURANCE AMENDMENT BILL,I can assure the honourable gentleman that it is not in the short title of this Bill.,82
141,Mr WRIGHT,INSURANCE AMENDMENT BILL,"I am sure that it is not, but I know that you would like to read it-and probably have read it, Mr Deputy knowing your special interest in ensuring that your constituents are not ripped off and that they understand the superannuation laws.",82
142,Mr HOWARD,INSURANCE AMENDMENT BILL,"It must be a very memorable title. '- Mr WRIGHT-That was just a slip of memory. To conclude, I make the point that, having written the book and having all the assurances given to me that there would be no further changes for a long time, some changes were made on 15 February 1990-while the book was being printed. Having dealt with those changes and being told 'That's it', some further changes came out by way of memorandum on 28 and 29 June 1990. As I have gone back through the laws that exist, I believe, as does the Life Insurance Federation of Australia, that there is a need for further fine tuning. Taking up the point of the previous speaker and in the light of the views that I hold, I argue that we need to look again at the definitions, the need for simplification, lump sum tax, the reasonable benefit limits and the need to have different levels of RBL, and simplification of the vesting and preservation requirements. We need to get down to a change of attitude and, possibly, a greater generosity when it comes to taxation on pensions and annuities. I would argue for that. By the way, the book is called Security in Retirement: A New Understanding. Mr Robert Brown-I've got it.",82
143,Mr WRIGHT,INSURANCE AMENDMENT BILL,"The Minister has it. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Robert Brown) read a third time. CRIMES (INVESTIGATION OF COMMONWEALTH OFFENCES) AMENDMENT BILL 1990 Second Reading Debate resumed from 15 November 1990, on motion by Mr Duffy: That the Bill be now read a second time.  have before the House the Crimes (Investigation of Commonwealth Offences) Amendment Bill 1990, which seeks to insert a new part 1B in the Crimes Act 1914 to make provision for fixed pre-charge custodial periods in relation to Commonwealth offences. The coalition will not be opposing the Bill at the second reading stage, although it has very serious concerns with some aspects of it, and I will be moving some amendments in the committee stage. The Bill seeks to balance the requirements of law enforcement agencies against the need to protect civil liberties in the area of pre-charge detention procedures. However, a real question arises as to whether it has achieved the appropriate balance. My comments on the Bill will centre around three threshold questions. The first is whether power should be conferred upon police to detain arrested persons for the purposes of questioning or investigation. The second is whether, in the context of offences against Commonwealth law, it is necessary for there to be special Federal legislation. The third is what time constraints should be imposed if police are to be allowed to detain arrested persons. At common law there is no power to detain a person who is suspected of having committed a crime for the purpose of questioning that person or completing an investigation. Once a subject is arrested, the common law requires that he or she be brought before a justice of the peace or magistrate as soon as is reasonably practicable so that questions relating to his or her liberty can be determined. Any confessional material obtained from questioning conducted by police at a time after which the arrested person could have been brought before a magistrate is unlawfully obtained. The trial judge will have, of course, a discretion to exclude or admit such material, depending on what is considered fair in all the circumstances. The common law rule applies in New South Wales and has been given statutory force, albeit with slightly different formulations, in Queensland, Western Australia, Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory. In South Australia, the Northern Territory and Victoria, special provision has been made by way of legislation. In South Australia the relevant period is four hours, with an extension of time procedure allowing for extensions up to eight hours, and in Victoria and the Northern Territory a reasonable time period applies. By section 68 of the Judiciary Act 1903, in the case of offences against Commonwealth law, unless otherwise provided for, the law of the State or Territory in which the arrest is made is rendered applicable. There are some specific provisions in various Commonwealth statutes. In his second reading speech, the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) made special mention of a 1986 decision of the High Court of Australia in the case of Williams v. The Queen, a report of which can be found volume 66 of the Australian Law Reports at page 385. The Attorney-General claimed that, prior to the High Court's decision in Williams, it had 'been taken for granted that an arrested suspect could be questioned about an offence in the course of deciding upon a charge or In charges before taking him or her before Magistrate' . With respect, the High Court's ruling in Williams case created no new law and simply reaffirmed earlier High Court deperson cisions such as the Queen v. lorlano, a tory 1983 decision reported in volume 50 of in the Australian Law Reports at page 291. In Williams case, the High Court considThis ered the provisions of section 34A of the Tasmanian Justices Act 1959, which repower quires persons in custody to be brought before a justice 'as soon as is practicable' and overruled the position taken by the Tasmanian Court of Appeal. The Court of Criminal Appeal followed an earlier unreported decision by that court in 1984 in the case of Clark v. the Queen. In Clark's case, the Court of Criminal Appeal had taken the view that the exigencies of criminal investigation may be relevant in determining what is practicable in the context of the proviies sions of the Justices Act. Clark's case lowed the approach that English courts have adopted, an example of which can ing be found in the 1965 decision of the Enggreat lish Court of Appeal in Dallison v. reported in part 1 of the 1965 volume of Of the Queen's Bench Reports at page 348. vation In that case, the Master of the Rolls, Lord 1eft Denning, with whom Lord Justice Danckto werts agreed, held that the Commonend wealth law rule allows police to detain and question arrested subjects. Lord tice Danckwerts, at page 367 of the port, summed up the rationale behind this approach when he said: So long as such measures are taken reasonably, they are an important adjunct to the administra- rogation. tion of justice. By which I mean, of course, tice not only to the man himself but also community at large. The measures must, ever, be reasonable. Whilst there have been some differences in in approach by the various State supreme courts in Australia and the English courts, in Williams case the High Court was firmly of the view that the common law as developed in Australia does not permit the detention of arrested persons for the purposes of questioning or investigation. referring to the decision in Dallison v. a Caffery, Justices Wilson and Dawson of the High Court, at page 411 of the report, said: In the absence of precise limits upon the suggested power of the Police to detain an arrested for questioning, it would be an unsatisfacdevelopment, swinging all together too far, our vifw, in favour of increased investigative powers at the expense of individual freedom. really is what the Bill is all about. Firstly, it seeks to confer upon police a to detain for the purposes of questioning or investigation; secondly, having gone that far, it seeks to lay down precise limits upon the manner in which such a power should be exercised. Although we should always be reluctant to interfere with the time honoured civic rights developed over the centuries by our common law, I have reached the conclusion that in this area there is need for modification. It is a conclusion that has been made in the reports of various bodthat have been charged with the task folof examining the subject. In reaching such a conclusion, I am sensitive to the warnthat all legal students will recall of the legal philosopher of the eighteenth Caffery, century, Blackstone, who said: great importance to the public is the preserof this personal liberty: for if once it were .in the power of any, the highest, Magistrate imprison arbitrarily whomever he or his officers thought proper . . . there would soon be an of all other rights and immunities. JusAt the time Blackstone wrote this warnreing, which was the same time the common law rule developed, it was a duty of the magistrate to interrogate the arrested person and compel answers to the interIn the mid-nineteenth century, justhis investigative function was removed, to the but the powers of compulsory interrogahowtion that magistrates once had were not given over to the newly formed police. Bearing in mind the fundamental importance of the liberty of the person as the cornerstone of our common law rights, any interference with this liberty must be subject to strict safeguards which, fortunately, this Bill provides. That addresses the first threshold question involved in this matter-namely, whether police should have power to detain arrested persons for the purposes of questioning or investigation. The criminal justice system must not only serve to protect the rights of the accused but also to protect the interests of the community as a whole. In the context of Commonwealth offences, the second threshold question which needs to be considered is whether it is necessary or desirable that there be special Federal legislation to govern situations involving the arrest of persons for Commonwealth offences or whether the present system should be maintainednamely, that the law of the State or Territory in which the arrest takes place be rendered applicable. Over the past year, we have heard much from this Government about how it seeks to reform Federal-State relations by encouraging a spirit of cooperative federalism. However, we have seen very little concrete evidence of any such approach. Late last year, for example, we debated the Governments and Government Instrumentalities (Application of Laws) Bill, a Bill which we opposed because it sought to place the Commonwealth in a privileged position. I suspect that the Bill under present consideration may be yet another example of this Government riding roughshod over the States and Territories. I do not say that lightly, because I want to come onto the question of consultation that could have occurred between the Attorney General and his counterparts in the States and Territories. I ask the Attorney General, when he sums up on this Bill, to advise the House what consultation took place between the Federal Government and the governments of the States and Territories before the introduction of Bill. Has the Bill been considered by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General or by the. Australian Police Ministers Council? If it has been considered, what was the outcome of their deliberations? While I am raising some questions relating to Federal-State consultation, it might be convenient if I also raise some questions for the Attorney-General regarding what consultations he has had with Federal law enforcement agencies. I understand that the former Attorney General, the Hon. Lionel Bowen, had decided that instead of fixed time limits the relevant pre-charge custodial periods should be determined by what is considered to be reasonable in individual cases. In a letter dated 16 November 1990 from the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police to the Australian Federal Police Association, the Commissioner says: . . . the new position has been reached by a review process which did not involve further consultation with my officers or myself. In reversing the position reached by the last Attorney-General, I ask whether the current Attorney-General has consulted with the other Federal law enforcement agencies such as the Director of Public Prosecutions, the National Crime Authority or the Australian Customs Service. I find somewhat astonishing the suggestion that the Attorney, as the first law officer of the land, would contemplate introducing a Bill of this type, containing the far-reaching reforms that it does, without obtaining the views of the law enforcement agencies which will be responsible for its administration. I return now to the question of what impact the Bill may have on Federal-State relations. Given that there are variations both within Commonwealth law and between the States about pre-charge procedures, there are no doubt some anomalies in the present state of the law. The review of Commonwealth criminal law, the Gibbs Committee, concluded that in light of these anomalies it was undesirable that pre-charge detention periods for persons arrested for an offence against Commonwealth law should remain governed by State and Territory law. We have to questhis tion whetherÂ· the Bill actually removes these anomalies. Proposed subsection 23A (2) states that the provisions contained within the Bill do not: . . . exclude or limit the operation of a law of a State or Territory so far as it can operate rently . . . This provision is an example of what is sometimes referred to as 'roll-back legislation' which is designed to show that the Commonwealth does not intend to cover the field and therefore, by section 109 of the Constitution, render inapplicable any State or Territory law on the same subject matter. The mischief identified by the Gibbs Committee-namely, the uncertainty as to whether some parts of State law may still apply-may not have been remedied. For example, under section 464B of the Victorian Crimes Act provision is made whereby police may make an application to a Magistrates' Court for an order that persons held in prison be delivered to the police for the purpose of questioning. No similar provision is made in the Commortwealth Bill. In his second reading speech, the Attorney-General pointed out that when the Australian Law Reform Commission considered this subject it rejected the notion of conferring post-arrest investigation or detention powers upon the police. I assume from the Attorney's comments that he concurs with this view, for we see that proposed subsection 23B (3) provides that once an arrested person is remanded on bail or in custody by a magistrate the definition of arrest and the provisions of the Bill cease to apply. However, given the way that this Bill has been drafted, if a person has been remanded in prison for a Commonwealth offence it may be possible that either State or Federal police, having regard to the provisions of the Judiciary Act, could make an application under section 464B of the Victorian Crimes Act. We would therefore have the situation where one of the objects of the Bill has been circumvented. Another problem that arises in the area of Federal-State relations is the difficulties that this Bill maY impose upon law enforcement agencies when arresting persons suspected of committing offences' against both Commonwealth and State law. It is not uncommon for a person, having been charged with the importation of prohibited narcotics, for example-an offence under the Customs Act-to be concuralso charged with the offences of possessing and trafficking such narcotics, the latter offences being offences prescribed by State law. That is obviously only one illustration of the many operational problems that law enforcement agencies may be confronted with, given that the Bill imposes very different requirements to those found in the States and Territories. So we have a real concern that this Bill, if enacted, may have an adverse impact upon Federal-State relations in the law enforcement area. Our preference would be to see the development of uniform legislation by the States and Territories. That of tourse raises this very question of consultation. The Attorney, in hi- summation, will be able to advise me as to whether the consultation occurred. I do not know all the details, but on the prima facie evidence I think some gaps will appear in this consultative process, and if that is the case it ought to be abundantly clear that we need a more uniform approach. The first step that needs to be taken is to at least hold consultations in this arena so that we do not have the problems to which I have just referred. However, notwithstanding these concerns and the next concern I am going to raise, we will not be opposing the Bill as the amendments we intend to move in the committee stage are designed to minimise any such impact and bring the Bill in line with the provisions more commonly found in the States. Furthermore, when the Bill reaches another place our senators will consider-no final decision has yet been taken-taking steps to have it-referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. They will adjudge that at a later date. Having dealt with the second threshold question, I now turn to the final threshold question which was identified earliernamely, whether pre-charge detention periods should be determined by what is regarded as a reasonable amount of time for individual cases or whether they should be subject to prescribed maximum time limits. In 1984 the Victorian Parliament made changes to its Crimes Act to provide for a six hour pre-charge detention period. This led to very considerable disquiet amongst police and prosecuting authorities in Victoria and a committee was established, chaired by the Victorian Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr Coldrey, QC. In examining the matter, that Committee found that the six-hour rule, under the 1984 amendments, had serious shortcomings. They were: firstly, the six-hour period was believed to be inadequate in the case of complex investigations or where there were multiple offences; secondly, the necessity to apply for extensions of time unduly disrupted the continuity of investigations; thirdly, the six-hour period could easily be eroded by time lost in travelling, obtaining medical treatment or legal advice; fourthly, in some cases it was simply not practicable to bring the suspect before a magistrate where, for example, he or she had been admitted to hospital; and, finally, there was a risk that the upper time limit could be regarded as the norm and arrested persons might be detained for six hours where it was not necessary for the purposes of the particular investigation involved. In essence, the Coldrey Committee found that the prescription of a fixed period was too inflexible and recommended that police be required to take an arrested person before a magistrate within a reasonable time of the commencement of custody if that person had not already been released, either on bail or unconditionally. In 1988 the Victorian Parliament again amended its Crimes Act to implement the recommendations of the Coldrey Committee. I acknowledge that the provisions in this Bill draw upon some of the lessons learned from the Victorian experience and improve upon the Victorian 1984 amendments--for example, in regard to so-called dead time. Nonetheless, I am heavily influenced by that Victorian experience. Whilst it may be that the majority of cases can be easily dealt with under fixed time periods, there will be exceptional cases and very complex cases for which provision must be made. Take, as an example, the case where police arrest a person for a traffic offence say in Melbourne and find out through questioning that the person has been involved in a much more serious offence hundreds of miles away. By excluding the so-called dead time, there is no provision to exclude the time the police may spend travelling to that other place to gather further information that could assist in questioning the suspect, or which could otherwise form the basis of a charge for that more serious offence. As I said at the outset, it is a question of striking an appropriate balance between the interests of law enforcement and the need to safeguard individual liberty. The concept of reasonableness-a notion which permeates our common law-does provide such a balance. It is a question of determining, of course, what is reasonable, and what is reasonable in an individual case. That is a question which can ultimately be determined by the trial judge, who of course has the discretion to exclude evidence if he believes it has been unreasonably obtained. It may be said by some that the concept of what is reasonable lacks a high degree of certainty, but offset against this it is clear that it allows for much greater flexibility. What is considered reasonable will of course depend upon all the circumstances of the case. It is not a question of what the police alone believe is reasonable; it is an objective test determined by having regard to what a reasonable person, guided by the considerations which ordinarily regulate the conduct of human affairs, would or would not do. Furthermore, the safeguards which are provided by the law relating to arrest and the protections afforded by this Bill, as well as the discretion that courts have to exclude improperly obtained evidence, will work against arbitrary or protracted detentions. The final concern that I have relates to an element of discrimination. In this Bill we have a time limit imposed for questioning of four hours but in the case of those under the age of 18 years or Aboriginals or Torres Strait Islanders, it is two hours. With my quaint notions of the pursuit of anti-discrimination, I may be viewed as old-fashioned but I take the view that all people who are Australian citizens ought to be treated equally. It also seems to me to be fundamental in terms not only of the law but also of democracy that all adult Australian persons ought to be treated equally, and I see no reason for limiting the period to two hours for Aboriginals. If I am wrong in terms of this question of discrimination and if it is accepted that we ought to have a special rule for Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders, then in some cases-and this is no reflection on them-it may be the nature of those certainly who are not urban dwelling Aboriginals that a longer period is needed. My starting point is that in this community of ours we ought to be treating all adult males and females on the same basis, and the police ought not have these additional difficulties placed in their way. I have already said, of course-it is innate to my remarks-that I think this fixed time is too inflexible. I also believe that four hours is insufficient. Six hours was found to be insufficient in Victoria, and that is why the change was made to a reasonable period of time. We are taking a further step down a dangerous and questionable path if we start in this arena making a rule of four hours for all Australian citizens above the age of 18, save and except for those who are Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders. When the Attorney-General introduced this measure, he gave no justification for such a discrimination. I do not want to dwell on it at any further length, as one of the great tragedies in our society today is .that if one points to these things, one is tarred with all sorts of disgraceful adjectives because one is allegedly making some sort of racist attack. I think my record in this Parliament is such that at least I would be excused from that. I do not comprehend the reason for distinguishing here and making. a different period for questioning by the police. If equality means anything under the law, it ought to mean what I am pointing to. In conclusion I would like to emphasise that we are supportive of the basic principles underlying the Bill, as it seeks to provide checks and balances in the area of pre-charge detention procedures. However, we have very strong reservations about the extent of consultation that led up to the introduction of the Bill, the impact it may have upon Federal-State relations and in particular the appropriateness of having fixed time limits for precharge detentions.",83
144,Mr MELHAM,INSURANCE AMENDMENT BILL,"It is important at the outset that I place on the public record 'my qualifications in speaking to the Crimes (Investigation of Commonwealth Offences) Amendment Bill. They certainly guide me in what I have to say. For more than a decade before entering the Parliament I worked firstly as a public solicitor witFt the Legal Aid Commission of New South Wales, and then as a barrister and public defender in New South Wales. Throughout that period I specialised in the area of criminal law, exclusively defending people charged with serious criminal offences who were granted legal aid. I also happen to be a member of the New South Wales Bar Association, the New South Wales Society of Labor Lawyers and the New South Wales Council for Civil Liberties. I know that each of those groups has some reservation about extending police powers to include the power to detain. I have come to a different conclusion from those outlined in the submissions they have made to respective law enforcement bodies. It is my view that the scheme provided by this Bill is a welcome reform in the law of criminal investigation, and that it brings Australia much closer to compliance with the standards established by the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It provides a sound model which several States should be encouraged to follow. I know that there is consensus in terms of the majority of the Bill, and it would be superfluous to go into those areas. Basically I will concentrate on what I envisage is the difference between the Government and the Opposition in terms of a reasonable time as against a fixed time. It is important that we concentrate on such differences. I want to begin by quoting from the case of Williams and the Queen, reported in 161 Commonwealth Law Reports at page 278. At page 296, Justices Mason and Brennan have this to say: It should be clearly understood that what is in issue is not the authority of law enforcement agencies to question suspects, but their authority to detain them in custody for the purpose of interrogation. If the legislature thinks enhance the armoury of law enforcement, at least the legislature is able-as the courts are not-to prescribe some safeguards which might ameliorate the risk of unconscionable pressure being applied to persons under interrogation while they are being kept in custody. Basically in relation to the question of whether it should be a reasonable time or a fixed time, Justices Wilson and Dawson at page 311 say the following: To countenance a period of detention in police custody after arrest, without specific limits, for such time as might be reasonably necessary to enable the police to obtain the evidence upon which to charge the suspect, is unacceptably openended and quite contrary to what was (and in Australia, in our view, still is) the law. At page 313 of their joint judgment they also had the following to say: If the law requires modification then it is better done . . . by legislation. For there must be safeguards, if necessary in the form of time limits, and they must be set with a particularity which cannot be achieved by judicial decision. Moreover, it is better that legislative change should take place against the background of the common law as it has been understood in this country, which has consistently viewed detention for the purpose of investigation as an unwarranted encroachment upon the liberty of the person. There have been a number of inquiries in relation to time limits. I think the first and the most relevant one that I want to call upon is the criminal investigation report No.2. It is the interim report by the Law Reform Commission dated 5 September 1975. Page 38, paragraph 87,this is pre-Williams-headed 'Present Law and Practice'-says: It is well established at common law that the power of police (and private citizens) to arrest exists only for the purpose of taking the suspect before a justice or magistrate to be dealt with according to law. The corollary is that a detention will become unlawful if there is unreasonable delay in so doing. The fundamental policy is that the law enforcement process should move as fast as possible from the committed executive level to the uncommitted judicial level. The Commission goes on to recommend at page 147, paragraph 329: The four-hour period should be, and be regarded as, the maximum rather than the norm. In relation to the four-hour limit at page 39 the Committee said: it right to The Commission is of the opinion,we should bear in mind that the one dissentient was Mr F.G. Brennanafter carefully canvassing alternative. opinions, that there ought to be a precise limit set for police custodial investigation. The proposal is, in outline, as follows. (a) No person taken into custody for an offence (or group of offences) shall be questioned or subjected to any other investigative procedure for a period longer than four hours from the commencement of the custody. It goes on to allow for an extension period by bringing that person before the magistrate. Paragraph 90, page 40, summarises the argument. It states: The argument for having some explicit time period fixed for custodial investigation is as follows. The present vague parameters are satisfactory neither for suspects nor policemen. For suspects, the reason is obvious enough: too many people are being kept in police custody too long. For policemen, the difficulty in the present situation lies in its uncertainty; no one really knows what kind of delay will be held to be reasonable for what kind of case. Hitherto, when the only sanction for unreasonable delay has been an admonishment from the bench and the unlikely prospect of a civil suit for false imprisonment, this uncertainty could no doubt be tolerated by police officers with composure. But if the Commission's recommendations are accepted as to a more effective exclusionary rule of evidence and a police discipline code which can be enforced through externally initiated complaints, then it will become much more important for the wotking policeman to know with some precision what he can and what he cannot do. This is the clincher in view of what the Australian Federal Police Association is now saying: In the public sittings the Commission was urged by police representatives on numerous occasions to formulate all its recommendations with as much precision as possible. We were told to abjure generalised statements of civil rights and guarantees which express principles in large and general terms and leave it to the courts to fill in the details. The present context is one in which the Commission feels inclined to accept vice. Why four hours? The figure was fixed upon as being on the evidence before the Commission the shortest period within which, in the great majority of cases, the post-arrest investigation is brought to fruition and the subject charged or released. American studies have suggested that as many as 97 per cent of cases are cleared in this time. Local research has produced figures of a similar order. That was back in 1975. Subsequent studies have really shown that not much has changed. We should bear in mind that in this legislation we also have the ability to extend that four-hour period for a further eight hours. Discussion paper 16 was released by the New South Wales Law Reform Commission in 1987, titled Police Powers ofArrest and Detention. It is a great tragedy that the final report of the New South Wales Law Reform Commission is not yet to hand. My inquiries reveal that it will be shortly tabled by the State Attorney General for New South Wales. There have been some problems with printing. That Parliament reconvenes next week. Hopefully that report will be available when the matter comes before the Senate. One can glean from the discussion paper the track upon which the Law Reform Commission was heading. It was a law reform commission that was made up of the following people: Paul Byrne, a former public defender, a former Commissioner of the New South Wales Law Reform Commission, a former director of the Criminal Law Review Division in New South Wales, presently practising at the New South Wales bar, with an extensive criminal practice; Greg James, QC, with an extensive criminal practice at the New South Wales bar, who regularly appears before the High Court and has been engaged by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions on numerous occasions; the Honourable Justice Jane Mathews, a former Crown Prosecutor in New South Wales and a distinguished judge with an impeccable record when it comes to the criminal law; Ronald Sackville; and the Honourable Mr Justice ./ that adJ.R.T. Wood, a justice of the Supreme Court in New South Wales. What do they say? We should bear in mind that this is a discussion paper that was presented after a range of submissions were received by police associations, Crown prosecutors, magistrates, and district court and supreme court judges. On page 13 this appears: We consider that there must be some limits in relation to the time during which arrested people may be held in custody before being brought before a court. The major policy question is whether this should be a 'reasonable period' bearing in mind all the circumstances or whether there should be a specified maximum period. They come down in favour of a specified maximum period. On page 14 they say: We believe that there are three major arguments in favour of a specified maximum time period. Firstly, if the police were able to detain a person for a 'reasonable' period, there would be, in virtually every case, scope for argument as to whether the period for which the accused person was held was 'reasonable'. As someone who has practised in the criminal jurisdiction for more than 10 years and seen others performing in that jurisdiction, I think that is pretty close to the mark. Time and time again there would be voire dires as to what constitutes a reasonable time. We would have arguments along 'the lines of Williams's case. Is four hours a reasonable time? Is 72 hours reasonable, et cetera? Some of these arguments may be dismissed as without substance but the point is that nearly every case has the potential for such an argument. This is not me; this is the New South Wales Law Reform Commission. The specification of a period of time will, particularly if it is reasonably long, eliminate those arguments in the vast majority of cases. The Victorian experience so far has been that in 99.5 per cent of cases the police have not required more than six hours detention following arrest for an adequate investigation of a suspected offence. Let us bear in mind that this legislation allows four hours, with an extension of eight hours, for someone who is cooperating with the police. Secondly, the specification of a nominated period allows a ceiling to be put on the intrusion upon personal liberty constituted by detention following arrest. It also ensures, if the period ably short, that the conduct of police in detaining people who have been arrested is subject to review by a court at an early stage. Thirdly, the specification of a nominated period removes the subjective nature of the decision as to whether a certain course of conduct is 'reasonable'. Both the police and the arrested person know precisely, presuming they are aware of their respective rights and duties, what is permissible and what is unlawful. They say: . . . there is the need to balance the community interest in effective law enforcement with protection of individual liberty. In the second place, there is the goal of making such a clear so that it may be applied more predictably and with greater certainty. The code must be sufficiently clear to enable its provisions to applied by a police officer or private citizen ing, usually under conditions of great emotional stress, without the lUxury of being able to any minute details that the code may contain. Basically, I come down in favour of the specific periods as against the reasonable time period because of the certainty relation to the accused and the ficers. The police can act with certainty. Another report was released in March 1989-Review of Commonwealth Crimithe nal Law-Interim Report, Detention Peacock), Before Charge. Again, the people who constituted that committee were the Hon. Sir Harry Gibbs, the Hon. Mr Justice R.S. Watson, and Mr A.C.C. Menzies. pleased That committee recommended a fixed period of time. True it is that adopt the four hours that this Bill adopts, but on balance the committee recomjects mended the six hours. At page 36 of report it recommended: If a fixed time is to be prescribed, the Review Committee would recommend that the period fixed be six hours in the case of offences able by imprisonment for a period exceeding months, and four hours in other cases. In effect, what it is saying is that for offences of 12 months imprisonment and less, the initial period need be only four hours. The Attorney-General in his secof ond reading speech on this Bill put more eloquently than I the reasons why he lieves it is preferable to have that hour period as against the uncertainty a six-hour period for offences carrying is reasonmore than 12 months imprisonment and the four-hour period for offences that carry 12 months imprisonment or less. Basically that is because, in terms of the initial investigation and charging, police in the higher courts, or indeed in the magistrates courts, can reduce the charge from an indictable one that carries the more serious sentence to one that carries. the lesser period of imprisonment, and it does not leave it open for overcharging. I believe that the Bill is worthy of supthe port in its entirety. I urge the Opposition to rethink its amendment and to give concode sideration to supporting the Bill in its entirety. It is innovative legislation; it is be vanguard legislation; it is legislation that actshould be adopted by each of the individual States. I look forward to the New to refer South Wales Law Reform Commission's report being tabled in the near future in the New South Wales Parliament. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs in Sullivan)-Order!

145,Mr ALDRED,INSURANCE AMENDMENT BILL,"As my colleague the shadow Attorney-General, honourable member for Kooyong (Mr has stated, the Opposition supports the Crimes (Investigation of ComRt monwealth Offences) Amendment Bill 1990 in general terms and is particularly that under its provisions the video recording of police interviews with susit did not pects will be permissible. However, the Opposition completely rethe notion of timed interviews and the fully supports the amendment to be moved by the shadow Attorney-General to allow a reasonable time for police interviews. We do this mainly on two punishgrounds. The first is the complexity of 12 many Australian Federal Police (AFP) investigations, which often involve examining sophisticated and deviously planned illicit schemes requiring lengthy interrogation. The second is the differentiation interview times between two categories of Australian citizens. To be specific, beAborigines, Torres Strait Islanders and fourpersons under the age of 18 are to be of subject to only two-hour interviews while those who are over 18 and not Aborigines Crimes Amendment Bill or Torres Strait Islanders are to be interviewed for four hours. The Opposition finds this differentiation completely repugnant, as well as being totally unnecessary. Let us consider these significant concerns in more detail. In order to appreciate the position of the Federal Police in their fight against crime on behalf of the Australian people, we must understand the type of complex criminal investigations with which they are involved. I refer particularly to the areas of their work which apply to organised crime, drug trafficking, fraud against the Commonwealth, including social security fraud, and investigations into departmental corruption. A further area of investigation which has national and international connotations is, of course, those investigations which are conducted by the AFP at the request of Interpol, the international police organisation. The official Federal Police view is abundantly clear. Here I would like to quote from a letter sent to Mr Chris Eaton, National Secretary of the Australian Federal Police Association, by  Federal Police. The letter reads in part: I believe that the imposition of arbitrary constraints on the interrogation of suspects important and complex matters is impractical and likely to impede justice, and is therefore against the public interest. I hold the view these constraints will result in lower detection and conviction rates. Mr MCCauley in his letter then went on to refer to the recent Victorian experience where, as we know, the six-hour limitathere tion on police interviews proved to be dismal failure. The lack of consultation with police ferred to in this letter also seems curious, especially since the line taken by the presFederal police. ent Attorney-General (Mr Duffy), insisting on fixed time interviews, is in very marked contrast to the position taken in 1989 by a former Attorney-General, Mr Lionel Bowen-and the Labor Caucus at the time, I might add-who decided that reasonable time was very much the ferred option. Here the Opposition is also moved ask whether the views of State commiswealth-as 13 February 1991 REPRESENTATIVES 509 sioners have been sought, since State police are often empowered to interview when no Commonwealth officers are available. For instance, is the Attorney General aware of the concern in South Australia that this Commonwealth Bill will, if implemented, severely impede South Australian police in their ability successfully to prosecute Commonwealth offences? I would also ask the Attorney-General whether he is aware that the South Australian police in the short term may in fact not be able to investigate Commonwealth offences at all for a number of very practical reasons. These reasons include the expense involved in extensive retraining of officers who will have to operate under two different sets of regulations concerning the timing of interviews and the failure to be able to meet the increased costs involved in installing the necessary electronic equipment for recording interviews as provided for in this legislation. At present, for mainly economic reasons, the South Australian police video recording implementation program is limited to two static units in the Adelaide time metropolitan area. While it may be feasiin ble to utilise these units for interviews taking place in the city and its immediateÂ· that environs, no such facilities exist-none at all-as yet in country or remote areas of South Australia. Disquiet about this legislation will also be found in Queensland. It is recognised that the Crimes (Investigation of a Commonwealth Offences) Amendment Bill 1990 now before us will markedly affect rethe conduct of investigations into Commonwealth matters by State as well as If projected difficulties are not satisfactorily resolved, the Queensland police service might be compelled to decline any responsibility whatever for the investigation of Commonwealth offences. Queensland police officers frequently investigate preCommonwealth offences such as theft, false pretences, receiving and wilful damto age under the Crimes Act-Commonwell as offences against the telecommunications legislation, the Public Order (Protection of Persons and Property) Act 1971 and various State offences which are prosecuted as Commonwealth offences by virtue of the Commonwealth Places (Application of Laws) Act 1970. The Queensland experience dictates that the imposition of a fixed time for the conduct of suspect interviews is considered utterly foolish, as is the view demonstrated in other jurisdictions that I have referred to. This could be particularly so with regard to investigations into corporate crime, where an extensive range of documents must be shown to a subject before they can be successfully tendered to a court as exhibits. One has to reasonably ask how that can be possibly fitted into a fixed time interview of two hours or four hours. In the Northern Territory, where State authorities are allowed reasonable time to interview suspects, similarly there are a number of concerns, some of which relate to Aboriginals, Torres Strait Islanders and persons under the age of 18 years only being given a two hour interview period. My information on this particular matter is contained in a letter from the Northern Territory Attorney-General, Mr Daryl Manzie, to the shadow Attorney-General in this place and is dated 1 February 1991. In his letter, Mr Manzie emphasises the point that Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders often require more time to interview, in fact, not less. He states that there often has to be a detailed explanation given to them concerning electronic devices and that the time taken to enable that person to demonstrate on tape that the effect of the caution is clearly understood can be extremely lengthy. He also mentions that interpreters are sometimes required-a further complication, which of course further delays the interview. Apart from the question of different categories of Australians being treated difwhich ferently, Mr Manzie, the Northern Territory Attorney-General, has a number of other objections to certain features of the Bill, some of which would apply to those areas of Australia where vast distances are involved. For instance, Mr Manzie points out that section 23c (6) (a) requires a person to be taken to the nearest premises, which may well affect the quality of the investigation. He gives the example of a recent case in the Northern Territory where a suspect was apprehended in Alice Springs sometime after the commission of an offence which had been committed in Darwin. The investigating officers were in Darwin while the suspect was at the nearest premises, that is, the Alice Springs police station. The logistics and the problems that flow from that are quite obvious. Mr Manzie refers to section 23G which presupposes that there are means readily available by which telecommunication can be made; whereas in practical terms, in a place like the Northern Territory with its vast distances and remote areas, there are sometimes no telephone facilities for that particular purpose whatsoever. There are many other objections contained in the letter which I will later seek to table. In conclusion, it would appear that all Australian police forces, be they Federal, State or territorial, object most passionately to the proposed fixed maximum interview times which they consider will shackle all law enforcement officers in their fight against crime in this country. Consequently one is moved to reasonably ask why the Government has taken this option instead of the reasonable time preferred by the Opposition, by the various police forces throughout this country and even, I might add, by the former Labor Attorney-General, Mr Lionel Bowen. Surely fixed time interviews will serve only to help criminals in general and the perpetrators of organised crime in particular. I strongly support the amendment to be moved by the shadow Attorney-General, and in conclusion I seek leave to table the letter from Commissioner MCCauley to the Australian Federal Police Association, I referred to earlier, the letter from the Northern Territory Attorney-General, Mr Daryl Manzie, to our shadow Attorney-General in this place and the supporting letter that was provided with that from the Minister for Police, Fire and Emergency Services in the Northern Territory, Mr Marshall Perron. Leave granted.",91
146,Mr KERR,INSURANCE AMENDMENT BILL,"It is to pleasing that the Opposition has adopted a constructive attitude to this legislation, which generally regularises arrangements for the interviewing of persons who are suspected of crimes following decisions the Williams case. But there has been too glib assertion of the public interest the debate around the question of whether there should be what is called a reasonquiries able time provision or a fixed time prolength, vision. It is not the case that opinion on this issue is singularly in favour of what is called a 'reasonable time'. In fact the ious law societies and bar associations Australia have strongly urged that we should maintain the pre-Williams posijustice tion, which was essentially that police an obligation to take a suspect directly a magistrate as soon as practicable after his or her arrest and detention. The common law indeed has never relibertarians cognised any capacity of the police to hold a suspect once an arrest occurs for the purpose of interrogation. That was always the law. It had perhaps been more honoured in the breach than in the oblightly servance, but the Williams case made it particularly patent that that could no longer continue because confessions tained or admissions made during of interview whilst a suspect was held outside the provisions of the common law would be rejected in evidence. It is not the case that the law has ever been that a police officer is entitled to hold a person for the purpose of interrogation. Indeed the whole basis of the common law has been that a free person is not subject to detention at all unless placed under arrest and that an arresting officer bears a burden of having good cause for making that arrest and is subject to alties for false arrest if he makes an arrest without proper basis. It is not a proper basis for an arrest at common law that entertains a suspicion which he must ther develop by way of interviewing a suspect. So we are moving by this measure far away from what has been the law in this country since settlement. We are moving a situation where, for interview purposes, we actually empower police officers to arrest and hold against their will for a period of time citizens suspected of crimes. However, we are not doing away in with a right to silence. And, for example, a it remains the case that the police have in ample powers where persons are cooperative to ask them to assist with their inand to interview those persons at as long as they would wish, so long as their arrangement is purely voluntary. This Bill regulates that area where there is an involuntary holding of a person and varan interview conducted in a circumstance of of compulsion. We are moving to a situation where we recognise the interests of ought to allow the police to have had some rights to exercise such interviews. to But let us not be mistaken; we do so against the raised voices of all the law societies of this country, all the bar associations, against the views of many civil and against the express platform of the Australian Labor Party. This legislation is raising issues of great substance and the Government does not make these judgments lightly. It does not move to a situation where it will entertain the detention of a citizen by the police for the purpose of interview, but it obdoes come down in the balance of public a period interest to permit that. Much has been argued about the period of time of the interview and there have been many assertions made about whether a period of four hours will prove adequate. I regret to say that much of that debate is misinformed and flows from the reality that in the past, before the introduction of video recording, interviews were prolonged and complex, tedious and time consuming. Essentially what occurred was that a police officer would ask pena question; he or she would then be obliged to type that question on an interview form; the person being interviewed he would then respond; the answer, in turn, furwould be typed and the interview would proceed. Given that the typing was often done by officers not particularly typing, the process was prolonged. I speak as a person who has sat through a number of such interviews as an adviser to persons in detention. We move in this Bill in a very important ancillary area to introduce the video recording or tape recording of all records of interview. That will bring about a revolution in terms of the time necessary for the conduct of police records of interview. There is only one empirical study that exists and there is only one police force which has tested this-the Tasmanian police force. A study was conducted and a report written by Detective Inspector Luppo Prins on behalf of the Tasmanian Police Force on the video recording of police interviews pilot project. It was reported to the Australian Institute of Judicial Administration Ninth Annual Conference in Melbourne between 18 and 19 August last year, 1990. The first part of Detective Inspector Luppo Prins's paper deals with the introduction of video recording by the Tasmanian Government, which introduced a 12-month pilot program for the electronic recording of police interviews. It sets out the methodology, the establishment of a video tape interview room and a filming room and explains how the technique was instituted. It then goes through a number of technical explanations in relation to the equipment and supplies that were used and the methods that were established to train police officers as both investigators and video technicians. The report then proceeds to explain the method of operation, which was by the simultaneous use of two video tapes and one audio tape for each interview. The multiple tapes were part of a process to prevent any potential abuse of the system by interference with the tapes. The first video tape is referred to as a master tape and is treated in the same way as any other original confession and is ultimately tendered. A copy tape is used by the prosecutor, defence solicitors and investigating officers. The tape may be copied many times. The audio transcription tape is a backup in case of any mechanical problems and it can also be copied for the use skilled at of any interested parties. The police conducted many interviews. They recorded entire interviews, and the basis upon which that process was carried out is established and set out in the report. Between 6 October 1988 and 31 July 1989, a total of 446 interviews with suspects took place. The interviews were in connection with various crimes and offences as follows: 346 crimes; 50 drug related matters; 36 offences under the Police Offences Act; 5 serious traffic matters; 5 gaming offences and 4 miscellaneous matters. Charges were preferred against the suspects in 425 of the video taped interviews. The report proceeds: The broad range of matters under investigation during the period under review clearly shows that video taped interviewing can be applied to any area of investigation. Approximately 85% of interviews resulted in admissions or confessions by suspected persons. This indicates that the video taping did not really inhibit either the suspects or the interviewing members. On the point that is important in relation to timing, it is said that four hours is not going to be adequate. I will quote the section in the report entitled 'Length of Interviews': The longest interview during the period under review was two hours and forty-seven minutes and the shortest, four minutes. The average interview time was twenty-six minutes. It should be noted that six interviews went over two and a half hours. Only two of these resulted in charges being preferred. The others involved questioning re homicides for Coroners Court. The average interview time for a single offence of burglary and stealing was twelve minutes. The average time for such an interview prior to 'Video Taping' is estimated at thirty-five minutes. It seems clear from analysis of the interviews that video taped interviews take less than a third of the time of a typed 'Record of Interview'. This is a considerable time saving for operational detectives and of course permits more time to be spent in investigating rather than interrogating. That is very important because much of this debate is conducted on the misunderstood assumption that the techniques and technology of interviewing will be prolonged over a period longer than four hours. That certainly would have been the case if the police had to go on in the old fashioned way of conducting records of interview. But one of the very important elements of this Bill is the introduction of recorded transcription of records of interview. I will leave it to honourable members and others to follow through that report. Detective Inspector Luppo Prins is a most senior officer of the Tasmanian Police Force. His report has been endorsed ultimately by the Tasmanian Government. It has now introduced a program requiring all interviews to be video taped and that program has proved very successful. The bottom line is that video taping cuts the time involved in recording records of interview by two-thirds. The longest interview out of the 446 interviews I mentioned earlier was of less than three hours duration, so even in the most complex matters it is unlikely that the fourhour period will be exceeded. If it is exceeded in an extraordinary circumstance, and if the compulsory detention of an offender past that four hours, still in extremely unusual, rare circumstances which I would anticipate occurring most infrequently, were to be required, there is provision in this Bill for a magistrate to extend the period for a further eight hours. Exploring this to the limits in terms of hypothetical possibilities, I think it is a fantastical conclusion to suggest that the police could not conduct their investigations properly within those time frames. It is important in this context to realise that the four hours that is provided-and the eight-hour period that may be further ordered by a magistrate in exceptional circumstances-will in almost all circumstances be more than adequate, and is exclusive of periods which we might call dead time, which is time necessarily taken up in the ordinary process of getting somebody to a place of interview or providing him with legal advice. This is made plain in proposed new section 23c (6) which states that, in ascertaining the period for the purposes of subsection (4) or (5), certain times must be disregarded-that is, the time it takes to get somebody from the place at which he is arrested to the place where the investigating officer has facilities for making. audio or video transcriptions; the time during which the questioning of a person is suspended or delayed to allow the person to communicate with a legal practitioner, friend, parent or guardian; the time during which questioning is suspended to allow a legal practitioner, friend or whoever to arrive; if an interpreter is arranged, the time it takes for the interpreter to arrive; the time during which an . interview is suspended to allow a person to ireceive medical attention; the time during which it is necessary to suspend an interview to wait for the effects of intoxication on a person to wear off; any time during which the questioning is suspended to allow for an identification parade to be arranged or conducted; and, finally, the time that is needed to secure a prolongation of the period of detention if an application is made to a magistrate. If one goes through those very extensive provisions one sees that what is provided for in the Bill is essentially four clear hours for the purposes of questioningfour uninterrupted hours. That is against a background where in the only survey that has been methodologically soundly carried out, the longest ever recorded interview, out of 446 records of interview, took less than three hours and the majorquite ity of interviews were disposed of in far under an hour. It is important, against that background, to put into context some of the things that areÂ· being said in this debate. It is often the case in debates which affect group interests that people take entrenched positions and overstate their cases. In the present debate there is a polarisation of opinion in our community. On the one hand, as I have said, there are those from the civil liberties movements, the bar associations and the law societies who are repelled entirely by the idea of the police having any power whatsoever to hold people after their arrest without taking them immediately before a magistrate and instead holding them simply for the purposes of further investigation, interrogation, identity parades and the like. On the other hand, there are the legitimate interests of the police who, naturally, would wish to extend, as far as is within the legitimate range of debate, the authority they have to pursue their interests-that is, the investigation of crimes in pursuit of criminals and making sure that they are as unencumbered with any restraints as possible by legislative means. It is our job as legislators to draw the balance, to find the lines, to make the judgments that are necessary in these complex issues. Unfortunately, I believe that members of the Australian Federal Police have allowed themselves to be drawn into making extraordinary and extravagant claims in defence of an indefensible proposition-that is, a four-hour period will not suffice in order to allow them to conduct their proper policing responsibilities. lieve this measure does make the proper balance. We are moving away from the law which was established in this country froni the time of settlement. We are accepting that the police can detain persons for the purpose of interrogation and for the purpose of seeking from them answers to questions they have put to them. We are moving away from what was the law previously-that a person under arrest must be arrested simply for cause and taken to a magistrate and that would be the end of that process. Having made that recognition, we have a responsibility to make the correct balance. We must not throw out the civil liberties baby with the bath water. There are important public considerations and it is not apposite-it is not right-to allow lack of clarity in this area when the evidence on the ground, in operation, in the only State where this has been established by way of empirical evidence shows plainly that four hours is more than adequate in all the circumstances. I commend those general remarks to the House. These are important measures. They are breakthrough measures and I believe they will contribute a great deal to certainty and understanding of the legal rights of the individual vis-a-vis the police force. They avoid the complexities of people not knowing precisely what their rights are and I believe the balance has been correctly drawn.",94
147,Mr FILING,INSURANCE AMENDMENT BILL,"ln speaking to the Crimes (Investigation of Commonwealth Offences) Amendment Bill, I wish to firstly agree with the Attorney General (Mr Duffy) as to the need for investigating police to have the power to detain a suspect for questioning after having arrested that person. I share the Minister's view that there is a responsibility to ensure that the laws made by the Parliament are able to be properly enforced, so as to afford appropriate protection to the community. This responsibility requires a constant review of the ability of those charged to investigate breaches of our laws to perform their duties effecI betively and efficiently. I am, of course, mindful of the dual responsibility as expressed by the Attorney-General to maintain and defend the civil liberties inherited by us from centuries of evolution and practice. It is my belief that the Australian criminal justice system is one of the fairest models in the world and the relationship between the elements of it sufficiently balanced as to ensure the maintenance of a healthy mix between the issues of law enforcement and freedom from oppression by the state. The Attorney, in introducing the Bill, referred to the dilemma presented by the Williams case of 1986 when the accused appealed against the decision by the Supreme Court of Tasmania-the Court of Criminal Appeal-to uphold an earlier appeal by the State Attorney-General and order a retrial of the 26 offences of burglary and theft for which Williams was acquitted after a voir dire in the trial excluded confessional records of interview obtained by police during a period of detention considered unlawful by the trial judge. My differences with the Attorney arise from his use of a maximum time limit in which an arrested person may be held for questioning or investigation before being taken before a magistrate. I find that such a time limit is an unnecessary constraint upon the interests of justice from the vantage point of t-e - ommunity. - y c-ntriÂ­ bution to tomght s debate will dISCUSS some of the problems created by the provisions of the Bill in regard to these time limits. The whole thrust of the Bill is based on the rationale that existin- State or Territory law is sufficiently weakened by the repercussions of the Williams case as to deprive those investigating Commonwealth offences of a clear authority to question a suspect or investigate offences after the detention of that person following his arrest. I am not - atis-ed from - y readings that such a legIslatIve change IS absolutely necessary, or for that matter desirable, following the judgment of the Williams case. A number of problems are likely to be created by the implementation of su-h legislation that should be canvassed m this debate and corrected before the provisions come into force. The most glaring of these include the questions associated with the questioning of suspects where both State and Federal offences are revealed or alleged, the instances where investigators conducting inquiries into breaches of State or Territory law, obtain evidence as to breaches of Commonwealth laws while interviewing a suspect, and the provision of facilities, et cetera, in such instances where distance and isolation prevent the investigator from access to the equipment and resources necessary to comply with the provisions of the Bill. I wish to discuss the latter issue while looking at video or tape recording of evidence later in my speech. . One of the great downfalls of our soci-Â­ political system, based partly on the Bntish model, which Churchill once described as 'the worse in the world, apart from all the rest' is its susceptibility to criminal behavio-r and an apparent inability to deal as efficiently with crime and criminal behaviour as more authoritarian or totalitarian regimes. There is a charming story set during the 1930s when the head of the Scotland Yard Flying Squad visited an Interpol c?n-erÂ­ ence in Berlin hosted by Hemnch Himmler. In conversation with another Nazi luminary, the murderous Reinhard Heydrich, the subject turned to methods of dealing with crime in th.eir two countries. The head of the Flymg Squad lamented the huge increase in housebreaking then being experienced in London. He indicated it was a problem that was causing considerable headaches to senior police in the British capital. Heydrich replied that they had experienced similar problems in Berlin until the Fuhrer had ordered the summary execution of the next 10 people caught housebre-king., I;Ieydrich is reported to have smIrked, Smce then we have not had any housebreaking'. I sometimes wonder whether some of the community expectations placed on our own law enforcement agencies are a little too coloured by the flickering images of American-style police dramas laced, as they are, with gratuitous violence and summary justice. As a police officer myself I was sometimes struck by the surpri;e exhibited by some suspects at the gentleness and the reasonableness v.:ith which they were treated. To a generatIOn reared on the interview techniques used State by Dirty Harry Callaghan and the lurid violence in movies like Colours, the usual treatment extended by our own system of policing must seem very tame in comparison. Nonetheless, there are instances, of course of abuse in police inquiries, just as the-e are those who view their entry into the legal profession as an opportunity to circumvent the legal restrictions felt by the rest of the community. It is in those instances that our present criminal justice system comes into disrepute and is attacked by those who prefer to tie the hands of investigators behind their backs. The report of the Committee reviewing Commonwealth criminal law, chaired by Sir Harry Gibbs, the former Chief Justice, looked at the question of the detention of a suspect by police for the period necessary to complete an investigation. In recommending the introduction of a time limit for the questioning of a suspect and further investigation prior to taking him or her before a magistrate, the Gibbs report appears to have down played the experience of the Victorian Government which, after introducing a time restriction of six hours in 1984 with the enactment of the Crimes (Criminal Investigation) Act, time limit. subsequently amended the Act to allow for a reasonable time in place of the hour limit. Mr MCGauran-It was a disaster in Victoria.",97
148,Mr FILING,INSURANCE AMENDMENT BILL,"As has been stated by bothÂ· sides of the Parliament in Victoria. Effectively, the introduction of such a time limit complicates and hinders the work investigators, who must be at all times mindful of the period in which the suspect after arrest. In complex investigations or where there is evidence of interlocking or independent multiple offexample, ences, the opportunity for the fullest quiries being undertaken will be lost officers battle to put the most important questions to the suspect before time runs out. The burden of proof on the officers to substantiate the dead time, as proposed by the Gibbs Committee and as would implemented by the Bill, imposes a substantial extra load on the investigators. As a detective in the Western Australian him; don't worry. Police Force, I have had enough experience in the intricacies of criminal invesVictoria tigation to be well aware of the already existing time constraints imposed by the rules of evidence, the Commissioner's guidelines for questioning suspects,the extra pressure of dealing with more intelfollowed ligent and resourceful criminals and the circumstances of the offences themselves. As opposed to the working environThat ment of those who target the work of investigators for criticism, crime and its investigation rarely fit in during conveniquestioning ent office hours. In the case of violence opportunistic criminal acts, these tend to occur at times that make for delays in fulfilling even existing requirements vided for in statute and common law. Often, valuable time is lost. Suspects vary in their cooperation to such an extent each investigation requires an approach rather than uniformity. Time constraints may lead to less time being spent on cross-checking of facts, verificaOctober tion of alibis, collaborative evidence so on, as investigators race to complete further inquiries before the expiry of the Many offences generate differing invessixtigative responses. For instance, in the case of an offence where the offender was apprehended at the scene of a crime, the officer investigating has no choice but to make an arrest or allow the offender to leave-which of course would be a serious neglect of his or her statutory duties. In the case where further injuries may be of suffered by another member of the public, instant action must be taken by the investhey hold tigating police officer. In contrast, in company fraud cases, for where the suspect does not flee in the scene of the crime, the actual interas view may not actually take place until weeks or months after the offences have occurred and after the investigators have interviewed enough witnesses and obtained enough evidence to formulate a substantial case for prosecution. The then Premier of Victoria, John Cain-and did be I hear someone say 'John who?'? Mr MCGauran-We haven't forgotten",99
149,Mr FILING,INSURANCE AMENDMENT BILL,"I am sure the people of will never forget the reign of John Cain. The then Premier of Victoria, John Cain, was reported to have stated that the dumping of the six-hour limit was a victory for common sense in that State. This the report of the Coldrey Committee, which found the six-hour limit on the questioning of suspects too inflexible. Committee recommended a package of changes to the law which included replacing the fixed time limit on consensual and investigation with a more or flexible limit based on reasonable time; giving statutory basis to the rights of suspects to communicate with friends, relaprotives and legal advisers and, where appropriate, to have the assistance of an interpreter and a consula.r official; and that mandatory tape recording of interviews individual for indictable offences. In the second reading of the Crimes (Custody and Investigation) Bill on 8 1987, Victorian Minister Race and Mathews stated that the Cain Government was implementing the recommendations of the Coldrey Committee through the Bill after, as he said, 'extensive public consultation on the recommendations'. We are now faced with a Bill that provides for less time than was originally provided for in the Victorian Crimes Act and which has had little to no consultation process in the formulation of its provisions. There is no doubt that the Bill before us is not as stringent in its limitations as the old section 460 of the Crimes Act. Nonetheless, the effective flow of questioning may be interrupted by attempts to have the time limit extended by a magistrate. Anyone with any experience of the difficulties in obtaining confessional evidence would be well aware of the dangers presented by lengthy breaks and distractions. Proposed new section 23D of the Crimes (Investigation of Commonwealth Offences) Amendment Bill, which provides for the application for an extension of the investigation period, requires the offence being investigated to be a serious offence and, among other conditions, allows for the suspect to make representations as to whether or not the time should be extended. While presumably this is a safeguard to prevent the involuntary questioning of the suspect, it would also have the effect of limiting police investigation which may be intended to locate further evidence, search premises or check already obtained evidence. The other item of contention presented by this Bill is the different time limit of two hours provided for juvenile, Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander suspects. With the companion safeguard presence of a legal practitioner, interview friend or acceptable friend, it is questionable that a more stringent time limit of two hours is absolutely required-that is, if one accepts the principle of the time limit in the first place. It is with these factors in mind that I would strongly support amendments to change the time limits in the Bill and provide for detention for a reasonable time-in other words, for a period of time that would seem to be reasonable under the circumstances-with the admissibility or otherwise of the evidence obtained being subject to the existing judicial scrutiny that is available in courts as to its voluntary nature. I now turn to the question of video or audio taping of interviews. In looking at this issue, I wholeheartedly support the principle that the best evidence should be made available to the court-and there is no doubt that the best evidence of confessional material is a video or audio tape of the suspect making a confessional statement. Where problems arise is in the grey areas that occur before and after taping of any evidence. What does the investigator do in the case of a voluntary admission made during these times? What about during transit to and from the place where tape recording takes place? If the suspect subsequently refuses to confirm or deny those admissions on tape, what is considered as 'non-practicable' in relation to compliance with the other sections of 23v? Is this provision likely to increase or decrease the number of voir dires in criminal cases? I think it is likely to increase them. Whatever the outcome, it is clear that evidence as afore-described is to be considered as inferior and questionable in its contribution to the prosecution's case. This diminishes, rather than improves, the opportunities for investigators to properly investigate Commonwealth offences. One peculiar outcome. from the full implementation of the Bill would be some confusion as to how State investigators would respond in the case of a suspect who is being interviewed in relation to State matters and who makes admissions or reveals the commission of Commonwealth offences. I would envisage this problem being most serious in the case of drug trafficking, particularly where importation of drugs may be involved, or perhaps where a bank hold-up offender confesses to a hold-up at a branch of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. At which stage in the event of the retention of the time limits imposed by this Bill would the time be considered to have commenced-at the point of original arrest or at the point when the interviewing officer decides to further charge that person with a Commonwealth offence? At what stage should the caution be given in such a case, or is - it in fact necessary to give a caution if the person has been initially arrested and cautioned on a State matter? At present, these matters are controlled by the relevant State or Territory legislation. The. effect of the provisions of the Bill at present may well encourage the State investigators to decline to handle Commonwealth matters in order to prevent the intrusion of the time limit into the conduct of their own inquiries. Another important consideration in relation to the video or audio taping of interviews is the provision of proper facilities to record those interviews. Investigations into Commonwealth matters may well occur in any part of the continent and outside the principal offices of the Federal Police. Investigators may have to rely on State police facilities and equipment. In the remote regions of Western Australia, the Northern Territory and perhaps northern Queensland, this may present serious impediments. Additionally, with State Labor government funding crises already evident in Victoria, Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania, what is the likelihood of the availability of equate equipment for those investigators to comply with the Bill's provisions? The relegation of non-taped evidence to substantially inferior status, notwithstanding section 23v, subsection (6), poses some serious problems for investigators away from the capital cities. In the explanatory memorandum, the Attorney-General indicated that the financial impact of the Bill would be $3.4m over a period of two years. I feel that this would be inadequate, given the financial problems facing State police forces. Further costs would have to be met by the Commonwealth in order to provide facilities truly throughout Australia. This brings me to the heart of the predicament likely to face investigators as a result of this legislation, that is, the graphical problems peculiar to the Australian law enforcement system. As a former Western Australian police officer, I am well aware of the constraints of distance and geography. These extend to special considerations where, for instance, an apprehension of a suspect is made in one part of, say, the Northern Territory and the interviewing officers are at the other end of the Territory. This is an added concern when the suspect is a juvenile, Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander. How far should the investigating officers go in trying to locate, for instance, an acceptable interview friend? In concluding my remarks, I wish to emphasise that in introducing this Bill the honourable Attorney-General is creating a number of problems in relation to the operation of its provisions. I have always had the view that new laws should be introduced only in the case where the existing situation is inadequate or where there is a good case for change. Following the experiences of the Victorian Labor Government, which eventually scrapped its fixed time limit on interviews of suspects in custody, I would have thought that the Government would have learned from the Victorian experience. In committing the investigators of Commonwealth offences to the tape recording of interviews, there is inadequate consideration of some of the logistical and ad- cost factors associated with the provision of such equipment and resources throughout the country. It is sad that the Government did not spend more time consulting with those responsible for the enforcement of Federal, State and Territory laws before the introduction of this Bill. I conclude by saying that the time limit for the detention of suspects under arrest for investigation purposes should be 'a reasonable time' and I support amendments to effect this. Finally, I just congratulate those police officers throughout the country who work under extraordinarily difficult circumstances and who at times are deprived of proper equipment and facilities by the constraint of the financial problems of various States and Territories. Also, I would like to acknowlgeoedge the work of one of my constituents, a retired superintendent, Graham Lee. He was the author of the police manual in Western Australia, which I used to a great extent as a junior detective In my early days in the force.",99
150,Unknown,INSURANCE AMENDMENT BILL,Sitting suspended from 6.35 to 8 p.m.,102
151,Mr LINDSAY,INSURANCE AMENDMENT BILL,"It has been said that the right to personal liberty is the most elementary and important of all common law rights. The High Court of Australia probably had this fundamental principle in mind when it asserted in the 1982 case of Cleland v. the Queen: It is of critical importance to the existence and protection of personal liberty under the law that the restraints which the law imposes on police powers of arrest and detention be scrupulously observed. The Crimes (Investigation of Commonwealth Offences) Amendment Bill therefore is of fundamental importance in that it introduces a pre-charge custodial period for a person under arrest in relation to a Commonwealth offence. The Law Council of Australia has expressed opposition in principle to legislation which confers on police officers and other investigating officers a power to detain persons arrested for offences against the laws of the Commonwealth for the purpose of questioning and investigation before bringing them before magistrates. I suggest that the Law Council's view is shared by many lawyers personally. Previously the common law required that an arrested person be brought before a magistrate as soon as practicable or without delay. It was generally assumed that it was lawful for a reasonable period of questioning or investigation to be allowed to decide whether to proceed or to establish the correct charge to be laid. Historically, at common law an arrested person was required to be brought without delay before a justice, whose role was investigatory and inquisitorial. James Bowen, a Victorian prosecutor, writing in the Law Institute of Victoria Journal in December 1986, traced the historical development of the transfer of that role from justices to members of the police force. He said: When the first English police force was created in 1829, police began to take over from the Justices of the Peace the responsibility for investigating crime. For centuries prior to 18:?,} the Justices of the Peace had combined the adjudicative function associated with the preparation of criminal cases to be laid before the grand jury and the police function of investigating crime, but they had much greater powers than modern police officers. The Justices could cause a suspect to be brought before them and require him or her to answer their questions. When the Justices of the Peace became true judicial officers in the early part of the nineteenth century, their criminal investigation function devolved upon the first police forces, but the power of the justices to detain suspects for questioning was not transferred to the police. Apart from special powers in relation to arrest, the police were given no greater powers than were possessed by an ordinary citizen to investigate crime. The common law did not permit the police to detain suspects for questioning or to facilitate investigation of crime, and required that the power of arrest be exercisable only for the purpose of taking the defendant before a justice or magistrate to be dealt with according to law. In 1986, in the case of Williams v. the Queen, the High Court held in effect that any delay whatsoever in bringing a person before a magistrate-that is, due to questioning the person either about the offence for which he or she was arrested or any other offence-is unlawful. Any confession, no matter how voluntary or authentic, that is made after the time when the person could have been taken before a magistrate may be held inadmissible as being obtained during a period of unlawful detention. The judges in that case referred to the problems flowing from their decision and foreshadowed the need for legislative intervention. What were some of the problems foreshadowed as a consequence of the Williams decision? They include these concerns: prosecutions of persons who are clearly guilty by their own admissions may fail; there may be difficulty in prosecuting complex and multiple offences; innocent people - ay be prosecuted and incur suffering and expense on the basis of evidence which could have been refuted by preliminary investigation-for example, disclosure and confirmation of an alibi; and there may be police subterfuge to overcome the problems of no lawful investigation period-for example, nocturnal arrests and stretching and bending the concept of voluntary cooperation. This Bill does not confer a power to detain a person not under arrest as defined in the Bill. The Bill makes provision to detain for a fixed period any person who is arrested or deemed to have been arrested on suspicion of having committed a Commonwealth offence except an offence against the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982. The maximum period for which persons may be held for questioning without formal extension or release is four hours, unless they are of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander descent or are persons under the age of 18 years, in which case the fixed period of detention is two hours. Previous speakers have outlined in some detail those provisions of the Bill. Many lawyers hold the view that to introduce a precise time limit for police custodial investigation is prima facie objectionable. The Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) in his second reading speech observed that the Australian Law Reform Commission was well aware of the objection that 'any acceptance of post-arrest investigation is undesirable because it is a retreat from the common law principle that arrest marks the point of executive commitment, when there should be a reduction, not an expansion, of police power and when the judicial arm should take over as soon as possible'. Nevertheless, the choice had to be made to define the limits of the investigation period-that is, between the uncertain 'reasonable time' approach or the clearly defined and ascertainable 'fixed time' option. In electing to proceed with the fixed time option, the Government took into account the views of both the Australian Law Reform Commission and the Gibbs Review of C9mmonwealth Criminal Law, which had both favoured the introduction of a fixed time provision. The Australian Law Reform Commission in its 1975 investigation recommended a time limit of four hours for police custodial investigation, with provision for what has been described as dead time. The Gibbs Review in its report of February 1989 recommended for the purpose of investigation a period of custodial detention not exceeding six hours in the case of arrests related to offences punishable by a period exceeding 12 months imprisonment and four hours in other cases. The Law Council of Australia has cautioned that, if a detention period were to be introduced, it should not be allowed to be the thin end of the wedge. The Commission said that where an arrested person is detained for questioning and must be brought before a magistrate the time limits which apply must be certain and incontestable. The Law Council argued that the reasonable time provisions to be found in current Victorian and Northern Territory legislation should not and could not be supported. The whole emphasis in this legislation is to achieve a proper and adequate safeguard and necessary balance between the reasonable requirements of law enforcement and the protection of the rights of individuals. An early attempt by Victoria to define the investigation period using the fixed time approach has been subject to much examination and debate. In 1984 Victoria amended its Crimes Act of 1953 to provide for a maximum period of six hours detention for the investigation process. The amendments also provide that this period could be extended by a magistrate in certain circumstances. After the amendments had been in operation for some time the Victorian police detailed a number of deficiencies in the fixed time approach. As a consequence, a further committee under Mr Coldrey, QC, recommended that the reasonable time approach be substituted for the fixed time approach. The fixed time period was considered by the Coldrey Committee to hamper police investigations of complex crimes and multiple offences. This Government is of the view that the Victorian attempt at the fixed time approach failed because the amendments to its Crimes Act did not allow for the inclusion of the crucial so-called 'dead time' provisions. The time spent transporting accused, awaiting the arrival of legal advisers or parents or guardians or interpreters, or seeking medical treatment are all examples of what has been described as 'dead time'. These have been specifically exempted from the calculation of investigation periods in this Bill. This Government, therefore, believes that by the use of dead time provisions the problems encountered by Victoria will be overcome, that the adopted legitimate needs of the police in their ingations-preferring vestigations of crime will be met and that custody, the rights and civil liberties of those being investigated will be protected. It is true that some Commonwealth laws contain provisions which are not affected by the Williams case-for example, the Customs Act and the Migration Act. Furand thermore, three jurisdictions-the Northern Territory, Victoria and South Australia-have legislated to override the decision in the Williams case and each jurisdiction has used a different approach. The Law Reform Commission of Tasas mania has presented a report recommendIslanders ing legislation for pre-charge detention the report of the New South Wales Law Reform Commission on this issue is about to be presented. There will be a variety of formulations with varying safeguards that will apply among the States and Teralso ritories of Australia. In addition, section 68 of the Judiciary Act 1903 applies the law of a particular State or Territory persons . in custody for Commonwealth offences throughout Australia. This Bill, when enacted, will provide uniform system of procedures to be folvalue lowed during the investigation period for ing voir dires. all persons charged with Commonwealth offences. The Williams case illustrated an incapacity on the part of the courts give police officers practical guidance to how they should behave after they had taken into custody people that they sonably suspected of having committed an offence. We should always be mindful that police are expected to investigate crimes and question suspects. The public interest demands that suspected crimes a serious nature be thoroughly investibalances, gated. Police should not be shackled or hampered in their task of bringing to tice those who are guilty of crimes. Bowen in the article to which I referred earlier, which appeared in the Law Insticontribution tute Journal of Victoria, has observed: The police have been forced to investigate in a grey area, always at risk of an action false imprisonment when, for the purpose rying out reasonable investigations, they have deferred taking a person in their custody justice or magistrate. During this long period governments and lawyers have in the main a blinkered approach to police investinot to rock the boat so long as the police acted fairly towards suspects in their and did not delay unduly the bringing of suspects before a justice or magistrate. The High Court made it clear in the Williams case that the legislature has the responsibility of determining the difference between the protection of personal liberty the need to bring offenders to justice. This Bill will achieve that aim. This Bill will provide certainty in this area of the law for all citizens. This Bill will protect the position of vulnerable minorities, such children, Aboriginal and Torres Strait and those in need of interpretand ers, such as the deafÂ· and non-English speakers. Indeed, the proposal for video recording of interviews as a precondition for the admissibility of confessions has been approved not only by the police but by civil libertarians. It has gained their approval as a safeguard against police malpractice. It has received the apto proval of police and prosecutors as the best evidence of confessions and as an enormous time-saver for investigations and courts. It has received the approval a of the judiciary because of its evidentiary and the avoidance of time-consumWhen I initially perused this Bill I had to some reservations and concerns about as adopting a fixed time period in preference to the reasonable time proposal that is reanow operating in Victoria. I have now come to the firm conclusion that the fixed time period represents the basis of consensus between various elements in the provision of justice in our society, and of with the introduction of the checks and such as the dead time provision, I am confident that this Bill represents a jusmarked reform in the law which is appliJames cable to criminal investigation.",102
152,Mr GAYLER,INSURANCE AMENDMENT BILL,"My this evening will be brief, but I feel it is important that I speak on crime the Crimes (Investigation of Commonfor wealth Offences) Amendment Bill-a Bill of carwhich we could regard as a legislative before a intervention into our common law and law of precedence in the criminal area. Of course, the real dilemma that emanates from the introduction of this Bill is the competing balance, on the one hand, of the common law protection of personal liberty and, on the other hand, the exigencies of criminal investigation. It is argued-I think not without some basisthat the common law and its statutory equivalent as now interpreted by the courts unrealistically failed to give due weight to the latter consideration with the consequence that if the law were strictly enforced the proper investigation of crime would be likely to be seriously hampered and offenders would be likely to escape justice. That was really the principle involved in the High Court of Australia decision of Williams v. the Queen where the trial judge-and I emphasise the trial judgewas satisfied that confessions that were made voluntarily were made during a period of wrongful detention of the accused. It is interesting to look at the language used in the comments of the learned appeal judges of the High Court when the matter reached that jurisdiction on appeal. It is interesting, but not surprising, that the oft-repeated quotations of the learned justices resound throughout that particular decision. I talk of terms such as 'reasonably necessary', 'reasonable attention' and 'as soon as practicable'terms that denote the balance that must be struck; a balance which, as I have already said, some would see under common law and codified law of that common law as tilting in favour of the suspect. This legislation intervenes with our common law principles and, in some States, our codified principles. It is interesting to note that four of the five judges in the Williams case refer very clearly to the need to strike a balance between the requirements of effective law enforcement and the long standing common law protection of personal freedom. They express awareness, too, of the difficulties presented by complex investigations. In this context Justices Mason and Brennan, in their joint judgment, point out: If the legislature thinks it right to enhance armoury of law enforcement, at least the ture is able-as the courts are not-to prescribe some safeguards . . . Justices Wilson and Dawson also recognised that the policy issues involved were properly the province of this Parliament. They said: If the law requires modification then it is better done . . . by legislation. For there must be safeguards, if necessary in the form of time limits, and they must be set with a particularity which cannot be achieved by judicial decision. Later I will speak at some length about the safeguards-safeguards that are now being included in the Bill before the House. The first question that Parliament has to face is whether we should move at all to alter the effect of the decision of the High Court in the Williams case, and the second is, if we do so, what should be the manner of the intervention to best balance the community's interest in effective law enforcement and the interest in maintaining high standards of criminal justice in which individual rights are given appropriate protection and respect. Law and practice in this area have been uncertain, and certainly unsatisfactory, since well before the Williams case. In 1975 the Australian Law Reform Commission in its report on criminal investigation noted, as well, that although the common law principle that an arrested person must be brought before a magistrate without unreasonable delay had been given statutory expression in most jurisdictions in Australia, the words used to delimit the permissible time period were variable and imprecise-something, of course, that was referred to time and again in the High Court decision in the case of Williams and the Queen. Judicial interpretation of a permissible time ranged from holding 'forthwith' to mean exactly that in the Drymalik v. Feldman case in South Australia, which case is well known in this area, to several hours after it became practicable to bring the person before a magistrate. Police practices were similarly variable, and the Law Reform Commission found that one of the most frequently voiced complaints against the police was unnethe cessarily-I emphasise 'unnecessarily'legislaprolonged custody. In some cases it was up to three days on minor public order charges. The Law Reform Commission recommended that there should be a precise time limit set for police custodial investigation. It set this at four hours, with some provision for dead time. Dead time, of course, means those periods which it is considered appropriate to exclude from the calculation of the investigation period, as they are all periods when investigations should not, in fairness, take place. They include direct travel time to the police station, time spent arranging communication with family, friend or lawyer and time spent waiting for the attendance of a lawyer or prisoner's friend. The Commission also recommended provision for the extension of time in appropriate circumstances by application to a magistrate, in no circumstances to exceed a further eight hours. The Commission was well aware of and gave careful consideration to the objection that any acceptance of post-arrest investigation is undesirable because it is a retreat from the common law principle that arrest marks the point of executive commitment, when there should be a reduction and not an expansion of police power and when the judicial arm should take over as soon as possible. As I have indicated previously, a number of safeguards have been included in the Bill-safeguards that the Gibbs Committee of Review of Commonwealth Criminal Law has recommended, and safeguards that we in protecting the interests of the community at large must defend jealously. I refer to the provision the customary caution that the person in custody does not have to say or do anything, but that anything he or she does say or do may be given in evidenc,e. The caution is to be given in or translated into a language in which the person is fluent, where necessary. There is the provision for the person before the commencement of questioning or investigation to communicate with a friend or relative and with a lawyer and for a lawyer to be present during investigations involving the arrested person, subject to some specified conditions. There are special provisions for the protection of young persons, foreign nationals, Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders. There are provisions requiring persons in custody to be treated with humanity and respect for human dignity, and prohibiting cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. The list goes on. There are provisions requiring electronic tape recording of interviews-something that at long last has been recognised, hopefully throughout the length and breadth of our nation. Both the Law Reform Commission and the Gibbs Committee also recommended the incorporation of measures to control any possible tendency for police to allow the maximum to become the norm. That is an area of concern. The Commission favoured a formulation requiring police to take a person before a magistrate or make a release or bail decision as soon as reasonably practicable, and in no event should it be longer than four hours after the commencement of custody. The Gibbs Committee suggested a provision that the investigation period for which the person may be detained be defined as a period not exceeding the specified maximum, during which that person is detained for the purpose of investigating whether he or she has committed an offence. That is, it would be a period during which active questioning or investigation is taking place directly related to an offence for which that person is being held. A watershed was reached in the decision of Williams and the Queen at the appellate level, and I believe it has been for the duty of this Government-or any government for that matter-to look very closely at that decision to see whether it believes it is its rightful role to intervene in the common law as it stood prior to that decision; to see whether legislative intervention is necessary. It is a bold step, and one that my Government has taken. I have some reservations about it, but I support it in the first place. It is a measure that must be diligently and very carefully monitored in the early days of its existence. When our very competent Attorney General (Mr Duffy) made his second reading speech, he indicated that he had a dilemma. I agree totally, and at the commencement of my comments I spoke of that dilemma. There is a dilemma, the balance of what I have referred to, but let us not be put off by having to make these difficult decisions, burying heads in the sand. Let us look at notwithstanding the protestations of those in the Australian Federal Police. I undercussions stand their apprehension and I underfrom stand some of the difficulties, but I must say that I am somewhat bemused by their suggestion that they have not had an opdetail. portunity to express themselves in any area. We have had countless numbers of disreading cussion papers from the Law Reform Commission. We have had the Committee. If the Federal Police, through its machinery, has not had the ability put forward its views on the legislation, or its views iIi relation to this particular issue, then it is sadly lacking in its admina istration. Be that as it may, we must not resile from bringing forward reform this very important area, which I know that our Attorney-General, through his expressions of such a dilemma, if further reform is needed will look at very careall fully and diligently.",104
153,Mr DUFFY,INSURANCE AMENDMENT BILL,"in reply-Firstly, may I express my appreciation to those who have taken part in this debate this afternoon and evening. The honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) indicated that the attitude adopted by the Opposition, whilst disagreeing, was constructive, and I think that is true. In touching on the remarks of the last two speakers on this side the House-both members have had some spent a lot of time. not inconsiderable experience in this area-the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) mentioned that when he first read the Crimes (Investigation of Comthoughtful monwealth Offences) Amendment Bill he had grave reservations about it. Ultiaware, mately, after thinking about it, he came down on the side of the Government's position on the Bill. The honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Gayler), who is also someone who has had a very close association with this area over a long period, expresses a few more reservations and says that the area has to be monitored over a period of on time. Anyone who says that this was an easy decision would be kidding himself. The point he made was a valid one. That our point was also made by some members reform, on the other side of the House. I do not want to go back over the disand points made at earlier stages the Opposition that second reading speeches have not outlined Bills sufficiently and have not gone into enough That was certainly not the case in respect of this Bill where a lot of time was spent in the preparation of the second speech. Therefore, in summing up I do not propose to go over the matters Gibbs that were outlined earlier. There are a couple of matters that I to would like to touch on that have come out in the debate earlier today and tonight pretty clearly. The first matter is not terribly serious one, in the sense that anyone was making a huge issue of it, but in it was mentioned that my view on this matter was different from that of the previous Attorney-General. People seem to express some misgivings about that. As honourable members know, there was no-one closer to the previous Attorney General than myself. On this issue I just happen to disagree with him. If I had not been otherwise engaged in the previous this Government's Legal and Administrative Committee I may have been able to persuade him to another way of thinking. There is nothing very strange about the fact that we happened to differ on this, albeit very important, issue. This was a of matter on which the Caucus committee Both the honourable member for Banks and the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) were extremely helpful and in working through this very difficult issue. As honourable members are the solution I found at the end of the day, the one which was in my view the most fair and balanced and is the Government's position, as well as being workable, is to provide for that maximum period during which an arrested person may be held for questioning or investigation before being taken before a magistrate. Within that maximum, of course, is the very important point touched on by the honourable member for Leichhardta defined investigation period, which is a period of active audio and video recorded questioning or investigation regarding the relevant offence or offences reasonably appropriate in the circumstances of a particular case. There was a fair amount of concern expressed by those on the other side of the House that this was different to the Victorian position. It is different to the Victorian position. I think that the history and some facts regarding the Victorian position should be outlined. A committee to examine this matter was chaired by Mr Justice Phillips, ashe now is but who was then the Director of Public Prosecutions in Victoria. That committee was given the task of addressing this very difficult problem and recommended legislative amendments for a maximum period of six hours which could be extended by application to a magistrate with the consent of the arrested person. Those recommendations were adopted by the Victorian Government. After a period of monitoring the police compiled a report detailing a number of deficiencies in the operation of the amendments, and the committee was then reconvened under Mr John Coldrey, QC, who was the successor to Mr Justice Phillips, asÂ· he now is, as the Director of Public Prosecutions in Victoria. That committee was set the task of re-examining the effectiveness of the amendments. There are a couple of matters which I think should be emphasised. It should be made quite plain that the amendments which we are talking about in Victoria are the ones recommended by the first Director of Public Prosecutions in Victoria, Mr Justice Phillips, as he now is. They did not provide any allowance for dead timeanother matter which two members on this side of the House, the honourable member for Leichhardt and the honourable member for Herbert, touched on. This is a very significant factor. I think that that has been overlooked by some people. The reasonable period in Victoria is now the position and replaces the fixed period of time. The fixed period did not take into account that dead time position which, of course, this Bill does in some considerable detail. One of the other interesting aspects of the Victorian position is that when the Coldrey Committee, which re-examined this matter, reported in 1986 on the Phillips amendments to section 460 Mr Coldrey quoted research findings on a similar Scottish provision for a fixed maximum of six hours pre-charged detention which had operated since 1980. The Scottish provision had been operating for a period of six years at that time. The findings by Mr Coldrey, QC, were that the average time a suspect spent at the police station, despite the permissible six-hour maximum, was two hours and 15 minutes. Twenty per cent of suspects spent less than one hour and 50 per cent of all detentions lasted less than two hours. The extraordinary statistic which came out of that examination was that Mr Coldrey found that in Victoria over 99.5 per cent of investigations under the Victorian provisions did take place within the six hours. There was no breakdown of figures within that period, but 99.5 per cent of investigations took place within the period of six hours. One has to wonder somewhat what the grave deficiencies were in the fixed detention period that prevailed in Victoria before the subsequent amendments arising out of the Coldrey Committee report.  was in relation to complex matters.",107
154,Mr DUFFY,INSURANCE AMENDMENT BILL,"There must have been a few complex matters involved over that period when 99.5 per cent of them were disposed of within the period.  very point. You are virtually accusing him of being stupid after elucidating those elements and then concluding the reverse of what you're alleging. Mr Gayler-A lot of experience in the criminal field, this chap!  tainly have. I've noted your name down in the report.",108
155,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INSURANCE AMENDMENT BILL,"I suggest that we get back to the debate before the House and you have the other one outside. MR DUFFYIt has been quoted over Torres and over again tonight that because it changed in Victoria from the fixed period to the reasonable time, this Government members should follow that path. I do not find that a very convincing argument. I think there are various points that can be made and it is a matter of balance. The reasonable investigation period within a specified maximum time versus the open ended reasonable time is a matter which has been debated here tonight for a long while, but there are advantages in the specified maximum time. There is certainly the question of greater certainty applying all people involved. It applies tainty from the point of view of the accused, the legal representatives and police. It certainly provides better protection civil liberties. The dead time provision, I emphasise, did not apply in Victoria. In my view, overcomes most of the problems of the lack of flexibility complained of regarding the Victorian fixed time provision where there is no provision for dead time. think that that dead time provision does overcome what was one of the main criticisms of the fixed time provision in Victoria. The legislative balancing of rights individuals in society is preferable to expensive case by case judicial balancing of those rights. Unlike Victoria, the time provision in this Bill will allow an extension of the investigation without m;;tgistrate. the need for physical attendance before a magistrate, which was one of the proband lems in Victoria, or the consent of the accused, who has, however, the right to be heard. Therefore, there is minimal ruption of the continuity, which was the case in Victoria. So I think there some distinctions in respect of Victoria which should be taken account of when people obviously believe that the Victoauthority rian position is the perfect one. teresting that in this instance I also do not agree politically with my colleagues Victoria. The other matter that I wish to touch on in summing up is the Aboriginal and Strait Islander issue, which is another matter on which there was discussion tonight. The Bill, as honourable are all aware, includes a provision that for young persons, Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders, the permissible maximum period of pre-charge detention will be two hours, while in other cases it will be four, and the eight hour extension provision is to apply equally to both. This has been criticised in some areas as being paternalistic in respect of Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders, and also as discriminating against non-Aboriginal and non-Torres Strait Isfor landers. They have been the criticisms I with a cerhave heard directed at it. This was a matter which had to be looked at very closely. I would like to for mention some points made and some matters examined in coming to this conclusion for people to at least think about. it For example, the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody referred specifically to the risks associated with the initial period in custody. That royal comI mission was something which caused considerable concern. The public sittings held by the Australian Law Reform Commission in relation to its Criminal Investigation Report No.2, especially the sittings in Alice Springs and Darwin, revealed that of frequently bail was not contemplated unan til the morning following arrest, and that in some cases people were held up to fixed three days in police custody on minor for charges before being brought before a Aboriginals in the Northern Territory, everywhere else in Australia, have, unfortunately, a disproportionate contact with our criminal justice system, and cordisrespondingly they are more vulnerable to not this kind of abuse. The Australian Law are Reform Commission also found that Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders were more susceptible than other groups to situations, and were likely to be It is inoverborne more easily. There was reference in earlier debate, in certainly in the second reading speech, in some detail to the Anunga rules which operate in the Northern Territory and recognise this kind of vulnerability in Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders. In my view the provisions are justified. Furthermore the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC), the official national voice of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, endorses the special provisions of the Bill concerning Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders. Mr Aldred-So what?",108
156,Mr DUFFY,INSURANCE AMENDMENT BILL,"That may not be something that particularly impresses those opposite, but the fact is they have a li-t1e more expertise in this area than I thmk any honourable members opposite have. Whilst at the end of the day I come back to where I started, it was not an easy decision to come to; it was given a lot of consideration by the Government over a long period-in fact, probably the longest period that legislation under this Government has been considered, certainly by myself-before coming to a final decision. As was said by various speakers tonight, and it is my view, on balance there are arguments both ways, obviously, as this debate has shown. I think we did get it right. It is something which will of course have to be monitored. It may be proved ultimately that we did not get it right, but certainly at this stage I am convinced that we have.

(4) Clause 3, page 5, line 26, to and including page 7, line 3, omit proposed sections 23D and 23E. The common purpose of the amendments is to remove the fixed time limits for precharge detention as provided for in the Bill, and to substitute those limits with a test of what is considered reasonable. The first amendment proposes the deletion of the definition of 'investigation period'. The second amendment is of a technical nature to provide that the power of detention to be conferred upon police is to be read subject to proposed subsection (3) as amended. Next, the proposed subsection 23c (3), in its present form, is to be deleted, and in substitution the amendment will provide that once arrested or detained, a person must be released unconditionally or on bail or brought before a magistrate within a reasonable time of being arrested. Further consequential amendments are made to proposed subsections 23c (4) and (5), which, as presently drawn, set out the fixed time limits proposed by the Government. Finally, proposed sections 23D and 23E are to be deleted. At the moment they provide for an extension of time procedure in relation to fixed time limits. With the removal of the fixed time limits, these provisions have become redundant. Before concluding these remarks in committee, I wish to refer to some matters raised not only by the Attorney General (Mr Duffy), but also, for example, by the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham), who I thought made a very considered speech here today. I agree with him, as with so many-and the Attorney was dealing with it-that these arguments are finely balanced. In what was a fairly commendable debate, I recall, apart from the Attorney-General, the member for Banks in his speech firstly discussing the notions of reasonable time and fixed time. It is true that it is difficult, but it is true that the Gibbs committee, when discussing it, said that arguments on either side were finely balanced. I think we have ail .striven to do the right thing on this question, but-for reasons I will again touch on very briefly-we came down in favour of a reasonable time. Secondly, I recall the honourable member for Banks referring to the 1975 Australian Law Reform Commission report, in particular the representations of the police urging the adoption of a fixed time. As I understand it, being that 1975 date, that was certainly before the later Victorian experience and, as a result of that experience, the police found a fixed time extremely difficult. As I said earlier, rightly or wrongly I have been influenced by the Victorian experience, which led me, on balance, to make the recommendations to the shadow Cabinet and to the party room that I did and that were adopted and that I put earlier. Thirdly, the honourable member also raised the discussion paper of the New South Wales Law Reform Commission and noted, I think, at least three points. The first was the uncertainty in court with time taken up with voir dires. I concede that his period as a barrister in the criminal jurisdiction in New South Wales was longer than my experience in Victoria, but my recall is that, whilst there is much time taken up with voir dires, very little is taken up with the question of time but rather in relation to confessional evidence that relates to other factors. Secondly, he said that putting a fixed time ceiling led to the judicial processes occurring earlier. The Coldrey Committee found in fact that fixed times were frequently regarded as normal times and people were questioned for longer than necessary. Now there was a bit of a skirmish, which will not altogether appear in Hansard, when the Attorney-General was referring to some findings of the Coldrey Committee and the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Gayler) and I engaged in some dissertation across the table in regard to this logic. The reality is that for all those findings the Attorney-General referred to as coming out of the Coldrey also Committee's examinations, it was at pains to point out that in the important cases, and particularly in the complex cases, this was producing an impediment, namely, the period of fixed time, and that is why it concluded, despite all the other evidentiary elements before it, that a reasonable time was the appropriate approach to take. The third argument of the honourable member for Banks really related to the first, namely, that of greater certainty. I can acknowledge this but I believe that, on balance, the flexibility argument is to be preferred. I listened carefully to the remarks of the Attorney-General. I have to say to him that I am unpersuaded on what he produced as supporting evidence for the discrimination between non-Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. I reiterate again that there is plenty of experience overseas-and I say this with the utmost solemnity and sincerity-that it is extremely difficult, tragically these days, for people to raise questions of any reverse discrimination. It appears that the most plausible and reasoned argument as to why governments may be doing something for one group of people can be painted as either racist or obnoxious or ill considered. It is not. In the terms that I put to the House today, I work on the simple assumption that anyone who is an Australian citizen ought to be treated equally under the law. I feel that there are significant dangers in discriminating within a nation, as we have witnessed in other countries around the world. I would plead with honourable members that when there is a reasoned argument on questions that relate to others in the community, either of a minority or of a different race, those arguments must be able to be put in a reasoned and plausible manner or the sorts of difficulties encountered elsewhere will be felt even more horrendously in this nation. Finally, I asked the Attorney-General to answer a question relating to consultation. He has not done that. I indicated that the sensible approach would be to avoid any conflict between what we are laying down now under this Bill for a fixed time and the complications that can arise if a person is being questioned in relation to offences under Commonwealth law or offences under State law. The complex situation leads one to the conclusion that some degree of uniformity would be the approach to take, and I wanted to know what consultations had taken place with State and Territory Attorneys-General; I fear there may have been a minimum, if any at all. I also asked what was the consultation process with law reform authorities. As I adduced in part of a letter that I read from the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, in fact it appeared that since the current Attorney-General had taken his high office the Commissioner had not been consulted in regard to any so-called review that had taken place on this matter. It was a very serious allegation to have made-that there was no consultation with the Commissioner of the Federal Police. Even more so, if that significant law enforcement authority is not consulted in regard to a fixed time, which is a fixed time even less than that tried in Victoria, I think that also is a criticism of the Government. I would urge the Government to accept the amendments I have moved. The reasons for moving them. I have canvassed briefly here but more particularly in the second reading debate, and I will not take up any further time of the Committee.",110
157,Mr DUFFY,INSURANCE AMENDMENT BILL,"The amendments moved by the Opposition would replace the maximum investigation period and its extension with the reasonable time, which is the matter that has been at the heart of the whole debate, of course. The amendments also seek to delete the special shortened investigation period for Aboriginals and juveniles and the provision requiring aggregation of investigation periods. In determining what constitutes a reasonable period in a particular case, the court is to disregard those periods which now constitute dead time under the Crimes (Investigation of Commonwealth Offences) Amendment Bill, but it is given no other guidance on what it should consider, as is the case in Victoria and the Northern Territory. The adoption of a reasonable time removes the whole investigation from the oversight of a judicial officer until the matter is brought on for trial, and one then gets into the area of the admissibility of evidence when it is challenged, often a long way down the track-it might be months or even years sometimes. Under the Bill, the judicial officer is required to exercise a discretion to authorise the continued investigation after being satisfied both that the investigation has progressed properly until that time and that there is real need for further investigation. For the reasons I have put, I think that is the way it should be. U nless the officer is so satisfied, the application should be refused and the investigation terminated. The amendments offer no such protection. They also seek to remove the requirement that a judicial officer sanction the investigation after the initial two hours in the case of Aboriginals and juveniles. I have listened to what the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member  know he says it sincerely; he believes it to be the case. But I outlined in closing the second reading debate why we have come down with that particular provision and, equally, as he is not persuaded, I am certainly not persuaded to change that view. On another point which has probably not been touched on a great deal in relation to these amendments and was not discussed a great deal in the debate, the introduction of a reasonable period of detention does not really show that we as a 'parliament have exercised our responsibilities as fully as we should in providing some guidance as to what we are about both to investigators and to the courts. Such a scheme requires judgment by the court in each particular case on whether the police have acted in a reasonable way. Most cases will involve lengthy and very costly legal argument-for example, on a voir dire on the reasonableness of the detention, a matter which in most cases will be of no real relevance to the merits of the prosecution as it will be rare for there to be any consequence for the reliability of the evidence obtained. The provision for the maximum period for what is reasonable provides that guidance which I do not think is there until we as a parliament determine that that is the way we want to go. The amendment does not provide the best way to go, in what is, as we have all said, not an easy area. It is not that I have not discussed this matter with the Opposition before this Bill was debated in Parliament, but I thought about the issues as they were put to me by the Opposition previously, and I have tonight. The Government is not persuaded that we should accept these amendments and they are rejected. Amendments negatived. Bill agreed to. Bill reported without amendment; report adopted. Third Reading Bill (on motion by Mr Duffy)-by leave-read a third time. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1990 Second Reading Debate resumed from 4 December 1990 on motion by Mr Kerin: That the Bill be now read a second time.",112
158,Mr LLOYD,PIG SLAUGHTER LEVY,"The purpose of the Pig Slaughter Levy Amendment Bill 1990 is to increase the maximum levies payable for research and development from 50c to $1 per head and the marketing and promotion levy from $1.50 to $2.50 per head on each pig slaughtered. The Australian Pork Producers Federation, as the representative body of the pig industry, has requested these increases because the current operative levels are close to or on the maximum. The present Government offers dollar for dollar funding for research and development up to a maximum of 0.5 per cent of the gross value of production. The pig industry currently pays about 0.35 per cent. and wants to increase the amount. By doubling the legislative maximum to $1, obviously there is the ability for the pig industry to lift its commitment to research to the 0.5 level. I believe that this policy of the Government,with this whole range of rural research levies and rural research activities, is a positive policy and is bipartisan and very log-cal and sensible. It means that in general terms, the range of agricultural industries in Australia provide a significant amount towards research, matched by Government. That is one of the reasons why agriculture in Australia is so productiveit is based on research and on productivity. As recently as last year, in another area of research, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics indicated that the productivity level of agriculture in Australia was at least 50 per cent higher than it was for other sectors of Australian activity. If the productivity level of the rest of Australian activity was as high as it is for agriculture, this country would be a far more competitive place to be in at present. The second aspect of the Bill concerns the amount of $1.50 a head for promotion and to run the Australian Pork Corporation. The Corporation and the industry have been promoting pork in an endeavour to increase consumption of pork through a 'New Fashion Pork' campaign. It is interesting that Australia hasrelative to the consumption of other forms of meat such as beef and lamb-a relatively low consumption of pork. I believe it is primarily because of the grazing-based nature of our red meats that they are so cheap. Comparing other countries with Australia, what does Australia provide for consumers better than any other country? It is cheap, high quality food. To its credit, the pork industry wants to increase that levy to further promote its own products; hence the increase to $2.50 a head. That is the legislative arrangement. The actual increase in the levy to producers will .be determined by regulation and obviously will be done over a period, so this legislation provides that gap or that ability for the amounts to be increased. Probably the most frequent form of legislation in this place is this type of legislation-I think we have meat chicken levy legislation coming in next week-and it indicates 20-odd agricultural industries which are committed to this program. The pork industry needs to promote Australian pork, because it will be facing increased competition from Canadian pork. The Australian Quarantine Inspection Service (AQIS) has made an unfortunate decision in allowing Canadian pork into Australia. I believe that there are genuine quarantine risks and problems with that. The argument by the pork industry was not based on a non-tariff barrier attitude. I believe it is genuine and it is research based, because we have some advantages with regard to the relative freedom from disease of many of our animal and plant industries in Australia. At the time when this competition will increase, I am pleased that at last we are getting som,e labelling requirements in Australia that mean that whatever the imported product is, it will be reasonably obvious to the consumer that it is imported. My understanding of these new labelling laws for both packaged and unpackaged goods is that the labels will not be as significant and prominent as most other countries require for their own domestic product compared to imported products, but at least a consumer will now be able to tell that a product is imported. It is, therefore, advantageous and necessary for the Australian pork industry to be able to promote its product as being fresh and pure, pure in the sense-I am not referring to the Canadian product, but certainly there have been problems in Europe and nuclear problems with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics-that it is completely free of any potential problems in that regard. The whole nature of Australian agriculture means that it does not have many of the additives, promotants and so forth that other countries have. Our use of chemicals is strictly controlled. Our food ' standards are very high. So here is an opportunity for the industry to positively promote its product. Many Australian processed foods are facing increased import competition, due partly to other countries now developing industries, as we have done for some time; our high dollar value, which makes these imports more attractive; some of the tariff and subsidy weaknesses that we have in our present trade policy-I hope these will be addressed in the March statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke)-and particularly to our high cost structure which makes any product, once it leaves the farm gate and goes through any form of processing, less and less internationally competitive. The productivity level in the non-agricultural sector is abysmal and that means decreasing competitiveness for the particular product the more it is processed. The term 'value added' is used, but we are certainly not adding competitive value by further processing in this country. The Opposition supports the legislation and commends the pork industry.",113
159,Mr COURTICE,PIG SLAUGHTER LEVY,"The Pig Slaughter Levy Amendment Bill is about productivity and research and development. I am very pleased that the Opposition supports it. The main purpose of the Bill is to increase the maximum rate of levy which may be prescribed for pig research and development from SOc to $1 for each pig slaughtered for human consumption and the maximum rate of levy which may be prescribed for financing the operations of the Australian Pork Corporation from $1.50 to $2.50 for each pig slaughtered for human consumption. The pig industry, in itself, is currently not facing any major problems, although it has recently moved from a period of depressed saleyard prices, as I think everyone would acknowledge. I would like to point out that 20 per cent of pig producers are specialists, although they control approximately 60 per cent of production with the remainder tied to grain production and/or grazing. Therefore, farm income for most pig producers will be affected by the profitability of their other enterprises. There is no doubt that the wool industry, and of course the grain industry, is facing severe downturns and difficulties at present. The profitability of the industry is expected to rise during 1990-91 through lower feed prices and higher saleyard prices. Consumption is forecast to rise also through the relative higher prices for beef and lamb. That was covered fairly well by the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd). Recently I visited Japan and met with the Livestock Industry Promotion Corporation, Itohan Foods Inc - the meat and livestock division-and the meat department of the Marubeni Corporation. It was impressed upon me that, while Australia exports only a very small amount of pork to Japan-in fact, only seven kilotonnes is exported overseas per annum-the Japanese would be very interested in accepting more products of pig meat. Therefore, there is a potential and an opportunity for Australian pork producers to get into the Japanese market. Again, in comparison with other meat products, I believe that potential needs to be capitalised upon. I also recognise and make the point that primarily the pig industry has been a domestic market. But with the potential and the development of economies in South East Asia, I believe we have an opportunity to get on the front foot. This Bill, by encouraging research and development and improving our productivity, gives an opportunity on the ground floor to expand the potential of production and also to look to those markets in Asia, which we need to do to improve our terms of trade. I wish to mention briefly the effect that interest rates are having on primary producers at present. If we look across the level of interest that primary producers are paying we see that it is much higher for them than for the majority of people. While many bankers are sitting cosily in their lounge rooms watching television and sipping a cup of coffee tonight, there are farmers who are doing it tough. One of the negative aspects of all this is the way the issues have been raised and handled in the bush in convincing people that farmers are bad risks. I believe that we need to take constructive and positive approaches because the biggest crisis that rural Australia can have is a crisis in confidence. I make the observation that some of the banks have lent to corporate cowboys with gay abandon. It is important that they show a bit of patriotism and loyalty to the primary producer, as they look over the viability of many farmers. Even in my area-I am sure it is the case in the area of the honourable member for Murray and many other primary producing areas in Australia-bankers are making decisions on farmers who still have viability. Yet, as I have said, with gay abandon they have thrown money out to corporate cowboys over the last few years without any consideration of the consequences. Some of our banking experts might do well to spend 12 months working on a council to get a broader understanding of the economies and structure of this country. The present operational levy rates for research and promotion are at or near the maximum rates provided in the Pig Slaughter Levy Act 1971. The Australian Pork Producers Federation, the recognised body representing levy payers, has requested that the allowable maximum rates be increased to $1 for research and development and $2.50 for marketing and promotion. The Bill will make it possible for industry to seek increases in the operative rate if required. It will allow the Australian Pork Corporation to maintain or expand its marketing and promotion program in real terms to further assist industry. That is vital and will be very important over the next decade. The amendment to increase the maximum rate of levy for research purposes is consistent with the Government's objectives of encouraging rural industries to increase their contributions to research to 0.5 per cent of gross value of production and the Commonwealth will match the industry contribution to that level of expenditure. Over the past 18 months, industry has been preoccupied with the Government's decision to lift the import embargo on uncooked pig meat from Canada. I acknowledge that some legitimate concerns have been raised by the industry. The decision to permit the importation of uncooked pig meat from Canada was initially announced last September, but additional time was given for Australian producers to gather information which might justify Australia continuing its prohibition on the imports. However, in my mind, the ban can no longer be justified on either scientific or economic grounds, and could be perceived as a non-tariff barrier to trade. The decision to allow imports was taken only after art exhaustive process of consultation with pig producers and scientific consultations over a period of seven years. I point out that I have a very large piggery only 400 yards from my front door. At an early stage in this process, the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service ,(AQIS) identified the possibility of the disease transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) being introduced to Australia as the issue of primary quarantine concern. AQIS exists to keep serious exotic diseases out of Australia and maintains a very high degree of success in this regard. If sufficient justification existed, in quarantine terms, AQIS would reinstate the Canadian pig meat prohibition. Suffice it to say that TGE has never been known to be transmitted from one country to another by trade in pig meat. Studies indicate that only about 5 per cent of Canadian pigs have been exposed to the TGE virus or any other related virus. TGE is primarily a viral disease in young piglets, with slaughter-age pigs being far less susceptible and tending to develop only mild or no clinical signs. TGE virus localises in intestines, lymph nodes, lungs et cetera which are removed at slaughter; these parts are not permitted export to Australia. The virus has never been isolated from muscle tissue. TGE does not survive normal cooking processes. Swill feeding is illegal in Australia, and it is likely that prime cuts of imported pig meat would be disposed of by restaurants for swill feeding. TGE virus breaks down rapidly under normal temperatures and on exposure to sunlight. Likelihood of a bushwalker or a picnicker carrying uncooked pig meat, discarding it and it being consumed at once by a feral pig is next to impossible. Australia' has an international obliga.!. tion not to restrict trade on disease grounds unless a technically supportable case can be presented, and this is the issue at stake. The chances of TGE being introduced by imported pig meat are about one in 3.3 million. I have often underestimated the amount and made it much smaller, but facts since have demonstrated to me that it is approximately one in 3.3 million as I can ascertain it. This Government is keenly aware of the necessity of primary industry research and development and the Australian pig industry is currently contributing about 0.35 per cent of its gross value of production to research and development and is planning to increase its levy payments beyond the present maximum rates. There are no additional budgetary outlays and, as the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) said, this is one of many Bills in which we are expanding research and development in agriculture and it is vital, if we are to stay on top of the many challenges we face in rural industries, that we expand our research and development and increase and improve our productivity, and, of course, look at improving efficiencies from farm gate to market. As I have said many times, there is a massive gain to be made there. The Government is undertaking this and is addressing this issue now. It is not a simple one and it is something that has not been tackled in the past but it is important that we address it because there is a massive sa ving to be made there for primary producers, and primary producers in Australia are the best and the most efficient in the world. We are surviving under extreme pressures because of corrupt world markets, and the one thing I made clear in Japan-and I have said it many times not since-is that it is about time that Japan played a bigger role in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade round. It is a very wealthy nation. It is about time that the United States also looked internally and some of its own politicians showed a little more courage, instead of being wimps when it comes to subsidies, and it is about time members of the European Community started to understand that many nations, such as the United States and Australia, willingly sent young men to fight for their freedom in two world wars and what they are doing in their trade position now is disgraceful. But this amendment Bill is one that I certainly support. I am pleased that the Opposition supports it. The Bill will go a long way to improving our productivity and our competitiveness in the pork industry. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

160,Mr LLOYD,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"The Pri1986 mary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) amends two Acts-the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989 and the Grape Research Levy Act 1986-to correct minor drafting faults to the origiganisations' nal Bills. In debate on a previous Bill, referred to the frequency of research development levy Bills, and that to me is a very positive thing. This omnibus Bill, which picks up the drafting errors of the original legislation, certainly is positive. The changes in these Bills to correct these drafting mistakes mean research council selection committees will now be able to have their reports incormove porated in the annual report of the search and Development Corporation. Representative organisations are currently incorrectly associated with the research and development organisation rather than organisations. the industry, and this has changed. In the second Bill which this legislation seeks to amend, the grape legislation drafting error removed the right of the industry organisation which pays the levy to determine the level of the levy, and this is corrected. I understand that the grapes of wrath were brought to bear with regard to that industry in the way in which it was incorrectly excluded. There are also some amendments to energy Bills to correct minor drafting errors, and they also have the support of the Opposition. The coalition parties support these amendments but make the point that it would be nice if the Government got its drafting right the first time.",117
161,Mr COURTICE,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"The Primary Industries and Energy Legislabe tion Amendment Bill (No.2) amends the Primary Industries and Energy Research a and Development Act 1989, the PIERD Act, to correct a few minor drafting errors, as the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) has pointed out, and to introduce a number Of minor policy changes. It may well be that the honourable member for Murray will be called 1990, the John Steinbeck of Parliament. A further purpose of this Bill is to amend the Grape Research Levy Act of to restore authority for recommending levy changes to the industry-funding grape research which was mistakenly changed by the PIERD Act. The Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act defines 'representative orto be associated with the I research and development organisation, and rather than with an industry. This Bill will render all references to representative type organisations uniform. This Bill is an omnibus Bill for legislanot tion administered within the primary industries and energy portfolio. It aims to that improve the operation of research and development in the portfolio, and to reminor legislative inconsistencies. ReThe omnibus Bill aims to clarify the wording of financial reporting requirements for research and development corporations to their representative The minor policy changes refer to the requirement for research and development councils to provide their annualoperational and research and development plans to the Minister one month prior to them taking effect instead of two months ahead of time, as required by the PIERD Act, which will bring them into line with research and development corporations. It also allows the opportunity for the incorporation of selection committee reports into the relevant annual report of the research and development council or corporation, subject to agreement of the residing member of the selection committee and the chairperson of the research and development councilor corporation. By virtue of this Bill, research and development council chairpersons will be required to attend the annual chairpersons' coordination meeting. In addition, this Bill amends the Grape Research Levy Act 1986. The intention of the PIERD Act was not to alter past practice of determining the level of levies for industries, but arrangements in the grape and wine industry were inadvertently altered at the drafting stage. This Bill provides a role for the representative organisation in determining the level of levies. The measures set out in this Bill amending the PIERD Act and the Grape Research Levy Act 1986 will involve no change in financial outlays for the Commonwealth. Once again, it is pleasing to see the continuing emphasis in agriculture on research and development. In conclusion, I point out that whilst the Bill is a small Bill and may not necessarily measure up in the media to many of the other larger pieces of legislation, it covers the grape and wine industries which are extremely important. One of the things that we can proudly say in regard to Australian wine today is that it is competitive with other countries. Australian wine is as good as any wine in the world. Mr Sciacca-Hear, hear!",117
162,Mr COURTICE,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"And I am pleased to see that the honourable member for Bowman has made that comment. As a very well known connoisseur of wine and with some European heritage, he is well aware of the fact that Australian wine is holding its own. I was very proud when I was in Japan recently to see Australian wine on the. wine list of the Imperial Hotel. It just demonstrates that we have made it in the international scene. We should never be intimidated by the traditions and by the rhetoric of the French, the Germans or other Europeans-Mr L1oyd---,-And the Italians. Mr COURTICEAs the honourable member for Murray says, 'And the Italians'. We are doing well. We can be very proud of Australian wine. Research and development in this area can only enhance that pride, As I and many other speakers have said, there is a great market out there. We can take them on and beat them because we are doing it from behind the eight ball with handicaps. It means that we have to continue to produce the better product, and research and development is the way to do it. While this is just a small Bill, it does address a few areas; it also concentrates on grapes and wines. I am very pleased to support this Bill and also to have made those few - points. We should be very proud of our wine industry.",118
163,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"I rise tonight to address a couple of issues in relation to the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2). This Bill corrects minor drafting faults in the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989 and in the Grape Research Levy Act 1986. Although the individual amendments are far from controversial, they are important in a collective sense for the well-being of research and development in primary industries. Research and development has the very broad aim of keeping products competitive on world markets. Research and development is an investment in Australian industry, in greater efficiencies, higher productivity, progressive marketing techniques and enhanced managerial skills Training and research and development are of paramount importance to primary industries and should be made a national priority because of the high return compared to the money expended-in other words, the investment. I recognise that the Government does contribute considerable funds to research and development. However, one of the points that I wish to raise is that it appears that, because the Government contributes to research and development, it assumes that a financial commitment entails or warrants government interference. Take, for example, the current membership policy of statutory marketing authorities. The current policy provides for a specially designated government member selected by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) to be included in the membership of each statutory marketing authority board. The rationale for this arrangement is that as statutory organisations, the statutory keting authorities need to be aware of government policy and public sector administration practices and that their boards require professional advice on those matters in their decision making. I quite agree that the boards do need professional advice when they make decisions which could require legislation. However, I refer the House to the report of the Committee of Review of Commonwealth Primary Industry Statutory Marketing Authorities, chaired by Professor Jeremy Davis, which was released to the industry for wider debate on 18 October last year. The original document seems to have lain around the Minister's office or somewhere in the Department since 4 April last year. I am rather curious to know why it should lie around the halls of this place for six months prior to being released to industry. . Recommendation 21 of the Davis report on statutory marketing authorities advocates that there be no specially designated position for a government member on statutory marketing boards. It is rather interesting because it is a Government review which has recommended that there not be government members appointed to statutory marketing boards. Curiously, though, the Minister's attachment to the Davis report omits any comment on recommendation 21, and I question the Minister as to why this is the case. A further issue which the Government considered was the selection process of board members. It was the Government's view that in many cases the selection process had worked well but that in others industry politics had had an undue influence on the selection of board members and on the manner in which they discharged their duties. I think that is probably a fair comment. Many of us in this House agree that some of our statutory marketing boards have had undue political pressure from industry organisations. However, the Minister .did come up with two options for change in the process of appointing selection committees. I think this is most interesting because his recmar- ommendations are clearly at odds with the thrust of the Davis report which, to my mind, is in line with current thinking around the country. One of the options put forward was for the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy to appoint up to 50 per cent of members of the selection committee in addition to having the power to appoint the presiding chairman without reference to peak industry bodies. Once again, we are seeing the Government wanting to have a say in industry affairs. Political interference is not good in this area. The affairs of the industry should be allowed to flow without political interference. Another option that the Minister has put forward has been election by the levy payers of the statutory marketing boards at an open annual general meeting of that industry. I cite the meeting of the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation which is held annually at different centres around Australia. My figures suggest that only 15 to 17 per cent of those levy payers are represented at an annual meeting. I question why it is that they would be any more competent to appoint a selection committee than the process that we have now. The current procedure in the meat industry is for a selection committee, made up of two representatives from the cattle industry, one from the sheep industry, three from the meat processors and an independent chairman nominated by the Minister. I am quite at ease with that. No one sector has undue influence on the selection process determining who the members of the statutory marketing board should be. I ask the Minister: what is wrong with that type of structure? Is it that the Government proposes increasing the bureaucratic and technocratic elements of the various primary industry organisations? I hope not. I ask the Minister and the Government to clearly rethink these proposals. An area which this Parliament should look at is the alignment between research and development and training, which is lacking at the moment. Unfortunately, research is often isolated from training practices when skills learned through training practices are a means of achieving the results of research and development. In Australia, there is no tertiary level training on offer relating specifically to meat processing. This clearly contrasts with the situation in the United States where whole university faculties are devoted to meat science. Quite clearly, the Australian meat industry, which is the top meat exporter in the world, is lagging behind in industry training. Research and training are inseparable and provide the key to improved productivity. Australia will need to improve its work force productivity if it is going to. service our overseas debt, and training will contribute to that improved productivity. An obvious means of achieving that is by adding value to staple export earners before they leave this country by means of supplementary feeding, speciality breeding and consistency of quality of product. From the producing sector, to the processing plant and to the retail outlet, there is clearly scope for improved training practices. I would like to see training much more clearly linked to research and development. The honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) touched on the wine industry. He said that Australian wine is well regarded and that he was very pleased to see it being sold in Japan. I share that view, because Australian wine is a quality product and is now considered worldwide as the equal of that of anywhere else in the world. A lot of that success is due to the research and development and promotion money that the industry has put forward. However, one of the things that are hitting the wine industry right now is the worldwide recession; the industry is being hit very hard by the recession in Australia. In Australia wine is considered a luxury, unlike in Europe, where it is on the table as a matter of course almost at every meal. I acknowledge that there are different attitudes between Europeans and Australians, but I would like to see a change of attitude by the Government, because a change in government policy could help this industry. The wine industry is an export industry which has gained world recognition and I think this Government could show a lot more sympathy towards it. One of the things that are hitting the wine industry hard during this recession is the 20 per cent sales tax on all wines. But even worse than that is the stock valuation tax. One of the problems with the stock valuation tax is that it is taken as at 30 June each year. A winemaker has just finished his harvest by this time, so his stocks are right up to the maximum. The Government at this point collects the maximum tax from the industry, and the winemaker pays this stock valuation tax on his full stock. Clearly there is no incentive for the wine industry to age its product. As we would all agree, wine improves with age. Perhaps politicians improve with age too. Mr Cowan-Of course we do!",118
164,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,ENERGY LEGISLATION,Of course we do. I have not heard interjections from the other side of the House.,120
165,Mr LLOYD,ENERGY LEGISLATION,Some get a new lease of life.,120
166,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"The honourable member for Murray has a new lease of life. Clearly the Government should be playing a role. That role is to give the wine industry an incentive to age its wines, which will add further value to the export industry rather than taxing it. The industry feels that the stock valuation tax based on full stocks is an unfair tax. The wine industry is an export industry, it is doing well and it has gained worldwide recognition. I believe we should be giving it greater support. I will not oppose the legislation, nor will this side of the House. It is great to see that research and development are necessary parts of the legislation. We have supported these changes, minor as they may be, but I hope that the Minister will look at the points I have raised, particularly in relation to the statutory marketing authorities. I want to see less government interference in statutory marketing authorities and the selection committee process. I want the Government to let them run their own affairs.",120

169,Mr WRIGHT,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"The honourable memwhat ber would understand that the Act itself covers the 18 councils and corporations that this Government has promoted and - et up to assess the needs of industry, be 1t wool, energy or meat. It does a tremenreally dous job in that research and developyou'. ment arena. I want to propose that some of that $160m that has been spent in the last year be used in a different field. want to bring into the debate some of the concerns that are being expressed, particIndustries ularly in my area, in relation to foreign investment in the cattle industry. . It is importa-t t-at we do have foreign mvestment. It 1S 1mportant that we enlies courage other countries, which have that technology, those skills and access to kets, to come into Australia and give those advantages. But sometimes there debate as to whether or not those multiinvestment'-but national groups and foreign groups are simply coming here to take over existing well run industries. Recently I met with the United Gratential. ziers Association in my area and also members of the Cattlemen's Union and representatives from the Cattle Council Australia. They put it to me rather cinctly and strongly that one of the lems that they see in, for instance, Conagra proposal for Australia is that is simply coming into an industry that do best. It is not something that it is to really revamp or enhance in major ways with skills and new ideas; it is something we are the best at, especially when it comes to range grazing, and the processing facilities and capacity we have in this country. What I am proposing is that there is a need to use the skills and the expertise that exist in these councils and corporations in the research and development area to start assessing what we really need in terms of foreign investment. At the moment the test is a very simple one. If of someone proposes to come into AusI am pleased that the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean) is here because I believe he has a role in this field, as does the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin)there needs to be an assessment as to will be best for this country. At the moment, the guidelines are such that as long as that proposal is not going to disadvantage our country, the Foreign Investment Review Board can say little. It cannot say, 'We are going to stop In the old Whitlam days, there were two tests: first, it had to be positively advantageous to Australia and, secondly, I there was a requirement of equity. I note that the Minister for Primary and Energy is now pursuing that discussion as to the importance of equity in these ventures. I would suggest that those discussions go further. As I said, we should take up the expertise that within the corporations and the councils and get them to have a hard look at marsome of our rural sector and the indusus tries in that sector and come to a point is of saying, 'This is where we need the not because Conagra sees a massive advantage in neutralising-as it has been suggested by some in the meatworkers industry-our export poWe saw Kraft do that some time back. We were supplying the Malaysian and south-east Asian market but, because of of advantageous exchange rates, it was sucdecided to supply that market from the probNetherlands. We have seen it happen in the other rural sectors. We need to ensure it that those companies that come here to we take over our industries are really going going to give an advantage to our country. There is a lot of argument against foreign investment in the cattle industry, but I have always said that we ought to have a balance here. I am mindful of a meat works that was taken over 100 per cent by the Japanese in New South Wales. That meat works was going to be closed by the local council that owned it. Since that total 100 per cent buy-out by the Japanese interests, 500 people are being employed there. New markets have been found for high grade meat and new technical skills have been introduced into those works, so the advantages are there. One could say that we did not need research and development to have known that was going to happen, because the place was simply being closed down and anything would have been better just to keep the gates open; but, in most other areas, I believe that assessment ought to be made. I also argue that these councils and corporations ought to take upon themselves terms of reference to constantly assess the financial and the overall impact of the downstream consequences on those related industries. I have some concerns as a member who represents cattle areas that, as we have foreign investors taking over that processing point, they will in fact affect and control, directly or indirectly, upstream and downstream of that processing point. They shall have an enormous impact and control over grazing and they shall ultimately determine the retail price because they have targeted the very key point of the production line. We need experts to tell us whether that is warranted, whether it is needed or whether we can do it ourselves. Because of the structure and because of the money we have already expended, we are not seeking to drag money out of government to do these things. The money is already appropriated under the Primary Industries and Energy Research Development Act. Money is being expended year after year to carry out research and development through these 18 councils and corporations. It is already a part of the terms of reference to assess the future needs of the industries that are involved-the wool industry, the wheat industry and so on. I believe that my point is valid and that there should be some deliberation as to how we can extend this role; otherwise we will have continuing debate in this country as to the value of foreign investment. We will have graziers who constantly say, 'These people come in and they pay unbelievable amounts of money for a property next door and they blowout the costs in the surrounding area. They are making it impossible for young Australians to go on the land'. It has happened in Cairns, as we appreciate, where recently some $23m was paid for a cane farm. We know what the cost of living is in Cairns now because of the sort of foreign investment that has taken place in that area. I am sure that my colleague from Cairns appreciates those difficulties, and he is certainly addressing the problems. Whatever industry we look at, there is a need to assess the future impact of some of these investments. I believe that there is a case to be put and that what I am saying is warranted: we should use our facilities and expertise in this way. I ask that the Minister take my point to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy in particular, who I know has already expressed some personal interest in this issue of equity. I am sure that, because of the role he has already played in enhancing, developing and expanding our rural sector, he will also see the advantages of ensuring that, as we assess our needs right now, we apply that assessment to the foreign investment sector and that when we approve those foreign proposals we ensure that they are truly in the interests of this . country. We do not want a situation where we simply say that they are not to our disadvantage. We ought to have a positive measure, and that measure should be that foreign investment must be truly in Australia's best interests. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

NA Report [COGNATE PAPERS: INDUSTRY COMMISSION-INTERIM , REPORT NA AUTHORITY-REPORT] Debate resumed from 21 August 1990, on motion by Mr Beazley: That the House take note of the paper. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Sullivan)-I understand that it is the wish of the House to debate this order of the day concurrently with orders of the day Nos. 9 and 10. There being no objection, the Chair will allow that course to be followed. (Quorum formed)",121
170,Mr CHANEY,AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY,"1 must confess that to my surprise the House of Representatives is debating a number of important Industry Commission reports. I want to address some remarks to the interim report on paper recycling. I am touched by the fact that a number of Labor members have answered the call for a quorum. I suspect, looking across at them and their noting their concern about current political issues and holding their seats, that they are, I am sure, giving assiduous attention to their electorates. I am sure that they know that within their electorates there is a very great deal of interest in the issue of recycling. Indeed, as I go around Australia, I find frequent complaints from people who say, 'We followed the advice that has been given to us by the environmental movement. We have carefully collected up our materials. We have separated it out and we then find there is nothing that can be done with it'. This is one of those interesting areas where I think it could be fairly said that the public enthusiasm for change has actually outrun the capacity of the institutional arrangements in many cases to actually deal with the material which is available for recycling. Paper especially stands out in that respect. There has been very successful cooperation between industry, voluntary groups and various public bodies in respect of the recycling of aluminium. We find that a very high proportion of Australian aluminium production is being recycled. A very high proportion of cans is being recycled. That is very significant. We are told that one aluminium can takes about a third of a can of oil to produce. So recycling in those circumstances is of very great direct economic and environmental value because there is a very high energy cost saving involved. This feature of that successful area of recycling is substantially absentÂ· in the paper recycling area, particularly in that area which is a cause of concern in many areas, not least in Victoria, where I found many municipalities concerned about the fact that they are collecting up paper and then find there is nothing to be done with it. We have a situation-and the report puts a lot of useful information before us-where about a third of nearly 2.8 million tonnes of paper products that are, consumed annually is recovered and recycled. This is a high profile public environmental issue and, as I say, there is a great wish on the part of the public to cooperate in the endeavour. We have the position where some collection services are being abandoned because of a lack of a market. This has caused a great deal of irritation to local councils and to volunteer groups, and indeed to committed environmentalists. All of these people will be interested to examine the facts contained in this report. They ask some questions which need to be asked in assessing what public action should be taken. For example, the point is made that the important question is not whether recycling rates should be higher, but whether the Australian community would be better off if they were. As I said before, it is quite clear in the case of reprocessing aluminium that there is an immediate and considerable economic and energy saving advantage. In the case of paper, that is often not the case. The truth of the matter is that the problem lies not in the reprocessing of clean, high quality waste paper and board, but in the great volume of old newspapers and magazines which people conscientiously collect up and for which there is no immediate use in Australia. Some of it can be reprocessed but the great bulk of it has to be either dumped or exported. So there IS some public misapprehension about that. I think there is little understanding that a good deal of what we might call the higher quality fibre material is in fact going to reprocessing. That is increasing, and indeed there is considerable competition for such material. I have a dispute in my State of Western Australia between people who' are reprocessing high quality paper into tissue. It is a quite significant dispute between the people who want access to, amongst other things, government stocks of that higher quality paper. That is an area in which there is not a great public understanding, but it is important to know that in that area things are generally on track. If we look at the prospects of improving our performance, we run into some new environmental problems. The report indicates that collection and sorting costs are put at between $50 and $70 a tonne for newsprint, whereas landfill disposal costs range from nothing to $45. I know that it is very unfashionable to put forward that sort of accounting when we are looking at significant environmental questions, but the truth is that that sort of accounting is very relevant to environmental outcomes. Unless we get economically attractive options, we can often be in a situation where we are wasting community resources rather than saving them. I am sure that the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly)-and I appreciate the fact that she is in the chamber for this debate--:-would, like me, have puzzled over the environmental conundrum involved in having a de-inking plant in Australia. That is the major step which needs to be taken if we are to be able to reprocess greater amounts of newsprint. But the fact of the matter is, sadly, that the reprocessing and de-inking of newspaper in itself gives rise to environmental problems. I suspect that the Minister, like me, has examined the major environmental issue of salt in the Murray-Darling system and has looked at the equations being put forward, the proposals which involve the possibility of adding salt at some point high in the river, near Albury, and removing significantly greater quantities of salt further down. One can understand why there is a great deal of nervousness along the Murray River about that proposal. I think with the best will in the world it would have to be said that some of the work being done in the Murray-Darling Basin on salt removal is really experimental. I suspect that in this Parliament, within the lifetime of at least some of the newer and younger members here, we will be seeing an enormous increase in our efforts to revive the Murray-Darling Basin. I do not believe, even gi ven the sort of changes that have been made-and the Opposition advocated the inclusion of Queensland, and totally supports the changes that have been made-that there is within the Government, the Opposition or the Australian community a real comprehension of the size and scale of the problem we are seeking to deal with in the Murray-Darling Basin. The Age newspaper made a very valuable contribution to this debate a few months ago. It discussed some of the proposed engineering solutions, costing billions of dollars. It investigated the possibility of using channels and so on to divert water. We know that large sums are being expended on evaporation ponds and soon, and I would be interested to know whether the Minister shares my concern that we may not have got the story on that right, and that it is indeed to some extent experimental. The relevance of that to this issue is that the next major step, which we would all hope to see taken with respect to the reprocessing of newsprint-something which would be welcomed by local authorities, charitable groups and lots of other people who are concerned about this-is in itself giving rise to what I hope is not an intractable problem but a problem which is certainly causing significant debate in the community and which I do not believe it is possible to be glib about. terials. I do not think that in this area one can say that there are nice, straightforward, simple answers and it is just nasty politicians who are preventing these adequate solutions. I think there are genuinely ficult problems that are being sorted out. Since the Minister is in the chamber, I hope that there will be opportunities during the life of this Parliament for us to consider the broader related issues of the Murray-Darling Basin because, whilst I do not think that we are going to see a radical change of approach over the next couple of years, I think that we need to start canvassing the potential size of that problem and we need to understand why there will be solid resistance in the Murray-Darling Basin to the introduction of any processes which add to the salt flow in that river system. The Oppo-ition is strongly supportive in its policies of having an approach which will encourage the maximum reprocessing of paper. It is a matter of record that we were in advance of the Government in seeking sales tax concessions for the use of recycled paper, and we were delighted that the Government picked up that option to encourage the use of what is higher quality paper, in the main, under a sales tax advantage. I hope that there will be all-party sup- front reform. port in the House of Representatives for the proposition that we really cannot proceed in this area simply by coercion. To do that risks, as the report says, the possible compounding of inefficiencies. We really do have to try to ensure that the economic factors are such that there is a positive incentive to reprocess paper beyond that which exists at present. We will be considering this matter in our own review of the taxation system, and I know that since the last Budget the Government has had in place a review of environment-related aspects of the taxation system. I think it is well known in this chamber that we have decided to introduce a goods and services tax, and I think it will be necessary for us to examine the implications of that tax on the possible recycling of paper and other maI think it is worth mentioning another important point made by the Industry Commission-namely, its belief that exports are the only way of marketing sigdif- nificant amounts of excess supplies of waste newsprint in the immediate future. That is something which, again, offends some environmentalists. I have struck real anger in the community that Australian paper is sent to India, for example, for reprocessing. I think that anger is quite short-sighted and based on a misunderstanding of the reality that we should take a global approach on these issues. If material can be economically dealt with in some other part of the world and recycled, then that is a valuable contribution to the world environment and to the maintenance of the timber resources of the world. As is so often the case when looking at these questions, there are issues of fundamental changes that need to be made in the Australian economy. Again-too seldom, I think-the environmental debate picks up these fundamentals. The report states: If costs on the waterfront and freight rates were reduced more old newsprint could be profitably exported, since these costs are equivalent to two thirds of the cif value of export sales. This emphasises the need for continuing effort on waterI think that this country is in a perilous overall situation-not environmentally; we are blessed with a large country and a small population, which in environmental terms is an enormous advantage. We are, unfortunately, a country with very significant economic problems. As the Commission for the Future observed in its paper. on sustainable development, the truth is that there are major challenges if Australia is to move to sustainable development, and the first of those challenges is to solve our debt problem. That is not some hidebound, Tory, reactionary view of the environmental challenges facing Australia. That is the view that was put down in an excellent paper by Ms Lubya Zarsky of the Commission for the Future. I think, therefore, that this debate should also be a reminder to us that, if we are to do the right thing environmentally, it is actually vitally important that we do the right thing economically. That part of the debate has been underemphasised-it is not particularly fashionable-and I think it is part of the role of this Parliament to bring what is true but unfashionable into sharper focus. The truth is that many of the good things which one would seek to do cannot be done because of the structural inefficiencies in the Australian economy. If it is very expensive to transport waste products for processing, they will not be ported; they will not be reprocessed. That is why this continual refrain about microeconomic reform remains at the forefront of the Australian agenda if we are to solve our problems, not just environmentally but also economically. I hope that we will continue to see in Australia a very strong public support for the personal discipline, the personal contribution, that people can make to lessen energy use, to contribute to a more effective use of resources and to move towards sustainable development. There are policies which are required from government, but there are also very significant actions required from every individual in the community.",123
171,Mr SCHOLES,AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY,"It is my intention to devote my remarks to the 1989-90 Automotive Industry Authority report and matters relevant to that report. Almost anything to do with the automobile industry today is probably not terribly relevant to the circumstances at the time when this report was prepared. The automobile industry in Australia has had a very mixed past and has an uncertain future. In the first few decades of automobiles, Australia was to the forefront. It dropped back. There were assembly plants established in Australia. The Ford motor company, for instance, was established in Geelong in 1929. In 1948, I suppose, the maximum euphoria arrived when the first Australian-made car was actually put into production by General Motors and rolled off the production line some time in late 1948. .: For about 20 years the;industry had a fairly stable future, with one Australian vehicle. We then went through a period when the 95 per cent plan, a plan which the late Sir John MCEwen was responsible for, appeared to provide and-one has to say with hindsight-did provide excessive protection to the extent that the Australian car industry ultimately suffered by not being able to change with market trends that took place through the late 1960s as people moved to four-cylinder cars; and the inflexibility of the tariff regime of that time did not permit the Australian manufacturers-at that time transChrysler, Ford and General Motors-to move into the four-cylinder vehicles without going into a 95 per cent production vehicle which was unecol'iomic. In the mid-1970s, under the Whitlam Government, new plans were devised-:what was called the 85 per cent all models policy-and two new mal).1Jfacturers came into the system,. We had Jittle or no option at the time; it was always considered desirable that there should be three manufacturers, but Toyota and Nissan came into the field and subsequently Chrysler became Mitsubishi. We still have five manufacturers, although the real model content has dropped substantially from those days. In fact, I can recall Mr Whitlam saying that there were more than two million options available for motor vehicles in Australia for the two million buyers who were buying motor cars at that time. That was not a very economic situation. Since the plans' of 1974 came into being, there was the export facilitation plan which came in largely under Sir Phillip Lynch. There was a change of plan in 1980; which had the effect of increasing tariffs. The Liberal Party of Australia is now holy and pure' on tariffs, but it increased protective tariffs to well over 100 per cent, which was probably the highest ever level of tariff for any industry. The Button' plan, which is now in place and which is due to expire in 1992, was a modification of that plan, but it implemented a system of a gradual reduction in tariffs, and it also encouraged export, and export in skilled end products. The Automobile Industry Authority's report makes the point that export facilitation is a key element in the currentnot the proposed-plan. The scheme is designed to promote the process of rationalisation of both the vehicle producing and the component sectors by focusing the industry's attention on those products it produces at world levels of price and quality. I think that is important. Currently the Australian automobile industry is worth between $2 billion and $3 billion. That would be the cost of replacing the current Australian manufacture with imports, which is effectively the proposal now before the Government from the Industry Commission. The Commission is unable to project forward what type of industry it sees as the consequences of its report. One finds it very difficult indeed to see how a report such as the Industry Commission report on the automobile industry, which will have such potentially far-reaching effects on the Australian community, can be put forward when the Commission itself is unable to project forward what it sees as the consequences of that report. . In a throwaway line, the Chairman of that Authority said that he did not have a crystal ball. Without a crystal ball he has indicated that he thinks there may be a 40 per cent reduction in the size of the Australian industry. That is $1 billion worth of product and approximately 30,000 employees in the direct industry itself, plus virtually all the component suppliers who would no longer survive in a completely knocked down (CKD) type environment. In my electorate it almost certainly represents the loss of the major industry in the area, which is the manufacturing plant of the Ford Motor Company of Australia Ltd-there is no assembly in Geelong-which employs a very high component of the skilled labour force in that industry and trains something like 50 per cent of the metal-type tradesmen in the Geelong area. It is a key industry for the economy of a city of 160,000 people. The actual numbers employed are a lot fewer than the effect which the loss of that industry would mean. I contend-and I think with some justification-that one cannot cut off 40 per. cent of a major industry without losing a major part of the industry. We are talking about international firms manufacturing in Australia. There is no Australian shareholding of any significance and certainly no voting power in Australia. All the motor car industries are controlled from the United States or Japan-that is, those which operate in Australia-and their decisions are international commercial decisions made on the basis of what is in ,the best interests of their companies. We cannot reduce the industry by 40 per cent without taking it back virtually to CKDs-completely knocked down vehicles-that are assembled in Australia, which requires no skill at all. In the 1950s and 1960s, foreign countries involved in the assembly of motor cars, such as Sweden and Germany, used guest workers because that type of work was not considered to be satisfactory for their nationals. It must be said that Australia did exactly the same thing, but we allowed the people into the country as migrants. They worked on production lines in the various motor companies and in other jobs that Australians at that stage preferred not to do. The Australian motor car industry also has that component I mentioned beforethat is, it provides a significant foreign exchange replacement factor, possibly $3 billion. I have not at this stage seen any evidence whatsoever from the Industry Commission that it even comprehends where $ 3 billion worth of foreign currency will come from to pay for what it euphemistically says will be cheaper cars. The 10,000 to 15,000 families in my electorate who are completely deprived of their income will not be terribly worried about whether an imported car costs $30,000 or $40,000-or even $15,000-because they will not have income and they will not be purchasing. The Chairman of the Industry Commission said, 'Well, all of the people who were tossed out of the textile industry in the 1970s got jobs'. I have news for him. Women who worked as weavers in the textile mills in my electorate who lost their jobs through the 1960s and 1970s never got jobs again-there were never any jobs for them. There may have been additional jobs available for women in the work force in other areas and categories-particularly since the election of this Government-but they were not there for the people put out of work at that time. Those families suffered a permanent loss in standard of living. They did not recover. Any significant loss of the manufacturing sections of the motor car industryand that is the high skilled end of the industry-would be catastrophic for my electorate. The area has already suffered badly from other factors. It is a consumer buoyant economy area-much like Adelaide-where the effects of downturn are felt much more severely than in the capital cities and areas such as Canberra, where the decisions are made, where 60 per cent of the population are completely divorced from economic considerations. In Canberra they work in protected industries-the most protected industries in Australia. I might say that those people who have made these recommendations in the Industry Commission do not suffer any consequences for the mistakes they make; they get raises in pay. There are proposals being put forward by the Opposition, and also being suggested by some honourable members in my Party-and I hope they never come to fruition-that we should have what someone described as a level playing field. The Opposition spokesman has said that tariffs on motor cars should reach 5 per cent within. the next 10 years. That effectively means we do not manufacture motor cars in Australia. The textiles and footwear industries are confronted with exactly the same consequences. When we speak of level playing fields, let us see where we are, because the level playing field of 5 per cent is precipitous, and we are on the bottom. The first thing is that if we have a 5 per cent tariff against imports, in fact it does not cover the subsidies given to exporting nations in various forms by their governmentsassistance in tooling, assistance in tax concessions, tax holidays, and a range of other activities. It does not cover the tra charges placed on an Australian manufacturer which are not faced by tb,e, importer. Payroll tax in this country is 7.5 per cent, and it is charged on a multiple basis on those products which c<;>me from one supplier to another supplier before they end up in a final product. . Workers compensation is not paid by many of our major competitors; they do not have such things. It probably represents up to 10 Pt:r cent in additional cost to Australian manufacturers over and above importers. 'At that figure, and allowing that the full cost is not inflaJed by that amount, we are somewhere in excess of 10 per cent additional charges against Australian manufacturers on our so-called level' playing field. Decisions will be made in a very short time by the Australian Government about the future under which car manufacturing will take place-sometime in th- next two months the new car plan which applies for 1992 has to be brought forward-and will also be made by the car companies on their investments and future developments in Australia. Seventy thousand Australians, as a minimum, and their families depend on this industry. Far more . will be lost if we decide to play games with academic economic theories, as are too often quoted in this parliament. There are realities, and we have to give those people who are prepared to manufaoture goods in Australia an opportunity to do so at least similar to that which exists in the countries of our competitors. A level playing field does' not represent a 15 per cent tariff and it does not represent a government not providing assistance in the form of incentives for add-on skills and exports. Every country does it. Every country believes that it has to do it; Australia for some reason is naive enough to believe that it does not. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Sullivan) - Order! The honourable member's time has expired.",126
172,Mr DOBIE,AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY,"As chairman of the coalition's task force on environment and development, I wish to make. a few remarks about the Industry Comex- mission's report Pulp and Paper: Bleaching and the Environment. There is a great temptation to talk on the other two issues, but I shall limit myself to this report, which was published in May of and. 'reflects co-munity concerns about the' effects on the environment of the manufacturing and bleaching of pulp. Following the infamous debacle of the Wesley Vale proposal, about which I will talk tonight, let me say that I welcome this inquiry into the environmental impacts of alternative bleaching technologies. I am also pleased that the Government has allowed some time in the legislative program for debate on reports. One can only hope that after the shockingly short number of sitting days in 1990-only 38 in the House of Represent-tives-we will have more opportunity for debate of other reports in the House of Representatives this year. It has been a scandal as to few reports have been brought before the House for discussion in the last two years, and not just on this subject. If the Govalso ernment thinks that we keep talking about , ulently. this, it had better get ready-we plan to keep talking and pointing out the dispreferred graceful situation that has developed in Australia, in the last year with the almost destruction of the Federal parliamentary process. If it had not been for our Senate friends, there would be nothing discussed in the Federal Parliament at all. It is clear that the report we are discussing, and which we will discuss again tomorrow, is primarily intended to form and present different views about pulp and paper bleaching and the envimatters. ronment. It does not represent a blueprint for Government action. It is by no means a contentious document. Nonetheless, it is an interesting appraisal of current techpreferred nology regarding alternative bleaching technologies. There is justifiable community concern about the effects on the environment of the bleaching of pulp. The bleaching of pulp has always been a necessary compothat nent of the paper making process. Pulp bleached to increase brightness and to move lignum in order to produce paper products which are functional and satisfy quality requirements. While some pulp used in unbleached form specifically for newsprint and tissues, other pulp is bleached in some form either mechanilast year cally or chemically. Debate interrupted. NA",128
173,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being approximately 10.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Financial Situation in Victoria, Western Australia and South Australia",129
174,Mr CARLTON,ADJOURNMENT,"1 should like to draw to the attention of the House the, extraordinary position that Australia faces in three Labor governed States: Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia. In all three States the governments are not elected by popular how vote. In two of those States they were elected quite fraudulently and in the third State, South Australia, in retrospect it is quite clear that it was elected fraudIn Victoria the Liberal-National Party vote was 50.5 per cent in the last.election. The financial situation of the State of Victoria was covered up. There were a number of allegations about the condition of the State Bank of Victoria and of the Victorian Economic Development Corporation (VEDC) which were all denied by the State Government in the lead-up to the election. There was a deninialby the then Government, the Cain Government, of any concern about these Questions were asked at the time. An election was held. The Liberal-National Party got a clear majority of the two-party vote but because of the electoral boundaries, they did not win the election and the Government that was electednot representative of the people-was shown to have deluded the people of Victoria about the true financial situation of State. I do not need to point out to is this House the true dimensions of the refinancial catastrophe that has overcome the State of Victoria since that election. An even worse situation occurred in is Western Australia where the then Government deluded the people' about the financial situation in that State. Questions were asked. The former premier, Brian Burke, had departed for Ireland. Premier Dowding misled the people about the financial situation of that State and the extent of financial dealings between the Australian Labor Party and the business community in that State. The Liberal National Party vote on a two party preferred basis in Western Australia was 52.4 per cent but, because of the boundaries, the Labor Party still won and, to its eternal discredit, it was proven after the tion that the Labor Party had misled the whole community, and since then the history of Western Australia has become quite evident, and the disaster and the difficulties continue to this day. Now we find in South Australia, where in the last election the combined Liberal National Party vote wa-52 per cent, an extreme minority government was re-elected, again fraudulently, and we find now that the State Bank of South Australia has been in desperate difficulties, that all the various government inspired controls, investments and intrusions into private business have been misguided to the great disadvantage of the Australian electors and that this fraudulently elected government is liable for a deficiency in the State finances of an extraordinary degree, to the extent of some $2,000 per family. At the Federal level we face a very similar situation. We were told before the last Federal election that there would be no recession. We were advised by the present Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) that the whole economy was on track, that the various policies that had been put in place by the Labor Government were going to work. We were assured, during questioning, by the Prime Minister and the Treasurerboth of them-that there would be no recession. The Government was re-elected with a primary vote of 39 per cent of the Australian electorate and a minority of the two-party preferred vote. We now find that we are in a recession. We are in a state of financial disaster. Today the worse inflation rate for four years was announced. All we can say is that Labor means financial disaster. Labor in Australia could never be trusted and no longer can it be trusted.",129
175,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Japan,130
176,Dr CATLEY,ADJOURNMENT,"On Monday I returned from Japan, having spent 10 days in that country as a guest elecof the Japanese Government. I take this opportunity to thank the Japanese people for the wonderful opportunity they afforded me and the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns) and the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice). It was truly a fine educational experience. During the trip we visited many factories, a science city at Tsukuba, and a number of government and economic agencies. We spoke to senior officials of the Liberal-Democratic Party, the LDP, and to Ms Doi, the Leader of the Social Democratic Party. We also visited some cultural centres, including a kabuki theatre and a sumo wrestling competition. However, the most impressive aspect of Japan is its economy. While it is true that mass living standards do not yet rival Australia's, that its economic foreign trade surpluses are declining and that its growth rate has slowed, Japan has still produced the most impressive economic record of any nation in the post-war period. We might well ponder the reasons for this. It is true that Japan has an industrious, careful work force that has had a high savings, low consumption, rising productivity history. It is also true that the dense population has enabled the construction of an intense economic infrastructure of transport and communications, with low housing expenditure consolidating this density. But the same has been true of many other nations which have not performed nearly as well in the economic sphere. Like many other observers-and unlike our Industry Commission-I have long held the view that a major differentiating feature Of the Japanese economy has been the role of its state in successfully orchespeaking trating economic strategy. This is not to say that state intervention in economic affairs is universally benign. Soviet experience shows that this is clearly not the case. It is rather to suggest the Japanese state managers have designed a system of state-market interface which has, in the Japanese context, successfully produced a high growth economy with mercantilist external surpluses-surpluses which are detrimental to other consuming nations, particularly those of North America and Australia. Almost everywhere we went I was struck with the role of state management. For example, at NTT, the Japanese Telecom, we were told of the managed competition model which had NTT at its core, harassed around the periphery and in its subsidiary economic activities such as mobile telephones by a myriad of smaller competitors. At the science city we were informed of the $10 billion of public infrastructure investment that had kickstarted that vastly impressive project, which now has many private corporations investing there, but $10 billion worth of public capital was put in before a cent of private capital was injected. The agricultural sector has been and remains the object of managed protection. In the case of daily consumption rice, none of this is allowed to be imported. In industries that are deemed by the state to be in decline, recession cartels are regularly organised. In the past this wound down the silk industry, and at present the aluminium smelting industry is being wound down by such a recession cartel. In sectors of the economy identified as long term growth sectors, for example in the past automobiles and now information industries, low interest financing, personnel development policies, taxation incentives, research and development programs, just to name a few state subventions, are weighed in. The point is that the coordinated, almost corporatist state, which combines the LDP, long in office, the meritocratic and very efficient state apparatus, a productivity oriented labour movement and a coherent system of industry associations with the Keidanren, has identified and pursued national goals-that is, goals identified by the state. It has used the market mechanism as a tool of the economy to produce economic efficiencies within the context of a highÂ· capital accumulation-foreign account surplus strategic objective. The market is a tool for the pursuit of national objectives but not its goal. There is much that is wrong with this model, notably the relatively poor living conditions of much of the Japanese population,a condition which springs in large measure from the almost exclusively economic goals the state has set itself. When the opposition parties become more politically skilful they will no doubt capitalise on these deficiencies to the detriment of economic performance. But if we in this country are deluded into believing that market forces alone and unaided produced the Japanese economic miracle we are deluded indeed. Television Aggregation",130
177,Mr TRUSS,ADJOURNMENT,"On 1 January, television aggregation came to rural and provincial Queensland, or so the Government would have us believe. The truth is that the plan to bring two extra commercial channels to country Queensland is a shambles. Six weeks after the alleged start-up date, only a small percentage of viewers can actually receive the extra channels. On 1 January, many viewers did not get more choice; they in fact got less choice. Many viewers can no longer receive their favourite programs, such as 60 Minutes, one-day cricket and the soapies. These programs are just no longer available, even though in many instances the people of provincial Queensland have been able to receive them for years. Viewers right around Queensland received a smart brochure from the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) in which he assured everyone that, with their existing services, the two extra channels would provide an increased choice. The brochure contains a wonderful smiling photograph of Mr Beazley, obviously taken many years ago when he was considerably lighter than he is today. He has got a grin on his face rather like the one he must have had when he was standing outside the office of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) as the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the Prime Minister thumped it out. He certainly was smiling in the picture but the viewers of Wide Bay and many other parts of Queensland have got little to smile about. The fact is that the Government has not delivered on television aggregation. There are three major transmitters in the Wide Bay electorate,-Mount Goonaneman, Black Mountain and Mount Mowbullan. Only one of those transmitters was commissioned on the scheduled start-up date. For most of its testing period, that transmitter was run at something like quarter power; it broke down on occasions; it was not properly focused; and when the power was turned up, the main cable melted. Black Mountain started only a couple of days before Christmas, while Mount Mowbullan was ready for commissioning only a day or so before the actual commencement date for aggregation. So there was absolutely no testing time available for people to buy the necessary UHF aerials, cables and other equipment. Test transmissions finally started in the Christworks. mas-New Year period. As a result, on the 1 January start-up date something like only one to 3 per cent of viewers had the necessary equipment installed. Even now, there are tens of thousands of households throughout regional and provincial Queensland which do not have the capacity to receive UHF television and can expect to wait many more months. In fact, there are many towns and provincial areas which will probably never get UHF signals on the basis of current transmitter patterns. In my electorate alone, the city of Gympie with over 12,000 people, which has hadÂ· VHF television for years, now gets no UHF signal. A city of this size is being denied the called choice promised by the Government. It is not just Gympie that is affected. In my area alone, towns like Rainbow Beach, Tin Can Bay, Murgon, Kilkivari, Cherbourg and Wondai and even parts of Hervey Bay city do not get this extra television choice because the footprints from the various transmitters do not reach their particular area. The small town of Kandanga will get no signals at all. Within a few months time, as all of the channels move to UHF, a town that has had television for between 15 and 20 years will get no signals at all. In other places the country shire councils are having to club together to raise up to $70,000 to provide a local transmitter. The Minister smiles, but the ratepayers are paying. Not only was there an inadequate testing time but also the obvious planning was inadequate. There are many crucial areas that do not get the UHFÂ· signal. I know that the television channels themselves are not completely blameless. Many of them were reluctant to go into aggregation. Who would want to give up the monopoly market, the choice of all the best programs and the advertisers, and face the competition that they have now withÂ· the divided market share, particularly in our current depressed economy? It is difficult for others who are now finding themselves facing a future linked to one of the bankrupt television netThe Government needs to look at this situation closely because aggregation is due to move to other States as the years go by. The smiling picture of the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley), even if he may be a future Prime Minister, is no compensation for a fuzzy television picture.",131
178,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Unemployed: Demands of Certain Employers,132
179,Mr DUNCAN,ADJOURNMENT,"1 want to take the few moments available to me tonight in the House to raise a matter which I think is of the gravest imporso- tance. In the current economic circumstances many people who are unemployed and find themselves unemployed through no fault of their own are being offered jobs, sometimes through the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES), with organisations. Employers offer these people work on condition that they stayÂ· on the dole and accept cash. A number of people have come to my office in recent weeks complaining about the fact that they have been offered jobs in South Australia through the CES in fast food outlets and in lawn-mowing businesses on condition that they are prepared to work for cash and stay on the dole. This is disgraceful behaviour by employers. It is quite reprehensible and ought to be condemned by every honourable member of this House and, for that matter, by the Australian community at large. It is not good enough for people to think they can get away with this sort of behaviour without any sort of problem with the law, and we must be much more vigilant as a community to stop this sort of exploitation. I find it very annoying-in fact, I am extremely angry-that constituents of mine are confronted, through no fault of their own, with this sort of practice and this sort of behaviour. The laws ought to be strengthened much more to ensure that people cannot be exploited in this way. They are not just exploited; these employers are perpetrating a conspiracy against the revenue by engaging in this sort of offer and this sort of tactic with this practice. Not only that: these poor individuals are also put in the position where they are offered employment of this sort which is not covered by Workcare. They are in the position where they are not going to be protected if they are injured. They are offered cash and are told that no tax will be deducted-and, of course, the employers will not be paying tax either. I have run across a number of examples of this sort of behaviour, and I have raised it by contacting the employers concerned. In one particular case, the employer simply said to me that he was only offering part time work and he thought that it was okay to pay cash in those circumstances. The community should not stand for this. When these cases have been brought to my attention I have taken the appropriate steps to bring them to the attention of the appropriate authorities. But in these circumstances it is often very difficult to produce evidence which will stand up in court. I think that we need changes in the law to make sure that legislation is available and will come down very heavily on people who seek to defraud the revenue in this way. As I have said, whilst it may already be illegal in terms of a conspiracy against the revenue and also in clear breach of the taxation laws, it is not good enough that these people believe that they can get away with it simply because the cost of legal proceedings against them will be so high that it will riot be worth the effort of the appropriate authorities. I think that we have to do much more, particularly in the circumstances of recession and in the circumstances of an increasing number of unemployed in the nation, to make sure that the people who are unemployed-in most cases through no fault of their own-are protected against these sorts of dreadful practices which are clearly designed to exploit their labour. We have to be able to do something about this as a community. We ought to send messages to employers who seek to behave in such a reprehensible manner signalling that they will not get away with it, that they will be reported to the appropriate authorities, and let them know that the full strength of the law will be cast against them. if they try to do that. We have to do something of that sort, and I urge the House and the Government to take the appropriate action. Corporate Malpractice: Banking Industry",132
180,Mr MACK,ADJOURNMENT,"A major cause of the malaise affecting this country is to be found in the abandonment of ethical standards by large parts of the corporate sector. We hear just about every second week of some new example of gross incompetence or carelessness leading to collapsing investment values and lost hopes for many innocent people. Much worse are the instances of corporate malpractice and even fraud and theft on a large scale that are coming to light as the fog lifts from the greedy 1980s. This House is now examining, through one of its committees, the activities of the banking sector. It is an investigation which is long overdue. It is alarming to consider that one or more major banks maybe implicated in very serious types of unethical, unlawful and possibly criininal conduct, yet that is the picture that is starting to emerge. It is a tragedy and a betrayal of national trust when a major corporate citizen is implicated in a tax avoidance scam that may have cost the Australian Treasury $200m. It is a disgrace when the same institution may have accumulated large profits through the practice of point taking in foreign exchange dealings. This practice is nothing but the most venal cheating of customers. and so close to outright theft as not to deserve the benefit of any distinction. It is worse when the corporate citizen involved may have been prepared to enrich itself at the expense of its trusting customers through a practice known as deal switching in its foreign exchange operations. It is hard to believe that such a rotten practice is prevalent enough to have had a term coined especially for it-it happens when a bank switches a profitable foreign exchange dealing completed on behalf of a client for an unprofitable dealing which the bank made on its own behalf. What can one say of a bank that urges its small business and farm customers to take out foreign exchange loans and then abandons them to the fate of unfavourable currency shifts and enormous losses, while the bank acts prudently to protect its own foreign exchange exposure? The whole grimy scene is made worse when the response of the legal profession to revelations of such corporate sleaziness is to advise those involved how best they can avoid the consequences, control the damage, cover up and keep the victims at bay with the threat of ruinous legal action. This is anti-social behaviour. This is not what we expect .from our good corporate citizens-the sort of company that runs expensive image advertising on prime time television. The hypocrisy ami double standards, the wide gap between the respectable public face and the murky goings-on under the surface, are close to the heart of our country's present difficulties. It is up to the Parliament of this country to try to lead the country out of this mess. One way of doing this is to expose to the light these practices and those responsible for them. The activities of the Westpac Banking Corporation and its subsidiary, Partnership Pacific Ltd, must be examined by the House and the Government without delay, and the inquiry must be as searching and as public as possible. The banking industry, and particularly banks such as Westpac, spend enormous amounts of money on advertisements emphasising professional management, service to customers, and low risk. As Sir Eric Neale, the outgoing chief of Westpac, said in November 1988, people expect banks to set standards of integrity, trust, behaviour and performance andÂ· to ensure that these standards are met in a highly competitive world. Australia Day Honours-Flooding in North Queensland",133
181,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,ADJOURNMENT,"I am reminded that during the adjournment debate tonight the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) has spoken, and the former member for Wide Bay was recognised by the Crown in the Australia Day honours list. I believe that we should pass on congratulations to the former member for Wide Bay, Mr Millar, and also say that his place has been very well taken by the current member. I am also reminded that two other members were recognised-Lionel Bowen and Roger Shipton-and I think we should place appropriate congratulations on the record here.",134
182,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,I am sure colleagues in the House would share your views about our former colleagues.,134
183,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,ADJOURNMENT,"And you, Mr Deputy Speaker, will give me extra time at the end for making that intervention?",134
184,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,You are alboth ways bargaining.,135
185,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,ADJOURNMENT,"I understand that a previous Speaker, Dr Harry effect Jenkins, was also recognised-and that celled should give me yet another minute. The other reason why I am speaking tonight is to pass my congratulations to some emergency services and also deget partmental services which responded magnificently during the uncharacteristito cally high rainfall that was received throughout north Queensland as a result of Cyclone Joy and the depression that followed it. In order to give honourable members an idea, within the electorate did not see the sun for 10 days and had over two metres of rain. That is a tremennext dous amount of water. In fact, just north of where I live at Proserpine had 35 inches or 875 millimetres in night. It was a tremendous downpour. a result of this rain, of not seeing the sun, and coming after a long period of drought whereby the land was parched, the resultsystem. ing flood probably in some cases did more damage than it did good. I said that I wanted to pass on particuoffice. lar congratulations to people who reof sponded magnificently-and always do. I believe that the state emergency services, real crisis. particularly in Queensland, are underrated. The Director of the service in Mackay, Bill Young, and all of his assistsmall ants give their time voluntarily. On odd occasions, such as when there are tornadoes, volunteers are called for, these people came forward. The police, always, the Telecom Australia employees who kept the networks open and also people such as Barry Tanzer in the Delian partment of Primary Industries and Eneration ergy, were there trying to get the food stocks into cattle on properties that were isolated for quite a long time. It was magnificent effort. One of the services really failed the test. It .was of considerable concern that the Government failed to supply the funds necessary to provide what is requiredof that is, a flood free, all-weather road. Just regard. to give honourable members some idea, over a period of 51 days-the period of the first and second downfall-north Queensland was closed to all land transportation for 25 days. This had a horrific on tourist traffic; people just canout as a result of the pilots strike, high interest ratesÂ· and other depressed elements that affect the tourist industry. The media continually said, 'Don't go on above Rockhampton because you cannot through'. This really put the seal of doom on the whole situation. What I have say reflects mainly on the main road system and on the Commonwealth's failure to recognise that the Bruce Highway is a main arterial road affecting the economy in the north. The flood has had many we effects: cattle have died and properties have been closed off. I suggest that the 12 months will not be a happy time a beach for the tourist industry. The Department of Transport and one Communications and the Minister for As Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) must look very carefully at the curtailment of funding to our main road Funding has been cut by some 40 per cent in real terms over the last seven years that this Government has been in We now find that only 23 per cent fuel tax is returned to roads compared with 65 per cent seven years ago. It is a We also have to understand that graziers,cane farmers and rice farmers in business who have been badly affected must have access to some type of minifunding-not compensation-from the and Queensland Industrial Development Coras poration (Q1DC) through the rural adjustment scheme. I do hope that that is considered. I also suggest to the AustraTaxation Office that careful considis needed about the calling in of payment of all forms of taxation-sales tax, fringe benefits. tax, income tax and a corporate tax. Time has to be allowed to provide for the payment of the various taxes. I believe that it is very important that consideration be given to the payment of taxes, and also to the alteration provisional tax and assistance in that As a result of the devastation that so many have suffered, counselling will be required. I know that many people have collapsed while being asked over the telephone about the local situation. They need assistance. I draw attention to those three requirements: more money for roads, in particular to make the Bruce Highway trafficable; more consideration by the Tax Office; and counselling. It is very important that the QIDC and the Queensland authorities give sympathetic consideration to the requests that will be made of them as a result of the damage caused.

The following answers to questions were circulated: Transport and Communications (Question No. 460) Mr Jull asked the Minister for Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 6 December 1990: (1) Does a contract exist between Qantas and the Sydney media production company Broadcom for the production of in-flight news bulletins and other video material for use on Qantas flights; if so: (a) is the value of the contract $9 million; (b) is $1.1 million allocated within the contract for the production ofÂ· airport video guides covering airport arrival procedures and other general information; (c) is it a fact that while these guides have been produced, they have never been screened on Qantas flights because of their alleged poor quality and; (d) if the guides have not been screened because of their quality, is Qantas seeking a refund; if not, why not. (2) When will tenders next be called for the production of in-flight video news for Qantas. (3) Does Qantas have its own video production facility employing about 15 persons; if so will the facility be considered for the production of the in-flight video news service.",135
186,Mr BEAZLEY,PAPERS,"The answer to the honourable member's question IS as follows: (1) A contract does exist between Qantas and Broadcom Australia Ltd for the production of inflight news bulletins, a monthly magazine program and airport guides. (a) No. The value of the contract is commercial in confidence, but it is considerably less than $9 million. (b) An amount is allocated within that contract for the production of airport guides. The amount is commercial in confidence but it is considerably less than $1.1 million. (c) No. The guides have not all been completed. However, some are currently being screened in-flight. (d) Not applicable. (2) Tenders for the production of Qantas inflight video programs will be called in the early part of 1991. (3) Qantas has an internal video production facility which employs 8 people. This facility ANSWERS TO QUESTIONSÂ· be considered for the production of future inflight video news services. Telecom Australia (Question No. 470)  Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 20 December 1990: Has he received (a) any complaints about or (b) been made aware of any instances, which have not been referred to Austel, where Telecom has used undue pressure to dissuade businesses from using the products or services of Telecom's competitors; if so, (i) how many instances are involved (A) in total and (B) originating from the south-west of Western Australia, (ii) what are the details of each instance and (iii) what action was taken.",137
187,Mr BEAZLEY,PAPERS,"The answer to the honourable member's question IS as follows: No, to the best of my recollection, I have not received (a) any complaints about, or (b) been made aware of, any specific instances of Telecom using undue pressure to dissuade businesses from using the products or services of Telecom's competitors. Polar Bears (Question No. 504) Mr Ferguson asked the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, upon notice, on 21 December 1990: Are polar bear rugs being imported into Australia from Canada by Mr Big Rugs; if so, (a) is approval for importation limited to those pelts harvested in the Northwest Territories; if not, what other Canadian provinces are involved, (b) how many polar bear rugs have been imported, (c) is there pressure on Canada to lift quotas because of the high prices obtained and (d) is the Australian Government satisfied with the placing of the polar bear in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora.",137
188,Mrs KELLY,PAPERS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The name ' Mr Big Rugs' was used in a Fund for Animals publication, referring to the company World Rugs which has imported one polar bear skin from Canada. (a) Under the Wildlife Protection (Regulation will of Exports and Imports) Act 1982 only polar bears taken in accordance with an approved management program in the Northwest Territories of Canada may be imported into Australia. (b) Since the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982 came into effect in 1984 only one polar bear skin has been imported for trade purposes. The importer was the company in question, World Rugs. Six other polar bear skins derived from the management program were imported as personal items during this period; five of these were fully mounted specimens. Four other skins, being personal items obtained prior to the polar bear being listed in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), were also imported. (c) The Canadian CITES Management Authority has offered the following advice: There is no pressure on Canada to increase quotas. The annual quota of bears that may be taken is based on bear populations, reproduction and past cropping over the entire Canadian polar bear range. As Canada is a member of the Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears (which was ratified by 5 signatory nations), Canadian management of the species is closely watched by other member parties to the Agreement. Thus rug prices will not have any effect on annual quotas of polar bears allowed to be taken in Canada. (d) The polar bear has been listed on Appendix II since CITES entered into force. Included in this category are species which might become endangered if trade in them is not controlled and monitored. When member states hold their biennial meetings they review the working of the Convention and discuss changes to the lists of endangered species. Species may be moved from one appendix to another or entered or removed with the agreement of the Conference. The Australian Government supports this approach, and has had no reason to seek the listing of the polar bear on another Appendix. Nursing Homes (Question No. 507) Mr Braithwaite-asked the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services, upon notice, on 21 December 1990: Will the Little Sisters of the Poor and other such Catholic nursing homes which do not sign the Agreement between Proprietor and Residents continue to receive Commonwealth funding. Mr Staples-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Government is hopeful that, with the amendments passed by the Parliament, the Agreement will be acceptable to all proprietors. Signing of the Agreement by both the resident and the proprietor will secure the rights of both parties and enable them to take action to enforce their rights on their own behalf. It remains a condition, of approval (and therefore of funding) of a nursing home that the proprietor offer each resident the' Agreement for signing and that the proprietor comply with the conditions of the Agreement. If proprietors refuse to sign the Agreement there is a range of options which the Government may pursue. The decision to take action against a proprietor who refuses to sign the Agreement would be taken in the overall context of the level of care and accommodation provided by that nursing home. The welfare of the resident is of paramount concern. Mr Geoff Walsh (Question No. 508) Mr Downer asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, upon notice, on 21 January 1991: Has the Minister been endeavouring to ensure that Mr Geoff Walsh, a journalist and political adviser to the Prime Minister, is appointed to the position of First Assistant Secretary, Public Affairs Division, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade; if so, (a) why and (b) is Mr Walsh's experience as a journalist sufficient to qualify him to fill a position which includes the administration of Australia's cultural relations program.",137
189,Dr BLEWETT,PAPERS,"The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: I can confirm that Mr Geoff Walsh has been appointed for a fixed term of three years to the position of First Assistant Secretary, Public Affairs Division, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.
