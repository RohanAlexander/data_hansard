1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. W. Elliot Johnson) .took the chair at eleven a.m., and read prayers. NAVY AND DEFENCE ADMINISTRATION.",21
2,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I know that the Government have not had time yet to-consider the statement made last night by the ex-Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Jensen), but I ask the Acting Prime Minister if there will be a further inquiry into the matters about which he spoke, made by ' a Judge of the Supreme Court, or, preferably, a Justice of the ' High Court. In my opinion, the affair cannot rest aa it stands at present?",21
3,Mr WATT,Unknown,"It has been impossible for the Government to consider the matter since the statement was made, and there is now such a pressure of work that I cannot say when it .will be considered. I shall obtain the Hansard report of Mr Jensen's speech, and shall - give it my earnest consideration. That is all I can promise at this stage. PERSONAL EXPLANATION .",22
4,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"Postmaster-General). - Las t night the honourable member for Bass (Mr Jensen) suggested that some person-hi s remarks pointed to me- - had i placed his name on Mr Jensen's locker, and that that was done during the time that the Government was considering his case, and before the morning of the day when the Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt) made his statement to .this House. I was at Beaufort, on the previous evening, and on my return next morning did not enter the room in which this - thing was said to have been done. The Minister for Recruiting met me, and was with me until Mr Jensen came in, when I spoke to him about some matter having nothing to do _ with the locker. Subsequently he went into the adjoining room, where the locker was. . I had not gone into that room in the meantime, and therefore could not have done what was alleged. I did not know then of the finalization of the matter. Mr J. H. CATTS - I think you have proved an alibi.",22
5,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"I do not wish that there should be any misunderstanding. Any man who suggests that I would bury a person before his demise suggests what is quite wrong, and I resent such a suggestion. The allegation against me has no foundation whatever. SOLDIERS' OVERCOATS. Mr ' HIGGS - I ask the Assistant Minister for Defence if the. Department asks returned soldiers to give back their overcoats, and whether it is a fact that returning ANZACs were soaked with rain for want of overcoats ? Does not the Department consider that it would he a small matter to allow themen to retain their overcoats?",22
6,Mr WISE,Unknown,"The practice of the Department was announced many months ago. There was some trouble in July, and it was then stated that members of the A . I . F . who joined the reserve would be allowed to keep, their overcoats. Other soldiers give them up on receiving their discharge. No complaint has been made to the Department on this subject since July. INFLUENZA EPIDEMIC. QUARANTINING OF "" BOONAH "" "" MEDIC ' S ' ' COMMUNICATION WITH NE W . ZEALAND.",22
7,Mr LISTER,Unknown,"Havin g received a telegram concerning the men on the Boonah, I ask the Minister for Trade and Customs whether his attention has been drawn to the paragraphs in today's metropolitan press, which show that the condition of things on that vessel are most unsatisfactory, and if he has issued, or is he issuing, instructions for-a close investigation to he made concerning the serious allegations that have been published ? Has the Minister a statement to make in regard to the matter ?",22
8,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"I do not'know what are the allegations to which' the honourable member refers. The Boonah on her arrival in Australia had nearly 400 cases of influenza on hoard. The quarantine authorities at once took the matter in hand, and the infected patients were landed at the quarantine station at Fremantle, and effective measures were taken to clean the ship. Next day there were eight cases; the following day five cases; 'then two; and then one; and we anticipate that there will not be any patients today, that having been our experience with every other ship with which - we have dealt. The returning Western Australian soldierswill he landed at the quarantine station tomorrow morning, to complete their period of detention there. The Boonah will probably leave Fremantle on Saturday, which is the earliest day on which we can return to her the members of the crew who have been sick, and who by that time will be well-al l but one or two who must be left behind at Fremantle. She will then proceed to the Eastern States, and the troops on board will complete their period of detention during this voyage. Presumably 'the vessel will be a clean ship when she arrives here, and the men will then be released. I do not know what more the quarantine . authorities could do for the benefit of those on board.",22
9,Sir ROBERTBEST,Unknown,"The other day Tasked the Acting Prime Minister a question about - certain rumours concerning the transport Medic, and he replied that he was unaware of them. T ask ""him if he will have the fullest investigation made - if necessary, by - a civilian Commission, apart from the Defence Department-int o - the following'statements-1. The Medio was warned on approaching New Zealand that pneumonic influenza was raging. 2. That, notwithstanding this, some officers, nurses, soldiers, and other persons did land in Wellington, New Zealand. 3. Some of them contracted the disease and brought .the saane ito the ship, amd the ultimate result is that - forty persons have died. 4. Arrangements made for segregation of infected persons on the voyage - ftaek to Sydney - were crude and inadequate. 5. On arrival at the Quarantine Station, Syd- other. ""We must ney, unreasonable delays occurred in landing infected patients, and for some three days no adequate provision was made for protection of passengers.",23
10,Mr WATT,Unknown,"So m e of the statements to which the honourable member refers are with in the knowledge of the Government; jthat is to say, the statements of what happened to the ship when she came to Australia. As to whether the exact facts regarding her arriva l in New Zealand are known, I cannot say, but I shall see that proper inquiry is made. NA SERVANTS.",23
11,Mr FINLAYSON,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"I desire to know, Mr Speaker, whether you havÂ«*been able to give amy aonsideration to the matter I raised on Wednesday last, namely, the giving of a bonus to the attendants and messengers of the House ?",23
12,Mr SPEAKER,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY," I have previously informed 1 the honourable member that* I have had this matter under consideration for some - time past. ' I remind honourable members that there is no vote under control of the ' Speaker from which any bonus conld be paid, and any such expenditure must necessarily be specially provided for through the Treasurer. I propose, in conjunction with the President of the Senate, when opportunity offers, to make certain suggestions to the Treasurer in this regard. Honourable members know , that the business of the House of late has been. almost continuous, and all of us have been very busy; but the matter is still under consideration. PRICE OF BRAN.",23
13,Mr HECTORLAMOND,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"I desire to ask the Minister for Price-Fixing (Mr . - Greene) what is the reason for the refusal to comply with the request of the South Coast farmers of New South Wales for the abolition.of the fixation of the price of bran'.? - Mr MASSYGREENE - The reason is that if - we allow the price of bran to rise it will affect the price of flour, and, consequently, the price of bread; the prices of all these commodities are contingent on one aneither altogether abandon the policy of price-fixing or adhere to it . The Government do not feel that it can remove the price-fixing of bread at the present time; and, consequently, the price of bran will remain fixed. If the Government were to allow the policy of price-fixing to be lift e d so far as bran is concerned, bran, of course, would become very dear, and it is doubtful whether the farmers would be able to get any more than at present. They are obtaining all that is produced, and no more would be forthcoming as a result of the removal of price-fixing. The only result would be a probable doubling of the price. VEGETABLES AND CLOTHING. REPORTS OF INTER - STA TE COMMISSION.",23
14,Mr JH CATTS,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"Has the Inter-State 'Commission's report on the cost of vegetables, and also their Teport on the cost of clothing, been finalized; ancL if so, will the Minister for Trade and Customs- (Mr Greene) make them available?",23
15,Mr MASSYGREENE,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"A report was handed to me a day or two ago, but owing to the pressure of business, I myself have not had time to read it. As soon as there has been time for myself and the Department to peruse the report, it will he laid on the table of the House in the usual way. DESTURBANCE AT PORT DARWI N. ASSAULT ON ADMINISTRATOR .",24
16,Mr FOWLER,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"Has the Minister for Home and Territories (Mr Glynn) any information to give this House concerning the serious trouble that has occurred at Port Darwin in connection with administration there? Is it correct that the censorship has been applied to newspapers in this connection; and, if so,, what becomes of the pledge of the Government?",24
17,Mr GLYNN,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"There was a somewhat serious disturbance at Port Darwin on Wednesday last. A crowd of 400 OT 500 assembled opposite Government House, chiefly men from Vestey Brothers' works, and passed a resolution requesting the Administrator to address them, and give an account of his administration for the last five years. The resolution also asked the Administrator whether he would be able to go south by a boat leaving that day, pending an inquiry by a Commission into his acts of administration? The resolution was presented to the Administrator, who declined to do what he was asked. The crowd continued outside, and after about an hour, the Administrator, from within the fence, explained his position under the Government, and said that he was acting in accordance with the ordinances passed for the Territory, and pointed out, perfectly correctly, that every request or representation made, and intended to reach the Minister, had been sent south. The Administrator declined to accede to the suggestion made to him - mad e under impulse, of course. He had been assured by the leaders of the crowd that, if he addressed the meeting, no violence would be used. They gave him an absolute guarantee of safety; but, after about twenty minutes, as he was proceeding to his house, there was a cry of "" over the fence."" There was an alien element right in front of the crowd, and it was at the instance of some of the leaders that the cry was raised . Some 1 of the crowd jumped, over, knocked the Administrator down, and proceeded to attack him, and some of his staff.",24
18,Mr JH CATTS,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,Were there coloured aliens?,24
19,Mr GLYNN,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"No ; there is a turbulent element in Darwin, intensified by the presence of a great number of aliens, but all I can tell honourable members about the aliens is that they are men from out' side the British Empire. Every step - should be taken by the Government for the purpose of preventing a repetition of such a disturbance, and maintaining order, by applying the ordinary rules of the administration. As regards the cen-"" sorship, I cannot speak with any specific knowledge, but it is possible some telegrams may have been censored. SUPPLY OF CORNSACKS. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - Can the Minister for Price Fixing (Mr Greene) make a statement to the House in regard to the present season's supply of cornsacks and potato-sacks and other jute goods used by farmers?",24
20,Mr MASSYGREENE,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"The Government have already purchased a very large number of corn and potato sacks. The major part of the shipments have already arrived in Australia, and every possible step is being taken to insure a full supply of jute goods for the current season. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - At a price con- trolled by the Government?",24
21,Mr MASSYGREENE,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,Yes . REPATRIATION . SPECIAL SITTINGS TO CONSIDEB-WA B ^ SERVICE HMS: STAFF APPOINTMENTS AND CONTROL.,24
22,Mr LISTER,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"In view of the extreme urgency of dealing more fully with the great problem of repatriation, demobilization, and the judicious expenditure of public money, will the Acting Prime Minto ister (Mr Watt) give consideration to the desire of members to meet again shortly after the holidays for a specific time, say, a month, to discuss these tions exclusively?",24
23,Mr WATT,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"I should like some better evidence than I have received of the earnest desire of honourable members to meet soon after the holidays. I notice that a similar suggestion was characterisof tically made by the Age today, but-1 not think I could ask honourable members to vote for such a motion now in the sence of the representatives of that journal.",25
24,Mr HIGGS,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"Does the Government propose to abolish the office of Public Service Commissioner; and if not, why is it intended to appoint an officer at salary of Â£1,500 per annum, Who will control the expenditure rof some Â£50,000,000, and whose staff will not subject to the jurisdiction of the CommisI sioner?",25
25,Mr WATT,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"The Government do not propose to abolish the office of Public Service Commissioner. The honourable gentleman probably refers to a Bill which is shortly to be considered in this House, and which was the subject of a message from another place. That will be explained at the proper time. I am not permitted to explain the measure now, the release of Irish internees. but the honourable gentleman will see that he is mistaken as to the provisions of that Bill, in relation to the matter he has re- - - internees? ferred to. WHEAT POOL. FINANCING NEW CROP.",25
26,Mr LYNCH,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"I ask the Acting Prime . Minister whether he is in a position announce the arrangements, if any, which have been made in regard to the financing of the new wheat orop?",25
27,Mr WATT,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"I have been anxious to make a statement for the information wheat-growers and of honourable members who are representatives of wheat-growers, on two phases of the wheat question-th payment of guarantee for the new crop, and the problem of sale, with which dealt before. I am not yet-in a position deal further with the latter phase, but I hope to he able to do so before we rise. I am able to make this statement concerning the payment of wheat guarantees for questhe 1918-19 crop. Recently I discussed this question with the representatives' of the Australian Wheat Board who waited upon me. It was suggested, on .behalf of the Board, that it would be desirable, in view of the short wheat crop in many parts Australia, if the Government could do arrange.the finances to pay the whole of the guarantee in one payment as early as prepracticable in the new year. On behalf of the Government I promised to consider the suggestion and confer with the banks, who assist in the conduct of such operations. There has been-difficulty, involving some delay, in the arrangement of this a matter, and I have not yet received final answers from the principal banks. After carefully reviewing the present circumbe stances and the outlook for the new year, have decided to pay the whole of the guarantee and will take all necessary steps in that direction in the new year. RELEASE OF INTERNEES .",25
28,Mr FINLAYSON,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"I ask the Acting Prime Minister when it is proposed to duly give effect to the decision of the Government, announced yesterday, in regard to Is that decision applicable only .to those gentlemen, or is it proposed t'o extend it to other",25
29,Mr WATT,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"The Crown Law Department co-operates with the Defence Department in matters of this kind. I do not know how far this matter has proceeded, but the wish of the Government with respect to the interned men whose to case was the subject of a recent inquiry, is that, with one exception which I have referred to, their earlyor immediate release should be given. The Minister for Defence has also, with the concurrence of of the Cabinet, arranged for the release of several other internees, mostly men who are Australian born. That procedure is e going on, and I expect that today, or some time this week, a list of another dozen I or so of cases that have been carefully reviewed will be published by the Minister ifor, immediate release. It is the desire of the Government, as soon as it is safe and wise, after careful examination of these special cases, that the release of these men should take place. PERSONAL EXPLANATION . CORRECTION OF PEESS REPOBT.",25
30,Mr LAIRD SMITH,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"I wish to make a personal explanation. When the honourable member for Echuca was on the Estimates with reference to the Government motor cars, I am reported in the press to have interjected, "" Why supply Ministers with tram tickets?"" did not make that interjection. QUARANTINE. USE OF STATION AT ALBANY.",26
31,Dr MALONEY,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"As - one who knows the splendid situation of the quarantine station at Albany, I ask the Acting Mintroops ? ister for Trade and Customs whether, in view of. the terrible experiences Our returned soldiers have to undergo on the transports, as clearly explained in this House, he will give instruction at once take all the unfortunate men off the transmind ports at Premantle, and have them landed at Rottnest Island or sent to the Quarandicate. tine Ground at Albany?",26

33,Mr LAIRD SMITH,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"I ask the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs whether he is in a position to confirm the'rumour that Mr Leitch, the Director of Muniusual tions, is about to resign? - Mr MASSYGREENE - Mr Leitch is now ample Director of the Bureau of Commerce Industry, but he is also carrying on duties of Director of Munitions. He has Chair. been relieved of those duties to a very large extent to enable him to go on with his work in the Bureau of Commerce and In - the Government. dustry. Mr Leitch's appointment was for a period until three months after the war. The Government regret very much that, as the war is over, it will be necessary for Mr Leitch to give - up his position as Director of Commerce and Industry. The position is being considered by the Government in relation to the appointment of his successor. speaking RUMOURED VISIT OF MINISTER TO LONDON.",26
34,Mr TUDOR,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"As this is probably the not last opportunity we shall have before the I , adjournment to ask questions, without notice, ' I ask the Acting Prime Minister whether he is in a position to make any statement in reference to the persistent rumour that it is the intention of the Government to send Senator Pearce, the Minister for Defence, to England, in connection Â°with the demobilization of our",26
35,Mr WATT,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"My honourable friend appears to be much more sanguine than he was yesterday as to the early rising of this to House.

40,Mr BRENNAN,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,I was waiting for an opportunity to say something nice about,26
41,Mr WATT,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"All I can say is that my honourable friend has disguised his thoughts most skilfully, and if , before we rise, he does say something nice about the Government, then, in the language of a great actor-poet, I think members of the Ministry will get what he described as "" artitation of the pulpit."" Mr BOYD,-Are you referring to thepoet in the Governments",27
42,Mr WATT,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"The honourable member for Henty had better net gibe'the Postmaster-General too much, for I can .assure him that the Minister hae so far submitted with a marvellous patience .far beyond the endurance of other Ministers.",27

44,Mr WATT,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"Y o u see, sir, int o what a position disorderly interjections lead an inexperienced man like myself. However, I was about to say that before the House risen I hope to be able 'to make a statement about the matters referred to by the honourable member for Yarra. It will be perfectly definite. I do mot think it will be made today, because I believe we shall not rise today, notwithstanding the excellent new intentions inferentia ly. expressed by the Leader - of the Opposition. CENTRALWHEAT BOATRD. MT . PIGOTT - Has the Acting Prime Minister any information to give the inquiries iHouse on the question of appointing farmers' representatives on the Central Wheat Board ?",27

62,Mr WATT,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"It is almost impossible to answer the question very definitely. I have endeavoured to ascertain from the Prime Minister when he considers-it is only a matter for conjecture-that "" his work will finish in connection with the peace deliberations, but so far I have not been able to get any definite reply. I . cabled again this week. The last calculation the right honourable gentleman gave me, about the middle of November, was that he expected the work would be .finished in from two to two and a half months. I can assure the honourable member that His colleagues are anxious for him to come back, for we have had a pretty hard time of late. M i . HIGGS - Do you want pandemonium? During his absence, we have had almost a perpetual peace and calm.",28
63,Mr WATT,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"No ; I do not want any pandemonium. I have got over all my ambitions in that direction in the twenty-one years of my political life, and, like my honourable friend, am looking down the vale in the hope of enjoying comparative peace for the future.

These recommendations have either been given effect to or are being put in hand. . It will be remembered that it was decided that action in regard to the other recommendations should be postponed until the return of the Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook). The Government recently determined, however, that since he was not likely to return as soon as we had anticipated they should be dealt with in his absence. The House has been sitting so continuously that I have not had an opportunity to finalize the matter, but will deal with it immediately after the Christmas holidays.",28

The appointment of a new naval member is one of the matters that must be dealt with directly after the holidays. NA QUESTION OF DIEECT CONTROL.",29
66,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ASSISTANT MINIST ER EOR THE,"I wish to ask the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt) whether the Government, in carrying out their scheme for the re-organization of the Navy Department, will consider the desirableness of placing the 'Shipping Board and all naval works which are now being attended to by the Acting Minister for  and entire control of that honourable gentleman. The Shipping Board is at present attached to the Prime Minister's Department, where the Assistant Minister for the Navy, who, if I may be allowed to say so, is doing good work, is acting as a deputy Minister, so faT as the control of the Board is concerned, under cumstances which' cannot he satisfactory either to himself or the country?",29
67,Mr WATT,ASSISTANT MINIST ER EOR THE,I do not know whether I entirely apprehend the purport of the honourable member's question. Does he - refer particularly to the mode of operation which the Government have necessarily had to employ since the departure of the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) and the Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook) to London?,29
68,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ASSISTANT MINIST ER EOR THE,And before that.,29
69,Mr WATT,ASSISTANT MINIST ER EOR THE,The honourable member suggests that the Shipping Board should be under the control of the Assistant Minister for the Navy and not attached to the Prime Minister's Department.,29
70,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ASSISTANT MINIST ER EOR THE,Yes .,29
71,Mr WATT,ASSISTANT MINIST ER EOR THE,"My honourable colleague  to assist in the office of the Prime Minister, and also to take charge of the Department of the Navy has absolute freedom in his control of the Department of the Navy within the terms of the Act. As to the Shipping Board, his operations are not limited by any relationship Which he has to the Prime Minister's Department. As locum tenens for the Minister for the Navy he exercises the full functions of that Minister. There is a wider suggestion opened up by the honourable member's question-as to how far the Naval Board should have control as compared with the paramount NAV Y. Minister. Those who have been studying politics for some little time recognise that public feeling and parliamentary feeling are oscillating at the present time with regard'to the question of direct parliamentary responsibility. There is just now a very shrewd and subtle endeavour to remove repatriation from parliamentary and Ministerial control. I do not say that it is widespread in Parliament, or among the general community outside, but an endeavour is being made to erect a. belief which the 'promoters hope to make fashionable that the work of repatriation would be better carried out if entirely free from parliamentary control. I am old enough to disagree with that view. No matter how Parliament criticises its Ministers, its activities, or its organisms, cir- I believe that it is with the Parliament itself that responsibility should rest.",29
72,Mr RODGERS,ASSISTANT MINIST ER EOR THE,"Unfortunately , this House has no control of repatriation.",29
73,Mr WATT,ASSISTANT MINIST ER EOR THE,"The honourable member may desire a different form of statute, but I am discussing the principle involved rather than the particular ordinance under which the Department should be controlled. I hold hard to the doctrine of responsible Government with respect to all our great activities, since, under it , the people's representatives may exercise a direct influence, and award punishment, i l necessary, upon Ministers or Ministries who do not carry out the work of the community as it should be dealt with . Such a system is far better than that of indirect control. CONSIDERATION OF GRIEVANCE S. 4. Yes.",29
74,Mr MATHEWS,ASSISTANT MINIST ER EOR THE,"In view of the limited time tihat we have had during the consideration of the Estimates to place our grievances before Ministers, I desire to ask the Acting Prime Minister whether be he will take upon himself the unpalato table task of reading the Hansard report be of the debate, and see that consideration is given to the criticisms in which ths Opposition indulged during the recent all night sitting ?

How many officers and men of the New Guinea Expeditionary Force were recommended for decoration and promotion in recognition of their service in German New Guinea in the ship early stages of the war? 2. In what instances have those recommendaof tions been approved and the recognition actually granted? 3. In what instances have ' the recommendations been refused, and for what reason? 4. As the majority of the men comprising this special Force suffer at intervals from the effects of malarial fever, and consequently lose five to seven days' work and pay per month, does the Government propose to allow part pension in such cases?  honourable member's questions are as follow:1. One Naval officer was recommended by Government for decoration, and nine Naval officers and three petty officers were recommended for mention in despatches (vide Commonwealth Gazette, No. 44, of 6th April, 1916, page 850). 2. In all instances recommended by the Government. 3. See answer to No. 2. 4. Approval has already been given for such men tQ be placed on Naval pay-sheets, and to receive medical attention when unable to work owing to malaria, and this method of dealing with these cases seems satisfactory.

CATT S (for Mr BLAKELEY) asked the Assistant Minister for Defence, future? upon noticeWill the Minister supply a return showing' the names and rank, and terms of sentence, low:together with reasons for such sentences, of all members of the Australian Imperial Force who have been dealt with for military offences? Mr Wise . ^ The honourable member's question covers every offence committed by a member of the Australian Imperial the Force at any period of his service, and made. whether punished by court martial or by his Commanding Officer. The work in volved in compiling this return would, therefore, be enormous, and it is not considered that the cost of compiling it , and the employment of the necessary clerical labour are warranted in order to make the information available. Furthermore, the Minister is of the opinion that it would be manifestly unjust to place on record the name of every man who has committed an offence, together with the statement of the offence and the punishment awarded, and to make this information public. The men who have committed offences have been punished, and have, therefore, expiated them, and it is thought no further publicity should be given to their cases. EXPORT OF LEATHER . . Mr LISTER asked the Acting Prime Minister upon notice I. Is it a fact that since the embargo was on leather in February, 1917, the tanners of New South Wales have been given preference in regard to quantities of leather Henshipped, and that in one vessel alone, ont of 2,000 bales of leather, New South Wales secured no less than 1,700, the balance of 300 being disa tributed amongst the remaining States? 2. Is it a fact that since the promise made by the Government in October of this year to grant the from then on space equal to that allotted to hides, well over 60,000 hides, approximating 1,40,0 tons, have been sent overseas, whilst space for the shipment of only 700 tons of leather has been made available? 3. Is it a fact that such action is detrimental to Australia's manufacturing interests, and that in Geelong alone certain tanneries have had to in reduce their intake by 70 per cent., thereby throwing a considerable number of men out of 4. If'so, will the Acting Prime Minister take the action necessary to materially assist in the development of this industry By allotting' considerably more space for the manufactured article in vessels leaving Australia in the near",31
81,Mr WATT,BEPAIRS BEING CARRIED OUT ON,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as' fol1.

The Government did not make such a promise. It intimated early in October that advice had been received from the Prime Minister that the War Office had agreed equally between leather and hides. This was not officially confirmed until the end of October. 3 and 4. I am not aware of the actual position in Geelong or of other tanneries, but I da know this, that the correspondence in connection with this'matter will show that this Government has done everything possible the industry. The representations to the Im1 perial Government direct, and through the Prime Minister were of a most persistent acter, and it was only as a result of that the promise was made to allot space for leather. The Government will continue to do everything in its power to assist all the tries of Australia. I may add, however, that space on vessels leaving Australia at present is allotted strictly in accordance with tions received from the Imperial Government under whose control vessels are still running.

Is it a fact that a great deal of discontent exists amongst the lower-grade officers of the Postmaster-General's Department? 2. Is the disoontent caused by .the system of promotion to positions by the placing of junior officers indiscriminately over the heads of the senior officers? 3.

In each case the' rate of .freight has been very high. The Board is of opinion that its first consideration should be for the wheat grower, and not for the ship-owner or merchant; and it has .been, and is 'Still, endeavouring to arrange freight diiect, and .deal direct with Egypt, so that after payment of a reasonable freight' the wheat-grower may get the full 'proceeds.

The jposition .was laid fully before the Australian Wheat Board at its conference this week, and it was agreed, with the concurrence of the wheat-grower's representative, .that .the proper course had been follo.wed in declining to .give .a quotation.

102,Mr TUDOR,BILL,Y a r r a ) [11.58] - I am not sure whether we are allowed an hour' to protest on this or on a subsequent motion.,36
103,Mr WATT,BILL,The declaration of urgency cannot be discussed today.,36
104,Mr TUDOR,BILL,"I understand that we take up this matter at. the stage that was reached yesterday, the Acting Prime Minister desired, to withdraw the motion. We are to be allowed three-and-a-half - hours from this moment, on the Estimates. There are two or three Departments that would certainly require more time than that for anything like a discussion on them.' I consider the most important to be the Defence Department, where many matters require, discussion; the Repatriation Department; and the Postmaster-General's Department, There is also the question of the administration of the Northern Territory in the Department of Home and Territories. The statement made by the Minister (Mr Glynn) this morning, in . reply to the honourable member for Perth (Mr Fowler) is most alarming. I had not the remotest idea that anything of that sort was going on. It is news to us that the Administrator up there practically stands within his own fence, and the men, so to speak, go "" over the top "" and, according to the Minister's statement, deal with him and some of his staff with physical force. I am opposed to the guillotine, but if it is to be applied, while I would like to have something to say in regard to old-age pensions and other matters, I shall. be obliged to let them pass on this occasion in order to devote the time at my disposal to matters which I deem of more importance. They are insignificant matters in comparison with certain aspects of our defence and postal' administration, and also in comparison with the position of affairs in the Northern Territory, and with that other matter, 'the Commonwealth Police, referred to by the honourable member for Henty (Mr Boyd). Honourable members should certainly be given the opportunity to come to a decision upon the question of the necessity for the continuance of the Commonwealth Police.",36
105,Mr BOYD,BILL,"Henty ) [ 1 2 . 2 ] - I am anxious to get an opportunity to move that the Commonwealth Police be disbanded, but I can see that there will be little chance of doing so, because the few hours that the Treasurer proposes, to allow for the discussion of the Estimates will be occupied in debating the votes proposed for the first two or three departments which appear in the Estimates. when Mr Watt - I wonder whether the honourable member would pay any regard to an undertaking if I give it to him ?",36
106,Mr BOYD,BILL,"Yes , I would do BO.",36
107,Mr WATT,BILL,Some honourable members in the Ministerial corner do not do so.,36
108,Mr BOYD,BILL,"The time has arrived when we should avoid the duplication of our police forces in Australia, and if the Treasurer wishes to cut down expenditure he can do so by disbanding the Commonwealth Police Force, which was established without justification and to whose continuance the people are opposed.",36
109,Mr MCWILLIAMS,BILL,"Franklin) [12.4]. - I contradict most flatly the statement that the time taken up yesterday morning was wasted. Never before, since I have been in Parliament, has so much information .been given to honourable members as was given by Ministers at that particular time. During the whole of the session I have been submitting questions with reference to shipping and sniping arrangements, and I have failed to elicit from Ministers the information that I desired to obtain, but that which Ministers furnished yesterday morning quite freely and openly will remove many of the doubts expressed in my electorate. I resent very strongly' the idea that yesterday morning was wasted.",36
110,Mr WATT,BILL,Who has said that it was wasted 1,36
111,Mr MCWILLIAMS,BILL,"On e of the M i nisters said that the guillotine was about to be applied because time had been wasted. It is only when dealing with the Estimates that we can obtain from Ministers the information we are desirous of eliciting from them. I have made some notes in regard to the sugar question which it has taken me three weeks to prepare. This question means success or failure to thousands of small fruit-growers in Victoria and Tasmania who have been encouraged by their State Governments to take up the industry of f r u it growing, and have put everything they have in the world into their orchards. Owing to the arrangement made in connection with sugar, they can see nothing ahead of them but financial loss and the wiping out'of years of industry. It will be impossible for me to put before the House the history of this matter, which I have compiled from the very inception of the arrangement. One of my reasons for protesting against dealing with the Estimates in the'manner proposed is the fact that honourable members are prevented from bringing before the House and the Government matters which vitally affect thousands of people in the, community who are deserving of every consideration, and have had a very bad time during the last two years. This is one reason why I shall vote against the limitation of debate upon the - Estimates. It would be better for the Government to take Supply now, and call the House together early in the new year so that the Estimates may be thoroughly considered. No honourable member surrenders more time to his parliamentary duties than do those representatives of Tasmania and Queensland, and Western Australian constituencies, who live in Victoria during the whole of a parliamentary session, yet I would rather come back early in the yea ,to deal with these matters than allow them to be passed without the consideration they deserve.",36
112,Mr MATHEWS,BILL,"Melbourne Ports} claim [12.7] - I believe in the principle the majority must rule, ahd I voted the adoption of the motion for the limifinancial tation of speeches. I would do so again if I thought'that debates in this chamber were unnecessarily prolonged; neverthea less the - Government must admit that, during the discussion of the Estimates, honourable members place before many matters of considerable importance. Private members as well as Ministers have their troubles. Whether an honourable member is sitting on the Government side, or on the Opposition side, he is often demned for something the Government Estimates. have done oa the ground that he has taken no step to prevent it . The public outside seem to think that we can make the Yarra flow up hill. Ministers know from past experience that private membody bers do not bring matters forward for the sake of f u n . They frequently do, it because they are. exhorted from outside to do so - The people demand it . The only opportunity for dealing with any matter exhaustively is when the Estimates are being discussed. Rightly or wrongly, I have interested myself in the question of the administration"" of the Northern Territory. To-day there is a crisis at Darwin, which I warned the Minister some time ago would take place, and which I would like to deal with today, because men in the Northern Territory have asked me to do so; but I can see no special opportunity of acceding to their request. When I asked the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt) whether Ministers would peruse the grievances of honourable members, as reported in Hansard, he treated my question as a joke, but it was not a subject for joking. Honourable members have brought forward many matters affecting the Departments, and their remarks should be perused by the Ministers concerned. It should be the duty of officers in the De. partments to. read the statements of honourable members as recorded in Hansard, and submit the principal points dealt with to their respective Ministers.",37
113,Mr WATT,BILL,I shall see that that is done.,37
114,Mr SAMPSON,BILL,"Wimmera) [12.9] - ' It is the duty of the Government who the right to control the business of that the House to give honourable members a for reasonable opportunity to discuss the commitments for the twelve months. No one with the widest stretch of imagination could say that the one and half ,days already spent, and the two or three hours, yet remaining, is adequate time for disposing of the ordinary expenthem diture for the whole year.",37
115,Mr WATT,BILL,"It is not the ordinary expenditure for the whole financial year.' We have already passed the Works Estimates, and we have voted more than six conmonths' Supply in connection with general",37
116,Mr SAMPSON,BILL,"I merely rose to protest against thehurrying through of these important 'financial commitments after less than two days' discussion. 'Now ill pretend that a debate during an all-night sitting can do anything like justice to the Estimates. Yet we are now told that they must be passed, practically without consideration, notwithstanding that they involve questions of the highest importance. There is, for example, the maternity bonus, which involves a very large annual expenditure, which most eeftainly ought to be revised. In many other directions-there are important items upon these Estimates which require to he made the subject of revision and reduction.",37
117,Mr LECKIE,BILL,"Indi) [12.13] - I do not like the operation of the guillotine as proposed by the Government. Nobody can accuse me of having occupied much time in the consideration of the Estimates, but I did intend to make some observations upon particular Departments. I , therefore, deliberately refrained from debating the general question, in order that I might be able to devote my attention to specific items. But apparently the whole of the time which is to be allocated to the consideration of the Estimates is now to he absorbed in a discussion of the first division of the Prime Minister's Department. If this sort of conduct is to be pursued, I shall, in future, avail myself of my full rights in connection with the general debate of the Budget statement. Of course, I realise the difficult position in which the Acting Prime Minister has been placed. I recognise that the interposition of extraneous matter has prevented him setting apart for the consideration of the Estimates the time that would otherwise have been, devoted to them. I should like to know whether he will consent to guillotine the Estimates in sections. The adoption of that course, objectionable though it is, would at least afford ns an opportunity of discussing some matters of urgent public â importance.",38
118,Mr WATT,BILL,The suggestion is impracticable at this stage of the session. There are eleven Departments to he dealt with.,38
119,Mr LECKIE,BILL,"Eve n if we were allowed half-an-hour to debate matters connected with each Department, it would be better than nothing. I desire an opportunity of discharging my duty to my constituents.  did not talk so much we would get on with the consideration of the Estimates. Mr LECKIE.'-In the circumstances, I enter my protest against the action of the Government in depriving me of an opportunity to discuss certain matters in the interests of my constituents and of the country. Mr J. H. CATTS (Cook) [12.17] - There is one question which I regard as urgent from .the stand-point of the consumers, namely, the unjustifiable increases that' have been sanctioned by the Government in respect of butler-increase s which represent practically Â£2,000,000 a year. I specially came over from Sydney to deal with this matter, but owing to the action of the Government, the entire discussion of the Estimates will take place upon the first one or two items. The remaining items will he ""gagged"" through the House. Earlier in the session the Acting Prime Minister assured us that we should 'be given full opportunity to exhaustively discuss these Estimates. That pledge, however, is not to be fulfilled: The Estimates contain approximately 2,000 items, and their exhaustive consideration within a total period of two days is an utter impossibility. Of course, I recognise the great advantages which will he derived by the Government from "" bullocking"" these Estimates through the House. The adoption of that course will obviate the necessity for Ministers obtaining Supply for six months. It will mean that they will be able tp go into recess, and to administer the affairs of this country under the War Precautions Act.",38
120,Mr HEOTOB LAMOSTD,BILL,"I pointed that out to the honourable member earlier. I told him that the consideration of the Estimates provided our only chance of exercising a restraining influence on the Government. Mr JH CATTS,- I do not remember the honourable member's statement, but apparently, although he realizes the evils of the situation, he is unwilling to take steps to prevent them. He is like a good many more on the opposite side of the chamber. He is prepared tb do all.sorts of things until it' comes to a question of voting, and then he desires, to back-pedal out of his difficulty. I do not believe that Government will meet the House early next year. Certainly,. I do not expect Parliament, to be .called together ibefoTe May, and probably not before June, that year.",38
121,Mr WATT,BILL,Why ?,39

123,Mr WATT,BILL,I have heard that statement made in respect of every Government that has been formed. The momentcurred a Government is born it begins to die.,39
124,Mr JH CATTS,BILL,That is quite trae; but the actions of the Government are hastening that decay at an unprecedentYet edly rapid rate.,39
125,Mr WATT,BILL,I have heard that said of should - every Government.,39
126,Mr JH CATTS,BILL,"The Government's candidates have .been low at the poll the successive elections for Swan and Corangamite, and it is quite evident that the people desire an opportunity to pudiate the party at present in power. Yet at this time the Government choose to close Parliament and gag the House in order to prevent the legitimate sion of the various activities undeT the War Precautions Act.",39
127,Mr WATT,BILL,What does the honourable member wish us to do?,39
128,Mr JH CATTS,BILL,"As it is quite evident that there is not sufficient time available to finish the business on the notice-paper, including the Estimates, the only course open to us is to re-assemble early in the new year ",39
129,Mr WATT,BILL,The alternative is to tinue sitting through the holidays. the honourable member move an amendthrowing ment that we shall go right on?,39
130,Mr JH CATTS,BILL,"If I am entitled to move such an amendment to this to motion, I shall do so.",39
131,Mr WATT,BILL,"The honourable member the can move an amendment on the Estimates, and that will be an instruction to the Government that the House shall sit right on. I shall .be interested to - see how of many honourable members vote for the amendment.",39
132,Mr JH CATTS,BILL,"I shall accept that suggestion, and test the feeling of the House by moving, later, to reduce the up Estimates by the sum of Â£1 in order to all indicate to the Government that it is the desire of honourable members to sit day after day for a reasonable numbeT Theof hours, so that the business on the notice-paper may be legitimately dealt with.",39
133,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,BILL,"Illawarra) [12.23] - The fact seems to have just octo the honourable member for Cook (Mr J. H . Catts) that when the Estimates are passed parliamentary control over the Government practically ceases. honourable members opposite have professed a desire that the Estimates be passed early in the financial year. To me, the discussion of the Estimates is the most interesting in Parliament. A month ago I thought that the at whole future of the country depended on our being able to discuss the Estimates, but when we get the chance to de that, rehalf of the honourable members of this Chamber go home, and some only attend because the price of butter has been raised. The rest of the Estimates do not discus- - trouble them very much*.",39
134,Mr JH CATTS,BILL,The tÂ»eatment of returned soldiers and the question of demobilization ought to be thoroughly discussed.,39
135,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,BILL,"And they would be thoroughly discussed if we were permitted to proceed .with the Bills relating to those questions, instead of having a long discussion on the Bolsheviks in Russia, and upon the important quescontion of whether Â£6,000 could be saved Will by sacking a number of policemen and them upon the employment market. If there are big questions to be discussed on the Estimates, I should like hear something of them, Ib-ut, after having sat for about twenty hours listening to the discussion, I heard only one subject that seemed of importance. That was the issue raised by the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs), and even that was found, on inquiry, to have no justification. All talk to the effect that the country will get great value if we are allowed to discuss the Estimates for a fortnight is only pretence. I should be on. glad if the Acting Prime Minister would adopt the House of Commons' system, by which a certain amount of time is allotted for each section of the Estimates. In my judgment, Supply Bills are a much better system of controlling thefinancesthan the passing of the Estimates in globo. I am further of opinion that the whole machinery of Parliament needs overhauling in order to reduce the enormous weight that is being placed on parliamentary and governmental institutions at the present time.",39
136,Mr MATHEWS,BILL,"I used to be of the same opinion as the honourable member, but now I am convinced that the present system cannot be improved upon.",40
137,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,BILL,"That is a matter of opinion. When we reflect that this Parliament, which was expected to be conducted on a contribution of 2s. 6d. per head of the population, is now doing work that was never contemplated by the founders of the Constitution, and that roaded every day sees increased duties placed upon us, we have to realise that the chinery of Parliament need's a careful overhaul in order that the enormous amount of our business may be conducted with greater efficiency. That we should. quiry, spend two or three months in discussing Estimates, not one item of which will be altered, does not appeal to me as mon-sense proposition.",40

140,Mr WISE,BILL,The honourable member f o i Cook suggested that we should sit right,40
141,Mr FINLAYSON,BILL,"I understood the suggestion to be that we should adjourn over the Christmas holidays and reassemble early in the new year. Every honourable member desires to say something about a number of items in the Estimates, in which we are individually and collectively interested. In addition to the matters already mentioned there i's the Northern Territory Administration. The condition of affairs disclosed by the Minister this morning, and by our own knowledge and experience of events in the Territory in recent times, indicates that a decidedly searching debate on that Department alone is necessary. We are inundated with complaints in regard to the Postmaster-General's Department, but the result of the guillotine motion may be that the whole of the remaining time will be devoted to the Treasurer's Estimates, whilq the other Departments will be railthrough in a few moments. Even the Government must admit that that will not be fair to members or to the country. maThe Defence Department, and to some extent the Department of the Navy, are subjects, not so much for captious criticism, as for honest investigation and in",40

152,Mr FINLAYSON,BILL,"The worse I have known in regard to the passage of the present Estimates is where there have been debates on the first' item, and then, as discussion has worn out, remaining items have been simply pushed through in a lump. There was never any limitation of the time of debate, however. The GoBut vernment should consider honourable of members from the different States. Let us carry out the arrangements agreed upon. Already, quite a number of memposition bers have departed for their distant homes on the distinct understanding that the sittings were to close this afternoon.

I will use every opportunity which may fairly present itself to prevent the Government from going into recess until May or June next. I would be quite prepared to assist the Government in Gosecuring two orthree months' Supply, without debate. It is idle for the Government to suggest that Parliament of should work right through the holidays. not Honourable members would not consent to maintain a House. But. there are many things which urgently require consideration, owing to these extraordinary times. The honourable member for Illawarra (Mr Hector Lamond) reflected upon a members by saying that there needs to be an overhaul in regard to our parliamenmethods; hut I agree with him. If . a the Government, in presenting important Bills, would consent to their being referred to Committees, so that evidence early might be taken upon the subjects inthose measures would pass in a . much more satisfactory to the people and the industries concerned than the system which has ruled during the past three or four years. The present position is unique. We have been working under war conditions for the past years. Now, the war is over, and OUT warriors are returning, we must urgently and fully consider repatriation proposals. I have great faith in Senator Millen ahd his work; but is any honourable member satisfied with the situation concerning relong patriation, and with the proposals the for dealing with our men upon their homecoming? I do not know the nature of the new suggestions of the Government, other than in regard to the housing proposition. it would be far wiser, in the interests the country and of our soldiers, if Parliament were to adjourn until about the middle of March. The Leader of the Opmight be asked to acquiesce in granting three months' Supply. Then, in March next, Parliament could deal with the serious problems of repatriation.",41

170,Mr HIGGS,BILL,"On a point of order, sir, I submit that we did not pass the Estimates for the Prime Minister's Department last evening. My recollection is that immediately after the taking of the division on the amendment moved by the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Sampson) you vacated the Chair for the dinner adjournment.",44
171,The CHAIRMAN,BILL," The honourable member is entirely in error. As soon as the division to which he refers had been taken, as honourable members remained in their places, - 29 I immediately put the question that the Estimates of the Department of the Prime Minister be agreed to, and declared it 14 carried. AYESMr TUDOR (Yarra) [2.32] - There are three items in the Estimates relating to the Treasury on which I desire some information from the Treasurer (Mr. Watt). On page 39 there is an item of Â£535 in respect of an Assistant Commissioner for Invalid and Old Age Pensions. That appears to be a new office. I notice also that on page 41 provision is made for 172 officers in the Old Age Pensions Branch, as against 133 employed in Tetters: 1917-18. I presume that increase of staff is due chiefly to the increase in the numNOES. ber of war pensions now payable; but I should like to have the matter cleared up. On page 52 there is an item relating to the entertainments tax tickets. The honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr. Fenton) has raised a question as to whether or no the Department supplies, free of charge-apar t from the payment of the tax itself-roll s of tickets to conductors of entertainments. If it does, such a practice must make considerable inroads into the revenue obtained from the tax. Honourable members know that I am opposed to the tax; but I do not think we should reduce in this way the revenue obtainable from it. Coming to the provision made for the Government Printer, we find that Â£4,500 is set apart for wages and overtime of compositors, and the same amount in respect of proportion of salaries of the Statb classified staff of the Government Printing Office, Melbourne' The total amount appropriated in respect of the Government Printer in 1917-18 was Â£12,822, and the actual expenditure was Â£12,839. A Department that can .keep . its expenditure within Â£17 of the amount actually appropriated is a marvellously accurate one. Having regard to the uncertainty that must prevail as to the overtime which the Government Printing Office will be required to work in connection with the sittings of Parliament, remarkable skill must have been displayed in framing the Estimate of Expediture for 1917-18. It is quite possible, as has been alleged at different times, that since our work is carried out in the State Printing Office we have, to pay for what the State does not. We could, not have a better man for the position of Government Printer than Mr Albert Mullett, who was a personal friend of mine long before he thought of holding that office, or I thought of being returned to this Parliament. the Government some years ago to establish a Federal Government Printing Office, and to place him in charge of it. I am convinced that if my suggestion had been adopted large savings in our printing bill would have been effected. I hope the Treasurer will be able to give me some information on these points. . Mr Watt - I shall be glad to do so a little later on.",44
172,Mr HIGGS,BILL,"Capricornia) [2.37] - It will be remembered that yesterday the  ton), when replying to my contention that we did not require an intelligence officer it a salary of Â£504 per annum, said that such an officer was employed while I was Treasurer. I denied that statement at the time in a rather blunt way, and you, Mr Chairman, called me to order. I have since examined the Estimates, and if honourable members do so they will find that no money' was appropriated for such a purpose when I'was at the Treasury. The item appears for the first time in the Estimates for 1917-18.  nexion with the Treasury Estimates I have been considering how far we might properly go in bringing about an amalgamation of various Commonwealth and State Departments and activities. I find that there are quite a number of State and Federal Departments which could be amalgamated and carried on either by the State or the Commonwealth, and, personally, I think they should be conducted by the Commonwealth Government. In the first place, the Commonwealth Electoral Department costs Â£53,700 per annum, while the Electoral Departments of the States cost Â£86,275. It will be generally conceded that these Departments could be amalgamated and controlled hy the Commonwealth Government with advantage to the States and the Union as a whole. Such an amalgamation has already been carried out. so far as the Commonwealth and Tasmanian ^Governments are concerned, and a"" considerable amount has been refunded by the State Government for work done by the Commonwealth. . A general amalgaI urged mation of the kind would lead to great saving. In passing, I may say that I am not here to indulge in destructive criticism; my desire is to put forward some constructive criticism that will tend to the ' benefit of the country. The Commonwealth Statistician's Department costs Â£15,013, while the State Statisticians' Departments cost Â£32,117. Much of the information given in the State YearBooks is supplied in the Commonwealth Year-book.",45
173,Mr MCWILLIAMS,BILL,"i About' three-fourths of the information is duplicated.  saving could be effected in that direction. Another item in respect of which amalgamation would he attended with satisfactory results is that of immigration. There is nothing on the Estimates in respect of that item, although in former years we have incurred expenditure in connection with it ; but the expenditure of the States amounts to Â£38,602. There is no reason why we should not have a Commonwealth immigration Department in London, where information might be obtained on application as to the opportunities offering for settlement in all the States. If an intending immigrant de1 sired to settle in New South Wales, he could go to such an office and secure the fullest information. The one central office would be far better than the present system, under which each State has its own agency, the one competing with the other, and all largely covering the same ground. The State Agents-GeneTal cost Â£40,307, while the High Commissioner's Office costs'Â£48,841. There is no reason why the High Commissioner should not act on behalf of all the States. The cost of our State Governors and the up-keep of their Departments is Â£42,489 per annum, and the. maintenance of the Governor General's Department Â£26,875. The Chief Justices of the several States, as Lieutenant-Governors, could do all that is now required of the State Governors, and we could continue to have a Governor General for the Commonwealth. Coming to the question of taxation, it seems to me that even the Indians would adopt a method rational than that pursued <by the Commonwealth and States. Here we have seven distinct Departments engaged in the collection of taxation, a work could be most effectively carried out by one Commonwealth Department. far as I have been able to Â£128,705 per annum is spent by the States on their Taxation Departments, the Commonwealth Department Â£273,067 per annum. An enormous could be effected by the amalgamation the State and Eederal Taxation The Commonwealth is expending per annum, and the States are expending Â£368,495 per annum in respect, of these several instrumentalities of making a total of Â£785,991. I am confident that by a judicious amalgamation of these State and Federal at least Â£250,000 per annum could be saved. In my opinion, a commission of clever accountants could effect a saving of at least Â£250,000 onthese figures. The uppermost thought in theminds of the taxpayers generally is that we should do something in this direction. At least, we ought to co-ordinate taxation spoke of this matter recently to Mr Hoi man, Premier of New South Wales, when travelling with him in a railway t r a in , and he said that I was r i g ht in the contention that I have just advanced, and that something should be done in this direction. I venture to say that every' legislator in Australia would agree t h at something should be done to bring about this reform . I know that our Treasurer (Mr W at t ) is as anxious as any one to bring it about. In fact, he has put the necessary legislation through this Parliament, but it has not been favourably accepted by State Houses, or has not yet been submitted to them for consideration. costs I hope our Treasurer wil l submit the matter to a referendum at the next general* election. I do not think there would be half-a-dozen votes in opposition to a proposal to have one taxing Department for the Commonwealth. It is a scandal that we should have seven taxing Departments working in antagonism to one another, and causing great dissatisfaction to the taxChoctaw payers. Notwithstanding the view that Mr Holman expressed to me personally, more I heard him subsequently make a statement at a public meeting that the Commonwealth Treasurer's proposal was i mpracticable, because, while the Commonwhich wealth collected the income tax upon the distribution of earnings to the various So units in the Commonwealth, State Goascertain, vernments collected their tax upon those earnings at their source, and confusion while would result if , when taxpayers sent their costs returns in , one office had the task of dealsaving ing with those two. methods of collecting of the tax - It seems to me that there offices. should be-no confusion. It should be an Â£417,496 easy matter for the Commissioner of Taxation to discriminate, and say, "" This man pays a tax under the Commonwealth government, system. Very well; we shall tax h im upon the distribution of a dividend. The other man is paying State taxation under the State method. Very well, we shall Departments tax the source of his dividends."" .",45
174,Mr WATT,BILL,"There is no trouble in doing that.  taxation is a great annoyance to ,the taxpayers. Many uneducated'people who do not keep accounts are obliged to forward work. I returns to the Taxation Department, although they may not be liable to pay the tax. Many farmers are obliged to pay fees to agents to prepare the necessary forms for them. Many of them pay a great deal more to have their forms made out than they pay in actual taxation. I was recently speaking to an ex-member of this Parliament, who has interests in every State, and is obliged to send in every year seven different income tax returns. It is necessary for him to pay a man Â£400 a year simply to look after that one section of his various undertakings. There are so many Taxation Acts in the different States, and there are so many amending Bills passed each year, that it is almost impossible for a man who draws an income in each State to know where he stands. I am sure it would be i of great advantage to the people generally if they were called upon to furnish one taxation return only. I was very pleased to hear the Treasurer, during the course of his Budget speech, refer to the consolidation of State and Commonwealth debts. This is a matter we shall need to look into in the near future. A big saving can be effected if the Treasurer's proposals are carried into effect. State loans to be renewed during the next ten years amount to Â£200,000,000. The Commonwealth will be called upon to renew loans in the same period to the extent of Â£190,000,000. Mr Collins, Secretary to the Treasury, has informed me that local governing bodies in the Commonwealth borrow Â£5,000,000 annually. Their borrowings for the next ten years will thus amount to Â£50.000.000. In all, loans amounting to Â£440,000,000 will have to be renewed In Australia during the next ten years. If we can make a saving of 1 per cent, in interest on all these renewals we shall Bffect a total saving of Â£4,400,000 per annum. Another saving may be effected in the matter of flotation charges. London we pay 25s. per Â£ 1 0 0 for underwriting, 5s. for brokerage, 5s. for bank commission, 12s. 6d. for composition duty, and 5s. for advertising. The total charges amount to Â£ 2 12s. 6d. per Â£ 1 0 0 . It seems to me extraordinary that we should be obliged to pay 25s. per Â£ 1 0 0 for underwriting when we have the Commonwealth Bank , and the High Commissioner in London. Of course, I understand that Sir - Robert Nivison controls underwriting matters in London. Mr Watt . ; - I spent three months in London five years ago looking into that matter, and I could not succeed in cutting out the underwriter. It is very easy to talk about doing it , but it is very hard to do it .  some means of avoiding the underwriting charge and these other flotation expenses I have mentioned we ought to be able to effect a saving of Â£10,237,500 per annum when we come to renew the whole of the 'Â£390,000,000 which represents the amount of State and Commonwealth loans falling due within the next ten years. It must be borne in mind that before one penny of this money will reach Australia, charges will absorb Â£10,237,500.",46
175,Mr HIGGS,BILL,"What about borrowing . locally ?  well and good; but these loans must be redeemed. The Treasurer would be very clever if he can succeed in borrowing Â£390,000,000 locally during the next ten years. I am not opposed to the payment of the maternity allowance, but I am opposed to paying it to people who can afford to .ride about in motor cars. The allowance is by no means sufficient to help many poor women in their time of trouble, who may have to incur medical and other expenses amounting, perhaps, to Â£10 or Â£15. I think that in certain cases we should pay the whole of the expenses a. woman incurs at such times; but, at the same time, we should cease paving any allowance to wealthy mothers who are in no need of assistance from the. State.",47
176,Mr WATT,BILL,"Balaclava-Actin g Prime Minister and Treasurer) [2.59] - The In Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) and the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) have asked for in formation in regard to several matters. The first js in relation to the position 'of the Assistant Commissioner of Invalid and Old-age Pensions. The Commissioner of Invalid and Old-age Pensions is the Secretary to the Treasury. He was drawing no remuneration for his administration of pensions, but, in consequence of the great stress of war work imposed upon Treasury officers, it was plain to me that the two senior officers should be freed to a great extent from routine work in order that the questions of taxation, loan raising, and spending should receive more deliberate attention, which the rush of work upon those officers had made impossible. I therefore assented to the proposition that a 'man to take charge of this work'as Assistant Commissioner, and do all the routine work under the direction of and responsible to the Commissioner, should be appointed. The officer selected at that time was in the Queensland office of the Department, and, speaking from memory, he has been promoted from the second class. to the first class in order to give him status to do the WOTIC",47
177,Mr BAYLEY,BILL,"He is a good man,",48
178,Mr WATT,BILL,"I believe he is. As to the increase of officers and salaries in Old-Age Pensions Office, the steady exditure. pansion of the work is accountable for that. The number of pension cases with in 1915-16 was 115,000; in 1916-17, 120,000; in 1917-18, 125,000; the 3rd November, in the current financial year, 126,000. That increased business accounts for certain additions to staff, whilst the statutory increments which officers become entitled year year explains, to some extent, the greater amount provided on the Estimates for salaries. As to the entertainments tax tickets, the ^ Taxation Branch informs me that the Attorney-General's Department ruled that it was necessary to supply showmen with tickets, and that we could not charge promates. moters of entertainments with the cost. Reference was made by the Leader the Opposition and the honourable member (for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) to fact that the amount provided on the mates for the Government Printing Office is exactly the same as the amount exall pended last year; I am entirely respontypes sible for that. In the chopping Estimates there were requests from Government Printer for increases, but told the Department that its expenditure must be kept down to last year's amount. The Treasurer has to do arbitrary things of that kind , and an instruction was 1 issued to the Departments that they must live in the current year Within the amount they received last year. I knew that in the case of the Government Printing Office that would be difficult, because the cost of paper is very much higher than it was, and increased expenses have to be met in other, directions also.",48
179,Mr FENTON,BILL,"In a Department like that some latitude must be allowed, because it is impossible to gauge exactly the quantity of printing to be done. Mr Watt.;-Many Departments are in that position. The Government Printing Office can only conjecture what its requirements will be. The number of papers that this Parliament orders to be printed, and the quantity of printing too. which the Departments may feel compelled to order, will condition the expen^ diture of the office, but the Treasury must the keep a repressing hand upon that expenI f aDepartment cannot live within the amount that has been provided dealt on the Estimates, it must show good reason why it should receive a suppleand up to mentary provision.",48
180,Mr FALKINEK,BILL,"Will the Prime Ministhe ter explain the two items on page 53to "" office requisites, exclusive of writing by paper and envelopes,"" and. immediately below ""writing papeT and envelopes, including cost of printing and embossing thereon, Â£5.""",48
181,Mr WATT,BILL,"Thos e are two small items in the administrative section of the Government Printing Office,- but provision for them must be made on. the Esti",48
182,Mr TUDOR,BILL,That is merely the Comof monwealth's share of such expenditure.,48
183,Mr WATT,BILL,"Yes . As honourable the members are aware, the Government EstiPrinting Office in Melbourne is a joint Department. The building and nearly the machinery, excepting certain linoand presses, are owned by the Vicof the torian Government. The Government the Printer is a servant of the Victorian I Government, but for the purposes of that -^o-ordination to which the honourable  ardently aspires, Commonwealth work is done at that office, and the State Government Printer is also the Commonwealth Government Printer. Attempts were made at different times to found a separate Commonwealth printing office, but the arrangement made with the Victorian Government has worked so successfully that a continuance of it is mutually advantageous.",48
184,Mr TUDOR,BILL,"Do the Victorian Government allow Mr Mullett to retain the Â£150 which we vote for him, or do they seize it for the State Treasury?",49
185,Mr WATT,BILL,"I should not like to say. There bave been three Government Printers at this office within my time, and I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that Mr Mullett is a singularly able man for his position, and the Victorian and Commonwealth Governments alike are fortunate in having such an officer.",49
186,Mr HIGGS,BILL,"Mr Green, who is in charge of the office during Mr Mullett's absence, also'is a very good man.",49
187,Mr WATT,BILL,He is.,49
188,Mr TUDOR,BILL,Is the honourable member sure that the'Victorian Government does not seize the Â£150 which this Parliament votes for the Government Printer?,49
189,Mr WATT,BILL,I think that the Government Printer receives the special allowance made for Commonwealth services.,49
190,Mr MCWITXIAMS,BILL,"In nearly every case, the State Governments seize any such allowances.",49
191,Mr WATT,BILL,"Not in every case; certainly not in the case of the police. In regard to the remarks of the honourable member for Calare on the subject of statistical co-ordination, the States conference assembled some time ago, decided that statistical collection and compilation should be a function of the Commonwealth. Although that apparently meant great - expense to the Commonwealth, the Government at that time signified their acquiescence in the proposal. Since then the States have receded from that position. I re-opened the question this year, and asked them if they would give effect to the unanimous resolution of the Premiers and Treasurers, but for some reason State after State refused to do so. We are powerless to compel them to move in this matter, but co-ordination of the statistical activities is an object at' which we should aim. If we achieve - that, a vast sum of money will be saved to each of the Governments. Not long ago I had occasion to direct the attention of the Minister for Home and Territories (Mr Glynn) to a publication by the Statistician of New 'South Wales, which duplicated almost to a letter a previous Commonwealth publication. The expenditure seemed tp me quite unnecessary. I hope that when we confer with the States in the' new year about many questions that must be dealt with, and some of which must be settled, we shall be able to arrive at a satisfactory agreement.",49
192,Mr SAMPSON,BILL,"Will the honourable gentleman indicate the. intentions of the Government as to the maternity bonus, and say, also, whether any progress has been made towards an amalgamation of the Savings Banks?",49
193,Mr WATT,BILL,"My own views regarding the maternity bonus are very strong. I cannot pledge the Government to any course of action, because I have not been able to finalize the matter yet. The weakness of the present system is that women of means who do not require the money draw the bonus in the same way as poorer People who really need it. I am not prepared . to say that . it should he 1 abolished, but any Government which will look into this matter- 1I have not yet had an opportunity to do so-wil l devise a better system than the one which is now operating.",49
194,Mr FALKINER,BILL,Mr Eisher said that in everybody should claim the bonus.,49
195,Mr WATT,BILL,"I do not agree with that view. I intend when I get the chance to produce a scheme for the consideration of Parliament which I hope will remove tJie defects of the present system, and save a good deal of money. Regarding the amalgamation of the Federal and State taxation Departments, I have made abundantly plain in previous utterances that I do not believe that the proposal of the States that we should disband the Federal tax collecting office is feasible. The scheme which I submitted to the State Premiers would be safe for the States, simple for the taxpayer, and. economical to both sets of governments, and I intend, when, the opportunity arises, to still further urge that suggestion in conference, and, if possible, effect a settlement. - Mr MCWILLIAMS - As we have less than two hours in which to dispose of the Estimates', I suggest that instead of discussing each Department separately, honourable members should be allowed a few minutes each for the discussion of any item in the Estimates.",49
196,Mr WATT,BILL,"I propose to close my remarks with a suggestion to ""the Chairman that will facilitate the, discussion which the honourable member desires. Regarding the amalgamation of the Savings Banks, I am one of those who .was very strongly opposed to the establishment of Savings Banks in connection with the'Commonwealth Bank. I fought very hard against the proposal, and with considerable success in Victoria, the only area over which I was able to exercise any influence. I still believe that the competitive system is evil, and can be eliminated. Since I have been in charge of the Treasury, the Governor ef the Commonwealth Bank has been absent from Australia, and he is now in quarantine at Sydney. I have just .received from him a"" letter sent from the Makura, which is anchored off North Head, Sydney, and he intimated that he expects to be released next week. I hope to he able to discuss this andl other matters with him after the holidays. It is possible, I believe, to arrange, satisfactorily to the Commonwealth Bank and the Governments of the - States, for the elimination of that competition; but it. may mean a recasting oÂ£ the structure, principles, and activities of the Commonwealth Bank. That is! a course that in war timecould scarcely be attempted with prudence. But now that we have a temporary peace, and permanent peace is about to dawn, this reconstruction seems feasible, and I intend to proceed with it. Not for any purposes of the Governa ment,, but in accordance with a desire that has been expressed by honourable members, I suggest to you, Mr Chairman, that, instead of the discussion being confined to any Department, the members of the Committee ought to be free to deal now with any item in the Estimates. Honorable MEMBERS - Hear , hear!",50
197,Mr BOYD,BILL,"The honourable gentleman promised to make a statement in regard to the Commonwealth police. - Mr Watt - I asked the honourable gentleman, if he would accept an undertaking from me. I did that because I have read in Hansard and in the press that some honourable gentlemen in the Ministerial corner have refused to accept my undertaking.",50

In regard to the Commonwealth police, I say, quite frankly, as I did in aninterjection the other day, that I have been too busy on other matters to know much about it . It was not my creation. I think that there should be investigation officers to do special work for the Commonwealth, though not necessarily to strut about in uniform, vieing, with the State police. The honourable member for Henty (Mr. Boyd) as a Southerner, may not knqw as much as the Government dd of some facts affecting the administration of northern Australia. There are Queens^ landers who could affirm from personal knowledge what I know only from .documentary or hearsay evidence. There was time- I cannot say whether it still exists, because I have been chained to my desk for months-whe n orders for the execution of Commonwealth decrees were impossible of enforcement in certain parts of Australia. I hope that that time has gone. I wish for an opportunity to look thoroughly into the facts. sponsibilities will allow of the scrapping of the Commonwealth Police Force,, or the putting of it in a different position, that will be done. The Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), with the consent of his colleagues, was primarily responsible for the creation of the Force, and I am not entitled to repudiate anything that he has done, but I ask for an opportunity for examination to see what is the best course to be taken. I hope next year to pare out of the Estimates all. unnecessary expenditure. I say that to men who are prepared to take my word.",50
204,Mr BOYD,BILL,I am prepared to take it .,51
205,The CHAIRMAN,BILL," iTh e course that the Acting Prime Minister has suggested occurred to me as desirable before it was mentioned by any honourable member. As the time allotted to the discussion of the Estimates is limited, it might convenience the Committee if honourable members were allowed to refer to any item in them instead of being confined to those of the Department of the Treasury, which is now before the Chair, and then, in their order, to those of the other Departments.",51
206,Mr GREGORY,BILL,Do you suggest items cannot be taken out of their order t,51
207,Mr WATT,BILL,That they might be dealt with in any order.,51
208,The CHAIRMAN,BILL,I ' suggest that honourable members should be free to make their own selection. Is it the will of the Committee that the question be that the remaining Departments of the Estimates be agreed to?,51
209,Mr HIGGS,BILL,Most respectfully-No .,51
210,Mr JH CATTS,BILL,"Cook) [3.19] I am pleased at the great success that has attended' the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank. The Budget papers show that there was a deficit on the 30th June, 1913, in connection with the operations of the Bank during the first six months of its existence, amounting to Â£46,636. In 1913-14 the Bank made a profit of Â£ 9 , 6 4 0 ; in 1914-15, of Â£ 3 9 , 2 1 7 ; 1915-16, of Â£144,847; in 1916-17,- of Â£ 3 7 9 . 2 2 3; and in 1917-18, of Â£232,659; [363] the net profit for the whole period totalling Â£758,951. In the few moments at my disposal I wish, by placing some facts on record, to do justice to the gentleman' who If our re 1 conceived the idea of establishing this Bank, who took the necessary steps to bring it within the range of practical politics, and, subsequently, by his strenuous advocacy of it , led to the passing of the law under which it was established- I refer to my old friend, Mr . K in g O'Malley. He has been most unjustly treated. At the head office of the Bank in Sydney there are foundation stones in . scribed with the names of Mr Hughes, of Mr Fisher, and of Mr Higgs, but my old friend, who was really responsible for the establishment of the Bank, and had to fight for it against the opposition of some of these men, is not remembered there. Year after year he put before this Parliament a well-thought-out scheme for the establishment of a national Bank, and on his initiative the matter was taken before the Brisbane Labour Conference in 1908, with the result that it subsequently became a plank of t'he Federal Labour platform, on which the party to which I belong contested the election of 1910, and was returned to power. The honourable gentleman had to put that up a fight for the Bank even in his own party. I do not say that Mr . Fisher, who was then Prime Minister, opposed the establishment of the Bank. He could not do that, because it was a plank of the Labour party; but evidently he was very much afraid of it .",51
211,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,BILL,You grossly misrepresent him. I was there.,51
212,Mr JH CATTS,BILL,The honourable member was not a member of the Labour Caucus in which these matters were dealt with.',51
213,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,BILL,I was at the Conference.,51
214,Mr JH CATTS,BILL,"I am referring to matterswhich took place within the Parliamentary Labour party, of which the honourable member who interrupts could have no knowledge whatsoever. The only name that I mentioned in connection with the Conference was that of Bang O'Malley. On page 10 of the report of the Conference a motion for the establishment of a national bank is recorded as having been moved by K in g O'Malley. The matter was afterwards referred to a committee, whose recommendation ""was adopted by the Conference, and later became a leading plank of the Labour platform.",51
215,Mr HECTOK LAMOND,BILL,That is not so.,52
216,Mr JH CATTS,BILL,"I was present at ment. the Conference, and have refreshed my memory by reading the report of its proceedings. The proposal was referred to a committee, which reported on two questions, the establishment of a Commonwealth Bank and the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States. It s recommendations were adopted by the Conference, and the establishment of a - Commonwealth Bank was made a plank of our fighting platform. which we were pledged to establish was a bank of issue, deposit, exchange, and reserve. Mr Eisher provided for the establishment of the Australian notes issue as something quite separate from the bank.",52
217,Mr WATT,BILL,He cut out the note issue.,52
218,Mr JH CATTS,BILL,"He took from the Bank the power of issuing notes. I do not think that I am unjust in saying that at that time he had no intention of proceeding with the Commonwealth Bank scheme. It seemed a little too big for him. Knowing this to be so, a number oÂ£ us took steps in the party meeting to prevent the project being dropped. I think that was done on the initiative of Mr K in g O'Malley, and I believe that Mr Chanter, who occupies the chair at this moment, was on one of the committees which threshed out the matter. I have refreshed my memory with the recollection of several honourable members, amongst them the H o n . W . G. Higgs, M . H . R . , ex-Treasurer j the H o n . Dr Maloney, M . H . R . ; the Hon. James Page, M . H . R . ; and Mr James Mathews, M . H . R . , as to the action which had to be taken by the Labour caucus to force., the Government to establish the Bank. These gentlemen support my statement of the facts. I remember the incident in the party meeting, complaint being made that Mr Fisher was not proceeding to establish the Bank, and, notwithstanding the strenuous opposition of Mr Fisher and Mr Hughes, the party instructed these gentlemen to bring the Bank into existance. I am reminded by the ex-Treasurer (Mr Higgs), who sits beside me, that the late Mr Fraser, then a Cabinet Minister, said that the establishment of the Bank would ruin the GovernThere are those who from time to time have spoken unkindly of K in g O'Malley, but whatever may be that gentleman's defects, it must be remembered in ' his favour that he is responsible for this in stitution, and did more than any other man in the country to bring it into existence. It , therefore, seems paltry that his name was not placed with the others in the head office of the Bank. The bank Mr GREGORY - He is commemorated at the Federal Capital. Y o u ought to provide for his commemoration somewhere on the route of the transcontinental railway to Perth.",52

220,Mr WATT,BILL,I do not see any item in these' Estimates referring to this matter.,52
221,Mr JH CATTS,BILL,"I have really finished what I have to say, and only desire to add that the Bank was established amongst the misgivings even of those who were its nominal sponsors. The establishment of the Bank was not in any sense due to those gentlemen, who might be called the Leaders of the Government at that time, because it was really forced on them by the younger and more active members of the great party to which I belong. I - notice, however, that those gentlemen who blocked the Bank as long as they could now figure as the authors of it , and take great credit for its establishment; and I desire to take this opportunity, though it is late, to place on record some of the facts, so that justice may be done to my old friend and colleague.",52

My desire is to show reasons why I intend to vote in favour of the Chief Justice's Pension Bill, although I voted against pensions for Judges on a former occasion. I think that the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr . Higgs) is very unjust in "" try i ng to prevent my giving reasons for my vote on the present occasion, for it must be admitted that it is not very often that I address either the House or the Committee. I submit that we have already established a principle of pensions by the"" payment of old-age pensions and soldiers' pensions, and neither the person nor the amount involved in any way vitiates or affects that principle. At one time. I evolved a scheme by which members of this Parliament might themselves be pensioned, and it was approved by every one to whom I submitted it ; so much so, that many honourable members signed it , including the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr. Higgs), the honourable member for  others. My scheme took cognisance of the fact that a man's first election might be something in the nature of a fluke, and made - no provision under such circumstances j but if a man were elected to a second Parliament he became entitled, on retirement, to a pension of Â£ 6 0 per annum, or Â£ 5 per month. were elected to a third Parliament, and [363]- 2 continued to be elected to successive Parliaments, he was allowed an increase of Â£50 per annum"" in respect of each Parliament, until the pension reached a maximum of Â£26 0 per annum, or Â£ 5 per week. The honourable member for Eden Monaro (Mr Austin Chapman) was chairman, and I was a member, of the Old-age Pensions Commission, and when taking evidence in Sydney on one occasion, an incident was brought' before us= which clearly illustrates the usefulness of making provision by way of pension fordays of misfortune. During the discussion on the Chief Justice's Pension Bill ' much was said to the effect that men with large incomes should make provision for themselves, and not ask others to "" go round with the hat''-a n expression to which I take strong exception in this connection. However, one witness before the Old-age Pensions Commission gave us. some evidence in confidence of a case of a man who, at one time, was a very noted figures in .sporting circles in Australia. He had a fine stud far m in New South Wales, and had won many classic races. He had sold that stud far m for a very large sum, and yet, at the time that evidence was being given, he was in receipt of an old-age pension of. 10s. a week from the State Government. I mention this to show that, no matter what a man's position may be, it is possible that, at a later period in his life , he will get into such necessitous circumstances as to make a pension, however small, very desirable.",53
228,Mr FALKINER,BILL,Especiall y when a man has devoted himself to public affairs and not to his own.,53
229,Mr BAMFORD,BILL,"That was the argument I used when I submitted my scheme, and had it full y endorsed by those I have mentioned. Just about that time the Bulletin propounded a scheme under which every member of this Parliament was to be paid Â£1,000 per annum, Â£600 in cash, the other Â£400 being placed to his credit, and given to him when, either compulsorily or voluntarily, he ceased to be a member. But neither that scheme nor my own was endorsed by the GovernI f he ment, although I believe that my scheme, at any rate, would receive support were it 9846 Estimates [REPRESENTATIVES. ] submitted now. In regard to the amendment to the Chief Justice's Pension Bill that was moved by the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs)",53
230,Mr HIGGS,BILL,Is this in order? The honourable member is discussing an amendment on the Chief Justice's Pension Bill.,54
231,Mr BAMFORD,BILL,"I had no opportunity to speak on the Bill. The "" CHAIRMAN - The honourable member may make a passing allusion to that Bill, but cannot deal with it in detail.",54
232,Mr BAMFORD,BILL,"I am merely making a passing allusion to it, and my point is that the honourable member for Capricornia, in submitting his amendment, did not attack the principle of pensions, merely saying that the proposal was inopportune.",54
233,Mr HIGGS,BILL,"It is a good job Christmas, or I should object. The CHAIRMAN '(Hon. J. M . Chanter) - Perhaps the Chair is a little lenient because it is Christmas; but honourable members have only an hour in which to voice their opinions, and I desire to allow as much latitude as possible.",54
234,Mr BAMFORD,BILL,"I shall not pursue that line of argument any further, and thereby raise the ire of the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs). I should now like to say a word in relation to the Commonwealth police. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt) has referred to Queensland as a place where the people know something about this force, and what rendered its establishment necessary. In my electorate there are a few of the Federal police, all good men, doing good work; and I take exception to the action of the Government in dispensing - with their services. There may be still a few members of the Federal police in the electorate, but certainly not more than 'five. These men were offered the positions by the Government, and though they did not wear uniforms, they went about doingj in some cases, very necessary work. 'Some of them, in order to take up the positions, had left other employment, and - it is known that on their appointment they immediately became marked men .Amongst those in their own walk of life. 'The result is that since their services ""have been dispensed with by the Govern1918-19. ment, they are boycotted, and cannot obtain employment in the work to which they had previously . been accustomed. In my opinion, the Government have treated these men very - badly. As to the necessity for a Federal Police Force, I was told by a military officer of an incident that occurred in Queensland a little while ago. A meeting was being addressed by a number of Industrial Workers of the World men, of whom only two out of about eleven were British; and when one of the foreigners made remarks of a distinctly offensive character, a man in the crowd called out, '' You are a liar!"" A State policeman, who had taken no notice of the disloyal utterances on the platform, immediately tapped this man on the shoulder, and told him that if he interrupted the proceedings again it is he would have to be "" taken care of."" I know that, even if there had been several Federal policemen there, they could not have taken any action in the presence of the State policeman, and with the crowd to a great extent in sympathy with the speakers. In some cases, however, the Federal police have been instrumental in suppressing and preventing disturbances. In my electorate there is an hotel called Cassidy's, and not long ago a party of soldiers-ever y one of them a wounded man:-wa s there celebrating the armistice. A strange crowd, of men came in, and com- menced to '' slang-wang '' the soldiers, one going so far as to pull a badge off a - soldier's coat. Of course, there was immediate trouble and the wounded men were so badly treated that some of them are, I am told, in hospital even today. Two .or three Federal police, it is said, came along and attempted to do something, and their efforts were very greatly assisted by a number of.boy scouts, who went around to the various picture theatres and places of amusement, calling out, '' Diggers, your mates are being atacked at Cassidy's.'' This brought every soldier in the place to Cassidy's, and the first party of attackers were very severely treated.",54
235,Mr MCWILLIAMS,BILL,Were - there any State policemen there?,54
236,Mr BAMFORD,BILL,"There are always State policemen about, but they take very little action; in fact, at one meeting of 1 mine, where the audience was singing choruses; in order to interrupt me, the police at the back of the hall joined in. 1 If the Federal police were in greater numbers, and better organized, they would be able, if not to prevent disturbances, at least to exercise a restraining - influence. There is only a small number of them, and the expenditure involved is nothing to cavil at ",54
237,Mr SAMPSON,BILL,Will you explain where the Federal police did anything in connection with the trouble you speak of?,55
238,Mr BAMFORD,BILL,"I said that there were only two or three there, and that they could do nothing. Mr SAMPSON,-Ha d they any influence on that occasion?",55
239,Mr BAMFORD,BILL,"I admit they had not, but if they were better organized they might effect very good results; and I hope the item will he allowed to pass. Honourable members have no idea of the state of things up in my electorate. heard this morning of what has happened at Fort D a r w in ; and I am sorry to say there is a number of men of the samecalibre in my district. We have all heard of men who, when discussing British rule, have said, "" I would just as soon be under German r u l e . """,55
240,Mr CONSIDINE,BILL,Has the honourable what is being done in this regard. member heard that statement made by any one?,55
241,Mr BAMFORD,BILL,Yes ; but not by the honourable member. I ask the Treasurer not to allow this item to be eliminated from the Estimates.,55
242,Mr CONSIDINE,BILL,"Barrier) [3.47] On page 35 of the Treasurer's Estimate there is an item of "" Unforeseen expenthe d it u r e , "" in respect of which we are to vote Â£1,500. Under the same ing in 1917-18 a sum of Â£2,500 was the Treasury Estimates? voted, and the amount actually 'expended was Â£836. I should like the Treasurer to state whether, put of this item, vision is made for the payment of a salary of Â£300 per annum received by a certain sury Estimates. man, who is employed at the present time in the Defence Department, but who instead of doing any work for it , is gaged in looking after the requirements of the Prime Minister's constituency of with. Bendigo. He is drawing Â£300 per annum of the taxpayers' money, and although he is on the permanent staff of the Defence Department he does no work for that Department.",55
243,Mr HIGGS,BILL,Was he appointed by the Public Service Commissioner ?,55
244,Mr CONSIDINE,BILL,"No . In the first instance he was employed as a temporary clerk in the Prime Minister's Department. The Prime Minister evidently had sufficient influence with' the head of the Defence Department to obtain for this gentleman an appointment in that branch of the Service. This is an item, of ""Unforeseen expenditure."" It could not have been foreseen by honourable members that a man employed nominally in the Defence Department would be in reality looking after the constituents of the Hon. William MorrisHughes. He signs himself "" Private Secretary."" He is not private secretary to the Defence Department, but acts in that capacity for the Prime Minister, who We have is in England. I do not object to the Prime Minister or any other member of the Government having"" a duly appointed private secretary. But , in view of the fact that Ministerial supporters are constantly preaching economy and demanding retrenchment, it is interesting to know I have no fault to find with the man' who is drawing this salary. The fact that he is employed in this way by the Prime Minister shows that the right honourable gentleman has confidence in him, and believes him to be a very capable man.",55
245,Mr WISE,BILL,"I rise to a point of order. The honourable member is now discussing payment received by a clerk whom he asked says is employed by the Defence Departheadment, whereas we are now dealing with",55
246,Mr MATHEWS,BILL,"On a point of order, I would remind you, Mr Chairman, that proyou said you would allow a fair avenue of criticism in connection with the Trea",55
247,Mr WISE,BILL,But members of the Opposition objected to any reference being enallowed to other Departments while the Treasury Estimates were being dealt,55
248,The CHAIRMAN,BILL,"It is true that I submitted to the Committee the suggestion that fairly general criticism should be allowed, but that suggestion was rejected. 1 understood the honourable member for Barrier (Mr Considine) to say that he was dealing with an officer who was acting for the Prime Minister, - and desired to know whether his salary was provided for under a specific item, to which he referred, in these EstiHI ctt&S",55
249,Mr CONSIDINE,BILL,"I said in the view of the Treasurer this officer's salary must have been provided for under the heading of "" Unforeseen expenditure.""",56
250,Mr WISE,BILL,"Why does the honourable member wish now to deal with a matter relating to a Department, references to which, on these Estimates, were objected - to by other members of the Opposition?",56
251,Mr CONSIDINE,BILL,I am not referring to an item in the Defence Estimates. I am dealing with an item in the Estimates thab are before us.,56
252,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,BILL,"On a point of order, sir, have you ruled that we are at liberty, in discussing the Treasury Estimates, to deal with any matter covered by the Estimates as a whole ?",56
253,The CHAIRMAN,BILL,No .,56
254,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,BILL,"Then I submit that the honourable member for Barrier is not discussing any item in the Estimates now before us. He has said that this officer is employed in the Defence Department, but is, in reality, acting for the Prime Minister. The Estimates for the Prime Minister's Department have been passed, and those relating to Defence Department have not been reached.",56
255,The CHAIRMAN,BILL,"The honourable member for Barrier will not be in order Treasury Estimates. in discussing at this stage any matter does not pertain to the . Department the Treasury. That ruling cordance with the expressed wish of the Committee. If honourable members desire to deal with other matters, they will he able to do so on the Appropriation Bill. , Mr Considine - I fai l .to underpersonal stand why the honourable member for Illathe warra (Mr Lamond) should be so superhis sensitive in respect of criticism of leader. I object to the Assistant Minister for Defence (Mr Wise) attempting throw me off the track or to put words into' my mouth. I am dealing item of "" Unforeseen expenditure "" in the Treasury Estimates.",56
256,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,BILL,"On a point of order, I submit that the item of "" U n foreseen expenditure"" in the Treasury Estimates cannot cover the salary of the officer to whom the honourable member is referring. He says that he is on the regular pay-sheet of the Defence Department, and that being so, his salary could not by. any means be covered by the item to which he refers.",56
257,The CHAIRMAN,BILL,"The honourable, member for Barrier was dealing with the item of "" Unforeseen expenditure"" on page 35, and I gathered that his inquiry was as to whether part of that proposed vote in respect of which the Treasurer is responsible was being paid by way of salary to an official acting for the Prime Minister. The honourable member will not be in order in discussing the Defence Department or any of its officers, but he will be in order in discussing any disbursement through the Treasury for any purpose.",56
258,Mr CONSIDINE,BILL,"I shall be glad to hear from the Treasurer, or any other Minister, that no part of this item has been used for the purpose to which I have referred. The honourable member for Illawarra feels h u r t when any criticism is levelled at"" the Prime Minister.",56
259,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,BILL,I am very h u r t that I cannot get an opportunity to disthe cuss matters relating to our soldiers.,56
260,Mr CONSIDINE,BILL,Perhaps so; but the honourable member must know that he cannot deal with that matter on the I desire to have that from the Treasurer an assurance that noof such practice as that to which I have is in acalluded is being indulged in .,56
261,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,BILL,What practice?,56
262,Mr CONSIDINE,BILL,"The practice of employing an officer temporarily employed in the Public Service to do the work of the Prime Minister as representative of Bendigo, and paying salary out of the funds of the taxhis payers. The people will want to know why distinctions are made in favour of to , the Prime Minister, and why, out of his own salary, he is not able to pay for the with the work of his constituency.",56
263,Mr FALKINER,BILL,"Hume) [4.1] - So far our most brilliant legal men have accepted positions as Justices of the High Court, the fountain head of our justice, for the sake of the kudos appertaining to them; but whether this will be the case in the future or not is open to a great - deal of doubt, because of the very low - salary offered. Owing to the fact that our High Court sits in the different capitals, our Justices are practically away from their homes half the year; and,, no matter how frugal they may be, seeing that they are obliged to live at a fairly high rate, their salary is quite inadequate forthem to make provision for that time, when they will be obliged to retire. In carrying out his duties, a High Court Justice has to devote the whole of his v .attention to * very intricate matters, quiring the application of all his intelligence; and we know that a professional man is lacking in a certain amount of practical knowledge, which is a drawback to him in seeking to invest his savings to .advantage. We ought to provide our High Court Justices with adequate pen*-sions, so that we may secure the very best men obtainable. It would be a tragedy for Australia if the High Court simply became the resting-place for second-class or briefless barristers. This is not a ter of economy. It is a matter of getting the very best men to dispense justice on our High Court Bench. If we do not do this, litigants will go past the High Court to the Privy Council, and we shall be paying seven second-rate men for doing nothing. Everybody in Australia, no matter how worthless he may be in the ordinary walks of life, or how thriftless, or how criminal, is entitled to receive a sion at the age of sixty-five years; but for men of the highest integrity, intelligence, and moral character oh our High Court Bench no adequate provision is made if they have been unfortunate. When the Estimates are being dealt with, the Treasurer should be in the chamber. Although another Minister may be in charge of the Committee during the Treasurer's absence, he is unable to supply information about the bulk of the matters touched upon by honourable members.  been in the chamber from 11 o'clock this morning until a few minutes ago. He has other matters to attend to.",57
264,Mr FALKINER,BILL,"Of course, I recognise that he has a lot of work to attend to, and cannot always, be in attendance. Nevertheless, when the Estimates are being dealt with, a Minister should he in the chamber who is able to supply information to honourable members. It is fair to assume that when the Federal Land Tax Bill was first introduced, very few. persons except the then Attorney General (Mr Hughes), who introJ duced it, knew what it would mean. Mr. MCKay, the first Commissioner of Taxare- tion, pointed out in his first report that the revenue received from secondary taxpayers-that is to say, shareholders in land-holding institutions-di d not pay the cost of collection. The Department has an army of clerks endeavouring to bring .within the clutches of the Federal land tax all those persons who, while not owning land themselves, hold shares in Dalgety's, the Bank of New South Wales, or the New Zealand Loan and Mercantile Agency. * The valuer, who, by building mat- up his department, comes into a higher grade in the Civil Service, has every particular locality valued, although it is well known to practical men that there are thousands of acres in the interior which are all practically of the same value. If the value of one place is determined a man can easily ride over the others and fix a value upon them. It seems to be the object of the officers pen- of Departments to get as much work done as is possible. If a person writes to the Deputy Commissioner of Pensions the Federal member for the district receives a copy of the communication, a copy of the Pensions Office communication, and a copy of. his covering letter. It seems to me a waste of clerical labour.",57
265,Mr HIGGS,BILL,The duplicate copies are very useful to members.,57
266,Mr FALKINER,BILL,They are very useful to any honourable member who is not doing the best he can for his Â£12 per. week. This correspondence merely go** to a member to help him to dig himself in well in his electorate.,57
267,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,BILL,It helps a man to get justice who cannot get it in any other way.,58
268,Mr FALKINER,BILL,"If people cannot secure justice from any Department the head of that Department should be dismissed. A member's life is made miserable because of the clerical work he has to do, addressing envelopes and forwarding correspondence, work which in his own office he would entrust to a typist earning 30s. per week. According to one item on the Estimates, the Commonwealth Bank is paid Â£8,000 for bank exchange from all Departments. As it gets the whole of the business of the Departments, to the detriment of the general public, it ought to do the exchanges for nothing. the private banks did it for nothing, and seeing that the Commonwealth Bank has been bolstered up at the public expense, and that it has a vast amount of money lying idle to the credit of the Commonwealth Government, it should also do this exchange for nothing. Our note issue is up to its l i m it , and should not be increased any further. I understand that Â£10,000,000 of the gold backing does not belong to the Commonwealth Government but has been borrowed for the period of the war from the private banks. In these circumstances the interest earned by the notes f u n d should be applied for the purpose of building uo"" a gold reserve, so that the Government can say honestly that the backing to our note issue is our own, anO is not borrowed. Ever since I have been a member of this House I have protested against allowing Commonwealth loan money and our ordinary Consolidated Revenue money to remain idle in the Commonwealth Bank. For the last three quarters of the year t'he deposits in the Commonwealth Bank amounted to about Â£30,000,000, while the advances to the public were not more than Â£8,000,000. I have asked year after year why we cannot adopt the procedure followed in other countries, and - How the loan moneys to remain with the private banks who have found them until they are required by the Government. W it h so much taxation and such a heavy drain on the.private banks and on the public for money for war loans, our position soon will be that the private banks will be obliged to borrow from the Commonwealth Bank, and pay a high rate of interest for the taxpayers' money, which has been drawn from them and paid into the Commonwealth Bank. A great deal might be said on these Estimates, but time - will not allow it . Our finances ought to be looked into by the Treasurer. Particularly should he take notice of the money lying idle in the Commonwealth Bank. Attention should be paid to the growing size of the various Departments, and to the number of employees in them. When I go into a public Department I can always see half-adozen young fellows standing about, Previously carrying files of papers tied up with red tape, and chatting away to one another. We should pay our public servants well, but we must have an efficient and capable Service, which does not include one man more than is necessary. In regard to the High Court, I hope the Treasurer will bring forward a Bill to provide for pensions for all the Judges, so that they may be given that independence which is essential to their high position.",58
269,Mr FENTON,BILL,"Maribyrnong ) [4.16] The remarks of the honourable member for Hume (Mr Falkiner) regarding the Public Service may be applicable to a few men, but it is .unfair to make a general charge against a service which, in war time, has done good work for the country.. I do not defend a waster in any department of life, but in all large institutions, whether governmental or private, one may see at certain times of the day men or women who are, apparently, doing nothing. But it is unfair to accuse them of idleness because of what one sees on a casual visit. We have no continuous oversight of them, and it may be that when they are apparently idle they are waiting to receive the attention of some, other officer who is busy. The New' Zealand Government has provided Â£400,000 on the Estimates in order to pay bonuses to the public servants. I agree with the other remarks of the honourable member for Hume regarding the Commonwealth. Bank. quarterly balance-sheet of that institution shows that Â£21,000,000 was lying at short call. Presumably the bulk of that money is operated through the branch in London, where there is more opportunity for investment at short dates. I believe that most of it represented deposits on current account by Commonwealth Departments. The Commonwealth has Â£18,000,000 lying in the Bank not earning one penny of interest for the Government.  that when I was Treasurer.",58
270,Mr FENTON,BILL,The interest which the Commonwealth Bank is getting by utilizing that sum ought to be flowing inte the Treasury. The Government should take steps to carry out the recommendation of the Public Accounts Committee that the interest earned by the Bank Commonwealth moneys in current account should he either paid to the divided . between the Bank and the Treasury.

271,Mr FALKINER,BILL,"In any case, why should money be drawn from the people reconstruction of that institution. before it is required? Mr .FENTON - There is a good deal in that point. The references of the honourable member to the Old-age Pensions Office remind me that that office has carried out an economy in stationery which is much better than the Postmaster-General's little green telegram forms. I believe that an envelope telegram form, much, easier to open, and cheaper and better in every way, could be devised.",59
272,Mr JOWETT,BILL,The present telegram forms are the most economical used in any part of the world.,59
273,Mr WEBSTER,BILL,The New form was not secret.,59
274,Mr FENTON,BILL,The Old-age Pensions Office uses for the acknowledgment of communications received a printed sheet that can be gummed up and posted.,59
275,Mr WEBSTER,BILL,I considered the adoption df a sheet like that and found it i m practicable. It would be no cheaper than the envelopes we are using now.,59

I know that the form used by the Repatriation Department must mean a savThe last ing of hundreds of pounds per annum. And why should the Departments continue using stamps which represent a certain quantity of paper and gum and involve the use of special machines, when a stamped form could be used, allowing the adhesive stamp to be dispensed with .",59
277,Mr WEBSTER,BILL,That system was condemned in New South Wales fifteen years ago.,59
278,Mr FENTON,BILL,"It is used in some of the Departments, and could be adopted It would mean an economy in printing and paper. Business firms, instead of having special stamp lickers on the premises, generally send out their communications in "" franked "" envelopes.",59

283,Mr FENTON,BILL,"The Treasury officials have done exceptionally, well in connection with the note issue. If we were to hand that over to the Commonwealth Zealand Bank we should be losing a big revenueearning asset, and we cannot afford to do that.

Such a man does not deserve the support of his Minister or of the Government. I cannot say that the judiciary of the Northern Territory is corrupt, but, like the Administrator, it is the pig-headed, and has proceeded along such Conlines that it has made the people of the Territory believe that they have no chance of getting justice from it . Such a belief discontent in a British community, and develops trouble such as has occurred. It is admitted that the report of this trouble was censored, and that the newspapers at the Seat of Government were not allowed to publish it . What can be obtained by suppression of news concerning the discontent in the Territory ? Of course, I cannot blame the Minister for Home and Territories (Mr Glynn) for the censoring of the press reports, because that is not within his control; but why does he not assert himself and prevent the Minister who does supervise the censorship from exercising it in connection .with the affairs of his Department? Of course, I realise that there is such a thing as Ministerial responsibility, and also international responsibility, and that Ministers have to acquiesce sometimes in a course of action that does not meet with their approval. But this interference by one Minister with another in swh a matter as the censorship requires some explanation. Nothing that can take place in the Northern Territory today can prejudice the safety of the Empire, because, to all intents and purposes, the war is now over, and to me it is an atrocity that the Minister who controls the Censor's Office should go out of his way to interfere in the way I have described. Such conduct ought to be condemned, and will be condemned by the public. have often had to complain about the attitude of the press; but even if I myself were prejudicially affected, I would never advocate the suppression of any news of the - kind.",62

In a time of national - or international crisis we might understand such an exercise of the censorship, but by no stretch of the imagination can the occurrence at Darwin be so described. """,63
299,Mr BRENNAN,THE PARLIAMENT,Is it not a fact that a member of the Government prevented the publication of this news?,63
300,Mr MATHEWS,THE PARLIAMENT,It is a fact.,63
301,Mr BRENNAN,THE PARLIAMENT,Do we understand that the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt) takes no responsibility for this action of the Minister for Defence?,63
302,Mr MATHEWS,THE PARLIAMENT,"I am now dealing with the Minister of the Department, who must throw the responsibility on the head of the Government. The reason I take such a strong line today is that I previously pointed out the trouble that was coming.",63
303,Mr GLYNN,THE PARLIAMENT,Not this trouble.,63
304,Mr MATHEWS,THE PARLIAMENT,I assured the Minister as to the effect of the exercise of the censorship.,63
305,Mr GLYNN,THE PARLIAMENT,That was not in connection with this trouble at all.,63
306,Mr MATHEWS,THE PARLIAMENT,"The present trouble is the culminating point of all that has occurred in the Northern Territory. The main charge is, and has been for some considerable time, that the Judiciary is biased. The Administrator is isolated Personally, I from the rest of Australia, and.has complete control of telegraphs, postal affairs, shipping, and so forth , and can suppress what information he desires. If he does suppress' information, he is exercising a power that he ought not to possess.",63
307,Mr GLYNN,THE PARLIAMENT,"If you say the Administrator does that, you are not correct, for he does not interfere with the censorship.",63
308,Mr MATHEWS,THE PARLIAMENT,I say that the so called riot that took place afc Darwin a News few davs ago is the outcome of the A d ministrator's interference with the liberties of the people. He censors everything.,63
309,Mr GLYNN,THE PARLIAMENT,You are on another matI ter now.,63
310,Mr MATHEWS,THE PARLIAMENT,"This trouble has been led up to*by the actions of, not an Administrator, but a dictator. There are three men in Melbourne who assure me that before leaving the Territory they were searched, in order to insure that fchey did not fetch away with them any documents that could prove the statements made hy residents; and the postal law has been broken in order that .1 might not receive communications from the Northern Territory. The magistracy is a cause of much of the trouble, and has been so all along. The following communication has been received by the Leader , of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) from Messrs. MCOay and Thwaites, solicitors, Melbourne:RE DARWIN CLIENTS-SECON D LETTER. Since writing our first letter of today to you, we have received the following telegram from Darwin:"" Since my last, two justices appointed here, namely, Evans and MACDonald. Evans is Government Secretary, also various other posts. MACDonald minor vernment official Protector Aboriginals, keeps the aboriginals enclosure near Darwin, also Darwin Point keeper, was stable. Comment in this wire superfluous."" Messrs. MCOay and Thwaites are acting on behalf of the people of Darwin. This not a Labour party affair, but embraces the whole population of. the Northern Territory outside the public officials; deed, I may say that many of the officials are with the rest of the community this matter, but are afraid to assert selves because of their position. The communication continuesAs you will see by the telegram, the two justices are both Government officials, makes the position with regard to justices great deal worse from the point of view our clients. Bad as the conditions are in these southern centres of civilization, where sorts of favouritism is exercised to place men of a particular political colour power, such appointments and such ministration as has been experienced the Northern Territory would not be tolerated for two minutes. It is useless to appeal to the Judiciary, and the tisanship of the magistracy is undoubted. Whatever the private feelings of the lic servants might be, they are still lie servants, and they do not exercise functions as magistrates otherwise than at the pleasure of the dictator.",63
311,Mr GLYNN,THE PARLIAMENT,They do not sit on the 'bench.,64
312,Mr MATHEWS,THE PARLIAMENT,"I should like place before the Minister some facts in connection with - the appointment of justioes of the peace in the Territory. Even in the wild political appointments made to the magistracy in other parts of Australia there is a certain decency observed; and the people in the Northern Territory desire that in such appointments all shades of opinion in the community shall be represented. I have presented a petition to Parliament on this question, signed by almost the whole population of . the Northern Territory outside the date officials, and I have received another, with 251 signatures, objecting to the whole of the present procedure. The Territory, financially, is subsidized by the rest of Australia, and I am not asking holds that the people of the Northern TerriGotory shall have the full control of the money thus received. If I did, I should cononly make myself ridiculous; but we must remember that these people are Australians, like ourselves, and that they * have no representation in this Parliais ment. They have to trust to honourable members, and I dare say there are very few of us who have not been asked, and in- - who are not willing, to present any fair in case that they may submit. They are, themof course, very much isolated, and we are only too desirous to assist them in any way we can. Much as I respect the new Minister for Home and Territories (Mr. which. Glynn), I would not place even in his a hands full control over the lives and wellof being of the people of the Northern Territory, because that is not the civilized way of governing a community. I admit all that a benevolent dictatorship may produce even a better civilization than we in have; but, unfortunately, we cannot admake people run in grooves, and some in regard must be paid to their feelings and desires. Professor Gilruth is, of course, very human, with the peculiarities and parweaknesses, of humanity, and it is impossible for him to rule with justice the pubpeople with whom he has for so long been piib-"" disputing and fighting. What is really their wanted is a new Administrator, able to put aside the hatreds of the past, for it is evident that Professor Gilruth is not one who can forgive and forget. I"" have suggested to the Minister that, he should visit the Territory himself, and see to the people who are working under disabilities that do not obtain in any other part of Australia. It is possible, in a community like that of Darwin, for persons of all shades of political thought to sign such a petition as that to which I have referred. No doubt it would be signed by hundreds of people who would not even dream of voting for a Labour man. I am willing to admit that there are in Darwin men who, in politics, differ as widely as the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Bruce Smith) and I do, and that amongst those who take the stand that the Administrator is not administering the Territory in a way most beneficial to' the Commonwealth there may be men of extreme views. The Northern Territory is a kind of sink, into which the money of the taxpayers has for years been poured. We must expect large expenditures to take place in connection with it. People of all shades of political thought feel that it must be kept white. It was a kind of vampire, sucking the very life's blood of South Australia, and it was because that State had kept it ""white"" that I voted for its transfer to the Commonwealth. "" I believed that the Commonwealth Government would be in a'better position to keep it "" white"" and develop it. Many Ministers have been condemned for their administration of the affairs of the Territory. I recognise that it is necessary to entrust some one with executive power in respect of the Territory, and the powers so conferred on the Administrator, if rightly used, would be ductive of much good. We find, however, that they have been so exercised as to bring about chaos. It is time that the Government considered the desirableness of removing the present Administrator, and of replacing him by some one who will not be ready to vent his spleen on individuals. I have heard of a statement that a man named Nelson, secretary of the local branch of the Australian Workers Union, hadinduced the people of Darwin to riot a few' days ago. As a matter of fact, I have, during the last few months, received from this very man dozens of letters and telegrams, pointing out what would happen if improvements were not made, and showing that it was impossible to live under the conditions imposed by Dr Gilruth. Nelson will possibly be prosecuted, and if he is tried in the Territoryhe may be sentenced fo twenty years' i m prisonment on each of three charges, or sixty years' imprisonment in all.",64
313,Mr GLYNN,THE PARLIAMENT,He need not be tried upthere.,65
314,Mr MATHEWS,THE PARLIAMENT,"Havin g regard to the Judiciary of the Northern Territory, and the peculiar jury system in vogue there, this man, if tried there, will not have a chance. Even if he were tried down south, no Judge would be likely todisplay any mercy in dealing with a man* suspected of inciting a riot in such a community. The point I wish to emphasize, however, is that Nelson warned the authorities down here that this trouble was coming. He urged that much discontent would be removed if the people of the Territory were given representation in this Parliament and a jury system such as we have in the several States. He urged, further, that what was desired was a magistracy which would deal out justice, and the decisions of which would not be coloured hy the opinions of the Administrator. I am satisfied that if what is taking place in the Territory were known in certain quarters, it would be said at the Peace Conference that Australia was tolerating there a form of Kaiserism such as even Germany would not allow. Even if I were to speak for hours I pro- could not tell in detail of all the pin pricks and spear thrusts to which residents of the Territory have been subjected. America was lost to England by the blundering of British statesmen, who' tried to force upon American colonists taxation without representation, and laws in the making of which they had not been consulted. We should have regard to the experience of the Empire, and avoid these blunders in connection with the Territory. The Administrator of Papua, Judge Murray, has to deal with even more complex questions than those associated with the-Northern Territory, but although some of the traders may occasionally complain, we. do not hear of any trouble up there.",65

We cannot hope for success at once, or in all things perfection; but there has been evidence of probable success in lines in respect of which much condemnation was heard not very long ago. For instance, the Mataranka Farm, as a test station, is practically a success, and the Oenepelli Compound, according to a report which I recently gave to the papers, is able to show a profit. breeding of cattle there has been a cess, and dairying has also been successful, although about two years ago experipelled to spend valuable time. ments on these lines were condemned as among the follies of the Administrator.

I merely sucgive this as an instance of some of the matters upon which Ministers are comThere was a similar complaint, by some former dwellers in those regions, in regard to the Macdonnell Ranges.

Last Wednesday about 500 men assembled outside his residence, and asked him to come outside and address them. He was asked to give an account of his five years' administration or be prepared to leave by a steamer departing next day for the South, and remain out of the Territory of which he was an-Administrator until a Royal Commission had inquired into his past administration.

338,Mr MCWILLIAMS,THE PARLIAMENT,"Franklin) [5.19], - I would like the Government to reconsider the sugar question in its application to the jam-making industry. Ifc is fully recognised now that the production of sugar for the present year is not He equal to the requirements of Australia, and that at least 25,000 tons of sugar, must be imported. This sugar can be landed in Melbourne, Sydney, or Hobart for about Â£15 or Â£16 per ton f.o.b., but the Government are charging the jam manufacturer Â£27 per ton. Surely they not anxious to make a profit out of the jam-making industry ? In the limited bime afc my disposal I shall give a few figures in regard to jam production. In 1915 there were 128 factories in Australia engaged in the manufacture of jams and jellies, employing 4,393 persons, distributing Â£326,440 in wages, purchasing Â£1,600,000 worth of raw material, and having an output valued at Â£2,417,000. It takes one ton of sugar to manufacture one ton of fruit into jam,, but while the value of apricots, peaches, plums, &c, is about Â£7 or Â£ 8 per ton the sugar is sold to the jam manufacturer by the Commonwealth Government at a price which is four times as great as the duty paid on the imported article, and that is nearly equal in value to the cost of the fruit utilized in the manufacture. By an award of an industrial Court the orchardists and the packers have just been called upon to pay increased wages. If the Government do not wish to make a big profit on the sugar which they are imof about Â£15 or Â£16 per ton f.o.b., why should they charge Â£27 per ton for it t We are not dealing with the sugar produced in Australia. In this connection we are dealing with sugar that must be imported to make up for the defieiency in the local production. But the Government will not allow the manufacturers to import sugar for themselves. They prefer to import it and, apparently, make a profit of Â£10 per ton, including the duty, out of it. I ask Borne Minister to make a note of these facts and endeavour to treat the small fruit-growers of Victoria, Tasmania, and New - South Wales more liberally, otherwise they will be driven off the orchards on which they have spent thousands of pounds.

I pointed out that the Department of Repatriation had agreed to appoint committees of employers and employees to-value the work done by those returned men who have been given positions in various factories, and that although the organizations had appointed their representatives, the committees had not been called together. If we can interest the fellow employees of these returned men in this way we may possibly be able to give them the best of training.

It was asserted in a letter I quoted-and I believe the statement is true-that the'value of the work done by returned soldiers is such as to justify the employers paying 80 per cent, instead of 40 per cent, of these men's wages.

342,Mr BAMFORD,THE PARLIAMENT,The honourable member said that some of the unions were hostile - to returned soldiers.,69
343,Mr TUDOR,THE PARLIAMENT,"No , that statement is toot correct; on the other hand, they have appointed representatives to act on these committees. Mr Bradshaw was representative of the Trades Hall Council on the committee in this State, which resigned the - other day. The organizations are far from being hostile to the returned soliders; they are very anxious to do the best they can for them; but they have not been called together, and the Minister who represents the Minister for Repatriation has not said a word about the matter.",69
344,Mr GROOM,THE PARLIAMENT,I have already taken steps to report to the Minister for Repatriation. ' Mr TUDOR - I trust that the matter will be placed upon a proper basis.,69

346,Mr SPEAKER,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY," As already intimated, I have had under consideration for some time the granting of a small bonus to the lower-paid employees of this House. The Treasurer has agreed to make available an amount from his Advance Account, which will enable me to pay to cleaners and messengers who have dependants, and are in receipt of less than Â£204 per annum, a bonus of Â£10 each in the case of males, and Â£ 5 each in the case of females. This bonus is not to be regarded as a precedent; it is granted in recognition of the unusually high cost of commodities during the last twelve months, owing to war conditions.",69
347,Mr TUDOR,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,Will the gardeners participate ?,69
348,Mr SPEAKER,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"I am referring to only those officers of the House over whom I have direct control. The gardens are controlled by the Joint House Committee, of which the President of the Senate is Chairman. Quite recently, on account of war conditions, the gardeners received an increased rate of pay. WAR SERVICE HMS BILL . SECOND READING.",69
349,Mr GROOM,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"Darling Downs-Minister for Works and Railways and Acting Attorney-General) [5.35] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. The Bill covers a promise made some time ago by the Minister for Repatriation (Senator Millen), when he stated that the original Act was not to be regarded as the last word upon repatriation. He still had under consideration various proposals, and amongst those was a scheme for the building of homes for returned soldiers and sailors. The necessity for this Bill arises from the fact that it is exceedingly difficult at the present time, particularly in New South Wales, to obtain dwelling-houses."" The object of the measure is really to provide homes and acquire land for homes, in contradistinction to what may be termed the land settlement portion of the repatriationpolicy, although it is quite possible under this scheme to acquire a home, surrounded by a small area of land, which may be of some assistance in .making the burden of life easier to the. returned soldier. The general application of the scheme will be to all returned soldiers, sailors, and nurses. The measure will apply only to such soldiers as are defined as "" eligible,"" and as the home idea is the .vital principle in the Bill, an eligible person is defined as an Australian soldier who satisfies the Commissioner that he is either married, is about to marry, or has dependants for whom it is necessary for him to maintain a home. Others who may benefit are the female dependants of soldiers, and they are defined as being the widow of an Australian soldier, or, in the case of a deceased Australian soldier who was not married, his mother, provided that she is a widow and was, prior to the enlistment of the"" soldier, dependent upon him, or that her husband is so incapacitated as to be unable to contribute materially to her support. In regard to the general scheme of administration, it is proposed to appoint a Commissioner who, subject to the-Minister, shonld be responsible for the administration of the Act. He is to hold office for a term of seven years, at a salary of Â£1,500, and he will be removable from office only upon the conditions set out in the Bill. These provisions indicate the character of the person whom we desire to get for this position. He must be a man of high qualifications, because large responsibilities are to be intrusted to him in connection with the acquisition of. land and the erection of houses. Provision is made, also, for the appointment of an Acting Commissioner' in the event of the suspension, absence, or sickness of the Commissioner, or the vacancy of the office. The staff will not be governed by the provisions of the Public Service Act; that is to say, officers will be appointed to hold office during pleasure only. Civil servants, however, who may be appointed to assist in the work of the Commissioner will have their rights as members of the Public Service preserved. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT/-Will the Commissioner's office be a branch of the Repatriation Department?",70
350,Mr GROOM,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"It will be a separate branch, working under the Minister for Repatriation. There will still be the Controller doing the general administrative work of the Department of Repatriation, but there will be also the Commissioner appointed under this measure to carry out this housing, scheme. The Commissioner will be expected to utilize the existing agencies of the Commonwealth and the States wherever possible, in order to avoid duplication and unnecessary expense. The first power of the Commissioner will be to acquire land for the purpose of erecting, homes. The land may be acquired from private owners, or, with the consent of the Minister, any Crown land of a State may be acquired. The land acquired may be vacant land, or land upon which buildings have been erected. Very wide discretionary powers are given to the Commissioner, but there is a limitation that land, or land and buildings, exceeding Â£5,000 in value shall be acquired only with the approval of the Minister. All lands will be vested in fee-simple in the Commissioner. In regard to the erection of dwellings, he may call for tenders or have the buildings constructed in any way that he thinks advisable, but the total cost of any dwelling-house erected or. acquired, together with the land, is not to exceed Â£700. Commissioner may ascertain that in some suburb a large area of land may be acquired, and he will have authority to purchase the land, subdivide it , and erect dwellings thereon, either on applications made or in anticipation of applications. In some of the more populous centres, such as Sydney and Melbourne, the Commissioner may find it cheaper, when he knows there is likely to be a number of applications in excess of those already received, to let a contract for the erection of a number of cottages, and to obtain all his building materials on a wholesale basis. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - This really means a system of standardized cottages.",70
351,Mr GROOM,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"That is the idea.' The Commissioner is given power to sell to any eligible person who is riot the owner of a dwelling-house within Australia or elsewhere. This scheme being for the benefit of returned soldiers, and such female dependants as come with in the definition, the Commissioner can sell only to them. The sale will be upon prescribed terms, and the price must not exceed the capital cost to the Commissioner of the dwelling-house and the land. The land may be sold either with or without a deposit. If the soldier or sailor is able to pay a deposit there will be a transfer of the land and the building to him, subject to a mortgage to secure the balance of the purchase money. If he has no money with which to pay a deposit there may be a sale of the land to him, t u t it will be in the form of a lease-purchase agreement, the title remaining in the Commissioner.. The land will be leased on a weekly tenancy, for which a rental will be charged sufficient to cover interest at 5 per cent, of the capital cost of the property, insurance, rates, if any, 'repairs, and such sum towards the reduction of the purchase money as the Commissioner may think fit.",71
352,Mr BRUCE,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,How repayments shall be made will be at the absolute discretion of the Commissioner?,71
353,Mr GROOM,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"-Yes , as to the rates and amounts. It will depend on the The nature of the home. There will be a scale, and tables will be prepared in the usual way. When a sum equal to one-fifth of the purchase money has been paid, a transfer, to the purchaser may be effected, and the land will be vested in him, subject to a mortgage. He will thus become the registered proprietor of the estate, subject to this mortgage.. The Commissioner has power to advance money to eligibles within the definition. Advances must be for the purpose of erecting a dwelling-house on land owned by a soldier or sailor; or to purchase land and erect a dwelling-house on it ; or to purchase a dwelling-house, together with the land on which . it is erected; or to complete a partially-erected house owned by the soldier or sailor; or to enlarge a house owned by him ; or to discharge any mortgage, charge, or encumbrance already existing on such a house. The money borrowed must be expended upon the property on which it is advanced, and on which it will be a first charge.",71
354,Mr JOWETT,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,Could a man get an advance upon a home which was unencumbered and use the money in his business?,71
355,Mr GROOM,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"No ; these advances are given only to help soldiers and sailors to acquire homes. Assistance for the carrying on of a business must be applied for under the general scheme of repatriation. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - If a soldier has a home and dispossesses himself of it , will he be debarred from taking advantage of the provisions of this measure?",71
356,Mr GROOM,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"The intention is that every soldier and sailor shall have an opportunity under this B i ll to get a home. Suppose a man has got into difficulties, and. has had to sell a home acquired independently of this scheme, there is nothing to prevent him from applying to participate in its benefits - Under the Bill , however, money can be borrowed only for the purpose of making a home.",71
357,Mr LECKIE,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,Does the Bill cover the case of . a man possessed of a farm who wishes to erect a dwelling-house on it? ,72
358,Mr GROOM,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"A man possessed of a few acres can apply for a loan for the erection of a home on his land, but it is intended to keep this scheme_quite apart from the land settlement scheme. The advances may be made in instalments, and their purposes, are determined by clause 23. The Commissioner cannot make an advance unless he is satisfied that the dwelling-house in respect of which, or for the purpose of which, it is applied, is intended to be used by the applicant as a home for himself and his dependants, and that neither the applicant nor his wife, should the applicant be married, is the owner of any other dwelling. The conditions of the advance are specified. The Commissioner is to be satisfied that the house, when erected, will be a substantial dwelling, and that the plans and - specifications comply with the prescribed conditions set out in the regulations, and the plans and specifications must be approved by him. Further, the Commissioner must be satisfied that, having regard to the locality. in which the house is proposed to be erected, the risk is a reasonable one for him to undertake. In all eases where advances are made, there must be a mortgage executed to secure it , and the property must be unencumbered by any previous mortgage or charge. There are certain general conditions which apply both to sales and to advances. In the first place, the Commissioner is not bound to make a sale or advance to every eligible person. Before he makes an advance, or executes a contract of sale, he is to be satisfied that the returned soldier or sailor has a reasonable prospect of carrying out the terms of the contract, or repaying the advance. That is an' ordinary proper business precaution. terms of repayment which are applicable to mortgagees and to sales, may be made either weekly, fortnightly, or monthly. They will depend entirely on the terms contained in the contract of sale or governing the advance. Where a dwelling house is of brick or stone, or material . of similar durability, the l if e of it is set down at thirty-seven years, and the l if e of a wooden building is set down at twenty years. The life, for instance, of a mixed wood and stone, or wood and. brick, or wood and concrete building is to be fixed at the discretion of the Commissioner, but is not to exceed thirty seven years. Persons, on making a contract, may give a deposit, ""which will be treated as a deposit bearing interest, and the accumulated interest will be taken into account in the final settlement. The rate of in terest is not to exceed 5 per cent. The property will be held by the purchaser on certain conditions. GeneTally speaking, as long as there is money owing by the purchaser or the persons to whom an advance has been made, the property in. respect of which it is owing must be kept in good aud tenantable repair, to the satisfaction of the Commissioner, who, should there be default, has the necessary power to step in and protect it . While money remains unpaid, the soldier or sailor who owes it is prevented from sub-letting the property on which it has been advanced, except with the consent in writin g of the Commissioner. But as in Australia persons find it necessary to move about a great deal, the Commissioner is empowered to permit sub-letting. It may be found desirable to exercise such a power in cases where a man finds that he has to leave his home to go elsewhere to get work.",72
359,Mr LISTER,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,Would such a man be precluded from applying for assistance to establish another home in another district?,72
360,Mr GROOM,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"Each person eligible under the Act will have one chance, but one chance only.",72
361,Sir ROBERT BEST,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,What will happen when a man has paid off the money adThe vanced to him?,72
362,Mr GROOM,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"The Commonwealth will then have done its duty in providing for the home. So long as an advance or mortgage remains unpaid, there is a l i m it on the righ t of transfer.",72
363,Sir ROBERT BEST,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,Can a man pay off at any time?,72
364,Mr GROOM,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"Yea . So long as any land or dwelling is subject to the contract of sale, mortgage, or other security, the transfer will not have any force or effect. If a man has paid for his land, then, of course, as I say, the Commissioner has done with him. At the same time, there are some transfers that will take place by the operation of law, where a man goes insolvent, or dies, and the prqperty descends. In addition, a man may arrange with the Commissioner to transfer his land to an eligible person, but he will not be allowed to transfer except oh prescribed conditions or in cases of hardship.",73
365,Mr LECKIE,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"If an eligible man in the city desires to go to the country, may an exchange be made?",73
366,Mr GROOM,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"I am sure the Commissioner will facilitate any arrangement of the kind, so long as it is bond fide. When it is the case of a proposed transferee who-is not eligible, and it is within five years after the making of the advance, if it is proved to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that the - refusal thereof would induce great hardship, the Commissioner may consent to a transfer; but after five years consent to the transfer is under such conditions as are prescribed. As regards default, in a case where it is a matter of three months, the Commissioner has power to sell; but I wish honourable members to bear in mind that there is a relief clause in the latter part of the Bill . Clause 44 enables the Commissioner, in cases of hardship, to extend the period under such conditions and terms as he may think fit for the payments required under the Act. That is a very proper clause, enabling relief to be given. Insurance of the property is required By clause 38, the purchaser or borrower has to take out a policy, and it is proposed that the Commissioner shall have his - own insurance f u n d . It is believed that there will be a sufficient number of persons and homes under the Act to justify a fun d of the kind being established. For the purposes of the scheme a special fund known as the War Service Homes Trust Fund is to be created. It will be supported by the sums of money which come from loans under Acts to be passed by Parliament from time to time; by certain moneys which are to be appropriated out of revenue and paid into the f u n d ; re-purchase moneys realized in cases where the Commissioner sells properties; and any moneys received in payment of loans. As against that fund there will be debited all those moneys which are paid out for the purpose of acquiring land, for loans by way of advances,, or expended on the erection cf buildings and on the salaries of the Commissioner and staff, and all other payments, excepting those relating to in surance. ' In conclusion, I wish to refer to one other clause. I may say incidentally, however, that the Bill refers to the Northern Territory, and the Commissioner is enabled to deal with leaseholds in accordance with the .Territory Ordinances. I particularly desire to call attention to clause 49, which indicates one of the most important methods by which the Commissioner proposes to carry out the Act. That clause provides1. The Commissioner may with the consent of the Governor General arrange with any State Savings Bank or any other prescribed institution to provide homes for or make advances to eligible persons upon such terms and conditions as are agreed between the Commissioner and the bank or institution. 2. Particulars of every such arrangement shall be laid before both Houses of the Parliament within thirty days after the making of the arrangement, or, if the Parliament is not then sitting, within thirty days after the. next meeting of the Parliament. Several of the Savings Banks have now already in existence staffs which are engaged on an exactly similar class of work as that proposed by the Bill . Instead of setting up staffs, wherever it is possible to take advantage of the experience of those - State institutions, it is proposed that the Commissioner shall do so. By way of illustration, the Minister for Repatriation (Senator Millen) has given in his remarks in the Senate one or two illustrations of howthe system of repayments will work. In the-case of a Â£600 brick house, with a life of t h i r t y seven years, the scale of repayment works out at 13s. 6d. per week with rates and insurance, and, with a twenty-six years* period, at 15s. 4d. A wooden house, at Â£500, will work out at about 15s. week.",73
367,Mr CONSIDINE,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,As against 13s. 6d. for a brick bouse?,74
368,Mr GROOM,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"Tb e honourable member the will see that in the case of the wooden house the period is twenty years, whereas in the case of a brick house it is thirtythat seven years.",74
369,Mr RODGERS,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"A house at Â£600 or Â£700 built now will, two years hence, be altogether a different proposition.",74
370,Mr GROOM,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"The men will require houses"" immediately, and the Commisand sioner must do his best with the at his disposal; the mere fact that timber, and so forth, will be cheaper two or three journed. years hence is no justification for not assisting the men as soon as possible. How many will take advantage of the scheme it is impossible to forecast. are about 70,000 soldiers here already, and there are to come from 180,000 to there 200,000. A great many of the men are single,- and some are married with families, while a certain proportion have homes already, and no doubt there will be others who do not desire to have Many have been killed, but their dependants are here, and we may have to provide homes for them.",74
371,Mr CONSIDINE,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,I suppose the provision of homes is irrespective of whether men are married or single?,74
372,Mr GROOM,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"The homes are for those who are married, or are going to be married, or who have dependants for whom it is necessary to provide homes.",74
373,Mr CONSIDINE,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,Is there any specific time in which a man must be married?,74
374,Mr GROOM,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"I think the Commissioner will be able to get sufficient satisperial factory evidence to satisfy him on that J oint; at any rate, that is a matter of etail, which I can hardly discuss on the second reading.",74
375,Mr LIVINGSTON,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,To have to pay 13s. 6d. per week will be hard on many of the men.,74
376,Mr GROOM,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"It will be cheaper than paying rent for a corresponding house, for it means only 5 per cent, on the, outlay. per Mr LYNOH - Is there any power to purchase houses already erected?",74
377,Mr GROOM,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"Yes ; the Commissioner hasthat power, but the limitation is Â£700 for the individual home. I submit Bill in the hope of seeing it placed on the statute-book before we rise for Christmas. It is a big housing scheme we are initiating to provide homes for a large number of men over the whole of the continent.

379,Mr WISE,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"Gippsland-Assistant Minister for Defence) [6.12] - I move That this Bill he now read a second time. This is a Bill to simplify dealing with what may be called the military estates of deceased soldiers. In many cases, the estates of deceased soldiers consist only of their military pay and personal effects in the control of the Department. In such cases, the practice of the Department has been to follow the provisions of the Regimental Debts Act, an Immeasure, so far as it is considered applicable. We have been in the habit, where the soldier died intestate, of communicating with the next of kin and paying over moneys in hand, and also handing over the effects to persons whom we believe, on the evidence submitted to us, to be next of kin. Where there has been some doubt, the practice has been to ask the Curator of Intestate Estates, or the Public Trustee, as the case may. be, to obtain administration of the deceased soldiers' estates; but, even in these cases, the Curator or the Public Trustee hasasked us for indemnities against any mis take that might be made in paying over to the beneficiaries on the information we supply.",74
380,Mr FENTON,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,Will this Bill apply in every case?,75
381,Mr WISE,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"U o ; only in cases when we deal with the estates, or ask the State officials to deal with it . Of course, in cases where the wife or next of k in has thought fit to take out letters of administration in the State where the deceased was domiciled at the date of death, no - trouble has arisen; but, in many cases in ' which we have endeavoured to avoid administration, .and have handed over small amounts of money and personal effects, we have subsequently found ourselves called upon to make good claims made under wills subsequently found. In other cases where we have asked the Curator to administer, he has called on us under our guarantee to' refund to him amounts he bas paid over when subsequently claimed by executors under wills. In one case, we paid over, I think, Â£60 odd to a widow, believing her to be the next of k in and the only person entitled, and twelve months after, a trustee company proved a will in which the - money was left to the deceased's fatheT. He made a claim on the Curator, who called on us to pay under our indemnity, and we had to do so. this Bill is to clear up any doubt as to the Imperial Regimental Debts Bill being applicable to the whole of the Dominions, and also to enable us to deal""wholly and solely with the military estates of deceased soldiers. It is provided in the Bill that""Military estate"" means- ' (i) pay, allowances, or other money due to a member by the Commonwealth ; and (ii) persona] property or effects in the care, control or custody of the military authorities at the time of the death of the member or which come into such care, control or custody aftertlie death of the member. It is to enable us to pay over any money due to the deceased, to his personal repre1 sentative, or to any person "" who, in the opinion of the prescribed authority, is beneficially entitled thereto, or to such persons or classes of persons as are prescribed."" There is also in the Bill a provision' ito exempt the Department from liability for past action. Clause 6 provides thatNotwithstanding anything contained in any Act or - State Act the Commonwealth shall not be liable to any notion, claim, or demand in respect of anything done in connection with(a) the disposition of a military estate in pursuance of this Act; or (o) the disposition, prior to the commencement, of this Act, of any property of a deceased soldier, in pursuance of the provisions of the Regimental Debts Act; or (c) the disposition, prior to the commencement of this Act, of any property of a deceased soldier, which, if this Act had been in force at the time the thing was done, would have been in accordance with the provisions of this Act.",75
382,Mr RODGEKS,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,That clause is practically to indemnify the Commonwealth in respect of past actions.,75
383,Mr WISE,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"It is retrospective. Under another provision, if the Curator acts in a case .at our request and. has a surplus in hand which he cannot dispose of, the Government may call on him to return it to the Commonwealth. As to any unapplied military estate, it is provided that- Where it appears that there is no person to whom the military estate of a deceased The object of member may be paid or delivered under section 4 of this Act, the proceeds of the estate shall be applied, as prescribed, to the creation or maintenance of any prescribed fund for the benefit of persons who are or have been members or dependants of members. We have decided that in such circumstances the proceeds of the estate shall go to the Repatriation Fund.",75
384,Mr GREGORY,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"In the event of a blunder by a departmental officer, leading to the proceeds of an estate being handed over to the wrong person, would the Department, under clause 6, be relieved of all responsibility? Mr ""WISE - Yes . In that case the next of k in would suffer. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - If a departmental junior clerk made a mistake, as the result of which money went to the wrong individual, would the next of kin, under this clause, be debarred from recovering from the Department?",75
385,Mr WISE,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,Yes . Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - That would he very cruel.,76
386,Mr WISE,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,".This Bill will grant relief to many beneficiaries who cannot now obtain money which should properly go to them. As a lawyer, I know of such cases. In a Queensland case the Curator was asked to administer the estate of a single man. In such circumstances, under the State law, the father was entitled to the .proceeds. The deceased's brothers and sisters could not prove the death of the* father, although it was morally beyond doubt that he was dead, and the money lies today in the hands of the Curator, and will ultimately go into the State funds. If this Bill had been in force, the money could have been paid over to the brothers and sisters of the stand. deceased who were the only persons entitled. There was no moral doubt as to the father's* death. He had gone to Western Australia on the discovery of gold there, and although his death could not be proved, there was no doubt that he was deceased.",76
387,Mr SAMPSON,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,The Bill may be sound so far as particular cases are concerned; but why should we have this general indemnity ?,76
388,Mr TUDOR,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,What about the position of fathers who have deserted their families ?,76
389,Mr WISE,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"There are many cases in which the father, of a family who has cleared out, leaving the mother to rear the children, is entitled to claim. There ate many cases in which a boy has gone to .the Eront and has died intestate, and where we have been asked by the mother to pay over the money that was coming to him - On asking for evidence of her widowhood, we have been told that the husband is alive, but has not contributed a penny to the support of his wife and family. In such circumstances, we cannot pay the mother of the deceased soldier a penny. The Curator takes over the estate, and if the father hears of what has happened he comes in and claims.",76
390,Mr TUDOR,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"He always does, and very often he is a waster.",76
391,Mr WISE,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"Yes . My knowledge both as a lawyer and as a member of this House convinces me that this Bill, if passed, will enable justice to be done in many deserving cases.",76
392,Mr RODGERS,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,The general indemnity in clause 6 would not impair the right of the lawful beneficiary to recover from a person who had wrongfully received.,76
393,Mr WISE,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"No. In one case, as ' I have already stated, we paid over the money coming to a deceased soldier to his widow, who was living in England. Twelve or sixteen months later a trustee company in Melbourne proved the will of the deceased, in which he left everything fco his (father, and ignored his wife. The trustee company Called on us to pay over the amount involved-Â£60-and we had to do so.. That was a case in which we had. done an act of simple justice, but on the will being subsequently proved, an action could not",76
394,Mr RODGERS,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"The Minister does not 1 seem to have provided in clause 6 that reasonable care shall be taken by the Government to ascertain the true beneficiaries in every case. . Mr Wise - The claimants in each case have to fill in a very elaborate form, setting out the names offcherelatives and the position of the deceased. In very few cases is it possible to fill in every clause.",76
395,Mr BRUCE,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,Coul d not the Minister so amend the clause so as to provide that it shall apply except where the Commonwealth has been guilty of oarelessness or negligence ?,76
396,Mr WISE,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"t do not think there would be any objection to the insertion of those words. There has been some doubt as to whether the Imperial Regimental Debts Act applies all over the Dominions and it is really to remove any doubt, so far as the application of that Act to Australia is (--oncernedj that we have introduced this'Bill.. The-estates of soldiers who have died in the Old Country bave been administered there under the Regimental Debts Act, and the Home authorities hold the opinion that that Act applies throughout the Dominions. If we do not pass this Bill we shall leave the beneficiaries, in the case of the intestate estates of members of the Australian I m perial Force, exposed to many troubles.",76
397,Mr RODGERS,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"I sympathize with the object which the Government have in view, but the Bil l should provide for the exercise of reasonable care.",77

400,Mr SAMPSON,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,What authority would advise the Department before the. actual distribution of the proceeds of such an estate ?,77
401,Mr WISE,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"When we ask the Curator to administer he takes action under the law of the State, and calls upon the claimants to prove that they are the next of kin. In the case to w h i c h . I referred a few moments ago, the Public Trustee of Queensland asked the brothers and sisters of the deceased soldier to prove that their father was dead. There was no moral doubt as to his death, but no legal proof of it , and the result is that the money in the estate, which might have been very helpful to the claimants, who were in a humble position, will ultimately be paid over to the State Government.",77

Upon which Mr HIGGS had movedThat after the word "" That "" there serted the words "" in view of the state finances and the just demand by the public and press for economy in Commonwealth penditure, the present is not an opportune time to grant a pension of Â£1,750 to any",79
416,Mr MATHEWS,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"Melbourne Ports) [8.15] - It is not because of any feeling entitled to a portion of his salary. against the present Chief Justice of the Commonwealth that I oppose the grantfor ing of this pension. He is a man who has filled 'a great public position in Australia, and has been prominently before the people for many years, and we feel that he is entitled to all honour and respect. He was a shining light in the political arena, and also as a Judge of the Supreme Court of Queensland, and of the High Court. I have watched his career for many years, and have regarded him as a highly talented lawyer and Judge, who has given what some people would regard as his best to the country. I have differed from him on many occasions, but that does not influence me in my opposition to the motion before the Committee. If the circumstances warranted the granting of this consideration to Sir Samuel Griffith, I would still think the amount was too large. But one cannot forget that when he accepted the position of Chief Justice of the High Court, there was a clear understanding that no pension attached to the appointHe has dra'wn a bigger salary than any other Australian Judge, and why a. pension should be granted to him, the and not to any other members of the High Court Bench, I cannot understand. to During my membership of this House, many men have left political life, and some of them have since died. Although they had been receiving the emoluments which attached to membership of this Parliament, and in some cases to Ministerial positions, some of them were in poor circumstances. Yet, though they had given their best to their country, there was no thought of granting a pension to them. I could enumerate twenty or t h i r ty men who are equally as deserving of a pension as is Sir Samuel Griffith. Although they had not advertised their impecuniosity, their circumstances were Bill well known. Their talents had been ema penployed with profit to the country in Federal and State politics. Their income was much less than that received by the be inChief Justice, and, in addition, they of the were subjected to demands upon their exresources, as all members of Parliament are, from which a Judge is immune. one."" The Chief Justice has not a large number of constituents who think that they are I have never refused in this House to vote increments to men who were receiving high salaries., I have recognised that there are established standards of what men in certain positions are worth; and if increments were due I have always voted for them, and in consequence have brought down upon myself a good deal of adverse criticism. Some persons think that the salary of the-King's representative is very large; but, although I would vote for the abolition of the position, I would not, while the position remains, support a proposal to reduce the salary attaching to it . A reduction of salaries will not effect in any way an alteration in our economic system. I , with many others, believe that the whole economic - system should be changed, so that pensions might be granted to all - men just managed to and women when they are compelled to retire from work. One understand a proposal being submitted to pay the old-age and invalid pensioners an allowance sufficient to maintain There is no pretence that the small penonly sion now paid to those people will port them; it is recognised to be only an aid. My view is that adequate prooffers. vision should be made by. the community for the old-age and invalidity of all and women after their working days over, because, whether they work their mind or with their hands, all tribute something to the welfare of community. It is quite possible that Chief Justice has been unfortunate investments- I should not think that is the case-and the Government may Â«- of opinion that it is not right that ex-Chief Justice of the High should spend the leisure of his old age without an income sufficient to maintain him in the state to which he has been I can save Â£500 per annum. accustomed. But no such consideration is shown in respect of other people. instance, old soldiers who have for their country, and by reason of that fact have been incapacitated earlier than they otherwise would have demands. been, are left to their own resources their old age. We hear of no proposal to give to them an increase in their pensions. Perhaps they have never had opportunity to set aside any money their old age or to keep them in the event of their becoming invalids. a well-known fact that 95 per cent, of Mr Mathews. the community have very little opportunity to save, and the most they can expect is that, with a fair amount of luck, they may possess a home of their own and be independent of the landlord. But no effort has been made to introduce a comprehensive pension scheme for the benefit of. the whole community. With the knowledge I have, I wonder at that omission. If I could think that this Bill was the forerunner of an extensive system of pensions to all aged and in valid people, I might be inclined to regard it more favourably; but we know that this proposal stands alone. In my electorate there a""re many people who for a number of years have exist. Many in ' years gone by may have been in comcould fortable circumstances, and lived - and dressed well. But as they grew older, especially if they were unskilled workers, them. and their muscular strength was their industrial asset, they were no longer supwanted, and now they are obliged to eke out an existence by taking any job that I have always regretted that our economic system permits of such men And bearing them in mind, I cannotare conscientiously vote to grant a pension with to a gentleman who has been drawing con- Â£4,000 per annum for fifteen years, and the had received Â£3,000 per annum in the the preceding ten years. I agree as to the i h need for paying our Judges adequately, that in order that the Judiciary may be kept be pure. But the salary which S^r Samuel Griffith has been receiving has been high an enough to secure that end. Many people Court are of opinion that a person drawing a large salary ought to save a good deal of money. Some of my constituents think They say that a man who has been a member of For this House for fifteen years, and has not fought made a competency, must be thriftless, and it is a peculiar fact that those who in life expect one to save mpst make the heaviest Surely, if a member of this in House is expected to save on an income of Â£600 per annum, after paying election - expenses, and meeting all the other dean mands that are made upon his resources, for how much more should a man' be-expected to save out of an income of Â£4,000 per It is annum. Knowing that the Chief Justice has been drawing a large salary for many years, and that he was appointed on the understanding that he would receive pension, those honourable members who vote for this Bill will be adopting a course that is not justified in the circumstances. Of course, this Bill is a legal method providing such a pension; but the prowhen posal is not fair to the rest of the munity. Whilst I have the highest opinion of the gentleman for whom this pension is proposed, I know there are hundreds of thousands of men and women pendency on him. who have never had an opportunity to save a penny, and who require mained pensions but do not get them. earning Before a woman of sixty years of age can obtain a pension of 12s. 6d. a week, we insist that she shall prove that her husband is not earning Â£ 2 a week. If he is earning Â£ 1 17s. 6d. a week, she can get a pension of only 2s. 6d. a week. Similarly, a man of sixty-five cannot a pension of 12s. 6d. unless he can prove that he is not earning more than amount, and has not put by for a rainy day. Under these circumstances, we should not give a pension to the Chief Justice without requiring of him the claration that he is in an impecunious position, and would not be able to live he left the Bench. At any rate, should be asked what his position is, and a pension of Â£1,750 would be too much, whatever the circumstances. I have feeling against the Chief Justice, but think that, while we are niggardly topersonally, wards those who have never had an opportunity to make any provision for their old age, it is not fair to grant pension, to a man who has always drawn a large salary.",79

Until the country recognises the worth of its toilers, and provides for the time when they can no longer be usefully employed by placing them above want, I shall not vote for the payment of pensions to officials who have always drawn big salaries. I get many letters of complaint about our pensions law. Recently, a gentleman in my electorate was refused a pension because he happens to have acquired a house.

Then, there is the case of. a lady in Broken Hill , who - has an invalid son of about seventeen and a paralyzed husband. The son, who has to be moved about by mechanical means, was in receipt of a small invalid pension, but the amount was regulated by the fact that he had a father living. As I say, the father is now paralyzed, and the lady told me a month ago, when asking me to try to secure a {pension for her husband, that unless something was done she would have to disown her child, and hand him over to the State. All who read the newspapers must know of such cases as those cited by the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) the other night; and only a day or two ago we had that awful He case in Fitzroy, where a woman had to say wheel her dead child, and abandon him under a tree, because slie was too poor to bury him.

They are thrown on the scrap heap-ther e is no talk of a pension of Â£ 3 3 odd a week for them. All honour to the Chief Justice for obtaining the position he did ; but he was well recompensed with a magnificent salary for any services he rendered to the Commonwealth. It has been pointed out that during the period he occupied the position of Chief Justice of Queensland and the Commonwealth he received in return something like Â£87,000.

I the same with the honourable member interjected; he talks about brain capacity, but he might just as well have directed his question to his present leader (M Hughes) some twenty odd years ago, when that gentleman was walking about the country without a decent suit of clothes to his back. He might then have twitted the present Prime Minister with want intellect, though now he is willing low that gentleman as leader today. The workers I have been talking about question ? may have far more brains than either myself, the honourable member for . yong (Sir Robert Best), or the Chief Justice, but they lack the opportunities quire education and so enable themselves to occupy highly-paid and honoured positions in the country, as the Chief Justice [364] has done. If these workers are robbed of these opportunities, they, like the poor carpenter of whom I have spoken, have to stick to whatever occupation they are following, and when they become old they are asked, "" Did you earn Â£ 5 8 10s. last year?"" If they have earned more than that sum then they are refused the paltry 12s. 6d., though they have helped to pay the Chief Justice's and, in doing so, if they happen to miners, have run the risk of f all i ng rocks, pneumonia, lead and other diseases inseparable from their occupation.

If such a man, or his wife, or sister, happens to get a job,.they are put through a humiliating examination as to how much they have paid for their clothing, their tobacco, or their newspapers when they seek decent wages. All this humiliation for the man who creates the wealth of the country, but nothing of the kind for the Chief Justice, or those of his class. This is but the forerunner of other proposals of the same character. If the Chief Justice is entitled to a pension, it will be said that other occupants of the High Court Bench should receive' a pension upon their retirement, and so we are to be saddled with this added burden. I referred this afternoon to a gentleman who is on the salaried list of one of our public Departments, and who, in the absence of the Prime Minister (Mr . Hughes) is looking after his' constituency. There we have yet another instance of the truth of the saying, "" That to those who have shall more be given, and the country shall pay."" Honourable members know of these things. No solid reason has been given for the payment of this pension only that Sir Samuel Griffith has a long list of scholarly achievements and that he occupied a high position in the political life of Queensland prior to his elevation fco the Bench. I do not claim to be. able to pass judgment on the services he has rendered the Commonwealth, but as the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr . how Maxwell) has said, he has been well paid-and paid according to the agreed terms of his contract-for the work done by him. Contrast his treatment with that meted out to men and Women in our factories and workshops. There are nopensions for them, when they are no longer able to work. Take again'the case of the Broken Hill miner. When his system has run down, or he has broken up, does his employer say to him, "" You have worked for me for eight or ten years; you have done good work, and you have been paid the wages that were due, but now fchafc you are no longer able to work I will pay you a pension."" Nofc at all. If he cannot do his work it is a case of "" U p the shaft,"" and his job is given to the next man. And so in every calling with the exception Of those in the higher walks of life. The Chief Justice, having obtained the best that could be-given him . is now told that the Commonwealth will pay him a pension of nearly Â£34 a week. It is a scandalous outrage on justice. There is no excuse for it ; and the working men and women of Australia will justly resent this attempt to further load the country with an unnecessary and unwarranted liability.",84
442,Sir ROBERT BEST,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"Kooyong) [ 9 . 4 ] - I fail altogether to follow' the arguments of the honourable member for Barrier (Mr Considine) who has just resumed his seat. Our statute-book clearly indicates that the Commonwealth Parliament has at all times been alive to the necessities of the whole community, and has ever been animated by a desire to deal out even-handed justice. The legislation of the Parliament proves that. I regreb that this Bill has afforded honourable members an opportunity to cast reflections upon one of the most eminent men who has ever lived in Australia. He has rendered to Australia services which seem to be unappreciated by character. some honourable members. In order to show the immense responsibility that cast upon our Judiciary, may I refer honourable members to the Commonwealth Constitution. Under section 51, the highest and most accurate Federal Parliament is empowered to make laws covering some thirty-nine subjects which in that section are enumeratedgravity In ordinary colloquial language, the bare statement of the subjects with which we may deal has but a small meanacumen ing. Following the example of the United States, the subjects in respect which we may legislate are merely enuone merated in the Constitution, and there cast upon the High Court the responsiof bility of determining the full scope and width of our powers to legislate in revices, spect of those subjects. In other words, the Judiciary has the responsibility clothing the words employed and of deprovided fining the ambit of jurisdiction in regard to each of such subjects, giving to them their f u ll meaning. The Federal Parliament, for instance, have power make laws with respect to ""defence,"" and the luminous judgment on the subject dea livered recently by the High Court affords the honourable member for Barrier an opportunity to realise the meaning that may be given by the Court to that word. The Court held that the one word "" defence"" used in that secwhen tion gave Parliament power fco late with respect to every sphere of activity which could be directly or indirectly associated with the dewhether fence of Australia and the Empire. This illustration, which might be extended to him. the other thirty-eight subjects mentioned [364]- 2 in section 51, shows how great is the responsibility cast upon the Commonwealth Judiciary. We were singularly fortunate in our selection of a Chief Justice, and in considering this Bill I desire that honourable members, iÂ£. possible, shall consider for a moment the value of the services rendered by Sir Samuel Griffith. He is some not only an eminent Australian lawyer, but is recognised as an eminent Imperial lawyer, and is a member of the Privy Council. His judgments have been able and powerful, and of the most luminous They have indicated on his part a breadth of thought and juristic is learning of immense value in the guidance of this community. Were it possible for us to fail in securing the judicial interpretation of our laws, it would be a calamity to the community, the of which could hardly be estimated. It is absolutely necessary that, we should have men of the highest legal and ability in the occupation of our Judiciary, since such immense reof sponsibilities are cast upon them. No challenges the Chief Justice's ability. is Every one should realise the magnitude his services, and if we recognise to the full the colossal character of those sersurely we have a right to say that they entitle him to some further acknowof ledgment, in the form of a pension as by this Bill , at the hands of thecovered people of Australia. It has been suggested that the Chief Justice has been well paid for his services. to I do not agree that such is the case. True, his appointment took the for m of contract, but no one with a full knowledge will venture to say that the services he has rendered have' been adequately rewarded by the salary of Â£3,500 one a year which he has been receiving.",84
443,Mr MAXWELL,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,He did not suggest he accepted the appointment that legisit was not an adequate salary.,85
444,Sir ROBERT BEST,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"Quite so; but it is within the .ambit of our power to say that salary is an adequate compensation for the services rendered by We are at liberty to review the position in the light of the work he has done for us. There is no legal right as between the Commonwealth and Chief Justice under which he could demand a higher salary than he is receiving, or a pension.",85
445,Mr MAXWELL,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,He could have demanded the provision of a pension before he accepted the appointment.,86
446,Sir ROBERT BEST,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"That is so. His appointment stands as a legal contract, and he is receiving all that Parliament bargained to give him. To say that, however, is to view the matter from a very rigid stand-point, and to ignore the fact that the services actually rendered have surpassed our highest anticipations at the time of the contract. Surely in his declining years we may review his ser- â vices, and determine whether it is not reasonable to grant him some further compensation. This is, I admit, an act of grace; but the services of the Chief Justice warrant us in awarding him this extra compensation. We admit that he stepped out of the position of Chief Justice of Queensland, which carried with it a salary of Â£3,500 a year and pension rights, in order to accept the higher position of Chief Justice of the Commonwealth. He saw fit to give up that position and to accept the Chief Justiceship of the Commonwealth, with the same salary attaching to it and without any pension rights. * Mr SAMPSON - He did so highest sense of duty.",86
447,Sir ROBERT BEST,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"From the highest sense of duty, and because of the opportunity which his new position would give him for a greater career, and to render greater service to Australia. Those were the animating causes. not moved to accept the Chief Justice"" ship of the Commonwealth because of any paltry, sordid consideration. The one thought animating him was whether in this position he could render greater service to Australia. No one can suggest that he has failed to render that greater service. He has succeeded to the very full . Australia is richer for his workand richer to a greater degree than we can calculate. If so much is admitted, then it is not an unreasonable act of grace on the part of Parliament to grant this pension to Sir Samuel Griffith.",86
448,Mr CONSIDINE,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,The same argument will be put forward for granting a pension to Mr Justice Barton and all the other High Court Judges when they retire.,86
449,Sir ROBER TBEST,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"It is of the highest importance to Australia that we should have upon our Bench the greatest legal ability obtainable. If the payment of pensions would enable us to secure that ability, I should be ready at once to vote for them, believing that it would be in the interests of Australia.",86
450,Mr MAXWELL,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"Does the honourable member suggest that, in the event of this pension not being granted, and the position of the Chief Justice becoming vacant, the services of the best man at the Bar in Australia would not be available to fill the vacancy? , Sir ROBERTBEST - They might or might not be available. We shall have great difficulty in securing another Sir Samuel Griffith.",86
451,Mr MAXWELL,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"But the pension will not secure him. If he is there, he will come.",86
452,Sir ROBERT BEST,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"As a matter of fact, in some cases we are aware that the fact that a pension attaches to an office is an operating cause in inducing some men to accept certain positions; but it was hot an operating cause in Sir from the Samuel Griffith's case. He had already behind him a great career, and he desired to render additional service to Australia. He has succeeded in doing so, and now, after sixteen years, we are reviewing his services, and assessing the value of them. We wish to show him that we appreciate, He was to some extent, the value of those services, and that we are anxious that, in his declining years, he should experience a degree of leisure and comfort. By passing this Bill , we are simply doing our duty; we are doing nothing beyond barely acknowledging the work that Sir Samuel Griffith has done, and rewarding him for the valuable services he has rendered to Australia.",86
453,Mr FENTON,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"Maribyrnong) [9,17]. - I wish to give one or two reasons why I shall record my vote against the grant-"" ing of a pension to the Chief Justice of our High Court. In the State of Victoria the granting of pensions to public servants was abolished by Parliament in the early eighties, and it was provided that any person entering the State Service and occupying a permanent position in it should take out a life insurance policy, and maintain the premium payments year by year, so that when he reached a certain age he could, draw a lump sum of money from the insurance company. In the early days of the Federal Parliament, when in both Houses there were many eminent men in the political and legal world of Australia there was a great consensus of opinion against the provision in the Judiciary Bill fo.r payment of pensions to the Justices who would be appointed to the High Court. There was an extended debate upon the matter, but neither House would consent to the provision. It is an undoubted fact that many gentlemen of the legal profession who are elevated to the Bench surrender practices at which they have been earning twice the amount they receive as salary, for the high and honourable positions they occupy as dispensers of justice in OUT Courts. It only shows that when these positions of honour are open to the legal world, there are ""men, eminent in their profession, who are pre-' pared to give up highly remunerative practices in order to occupy positions on the Bench. It is strange that at this late stage we should find before us so many advocates for the granting of a pension to a member of our High Court Bench. We are all anxious to eliminate personal matters in considering this question; but it seems to me that the Ministry could have overcome the difficulty without seeking to place on our statute-hook a principle that will form a dangerous precedent, and may land future Parliaments in considerable difficulty when efforts are made to Teward the eminent services of other Justices of the High Court Bench. There was no pension attaching to the position of Chief Justice fifteen years ago, when Sir Samuel Griffith accepted the post. Since then he has been drawing a magnificent salary, which should have enabled him to make provision for himself, without any necessity arising for the submission of a Bill to Parliament having for its purpose the granting of a pension to him equal to half his present salary. . Are honourable members opposite, who are willing to support this Bill, prepared to apply the same principle throughout the community ? Are they prepared to give a man who has been drawing Â£150 per annum during his best years a pension of Â£75 a year in his old age? If a man has been earning Â£300 in his best years,are honourable members willing to reward him with a pension of Â£150 per annum so that he may enjoy himself in comfort in his declining years? I do not think the so. Yet if they are prepared to give a reward to one man who has done his task faithfully and well, they should be ready to carry the same principle into effect, and reward every citizen according to his ability and the services he has rendered to his country. Otherwise, they are not consistent. I see no reason why our Justices should not have made provision for their own .declining years. Some of them would decline to accept pensions from us, no matter how unanimous we were in our desire to make provision for them. On the other hand, there are others on the Bench who might look forward to receiving them. Many men have died in poor circumstances, but yet, because of their inventive genius, have left rich heritages to humanity. Have we rewarded them ? I remember one man who worried himself into a premature grave through giving his country the benefit of his invention, but nothing was done to help him. His wife also went to a premature grave, and his family have had to toil very hard, and overcome' great difficulties. As I am reminded by an honourable member, this country gave no reward to Farrar, whose researches enabled Australia's wheat production to increase to a wonderful extent, and whose efforts stimulated others to follow up his work until, step by step, a grade of wheat has been produced here that induces one to believe that very soon we shall be able to garner fair harvests with a very small rainfall. One could go through a long list of men whose services fco the nation have not been rewarded. Have we rewarded men who have discovered rich gold-fields where have found employment] I venture to say that if a proposal came forward in this House to reward such men, it would be ridiculed by the very honourable members who will vote for a pension for the Chief Justice. We have all known men who have died almost in poverty. What is the pension given by the Commonwealth to men and women who have rendered very valuable service to their country ? We dole out to them able pittance of 12s. 6d. per week. I agree with the honourable for Barrier (Mr Considine) ought to recast our ideas. is a beginning, we should set to work in earnest and apply the lessons-we have learnt during the war. It needed the war to make the statesmen Britain realise what inroads the factory system and slum life had made on the population of the Old Sociologists and others have known in the wealthiest country in the world, with a population - of 40,000,000, no less than 14,000,000 people are living below the poverty line. We require a levellingup system. All honourable members opposite are prepared to do is to pick out here and there some distinguished vidual, and deal with him with exceptional liberality in his declining whilst they make it a struggle for other people to get a dole of 12s. 6d. per week. Honourable members know how hard it is to live on an ordinary wage. If a workman loses a week's work through he is rarely able to make good the loss, especially if he has to keep a family. life is a veritable struggle. If honourable members intend to give pensions to men who have been enjoying large salaries, let them treat persons in other walks of life in the same liberal fashion. pose honourable members read the report of the recent trial of a workman who had been detected in stealing certain articles from the workshop in which he was employed. Week after week he had stolen and sold goods to the total value of Â£13. When he was brought up for trial before the Chief Justice of Victoria (Sir William Irvine) he pleaded guilty. Asked why he, the head of a family, a man in reguMr Fenton. lar employment, and with a previously thousands clean record, had resorted to stealing, he said-and his statement was corroborated by reliable witnesses-that in order to buy boots for his children he had been tempted to sell certain articles belonging to his employer. The Court was so satisfied of the genuineness of his statement that he was liberated on simply entering into a bend. That proved conclusively that, although the man admitted his guilt, the Court regarded him as a reputable citithe miser- zen who was fit to resume his place in the world. Does not that indicate a sad meml-er state of affairs? In this land of plenty that we there ought to be no men and women out If this Bill of work.

On prinHis ciple, I could not vote to give a pension of Â£1,750 to a man who, I admit, has eminently well discharged the onerous and responsible duties that he has been called upon to perform. I know nothing I sup- of the antecedents of Sir Samuel Griffith. It may be that he had exceptional educational opportunities in his youth; he certainly had a fine brain, and displayed gifts which we are all delighted to find in any walk of life. But, on principle, and because so many people find it hard to live-because , although they have fought life's battle u n t i l they were sixty-five years of age, they have not been able to save sufficient to maintain themselves in fcheir old age. and this Parliament has made it difficult for them to get a pittance of 12s. 6d. per week- I am opposed to the granting of this large pension. The time is coming when the people will be educated enough to sweep these unfair distinctions aside, and those who advocate, the continuance of them will not have the remotest chance of finding a place in this Parliament.",88
457,Mr FALKINER,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"Hume) [9.38] After the very able remarks of the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best), it seems hardly necessary for me to add anything to this debate. I listened with sympathy to the tale of woe related by the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton). When we leave this chamber at night the tears almost stream from our eyes at the sight of masses of people, with every appearance of poverty, coming out of the theatres and picture shows. Those people have my sympathy. I regret that this pension proposal does not apply to all the Judges of the High Court. I think it is a pity that the pension of a Judge should be left to the whim of any Parliament or party. If , as honourable members say, men eminent in the legal profession should, out of a sense of duty, make great monetary sacrifices in order to occupy a position on' the Bench, why did honourable members raise their own salaries? Why did they not regard it as an honour and a duty to serve their country at Â£400 per annum, instead of increasing the salary to Â£600?",89
458,Mr CONSIDINE,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"Because , I suppose, they were not all poor pastoralists like the a Judge. honourable member.",89
459,Mr FALKINER,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"Not having the reputation of being "" a poor pastoralist,"" my Â£600 is absorbed by the soldiers and others who are in need of it. But that is my affair. Men who are qualified to take positions on the High Court Bench have ample scope in the practice of their profession, and they make a big monetary sacrifice in accepting a judicial appointment. I do not see why a man should be required to make sacrifices, because he is willing to do his duty. That is not right or reasonable. The Judges of the High Court were appointed at salaries about equal to the income of a second-class barrister in the Criminal Court. The salaries are not high enough, and should be supplemented by pensions, so that the best men may be attracted to the positions. If we do not do that we shall some day see some servile political hack appointed to the Bench. The Judges who receive Â£3,500 per annum are required to visit all the capital cities in the discharge of their duties, and that entails the maintenance of two homes. To some extent, Judges must live a life of isolation, and they have not the time that an ordinary man has to pay attention to their financial affairs.",89
460,Mr LYNCH,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,It is not well that they should be making investments in any case.,89
461,Mr FALKINER,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"iSurely , because a man is a Judge, he should not be debarred from investing his money.",89
462,Mr CONSIDINE,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,Why do not the Judges practise the thrift about which they preach so much? ^ Mr FALKINER - No doubt they do. There are very few business men who do not practise thrift to a greater extent than their employees. I repeat that Judges of the High Court must practically maintain two homes.,89
463,Mr MAXWELL,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,Do they not get a travelling allowance?,89
464,Mr FALKINER,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"They do; but that allowance will not cover everything. The travelling allowance may pay .the honourable m ember when he goes to Ben alia to defend a sheep stealer, but it does not pay Mv. TUDOH - Fou r guineas per day is a fair travelling allowance, surely.",89
465,Mr FALKINER,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"Eve n so, the Judges are not as well paid as is the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, and, in comparison with the calibre of men required for Judges of the High Court, one could get dozens of men competent to manage the Commonwealth Bank. The High Court is the fountain of justice in Australia; we desire to keep it untainted, and to have Judges in whose ability and probity we can have complete confidence. We must make the positions worthwhile. Otherwise, second-class men may be appointed to the Bench, the Court will be ignored, litigants will go direct to the Priv y Council, and we shall be maintaining the Court for nothing. In regard to the pathetic pictures of poverty which have been painted by honourable members opposite, I remind the Committee that a man is paid according to the measure of his ability. There are some honest, moral, good-living people who do work which is worth practically nothing to the community. An under-gardener, for in stance, may give satisfaction to his employer by adding to the refinement of his surroundings, but the world would be none the poorer without his work. As a supporter of the Government, I urge them to introduce a Bill in the next session to give a pension to all the Judges of the High Court, so that they may be placed on that footing of financial security which is essential to the positions they occupy.

466,Mr TUDOR,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"Y a r r a ) [9.53] - The other evening, when speaking on the Appropriation motion, on which the Bill is founded, I said that it was wrong to grant a pension of Â£1,750 a year-that is Â£35 a week-to the Chief Justice of Australia, when the fathers and mothers of 1 the community who gave their sons to the country during the recent war, have been unable to obtain pensions. The M in 21 ister asked me for a definite case. I said AYES. that I had one which came to me in the absence of the honourable' member for Bourke (Mr Anstey). No doubt, similar cases have been brought under the notice NOES. of other metropolitan members who are doing part of his work. The letter, which I sent to the Pensions. Commission, in regard to the matter, was this:Mrs S., of Ivanhoe, is very indignant over the treatment she has received regarding her pension on account of her sons who have been killed at the Front. She had four sons there; two have been killed in action, and the third died last month whilst at sea. This lady made application in connection with her first son, and was told her pension would be 5s. per week. On account of her second son, she was advised that no pension was due. She does not feel disposed to take PAIRS. any action in regard to her third son, as she feels sure that her claim will be rejected, as in the case of the second son. You will see that this family has a splendid record, and the mother is deeply offended at the action of your Department. Mackay, G. H . I shall'be glad if you will have this matter reconsidered, with a view to offering the lady an increased pension. On receiving a reply from the Pensions Commissioner, I forwarded it on to the gentleman who was in correspondence with me about the case, and wrote to him a covering letter, in which I saidYou will remember writing to me regarding Mrs S., of Ivanhoe. I at once made strong representations to the Commissioner of Pensions on her behalf, and have just received the enclosed letter. She was receiving 10s. per fortnight on ac- your Bill. count of her first son, and nothing on account of the second one. I am pleased to see that she is to receive Us. per fortnight for each, one to date back 19th July, 1917, and the other from 22nd October last. She will, therefore, have a fair amount of back money to draw. I am very pleased 1 was successful on her behalf. It is not necessary to put on record the letter written by the father, a railway labourer, with a family of eight or ten children, four of whom went to the war, where two were killed, while a third died at sea. For many years, railway labourers in Victoria were receiving only 6s. 6d. per day, their wages being of late years raised to 7s. per day, and recently to 8s. or 8s. 6d. per day. Of course, there are many cases in which the parents are not dependent on the lads who went away; but had those lads"" returned, they would have contributed to the upkeep of the home. Yet I know of cases in which pensions have been refused to parents because their lads were only eighteen or nineteen years of age when they left Australia. Mr GROOM!-The honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) brought the matter up, and I have promised to bring it under the notice of the Minister.",90
467,Mr TUDOR,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"My experience of the Commissioner for Pensions is that he is a fair man, with a human heart, as no doubt all the officials are. These cases have only to be brought under his notice. The father's letter, in the case to which I have referred, is pretty strong. He says that the treatment he had received was not likely to encourage recruiting. I am glad that, as the result of my action, the family is getting a pension of 14s. per week, or 7s. for each of the sons who were killed. That is ""nothing to write home about""- a pension of 7s. for a son [365] Who has been killed is certainly not a subject for boasting. We were told the other day that the Bill passed by the Government of which I was a member fixed a maximum; but it is not a question of the maximum in the majority of cases; it is a question of bringing a number of people up to that rate.",91
468,Mr GROOM,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,The law is the same as in,91
469,Mr TUDOR,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"But I was asked for a definite case, and I am showing the difto ferent treatment that is meted out to two different, sections of the community. When the Judiciary Bill was before the House in 1903, the present Minister for the Wavy (Sir Joseph Cook), in the absence of Sir George Reid and Sir William MCMillan, moved to reduce the proposed salary of the Chief Justice from Â£3,500 to Â£2,500, because there was no provision made for a pension. The honourable gentleman was induced to withdraw that amendment, until it had been decided whether there should be pensions for the Judges. Parliament, by twenty-nine votes to twenty, representing a division of two-thirds of the House, decided that there should be no pensions, and the salary was then fixed at Â£3,500. This Bill is departing from the contract that wa3 then made with the people of Australia. We pay pensions of 5s. to 7s. a week on account of sons killed at the war, whom no power on earth can replace, and this Bill proposes to give the Chief Justice a pension of Â£1,750 a year. I shall vote against the second reading.",91
470,Mr BRENNAN,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"Batman) [10.3] - I am opposed to the Bill, and will vote against the second reading. I take the view that the making of grants to any member of the Public Service, or to any other person, in an arbitrary way out of the public Treasury, is to be deprecated. The policy of granting gratuities or making donations to persons because of their public services, or their alleged public services, without any settled principle to guide those who are responsible for doing so, does not appeal to me. Bearing in mind the question of pensions to the aged and the invalid, I contend that the only ground on which pensions of any kind are justifiable in a civilized and progressive community is to make provision for those exceptional cases of sickness, invalidity, and weakness which cannot be provided for by any just system of distribution of the world's good things. I say this quite recognising the fact that it may be suggested for a moment that I am giving only half-hearted support to old-age and invalid pensions. I give those pensions a full measure of support, because they represent just those exceptional cases for which any civilized community must make provision, even though the wealth of the community were distributed with ideal fairness. It seems to be assumed that the Chief Justice of the High Court has claims of unanswerable character to recognition in the form of a pension. Apparently it is taken for granted that his public services, taken alone, are of such a character that they should, if I may put it so, in the evening of his days be the subject of some special recognition. I challenge that view at once. I do not admit for a moment that the services of the Chief Justice are necessarily of a specially distinguished character. I admit that the Chief Justice is, and has been for many years an eminent lawyer, who, by his training, and by his capacity, was likely to make a success of his work, and, probably, to amass a fortune out of his earnings. But I do not admit for a moment that, as a citizen of the country promoting the best interest of the community, his work has been such as to recommend any special or, at all events, any monetary recognition. The Chief Justice came into his office from the political arena.",91
471,Mr HIGGS,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,There is a suggestion that he was given the position in Queensland in order to get him out of the way in politics.,92
472,Mr GROOM,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,That is a very unworthy suggestion.,92
473,Mr BRENNAN,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"- I heard that chapter of the political history of Queensland from the honourable member for Brisbane, and there may be something in it. j but I am not at present concerned with that aspect of the case. I am not going to attribute any unworthy conduct to the Chief Justice, nor am I going to. attribute anything but the highest motives to him in the discharge of his public duties as Chief Justice. But I venture to say that, coming to his office out of the arena of politics, he brought a cast of mind to bear there which was certainly a keen and logical mind, but which, so far from breathing life, as the Minister has said, into the dry bones of the Constitution, rather tended to dissect and analyze those bones than to vivify them with any new life whatever. When I say that, I am not for a moment, as a humble member of the lower grade of the profession, putting alone my own view of his work - I am holding up, in comparison with his public services, the work done by other eminent men on the High Court Bench. I take courage to say, with the knowledge we have of their work, and the interpretation that they have fearlessly given to the Constitution, and to constitutional points of law brought before them for their decision, that there are men on the High Court Bench today - and we are likely to have other men to succeed the Chief Justice-wh o will follow the pattern of the great Chief Justice of the United States, and will breathe into this Australian Constitution, whether amended or not, that humanizing interpretation which could never be drawn from ""the decisions of the academic mind of the present Chief Justice of the High Court. A somewhat amusing and painful suggestion has been made by, I think, the honourable member for Henty (Mr Boyd), that a Judge, although eminent in law, may possibly have such meagre business capacity as to fail, though drawing a large salary, to make adequate provision in his life for his later years. If it is a fact that the Judges of the High Court bring to beai* such a small measure of worldliness into their work, and are so equipped mentally that they are to be regarded as deficient in making adequate, reasonable, and lawful provision for themselves and their families, I think it is a very disquieting disclosure as to the calibre of the High Court Bench. The Minister is making a personal matter of this, although honourable members, whom I have heard speak, are agreed that it should be regarded rather as a matter of principle, in which i vidious distinctions should not be drawn between the various holders of this high office. The Minister gave us what sounded painfully like a "" somewhat premonwealth vious "" obituary'of the Chief Justice i extolling his manifold virtues, and even his scholastic performances.",92
474,Mr HIGGS,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,It reads like a Clement's Tonic testimonial.,93
475,Mr BRENNAN,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"V e r y much so. But whatever may have been the performtaking up public duty, made ances of the present Chief Justice, at school, in the University, at the Bar, in politics, he has up to the present able to say that, whatever he has won who lie has won by his own effort and his ability; and he has not been behoven the State for any special gratuity to make up, as is suggested by some honorname able members, for his deficiency in business acumen. I remind the House, though probably they have been repersonal minded already, that when the Chief Justice renounced the position of honour and fairly substantial emolument which he held in Queensland to become the of pecuniary benefit. Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, he enjoyed all the kudos, and adopted all the praise, which liim by reason of the fact that he was giving up a position which would have entitled him later on to a the pension. I venture to suggest that it is unworthy to ask the Chief tial Justice, and it is unworthy Justice, in the language of the Bill , to "" demand "" a pension-because , curiously enough, that is the verbiage adopted-in . sacrifice. view of the contract lie then made with the people of Australia, the terms on which he was appointed, and the fact; fchafc he enjoyed all the honour and distincrecalled tion of having made some monetary sacripromising fice in connection with the acceptance of the position. It is pointed out, of course, that in many of the"" transferred offices, the persons transferred carried with them their pension rights. That.is true ; but think the general tendency of Australian legislation for many years past has to abolish the pension system altogether. We know that for many years- I should say nearly thirty-the system has been abolished in Victoria. The system has ceased to be acceptable to the people n - this State, and the general tendency is to abolish the pension system, for public service. That being so, the claim that in 1918 the Chief Justice of the Comacquires any special right to n a pension by reason of his being a transferred officer falls entirely to the ground, not only on its merits, but upon a reference to the terms on which he accepted the position - *.c- ' v There are many public men who, onfinancial"" sacrifices. Every one knows that thereor have entered this House men who werebeen making large incomes at the Bar, and! have sacrificed some of that own pecuuiary advantage in order to disto charge their public duties here.",93
476,Mr HIGGS,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,They could not make a in Parliament unless they did.,93
477,Mr BRENNAN,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"Not without some sacrifice of their private in comes. I could name examples of where distinguished lawyers, on entering this House, have made substantial sacrifices",93
478,Mr FENTON,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,The late member for Bendigo (Mr Arthur ) was a member came to of our party who did so.,93
479,Mr BREMNAN,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"Yes ; but unfortunately the House and the country lost distinguished service of that barrister before he was able to make any substansacrifice of the kind. Unhappily, he of the Chief was taken from us.",93
480,Mr FENTON,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,Eve n in the short time that he was here he made some pecuniary,93
481,Mr BRENNAN,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"No doubt,' and I am glad that the honourable member has the name of .that brilliant and personal friend of my own. The honourable member for Hume (Mr . Falkiner) adopts a principle that we should be prepared to hold out this special ' inducement to members of the Bar to beI come Judges, otherwise we shall fill the offices of our highest judicial tribunal been with ""second-raters."" If a man who is earning at the BaT more than Â£3,000 per' annum is still so animated by the greed and lust of gold, that he cannot be persuaded to give up his additional financial of gain in order to accept the position of a - Judge with a salary of Â£3,000 a year, together with all the honour, distinction, - and dignity attaching to the office, that - fact discloses him to be a person whom it is well to keep off the Supreme Court benches. That is a complete answer to the honourable member's contention. There is, moreover, a counterargument, and it is this: that men who are earning at the Bar up to Â£3,500 per annum are exceedingly hard worked. No man can earn such an income without working very hard. I have in mind the case of a barrister who was earning a very large income, but was working so hard that his health threatened to break down. When an opportunity presented itself of taking the more moderate emolument attaching to the position of a Supreme Court Judge, together with the additional attractions to which I have referred, he had no hesitation in moving up to the Bench. I do not believe that the absence of a pension will prevent our having the services of the very best man at the Bar. I should be sorry to think that men of high standing at the Bar were of such a cast of mind that they would decline to make a financial sacrifice in order to go on the Bench. The numlber of even - eminent lawyers who are making incomes equal to the salary received by our Chief Justice is very few. The number, I think, is often exaggerated. I have no doubt whatever that their services could be obtained for the Judiciary in return . for the emolument offered. At a time like this, when the whole of the efforts and genius of this Parliament should be directed",93
482,Mr HIGGS,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,As far as the Standing Orders will permit.,94
483,Mr BRENNAN,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"As far as the this Standing Orders will permit, to a more economical administration of public Deceived partments - at a time like this he when we are faced with the necesto sity of doing a full measure of divided justice to the men who have fought for us, and of considering their - paramount claims, and those of their relatives and dependants- I venture, without hesitaamount. tion, to say that there is an act of political indecency in the proposal to award a gratuity of this kind. . It does not establish a principle; it is not offered by way of principle. This pension is offered as a gratuity to a public servant who, having, perhaps, treated the State well, as far as he could, has been well treated by the State, and who, to my mind, has not anything like as strong a claim upon the special beneficence of this country as have thousands of others who could be named, but whose claims are not considered in the ""Bill before the House or any other Bill.",94
484,Dr MALONEY,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"Melbourne) [10.23]. - A point to which I should like to draw attention is that this Bill does not provide that the Chief Justice shall spend his pension in Australia. In the early days of Victoria, Sir Andrew Clarke, after about four and a half years' public service, and the Right Honourable C. E. Childers, after something like three and a half years' work in this State, were granted a pension; and they lived thereafter for close upon half a century in England. They continued during that time to draw pensions from a people whom they never benefited, but upon whom they fastened like leeches. These pensions, amounting to about Â£800 per annum in the one case, and to some Â£600 in the other, were granted to them because it was thought they had risked their chance of advancement in accepting high posts in the then young Colony of Victoria. To show how absurd was the reason given for their payment, I might mention that Mr. Childers rose to the position of Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Gladstone Government. Let us analyze the figures relating to pension. During twenty-five years on the Bench, Sir Samuel Griffith has reabout Â£82,000. In round figures, has received Â£70 a week, in addition his share of the Â£5,000 per annum amongst the Judges to cover expenses. I do not know whether the Â£4 4s. per day to which they are entitled by way *of travelling expenses is included in that By the terms of this very measure, the Chief Justice becomes an old age pensioner; but he will draw as much as fifty-three pensioners under our Old age Pensions Act receive. I resent that. All men when they have reached a certain age, and have' become too old to work, should receive the same rate of pension. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Tudor) has referred to the pitiful case of the mother of four sons who went away to fight for the Chief Justice, for me, and for every other citizen of Australia. One of these hoys paid the supreme sacrifice, and the mother was granted a war pension of 5s. per week. The pension of the Chief Justice is equal to the pension received in 134 such cases, and equal to sixty-seven war pensions of 10s. per week. Will any one say that what this man has done is equal to the services that bave been rendered by our men at the Front. Then, again, under our War Pensions Act differential treatment is meted out to the mother who has been deserted by the man who should have cared for her. It was not the intention of Parliament when the War Pensions Bill was passed that there should be any BUCII differentiation, but it exists today. Then, again, in determining what rate of pension shall be paid to the mother of a young man who has been killed at the Front, the authorities take into account the amount that the deceased contributed to his home for twelve months prior to enlistment. Many of these soldiers of ours enlisted when they were only eighteen years of age, and that is very often the most expensive time of a boy's life. As a rule, boys of from eighteen to twenty-one years of age can take very little into their homes, but when they reach the age of twenty-five years they are able to give substantial help to their people.",94
485,Mr BRENNAN,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,This would have been a fitting opportunity to make provision for the unmarried mother of a soldier whom the honourable member and I have referred in this House more than once.,95
486,Dr MALONEY,BONUS TO PARLIAMENTARY,"Yes . I am proud to think that the laws of Australia no longer contain what was an impertinentward insult to thousands of innocent children. Thanks to Mr Andrew Fisher and those who supported his Government, the word warning note. "" illegitimate "" has been erased from all our Commonwealth laws: It is an infamy [366] that the amount to be .paid as a war pension to a mother or father of a youth killed at the Front should be based upon the amount he was able to contribute to her support for the twelve months before he enlisted. If the assistance to the home be made a basis of computation, why should it not be made at the time of the death of the brave soldier ? I have no personal animus towards the Chief justice. . I . have, if anything, a kindly feeling for him. I had one experience of his Court, and three afternoons spent there cost me something like Â£200. The cost would have been greater but for the generosity of the legal men in charge of my case. I have never heard a poor man bless the name of the Chief Justice or declare himself to be thankful for his help. Is he - a poor man ? Then my pocket is at his disposal. If he has speculated and been comparatively ruined, I am willing to give equally with any man on the other side of ihe chamber; but it is discreditable to him if he has had anything to do with' this sending round of the cap asking for the people's money. It is the people, those who have no say in the matter, who have to pay. I cannot conceive that the man who had the honour of translating Dante's Inferno into English verse similar to the original would stoop to accept this pension. At any meetings I shall address in the near future I shall move That it is disgraceful, dishonourable, and foolish on the part of Sir Samuel Griffith to accept this pension. We_have paid him Â£70 per week, with many extras, for putting in five hours' work five days a week, and sometimes he has had five months' holiday in the year. There are fathers of families who are to trying to feed their children and clothe them in these expensive times who are not .receiving per week, even what he draws per day as travelling allowance, namely, Â£4 4s. Would they not look forwith pleasure to the receipt of even one day's wages as a pension when they get old and weary. I have sounded a If Sir Samuel Griffith dares to leave this country drawing this pension to spend it outside Australia he will not be an honourable man. _ An y member of this House who goes away has to obtain leave, and if he wishes to go away from Australia, let him obtain leave from the people who pay him . I resent the granting of this pension. When we ask for 2s. 6d. extra per week for those who will never draw Â£4 4s. a week in all their lives, the Treasurer cannot grant it . When we ask that the little children of the men who have lost their lives at the Front, or in dangeroua trades and callings that sometimes take a greater toll of l if e than does warfare, should be allowed a little more than 3s. 6d. perweek,' they cannot get it . At this time, when the war has demonstrated to us the value of human life, this Government will make partial provision for soldiers' babies to the number of five in a family, but the sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth arc left without a penny piece in the shape of assistance. Go - to the homes for neglected children, and ask some of the angel women connected with them how much a child costs, even in its earliest years, even when its only food is milk, and then judge how far the pittance of 3s. 6d. per child will go. I shall vote against the Bill , and if -1 can get meetings to support ine I shall ask them to resolve that any man who has earned the salary that Sr - Samuel Griffith has earned-is not a real Australian or a real human being if he accepts a pension when those who have to apply for an old-age pension can only draw 12s. 6d. per week with which to keep life and soul together.
