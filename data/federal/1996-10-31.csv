1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. R. G. Halverson OBE) took the chair at 9.30 a.m., and read prayers. NA BILL (No.3) 1996 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Miles, and read a first time. Second Reading",13
2,Mr MILES,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (9.31 a.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The bill will amend the taxation laws in a number of respects. It delivers on the government's election commitments to provide a tax rebate for low income aged persons and allowing equity investments in SMEs to be taxed under the CGT provisions. In addition the bill implements 1996-97 budget announcements relating to the medical expenses rebate, sale of mining rights, cooperatives, infrastructure borrowings and research and development. Tax rebate for low income aged persons The bill implements the election commitment to provide a tax rebate to persons of age pension age who do not receive the age pension. To be eligible, a taxpayer will have to meet the same residency criteria as age pensioners and have a taxable income below the pensioner rebate cut-out thresholds. This measure builds on other assistance to older persons which the government has provided since the election including the reduction of the provisional tax uplift factor from eight per cent to six per cent for the 1996-97 financial year. As a transitional measure, the new rebate for the 1996-97 income year will be at a level equivalent to half the pensioner rebate for 1996-97. For subsequent years, the new rebate will be at the same level as the pensioner rebate. These changes will result in an estimated reduction in revenue of $10 million in 1996-97, $48 million in 1997-98 and $65 million in 1998-99 and the following year. Equity investments in small-medium enterprises The bill also implements the government's election commitment relating to equity investments in small-medium enterprises which was also announced in the budget. The provisions amend the income tax law to provide an incentive for lending institutions to make long-term investments in the small business sector. The changes will encourage banks to become equity partners in SMEs and help alleviate the debt-financing problems suffered by many of these businesses. The amendments change the tax treatment of certain equity investments from being on revenue account to being treated under the capital gains tax provisions. They will apply to investments made after 1 July 1996. Medical expenses rebate The government announced in the budget that the threshold for the medical expenses rebate would be raised from $1,000 to $1,500. The increase in the threshold applies from budget night, so that for the 1996-97 income year the threshold will be $1,430. Medical expenses in excess of the threshold qualify for a rebate at the rate of 20c in the dollar on the excess. As only medical expenses net of reimbursements from health funds qualify for the rebate, the increase in the threshold is consistent with other incentives announced in the budget for people to take out private health insurance. The increase in the threshold is expected to raise additional revenue of $26 million in 1997 -98, $23 million in 1998-99 and $24 million in 1999-2000. Sale of mining rights Another budget measure to be implemented by this bill concerns the sale of mining rights. The bill will withdraw the exemption from tax on income from the sale, transfer or assignment of mining rights for gold or other prescribed metals or minerals. Income from the sale of mining rights under contracts entered into after 31 December 1996 will no longer be exempt. The estimated revenue saving is $2 million in 1997-98, $20 million in 1998-99, and $40 million per year thereafter. Cooperative companies The bill implements the repeal of paragraph 120(l)(c) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 announced in the budget. The measures will prevent the effective 200 per cent tax deduction which was previously available for the cost of certain assets and which provided cooperatives and government lending institutions with commercial and taxation advantages over other companies. These advantages are not justifiable and are inconsistent with competitive neutrality principles. This measure will apply to government loans entered into after 7.30 p.m. eastern standard time on 20 August 1996 and to existing loans only where their terms are altered after this time subject to transitional arrangements. The first transitional arrangement ensures that certain loans to eligible cooperatives that were entered into after 7.30 p.m. on 20 August 1996, but on or before 31 December 1996, will remain eligible for the paragraph 120(l)(c) tax deduction provided the company has in the three years leading up to 20 August 1996 had a loan to which paragraph 120(l)(c) applies. This transitional provision applies if the loan was entered into for the sole purpose of acquiring a specified asset pursuant to: an authorisation given by the directors of the cooperative before 7.30 p.m. on 20 August 1996 (and recorded in the minutes of the co-operative) to acquire the asset, provided the authorisation to acquire the asset is in accordance with an approved business plan and the asset is contracted by 31 December 1996; or a contract that was entered into before 7.30 p.m. on 20 August 1996. The specified asset must be plant or articles for the purposes of section 54 of the act (other than a passenger motor vehicle) or an eligible building for the purposes of section 124ZF of the act. It must be installed ready for use by 30 June 1998. A further transitional provision applies where a cooperative has entered into a contract-which may include a verbal contractbefore 7.30 p.m. on 20 August 1996 to acquire an asset and has an agreement for the provision of finance before that time. In such a case, any drawdowns of funds under that agreement after that time for the sole purpose of acquiring the asset will be eligible for the tax deduction. The reference in these transitional provisions to an asset would include a group of assets within a particular project. The measure is expected to save the revenue $2 million in 1997-98, $4 million in 1998-99 and $6 million in 1999-2000. Infrastructure borrowings--amendments of the Development Allowance Authority Act 1992 The objective of the amendments to the Development Allowance Authority Act 1992 is to prevent certain types of schemes undermining the integrity of the infrastructure borrowings program by breaking the symmetry in the special tax treatments of the payer and receiver of interest. Such schemes enable indirect infrastructure borrowings to be made functionally independent of the financing of an infrastructure project thereby increasing the value of tax benefits to those involved and the cost to revenue without a commensurate increase in the funding for private sector projects. The amendments will give effect to the budget announcement designed to prevent those sorts of schemes from undermining the integrity of the infrastructure borrowings program. As was stated in statement 4 in Budget Paper No.1: 'If allowed to proceed, such schemes would substantially increase the value of tax benefits to those involved, and the cost to revenue, without a commensurate for increase in the funding for private sector infrastructure projects.' The amending legislation will require: new indirect infrastructure borrowings or refinancing infrastructure borrowings that succeed them to be made only by Australian resident taxpayers; and any transfer of rights by a direct infrastructure borrowing lender or repayment of a direct infrastructure borrowing, to be accompanied by repayment or parallel transfer of any associated indirect infrastructure borrowing or refinancing infrastructure borrowing that has succeeded the indirect infrastructure borrowing. The amendments, which will have effect from 30 October 1995, will not prevent infrastructure borrowings from operating in the way intended by the government to encourage the genuine private sector development of publicly accessible infrastructure. The amendments have the potential to prevent a future loss to the revenue. The amount of potential revenue loss is not quantifiable. Research and development activities The bill will also amend the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and the Industry, Research and Development Act 1986 to give effect to policy changes announced by the government on 23 July and 20 August 1996. The concessional deduction rate for R&D expenditure is being reduced from 150 per cent to 125 per cent and new syndicates are prevented from claiming R&D deductions. The R&D deduction rules for interest, core technology, pilot plant and feedstock are also being modified. The definition of R&D activities is being clarified. The tax concession for eligible R&D nevertheless remains generous. It allows immediate deduction or rapid write-off of expenditures which may otherwise be capital or deductible over longer periods. Even the reduced premium rate of deduction provides a considerable degree of concessionality. The bill amends the Industry, Research and Development Act 1986 to remove the ability of companies to register jointly for the R&D tax concession or, as it is more commonly known, to register a syndicate. Joint registration has facilitated arrangements that provide considerably greater tax benefits than the benefits provided to other registrants under the R&D tax concession. This level of tax benefit was clearly unintended. The government considers that quality R&D can be promoted effectively through other mechanisms, including the new START program, at lower cost to the Australian taxpayer. Other minor amendments to the Industry, Research and Development Act 1986 include the streamlining of grant provisions to make them more clear, and the introduction of a mechanism by which the minister can provide formal advice to the Industry Research and Development Board and its committees in an open and transparent manner. These changes will result in a gain to revenue of $59 million in 1996-97, $718 million in 1997-98, $630 million in 1998-99, and $840 million in 19992000. Tax exempt entities that become taxable The bill proposes to amend the income tax law to deal with transition issues that arise when previously tax exempt entities become taxable. The measures were announced by the previous government on 3 July 1995 and apply to entities becoming taxable on or after that date. The amendments will generally allocate income, gains, losses and deductions of an entity between its exempt and taxable periods. The amendments minimise compliance costs for entities that are becoming taxable. Deductions for post transition costs in respect of pre-transition leave, eligible termination payments, bad debts and superannuation are to be determined by reference to liabilities accumulated at the date of transition rather than by reference to the particular cost. The amendments are expected to be revenue neutral. Rebatable annuities The bill closes a loophole in the law that allowed the conversion of non-rebatable annuities to rebatable annuities and pensions. Amendments to the tax law in 1994 to allow the unused undeducted purchase price of a commuted superannuation pension or rollover annuity to be further rolled over had the unintended consequence of allowing amounts received on commutation or termination of annuities purchased with money outside the superannuation system to be treated as eligible termination payments-ETPs. These ETPs could then be rolled over into the superannuation system to purchase rebatable annuities and pensions. This rebate is intended to apply only to superannuation pensions and rollover annuities. Annuities that have not been purchased with amounts accumulated within the superannuation system should not be eligible for concessional taxation treatment that has been earmarked for genuine superannuation amounts. The bill will ensure that, subject to excepPeople tions designed to maintain the current treatment of some annuities purchased on or before 9 December 1987, only annuities purchased wholly from ETP moneys are treated as ETPs on commutation or termination and can be rolled over to purchase rebatable annuities and pensions. The measure will apply to annuities commuted or terminated on or after 15 June 1996. It is not expected to raise any additional revenue. However, failure to act to close the loophole would have posed a potentially significant threat to the revenue. Full details of the measures in the bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum circulated to honourable members. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr O'Connor) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1996 Second Reading Debate resumed from 30 October, on motion by Mr Abbott: That the bill be now read a second time.",13
3,Dr LAWRENCE,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"Fremantle) (9.48 a.m.)I rise to continue remarks that I began last night in relation to the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill. The bill increases HECS payments, it introduces differential HECS, it lowers the HECS repayment threshold and makes cuts to university funding. I think it is important, as I indicated night, that in examining these changes we look at the effects not only on individuals but on the community as a whole, something the government appears not to have done. It appears to see education, as I indicated last night, principally as conferring individual financial benefit, and therefore more appropriclassroom. ately funded by the individual, almost regardless of their ability to pay. I want to look briefly this morning, because I have only a few minutes, at the consequences that will be adverse both to individuals and to the nation as a whole. As I indicated, talent will be diverted from low paying occupations to high paying occupations. will obviously see that in the future they will not be able, for instance, in areas of science and research, to earn the sort of money that will enable them to clear the HECS debts, particularly now that science and engineering have been placed in the middle range-and expensive range at that-of the differential HECS. People will clearly be discouraged, too, from entering areas of work where a degree of public service and self-sacrifice is required but where the pay is poor, because the impact of the HECS repayments will hit hard over a longer period-for instance, on a lawyer who chooses to go into community or Aboriginal legal service as opposed to a private law firm. Law, of course, will be in the most expensive stream. But there are many lawyers, including members of my own family, who practise in low paid fields like community law, Aboriginal legal services and the like. In the future they will find there is a considerable personal financial handicap in doing that. Many will be discouraged from seeking entry at all to the universities because of anxiety about the substantially enlarged HECS debt, whatever strand they are in. I have a recent example, if members opposite think this is hypothetical, from a high school in my electorate, Hamilton Senior High School, which covers an area where there are a large number of people from non-English speaking backgrounds and considerable financial disadvantage. The school has worked very hard to encourage students to contemplate last university as an option following school leaving. In this case, a very bright young woman, judged by the teacher to be the brightest in the class, at the moment when the others were asked to go to put their preferences for university enrolment, stayed put in her seat in the When asked by the teacher why she was not going to enrol, she said, 'My family and I discussed it and we decided we can't afford that kind of debt hanging over our heads. We have never done it for any other reason and they won't allow me to do it now. I don't want to do it, either.' Fortunately, she was talked into enrolling, but whether when it comes to the crunch she actually goes is another matter. This is especially a problem for women who are already in the work force and for the so-called battlers that this government purports to care about who have no history of family indebtedness, let alone for education, and it is something that they will not contemplate now. There will be a lower threshold for repayment and that will force a lot of people, frankly, into poverty. They will begin paying their HECS debts below the poverty line. When you look at the child-care fee increases that we will discuss later today, that will be exacerbated. Enrolments in science and technology are already falling. The effects on the nation's skill base will be incalculable. The quality of education generally will undoubtedly suffer because of the cuts to operating grants to the universities. Choices are already being forced on universities that they do not like, to have to cut faculties and departments from their existing operation. So it reduces students' choice as well. Merit based places will be squeezed by the allowance of 25 per cent of places for those who can afford to pay. This is discriminatory and simply serves the wealthy. It will put us in the position of having one of the lowest levels of government, as opposed to individual, funding per student in the OECD. Some students will be paying more than 50 per cent of their course costs. This is higher than in the United States, where families start saving for higher education as soon as their children are born. We very definitely oppose this lation.",16
4,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"I approach the debate on the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill with some sadness. Right now the community of Newcastle are being bashed, buffeted and traduced by this government in one way or another, either by neglect or by deliberate policy. In the past I have not had as many people come to me after a budget with their individual problems, expressing how it is affecting them personally. In the months ahead, those opposite are going to find that some of the judgments they made in approaching government and in their period in government have laid a very bad basis. They will live to regret very much many of their actions. Throughout this budget session, we have been dealing with legislation about health, education and social security, which in theory is about those areas of activity, but which in practice is about something else. In practice it is about philosophy of government and the role of government in our society. It is about putting into practice an ideology that says that government effectively should not exist, that there is very little role for a federal parliament other than to raise taxes and for foreign affairs and defence. All the other functions should be transferred either to the states or to business. Speaker after speaker from the government side in this debate has referred to education as a business. Everything eventually seems to come down to a business-health is a business; education is a business. Everything seems to be put through a filter of business parameters. For me, education is not a business at all. It is a fundamentally important part of our society which the government is responsible for. The abdication of responsibility in transferring functions to the state or withdrawing from activities is an abdication of the greatest significance to this country. What we are seeing reflected in this legislation and this approach in many ways is poll driven and harks back 30 or 40 years to when education at universities was for a very small number-for the so-called elite. I well relegismember the differentiation between the eggheads-the academics, the ivory towerists, the very small number who went to university-who were never representative of mainstream Australia, and the so-called battlers. That is 40 years out of date. Nowadays university education is a natural, normal part of our society. It is not something special, different and elite. It is an extension of the education of our very talented population. Back in the sixties we were very lucky to be at universities if we could afford it. Many of us worked part-time and paid our fees in advance. We understood that the general community did not necessarily support that. Those kinds of attitudes in the sixties meant that by the eighties we were seeing school participation rates of 35 per cent. In the early eighties about one-third of our young people were staying on to year 12 to matriculation standard. That was an appalling figure. Why? Because the government of the day saw education as a function for the elite. It was not a function for normal Australians; it was a function for special people and, therefore, only had special privileges. The member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) in recent times said that it wasn't surprising that people who were wealthy had intelligent children. That amazingly elitist and circular argument was perhaps an unconscious expression of many of those opposite. They are still trying to tum us back to the days when education at university was for a small number of special people. Their speciality was not to do with their intellect or their ability. It was to do with where they came from. When I was a student, the vast number of students at universities were being paid for by their parents. If your parents could not afford to send you to university, you did not go-unless you got a scholarship, and there were not many of those. What we are seeing now is a shifting back. Many Australians will agree with this. Many Australians resent the fact that somehow their taxes are being used for personal gain by somebody else. That is that old attitude-the 'them and us'-to create resentment against this so-called elite. It is pretty obvious that most of those opposite do not visit universities very often and do not talk to students very much. If they did, they would find that students are not elite. They are not some group of special people who are going to benefit massively from education. The idea that schoolteachers are some group of elite is a nonsense. The salaries being paid to graduates nowadays are relatively minor. People are now forced to make a choicewhether to spend three or four years at university and forgo income, promotion and establishment in an organisation. That is now a major decision. In the past people had to weigh up the fact that they would have to forgo four years of income, which would mean that they would be behind before they even started. Now they have a debt on top of that. It has become quite clear that many people who do not see high incomes in their area of activity-whether it be in some of the community health fields or community service fields or even in teaching-have to decide whether it is worth their while to forgo those years of income and accrue a debt. The sums are very likely now to be against going to university. What happens then? As a society we de-skill. We tum away from education. If people think this might be an exaggeration, just look at the figures. Press reports indicate that the number of people seeking enrolment at Newcastle University this year will be down 10 per cent. Why? Why would a government want to do this? Why would a government want to deskill its community? Where is the benefit? What is being reported as a thesis? To educate them gives them a personal gain and therefore they should pay for it. As I have pointed out, for many people there will be no personal gain, or a very minor one, or the effects will be negative. Many people will go to university and not be successful for one reason or another-ill health or other circumstances-and they will end up with a debt and no income. For a family without a background of wealth, without a background of academic achievement, the attitude will be: don't take the risk; don't bother. Some have argued that because the previous government brought in the HECS, somehow we and the present government are like peas in a pod, that we are as one. It is important to clarify that position. Years ago, when we came into government, we started to understand that the skilling of our community was so limited that we needed to accelerate education at a much greater rate than other areas of activity. It became very clear that many taxpayers would resent the need to spend at a much higher rate on higher education, so we sought to balance the individual benefit against the community benefit and government responsibility through the introduction of the HECS. At the moment there is well over $3 billion in accumulated debt to government through the HECS from people at university or who have graduated from university. That debt is being paid back when people reach an income of, at the moment, $28,000, which is a reasonable income. That contribution allows the education sector to grow at a much faster rate than other areas of government spending. The failure of those opposite to understand that was exemplified in the comments made by the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) a few months back when she cast aspersions on the fact that higher education had grown 60 per cent. She asked why it should grow faster than roads and other areas of spending. That indicated her absolute ignorance. Education had grown at a faster rate because we had asked those involved to contribute. They had not wanted to-make no mistake. It was not the choice of students in those days to do that. But education, under our government, grew at a much faster rate because we had asked those involved to contribute via HECS. We did not regard it as a business or as some way of extracting money from those who would earn more, but as a contribution which, through a sense of social justice, would allow education to grow at a faster rate than roads and other areas of government spending. Those opposite saw this, to use the words of Senator Vanstone at that time, as some sort of pay-off by the Labor government to people who were Labor inclined. What a travesty, what an absolute disgrace for the now minister to have expressed those kinds of thoughts. We understood that if we were to compete in the world of the present and of the future we would need a much more highly skilled population. When we look at the way in which university graduates are utilised in our society-be it in accounting, hospitality or higher sciences-there is no doubt that the achievements of a much higher population of graduates are being felt. Comments have been made in recent times about the greater numbers of foreign language speakers-Japanese, Indonesian-particularly at university level. Their .impact has been enormous and is fundamentally important to building a base for our business people and traders. Then there is the fact that higher education is probably our single biggest foreign exchange earner, worth $2 billion a year. This country treats education as a commodity for sale but, because we have a very high standard, those who see it simply as a business somehow distort the situation. This government has achieved a pretty wonderful trifecta in recent times. Yesterday's balance of payments statement will not be the last of the bad economic news. The government has taken a healthy economy--one of the best economies in the world in terms of debt or any other factor you want to nameand talked it into a recession. I see that the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) thinks this is very funny. But yesterday's balance of payments was way over expectations. Growth in this country has dropped from 2.1 per cent in the March quarter to 0.1 per cent in the June quarter. Unemployment is increasing week by week. The long-term unemployed are increasing at 5,000 a month. This is very funny! The situation will not get any better; it will get worse. You know it and we know it. The jobs committee is a charade, created by the very people who are wiping out jobs. With this government we are seeing ideology running rampant, and the latest victims are students. Today's Sydney Morning Herald points out that one in five Australian students will suffer. Why? Because those opposite have never understood the problem and do not understand now. I want to mention the trifecta of problems that the University of Newcastle is suffering. Firstly, there is a 10 per cent reduction in those seeking to enrol there. From discussions in recent days with people from that university who work in the overseas market-passing the on what is happening in places like Singapore for the possible intake of students next yearthe message is a disastrous one. Without doubt, what is happening in Australia right now will affect Newcastle university's intake of students from Asia next year. Our income from overseas students might well go down and that will cost us jobs. Why? Because those opposite do not understand what they are doing. But they let these issues run on because they might be popular at the time. The fact is that cuts in university funding, changes to the higher education contribution scheme fees, massive changes to Austudy and, of course, the perception abroad that Asians are not welcome here will cost my community. They will cost us jobs and they will cost us opportunities. They will also cost us investment. It was said by a previous speaker that the government had introduced the proposal to raise the BEeS charges so as to make sure that people who were benefiting were contributing. The fact is that the changes proposed will mean that the cost of a law degree will go up. Yet the actual cost of teaching that law degree is much lower than a medicine or veterinary science degree, which of course are the other two degrees on the same scale. These fees are not about cost recovery. They are about a form of charging on a projected benefit. That may be well and good, but that is not about cost recovery. It is about taxation. In other words, the schemes are working in two ways. Firstly, they are a tax driven scheme. Secondly, they are a tax designed scheme in terms of the charges that are being imputed. It is about time the government came clean about that. The other thing that is going to affect fees is the lower threshold. The fact is that the government's proposal to reduce the threshold to just over $20,000 means that many of the part-time students in my electorate who are undertaking university courses-in many cases, they are relatively young people who are raising families, paying off mortgages and going to university as an attempt to broaden and strengthen their capacity for a future career and job satisfaction-will be paying off these charges as they go. Not when they get a high enough income to afford them, but when they reach $20,000. Many people in part-time work or on lower incomes who are trying to improve their circumstances by going to university will be paying these charges week by week, month by month. That was not what the scheme was about-ever. The fact that it has been pushed that way is indicative of the lack of understanding shown by this government. The lower threshold alone will be enough to discourage many people from improving themselves and learning new skills. What is the benefit of that? One has to look at the legislation and ask, 'What is its objective?' Like most of the legislation we are dealing with in this session, it is not about improving education at all. It is about finding ways to rip money off people who, in most cases, cannot afford it. We had the spectacle of the mlTIlster in Asia last week telling Asian leaders and those interested in Australian education that what was going on here would actually be of benefit. She said that Malaysian students and Asian students would find the universities of Australia better than before. What a lie. What a deceit. What a disgraceful thing to say. That is not the case, and she knows it and we all know it. What is more, the Asians know it. I do not know who she thought she was kidding, but the fact is she did not kid anybody. All of those things are telling us that the government want to tum back the clock. They want the universities to go back to being the location for the elite-because, after all, as the member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly) said, the only ones who are bright are those who are rich. So let them go to university. The government is saying, 'Let us tum the universities back to those days. Let us make sure the community out there understand that we are not really supportive of Asians being educated here.' As I said, my university is earning millions of dollars a year and employing people out of the fees being charged to people from Asia. But we have just told those people, 'Don't come. We don't like you.' What is more, the education centres are going to go down because the government is disinvesting. It is withdrawing funding from universities. That is a disgrace.

5,Mr ABBOTT,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"Warringah-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs) (10.12 a.m.)-in reply-In his contribution to the debate, the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) lamented the fact, as he saw it, that there were no intelligent conservatives left. Let me put it to the member for Melbourne and to other members opposite that this is highly intelligent, conservative policy making because this bill builds on the strengths of the existing system. It is the job of intelligent conservatives to reject change for change's sake while making necessary change palatable by stressing the enduring strengths and continuities of our system. The member for Sydney and the shadow minister for education and youth affairs (Mr Peter Baldwin) finds it easy to criticise but hard to be convincing, because what he is criticising is, in essence, a development and refinement of policies put in place, however reluctantly, by the previous government. Obviously, the fact that we are building on the former government's work shows that it was not all bad. The member for Melbourne and many members opposite have praised the work of Gough Whitlam for abolishing university fees in 1973. It is fair enough for them to do so. But, in praising the work of former Prime Minister Whitlam, they are criticising the work of the former minister for education, Mr Dawkins, and his prime ministerial bosses, Mr Hawke and Mr Keating. It was the Labor Party under Gough Whitlam which ended fees, but it was also the Labor Party under Mr Dawkins, Mr Hawke and Mr Keating which restored fees. If fees are a problem, we must blame the Labor Party, because it was the Labor Party which introduced fees in the guise of the higher education contribution scheme. Yet they had good reasons for doing so. The former Minister for Finance, Senator Peter Walsh, said: In 1985 we knew that 10 years of ""free"" tertiary education had not changed students' socio-economic background. Taxpayers were no longer subsidising education for the socio-economic elite; they were paying the entire bill. That is what former Senator Walsh thought. That is what the former government thought. That is the way the former government acted. If there is any problem with HECS, it should be sheeted home to the former government. The HECS system is a good system. It is a good system because it combines in a rather ingenious way elements of user pays with social equity. It has been very disappointing to find member after member opposite reopening the class war-a class war which should be dead and buried in this country. Certainly, it comes ill from members opposite to try to reopen the class war over a HECS system which their government introduced. The beauty of HECS is that no-one has to pay for their university education until they are in a position to do so. Let me very briefly run through the changes to the HECS system that the government is introducing in this legislation. Existing students pay the same HECs. Yes, we are lowering the threshold at which that same monetary amount is to be repaid, but it is worth remembering that the level at which former students will be required to pay their HECs is the same level at which the previous government thought people should be prepared to pay a substantial increase in their rate of tax. What we are doing is entirely consistent with the thinking of the previous government. Let us put the HECS repayments into context. A graduate who earns $21,000 a year will be paying HECs at the rate of $12 a week. That is the price of a movie ticket, a couple of packets of cigarettes or one round of drinks at the pub and that is the price of a university education. It is a very fair price indeed. A former student who earns $40,000 a year will be repaying HECs at the rate of $40 a week. That is less than the price of a restaurant meal for a couple. It is a very fair price for people to be paying for their university education. Even people studying medicine or law and paying HECs at the highest rate will find that their university education costs less than the price of a Holden car. In other words, the amount of money they are paying for an education which will be a productive asset for the rest of their lives, an education that will stand them in good stead for the rest of their lives, is less than the price of new Holden Commodore. Quite frankly, what we need to do in this country is to value our cars less and our university degrees more. Let me quote Neville Wran, who chaired a report which recommended not only the introduction of the HECS system but the introduction of differential HECS for people doing different courses. The Wran report said that 'considerable private benefits accrue to those who have the opportunity to participate'. The Wran report went on: Graduates typically get better jobs, experience little unemployment and earn relatively high incomes over their lifetimes, compared with nongraduates. When graduates commence employment, generally when they are in their mid twenties, their salaries compare favourably with the average earnings for all employees in the Australian workforce ... Neville Wran, the former National President of the ALP and the former Labor Premier of New South Wales, recommended in 1988that is almost 10 years ago-$3,000 a year for full-time students in medicine, dentistry, agriculture, forestry and veterinary science; $2,500 for a year for full-time students in engineering, surveying, science, applied science and health sciences except nursing; and $1,500 a year for full-time students in all other courses. So what the government is doing is taking up and implementing the recommendations of Neville Wran. There has been a lot of talk from members opposite about the alleged horrors of introducing full fee paying courses for some domestic undergraduates. Again we are building on the work of our predecessors. We are building on the work of the former Labor government, which introduced full fee paying courses for overseas students and which permitted full fee paying courses for local students doing postgraduate work. So we are building on the work of the ALP-nothing more and nothing less. We are taking the system it left us and we are further developing and refining the logic of that system. For members opposite to wax outraged about the existence of full fee courses for postgraduate students comes pretty ill. What members opposite are really doing is saying that postgraduate students, who in the case of a Melbourne university MBA earn on average $95,000 a year on completion of their course, should not be paying anything. So, according to members opposite, the taxpayers of Australia, rich and poor alike, should be subsidising people who are about to earn $95,000 a year. By allowing full fee paying courses for Australian students we are remedying a fundamental unfairness in the previous government's arrangements. The previous government allowed overseas students to buy very a place at Australian universities, but it would not allow Australians to do what foreigners could do. It was an unfair system. It should be changed and we are changing it. Let me remind the House exactly what we are doing. Sure, some Australian undergraduates will pay full fees, but this can only happen once all the HECS places in anyone course are filled. So this will be in addition to the HECS places, not in substitution of the HECS places. No university can offer fee paying undergraduate places before all its HECS places in that course have been filled. Fee paying places cannot exceed 25 per cent of the total places in any undergraduate course. This is clear government policy and we are absolutely, completely and utterly committed to it. Members opposite have cried crocodile tears over the alleged cuts to the higher education budget. Let us put it in perspective. Next year Australian universities will be receiving $56 million more from the taxpayers than they have received this year. Next year, the year after, the year after that and on into the future, Australian universities will be receiving in the order of $5 billion a year from the Australian taxpayers. That is the reality. The Australian government is completely committed to an excellent system of higher education. We are putting our money where our principles are to the tune of $5 billion or more every year. Let us consider what the academics say. As we know, the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee quite courageously has recommended to the Senate that the government's higher education budget package be passed. Professor Brown of the University of Sydney said: It is entirely reasonable that there should be a component of user contribution and that universities should be required to demonstrate the efficiency of their operations. I quote from a newspaper article what Professor Gilbert of the University of Melbourne has said: The Federal Government could cut university funding by 3 per cent this yearwe are not doing that, I hasten to addwithout compromising election promises, the ViceChancellor of the University of Melbourne, Professor Alan Gilbert, said yesterday. He later told The Australian that ""quite a of vice-chancellors don't say publicly what they privately"" on issues including fees and differential HECS charges. He said some vice-chancellors were ""isolating themselves from the debate"" because of the ""Whitlamesque legacy"" of slogans such as ""education should be free for all"". ""So if they could announce 3 per cent cuts and introduce a number of revenue-side measures ... packaging them together would allow them to use higher education to make major inroads on deficit management without breaking their election promises"". Professor Gilbert went on to say on another occasion: Simple opposition to the Budget's revenue-side measures will leave Australian universities with few alternatives to the melancholy tyranny of cuts and loss of quality. So in opposing the very sensible measures included in this budget, members opposite are exposing the universities 'to the melancholy tyranny of cuts and loss of quality'. It is important to remember something of the Labor Party's record. In 13 years of Labor government, funding for students declined by six per cent. Between 1989 and 1992, undergraduate entrant numbers dropped from lO2,000 to 93,000. Over the decade of the 1980s, the staff-student ratio in Australian universities declined from 12 to one to 16 to one. It behoves members opposite to stop running around scaring people and to accept that what we are trying to do is to take the system that we have inherited from Labor and make it work better. Let me take up a few specific points that were made by members opposite. The member for Sydney, the shadow minister said that we should be making these changes after an inquiry, not before an inquiry. It would be a fair point if what we are doing is revolutionising the system; we are not. These are evolutionary changes. You do not need an inquiry to go further down the road that the Labor Party pioneered. Members opposite have been saying that we are facing a catastrophe in terms of enrolments for science and engineering courses. Yes, early figures do suggest that applications number for some courses in some states are down. say But the fact is applications have not closed. It is far too early to tell whether the number and quality of science and engineering students coming out of school will change. Let us suppose that, yes, in the wash-up applications do go down a little bit; let us suppose that happens. Would that be terrible disaster? If it is a terrible disaster, let us accept that we have faced that disaster before. According to the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, applications over the last two years have declined by six per cent. The supplementation issue has excited some members opposite. Let me point out that the government has not ruled out supplementation for academic pay increases. But the universities should know this: it is up to them to negotiate the best deal they can with their staff, without calling upon the taxpayer to act as a security blanket before the negotiations have been completed. The idea that university academics should be running a kind of 'one in, all in' industrial campaign as if they were unskilled militant workers is, quite frankly, an insult to their professionalism and their individuality. Let me quote Frank Hambly, the executive director of the Australian ViceChancellors Committee, who says of our industrial relations reforms: The reforms will help universities cope much better Let me also quote Professor Cliff Blake, the President of the Australian Higher Education Industrial Association, who says of university industrial practices: We still have a lot of work practices which one would have to question. These are precisely the things that the universities will be able to tackle under the industrial system introduced by my friend and colleague the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith). Let me say in conclusion that I am proud of Australia's universities. The minister is proud of Australia's universities. The government is proud of Australia's universities. We have good universities in this country-and so we should-because good universities are the hallmark of a civilised society. Let me restate the government's fundamental objective: to have more students, to have better paid staff and to have universities which have an even more honoured place in our society. Let me remind members opposite of the words of former Senator Peter Walsh, who said: Whatever flaws other proposed changes may havereferring to the government's budget package for higher educationthis is better public policy. The Government should stick to it and the Senate should pass it. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole.  a.m.)-by leave-I move: (1) Schedule 1, items 1 and 2, page 3 (lines 4 to 9), omit the items. (2) Schedule 1, items 9 to 11, page 4 (line 24) to page 5 (line 3), omit the items. (3) Schedule I, items 13 to 21, page 5 (line 13) page 8 (line 17), omit the items. (4) Schedule 1, items 23 to 25, page 8 (line 25) page 11 (line 6), omit the items. (5) Schedule 1, item 27, page 11 (lines 12 and 13), omit paragraph (c), substitute: ""(c) guidelines issued under subsection 13(1), sections 20A, 26 or 27, paragraph 35(7)(b) or subsection 36(3)."". (6) Schedule 1, items 28 and 29, page II (lines 14 to 18), omit the items. The amendments essentially delete the items from the schedule in the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill that give effect to the proposals we object to. They relate to the HECS changes-the differential BECS and the reduction in the repayment threshold-the changes that permit the charging of up-front fees to Australian undergraduates and the changes to the open learning system which, in effect, totally deregulate the scheme and allow the charging of full fees but with only limited scope to assist students financially to cope with that. I make just a few points in response to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Mr Abbott). The parliamentary secretary spoke about the changes that were being given effect to as very minor incremental changes. I guess he was echoing Senator Vanstone's claim that 'it is really just a nick'. He also quoted the Vice-Chancellor of Sydney University, Professor Gavin Brown, who I understand is a distinguished mathematician by training. Professor Gavin Brown's assessment was that the combined effects of the cuts to operating grants, eliminating discretionary funding and not supplementing salary increases will translate into a 15 per cent cut for his institution effective by the year 2000. This is not exactly a nick. The former government attached great priority to maintaining an adequate funding base for our universities. The parliamentary secretary claims that we presided over a fall in funding per student. Perhaps he ought to read Senator Vanstone's speeches where she explicitly repudiates that point in order to try to justify what she is doing. She makes the to point that not only did we increase funding by about 70 per cent in real terms but we mainto tained and, in fact, slightly increased funding per student. Perhaps the parliamentary secretary ought to talk to Senator Vanstone and get the lines straight. The parliamentary secretary referred to the changes in HECS, fees and so forth as mere evolutionary changes. I suggest that the parliamentary secretary read a recent paper by Professor Bruce Chapman, who commented on the government's budget decisions for higher education. Professor Chapman was the architect and designer of the original HECS. He says that these are the most significant changes to be implemented in higher education funding in the past 30 years. Professor Chapman believes the changes will fundamentally transform the system and skew access to higher education toward the rich. I refer the parliamentary secretary to my speech on the second reading debate of this bill, where I quoted specific parts of Professor Chapman's paper. These changes are not minor nicks or little incremental changes to an existing system; these are massive changes that will transform our system for the worse. Reference was made to the impact of HECS on students' participation decisions. When we introduced HECS, we were very mindful of this possibility. Let us contrast the context which we introduced HECS with what is being done now. When we introduced HECS, it was in the context of a green paper and a white paper that laid out a massive expansion of the system and a massive expansion in government funding. It was in that context that we sought to introduce a scheme that recouped part of the cost of that. That is a very different context compared with the current one in which not only is HECS being ramped up by a quantum amount but also the level of public subsidy to universities is coming down in a massive way-not going up as it was under us. When we introduced HECS, we were particularly concerned to monitor and gather research on the impact of its introduction on participation decisions. By and large, the research that we commissioned-most of which was conducted and reported on in 1991-92-showed that at the level we had set it and with the specific arrangements and design, including an income contingent repayment structure, it was unlikely to have an adverse effect on participation decision. That is a very different thing from the quantum jump that is being talked about here. Again, I refer the parliamentary secretary to my speech on the second reading debate where I dealt with these matters in more detail. The final thing I would like to mention is that, in addition to deleting the offending sections from the schedule of the bill, one of the great omissions in this bill is any provision for parliamentary scrutiny of the way these new full fee arrangements are going to work. There already is provision for guidelines on postgraduate fees-and the proposal is to extend that to undergraduate fees-but there is no provision for parliamentary scrutiny. One of the amendments I have moved has the effect of including a provision that will allow the guidelines in relation to fee paying to be disallow able instruments in the parliament which at least will permit some degree of parliamentary scrutiny of those matters.

6,Mr ABBOTT,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"Warringah-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, in Education, Training and Youth Affairs) (10.35 a.m.)-I have a couple of brief comments to make in response to the shadow minister. I really think that it behoves members opposite to see this in context. We are increasing the HECS charge for most courses from roughly $2,500 a year to $3,300 a year-that is, $800 a year. But let us remember that this is a deferred contingent liability. People do not have to pay the extra $800 a year or, indeed, any of the debt until they are in a position to do so-until they are in employment that returns them $21,000 or near enough a year; until they are in a position to move from the lowest tax bracket into the higher tax brackets-a position where the previous government thought they were able to cope with a substantially higher rate of tax. It is a deferred liability; it is a contingent liability. If they never earn the income they are never liable for the debt. Let me repeat what we are doing, because members opposite seem to have wax in their ears: we are taking the Labor Party's system and we are extending it. We are refining it, we are developing it and we are doing so in ways that were recommended by Neville Wran, a former long-serving Labor Premier of New South Wales and a former National President of the Australian Labor Party. The shadow minister made mention of the guidelines. He said correctly that the guidelines are, strictly speaking, beyond parliamentary scrutiny. Obviously, the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) is subject to parliamentary scrutiny in her general stewardship of the department; obviously, the government is subject to parliamentary scrutiny in terms of the general accountability of all governments to the parliament and to the people. But, again, what we have done is operate in the same way that the previous government operated, by way of guidelines, in relation to postgraduate fees. All we are doing is taking the way the previous government operated in respect of postgraduate fees and applying it in exactly the same way in respect of undergraduate fees. If it was fair enough for the previous government to operate this way in respect of postgraduate fees, surely it is right and proper Hawker, D. P. M. and reasonable and sensible and fair for us to operate this way in respect of undergraduate fees. Every time members opposite condemn this government, what they are really .doing is condemning their own government. That is why they are so unconvincing. Question put:  agreed to. The House divided.

NA AMENDMENT BILL 1996 Second Reading Debate resumed from 10 October, on motion by Mrs Moylan: That the bill be now read a second time. Mrs Moylan-I submit a correction to the explanatory memorandum.",27
8,Dr LAWRENCE,CHILD CARE LEGISLATION,"I am here this morning because the honourable member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), our shadow minister, is unable to be here as she has pressing family responsibilities. In my speech in the second reading debate I will be reading from notes she prepared as shadow minister. If time permits, I will make some additions of my own. On behalf of the shadow minister, I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House: (1) deplores the Government for abolishing operational subsidies for community-based long day care centres which will have the effect of increasing the costs and reducing the quality of child care for parents using these centres; and (2) condemns the Government for breaking its election promise not to means test the Childcare Cash Rebate"". Let me make it clear at the outset that the Labor Party opposes large parts of the bill. The Labor Party opposes the abolition of operational subsidy for community based long day care centres. We oppose applying a means test to the child-care cash rebate. We oppose giving the Health Insurance Commission an open-ended power to defer making a decision about a claim for that rebate so that if the commission does nothing people will not be paid the child-care cash rebate they are entitled to. This is a power which effectively means that parents using child care for work related purposes are guilty until proven innocent. On 20 August this year the Howard government announced a package of cuts to childcare assistance worth half a billion dollars over the next four years. I have on numerous occasions since 20 August made the views of the Labor Party known in relation to these changes. I have said on numerous occasions that the cuts to child care alone pay for almost all of that part of the family tax initiative which gives extra assistance to single income families. I have said on numerous occasions that these cuts are effectively a direct transfer from two income families to single income families, not necessarily those on lower income either. People have told me that the message from the Howard government is quite clear: that women should not be in the work force; women should be at home looking after their children. Let me tell you that people-women, parents-do not like this message. Families where both parents are in the paid work force, where child care is a necessity, are already under pressure in their daily lives. It is not always an easy choice. The jobs at home still need to be done. But, even though it is often a hard decision for both parents to go out to work, this is in the 1990s what most people want. Forty-four per cent of mothers with young children are now working-some 400,000 women-and the number continues to rise. Far from supporting families in the choices they make, this government is effectively taking away some of their options. The combination of the Howard government's changes to child care and the introduction of the family tax initiative with its bias to single income families will clearly distort the choices that families make in the future about how they organise their lives. Analysis of these changes made available to me shows that perhaps the biggest disincentive for partnered women to re-enter the work force is the cost of child care. For example, in a family where the husband is on $25,000 a year with one child in child care, a woman earning between $10,000 and $15,000 will retain less than half of her pay after paying tax, child-care costs and the costs of working. A woman with three children pays considerably more in child-care costs than she pays in income tax. This can result in her retaining as little as 15 to 20 per cent of her earnings. The combination of the family tax initiative and these cuts to child care are a serious disincentive to women who want to enter the work force or stay in the work force. This is political correctness Howard style. But today I want to take the debate further. Today I want to talk not just about what is before us but about how much worse it is going to get for families with children under this anti-family Howard government. I say again, as I have said before in this place, Howard went to the election with a slogan 'For all of us'. Now we know that it is really for some of us and it is not for families who use child care. We already have the blueprint for the Howard government's so-called reform of assistance for families with children in child care. It is set out in the interim report of the Economic Planning Advisory Council's Child Care Task Force 'Future child-care provision in Australia'. The report says: 'The task force has focused on the desirable long-term structure for child care.' What desirable long-term structure does the interim report recommend? It recommends much greater emphasis on payment being made direct to parents themselves rather than to suppliers of child care, means tested financial support in the form of a child-care benefit paid to families for up to 50 hours per week of work related care, up to six hours of care per week where a parent is not in paid work and additional respite care beyond six hours subject to 'gatekeeper' arrangements. It recommends that all existing forms of assistance for child care be abolished, with a possible exception where special needs are involved, and these replaced with a single child-care benefit for low and middle income families. It also recommends that the states and territories should focus on standards, regulation of providers and assistance to services for special needs and that the Commonwealth should focus on payments to parents, research and review. It further recommends that any specific funding of special needs, apart from that through the proposed child-care benefit, should be by block grant from the Commonwealth with supplementation available at the discretion of the states and territories and, finally, that family day care schemes and other similar coordinating bodies for childcare provision be prohibited from placing a cap on fees charged by carers as a basis for eligibility for participating in such schemes. How far are we already along this path? We are a lot further along after the 20 August budget than we were before it. At the moment, child-care assistance is paid to providers while the child-care cash rebate is paid to parents. From January 1998 parents using long day care or family day care will have a choice about having their child-care assistance paid to them or to their service provider. There is not so far to go before this choice is available to families using other kinds of child-care services, like out of school hours care and occasional care. It is not far to go to remove the choice and make the only option available that of having all forms of assistance for child care paid directly to the parents. What this means is that child-care providers lose their guarantee of a regular cash flow. Service providers and the children they care for become vulnerable to interruptions in the continuity of care. As the Creche and Kindergarten Association of Queensland says in its submission to the EPAC Child Care Task Force: 'This proposal is a recipe for disaster.' At the moment, child-care assistance is means tested and the child-care cash rebate is paid free of a means test. From April next year a means test will apply to the child-care cash rebate. If this measure is implemented we will already be at the recommended position of the task force-that all assistance for child care be means tested. Once it is means tested at this level, it is a relatively easy step to make the means test stricter and stricter. At the moment there is no cap on the number of hours for which child-care assistance can be paid and neither is there any requirement for the care provided to be work related. The Howard budget changes this, too. From April next year a 50-hour cap will apply for child-care assistance-again, just as the task force recommended. We should remember that it was an interim, not a final, report. The 50-hour cap is of grave concern to child-care providers in both the community and the private sector. It takes away the centres' capacity to respond flexibly to parents' needs. Much has been made about flexibility in the new industrial relations legislation, yet we have child care now unable to respond flexibly. Some parents start work at 7 a.m. and finish at 4 p.m. Others start work at 9 a.m. and finish at 5.30 p.m. To cater for all parents a centre needs to stay open at least between 7 a.m. and 6 p.m. As Community Child Care Victoria has said, families requiring care at either end of the day or during off-peak times-and a lot of people work that way these days-will either have to pay a very large premium or not be able to find a service at all. It is not much of a further step to limit child-care assistance to six hours of non-work related care, which again is what the task force has recommended. When this happens I will not hesitate to remind you of the coalition's vociferous objections to Labor's measure to impose a 12-hour cap on childcare assistance for non-work related care. Their words will clearly come back to bite them. In the light of these changes, I do not think it is unreasonable to describe the task force's interim report as a blueprint for the future. We are already seeing it. The government is already well on the way to full implementation of its recommendations-before the ink has even been put to paper on the final report of the task force. It is fair to say that everyone in the childcare sector is opposed to these changes. Hundreds of parents from centres associated with the Australian Confederation of Child Care have written opposing them in these terms: My family is very disappointed that the newly elected government now wants to slash both the child-care assistance and cash rebate. We feel let down and misled and we join thousands of families around Australia in calling for the government to reverse the decision to abolish the $30 disregard and to include fringe benefits when assessing care assistance percentages. They object to 'the continued practice of indexing child-care assistance' and so on. This is one of the private provider organisations. They have written to members, including me, opposing these changes. Similarly, the Australian Federation of Child Care Associations makes it plain in its submission to the EPAC inquiry that it is opposed to the changes and very clearly indicates that it has concerns about a number of the recommendations made. It considers that the recommendations of the interim report, some of which have been implemented in the 1996 budget, 'will undermine the high standard of child care that is currently available for all families'. Again, this organisation represent the private providers. Of course, the National Association of Community Based Child Care Centres are also very strongly opposed and have let all members know of that opposition. The unions representing the staff are opposed, local government are opposed and thousands of parents are opposed to these measures. But the government are ignoring them. The government apparently only listen to the market drum. I make the point that the organisation representing the community based centres has run an excellent campaign pointing out the views of parents and their objections to what the government is doing. But the government is ignoring them, despite the fact that the shadow minister has obtained 8,000 signatures from various members of parliament signed by their constituents and a further 10,992 directly from parents who use child care. The major weakness in the task force recommendations, apart from those I have already mentioned, and in the policy of the government is that there is no strategy at all to address the supply side of the child-care equation. There is no strategy to address issues like the availability, quality, supervision, training, regulation, standards and wages. The government simply expects the private sector to deliver 20,000 new child-care places a year over the next few years. How and why is not spelt out. As the Community child- Child Care Victoria response to the report points out most eloquently: The report assumes that the provision of subsidies to individual consumers will allow them to negotiate their own child care arrangements and that this will result in a more diverse, flexible and responsive system. The report proceeds on the assumption that market forces will expand availability to meet demand and increase consumer choice in a competitive environment. Without compromise to quality or workers conditions, this will create a more efficient and effective system of services ... The simple nature of this proposition, from which the recommendations of the report flow, is breathtaking and absurd ... Ironically, it would move itthat is, children's servicescloser to the United States model, which is regarded as one of the worse and which has created entrenched problems of poor quality, low wages, unequal access and high indirect costs. This bill abolishes the operational subsidy for community based long day care to 'encourage services to become more efficient and cost competitive with the private sector'. This is the level playing field argument of the economic rationalists. This is the argument put by the report of the National Commission of Audit. This is also the argument that conveniently forgets that community based long day care services provide additional services to those provided in the private sector-more places for babies, more places for children with special needs, more highly qualified staff, more meals and extended opening hours, to name just a few, which are very important in disadvantaged areas, such as those which exist in my electorate. Do not get me wrong: the private sector does these things, too, but on the whole the community based sector, because of its operational subsidy, can and does do more. You ask the parents-they have not often been able to find places in the private sector, and go to community based centres. Let me remind you, too, that the operational subsidy for community based long day care centres is being abolished in spite of the reassurances given by the coalition to childcare providers before the election. The government was very clear about this. On 28 February, three days before the election-and this shows the audacity of the governmentDavid Kemp, the then shadow minister for employment, training and family services, wrote to the Australian Early Childhood Association as follows: ... the [Coalition] policy also states our continuing support for the community-based long day care sector, and we regard the operational subsidy as one of the key supports of that sector. The Coalition has no plans whatever to change the operational subsidy. So much for their word! Many of the people sitting opposite will be embarrassed by this complete reversal of coalition policy-and they should be. They went out and sold themselves on the basis that this would not occur. Many will have had representations from their local community based child-care centres seeking their opposition to the abolition of operational subsidies, as we on this side have had. Many of these representations have pointed out the effects of the abolition of the subsidy on their centres, especially in terms of the increased costs that parents will have to bear. I will return in a moment to the effects in my own electorate, because they are substantial. The shadow minister says that she has had thousands-literally thousands--of letters on this issue. I think it is worth noting that she says: As I have said elsewhere, I have received more letters on this issue than the opposition as a whole received on gun control. That is how important families regard it. The government cannot tell us now how many of these community based centres will close or where they will close, but they will close certainly. The government cannot tell us how many of these centres will have to pass on the effects of this measure to parents in the form of increased fees. The government cannot or will not tell us how many parents will pay more for their child care in child-care costs and most certainly in payment for food, nappies and so on. So, to the extent that the centres do not do it, they will have to pick it up themselves. Most centres that I have spoken to estimate that fees will rise by between $20 and $25 per week per child. And that is not counting the other changes which add additional costs. There will be community based centres in this country which, because of the abolition of operational subsidies, will start sending notices home to parents saying, 'Fresh fruit can no longer be provided for morning and afternoon tea; please send it with your child,' or they will say that meals can no longer be provided. There will be community based centres which, because of the abolition of the operational subsidy, will have to send home notices saying, 'We can no longer provide a nappy service; please send disposable nappies.' As the shadow minister for the environment, I am not particularly keen about that. There will be more children for staff to look after-in some cases no more, because the centres will close-because there will be fewer staff. There is no doubt in my mind that parents will pay more for the same service or the service they will pay for will be a lesser one. The government has the really hare-brained idea that this is efficiency. They equate poorer quality, more children per staff member, poorly qualified staff and lesser services with efficiency-a funny definition. Many of the parents I have spoken to since the budget have told me that they made a careful and considered choice to use community based long day care centres for their children's sake-a careful and considered choice and their choice, not the government's. They, unlike the government, recognise the value of the sense of community that these services engendered and they appreciate the fact that society as a whole thinks it is important to invest in the future of the children. These are, after all, largely parent controlled or local government controlled centres. Like our investment in public education and public housing, public investment in child care recognises our collective obligation to provide the best for our children. These parents well realise that the abolition of the operational subsidy is the Howard government taking that choice away from them. Thousands have signed petitions to this effect. Many members will be aware of the skydiving grandmother, Fiona Dunbar, who brought drawings from many children and their families to members of this parliament. I hope members have taken the opportunity to think about that gesture. What transitional assistance is the government going to provide to make sure that these centres share in the government's love affair with the market? Every community based long day care centre in the country will be able to engage a consultant-they were advertised recently in Western Australia-to advise them on how best to compete in the new environment, at $3,000 per consultation. The expertise resides in the centres. No-one outside the centres knows how to run them better than the people who currently run them. I might ask members opposite and members of the department: who will be doing this? The operators of child-care centres in the community based sector are vastly insulted by the way this is being conducted. Somebody with lesser expertise than themselves will be paid $3,000 to tell a centre to find more children to care for, to sack a staff member, to replace current staff with less qualified staff, to stop providing meals or fresh fruit for morning teas, to stop providing special treats like a movie or a visit to the zoo, to stop buying in a nappy service, to replace toys and children's books every five years instead of two, and so on. They can figure that out for themselves, horrible though it may be. While Senator Vanstone is cutting labour market programs for the unemployed, Minister Moylan is establishing them for highly paid consultants. The opposition will be moving amendments to the bill to omit item 18, which applies a means test to the child-care cash rebate. In its election manifesto, the coalition said: The Coalition has long supported the recognition of the costs of child care associated with ment. Again, I underline this: A Coalition government will maintain the nonmeans tested childcare cash rebate. So what do we see in the budget? The rebate is abolished, without so much as an explanation or an apology. Child care, as the coalition apparently readily agreed before the election, is a legitimate work related expense. I note that in a speech well after that time the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women, Senator Newman, also conceded that it was a legitimate work related expense. Yet it is now being means tested. It is a work related expense irrespective of the amount paid for that work. On the coalition's logic, why shouldn't highly paid men who claim tax deductions for expensive tools, or lawyers who claim for their professional libraries, be subject to a means test? Why are we not cognately debating a bill to introduce a means test on these tax expenditures? The opposition will not stand back while the Howard government breaks its election promises and we will not stand back while it breaks this one. The opposition will not stand back while the Howard government tells some single income families that they are more deserving of assistance than other kinds of families. We are well aware that the Australian people are relying on us to hold the Howard government to its promises. Today we are demonstrating that we mean what we say. We are doing precisely what we said we would do. We are holding the government to its promises and will continue to do so on behalf of all Australians. That concludes the speech that the shadow minister asked me to give on her behalf. I still have a little time, so I want to make some specific references to my own electorate of Fremantle. I think it is important for all members of this House to have a good hard look at how these changes actually affect their constituents. I have taken the trouble-as I know many members have on our side-to go out to the child-care centres in my electorate, both the private and the public ones, to ask employthem what are the likely effects of these changes on the charges they will have to make or the quality of care they provide. I must say it is not a pretty picture. When you take half a billion dollars out of a service like child care, it hurts. It hurts families who can ill afford to be hurt. One of the things that the organisation representing the community based centres has done in Western Australia is to ask parents to indicate to them how their family budget looks now and how it will look after changes to child-care costs. I have here before me one such example. This is a family where there are two adults and two children in child care. At the moment the family income is $743 a week. The childtransfers care cost they pay is $87. They have gage of $255. They have fixed household payments-rates, water, petrol, car maintenance, gas, electricity, telephone, insurance for house contents, car and health-of $290. What is left after all of that at the moment is $111 a week for everything else-food, clothes, pharmaceuticals, the family's needs. What happens with these changes, which will have to be passed on to the operational subsidy in particular, and the other changes that are part of this bill? For the family the same income of $743-there is no suggestion they are going to be paid more-childcare costs escalate from $87 to $132 a week. Assuming their mortgage repayments stay the same-they may diminish slightly but not enough to make up that gap-and that there is no escalation in their fixed household payments, so they are still $290, that family will have left $66 a week for clothes, pharmaceuticals and, as the person who has put forward this budget describes it, a life: entertainment, movies. That is $66 a week two adults and two children. As this constituquality ent describes it, very ironically, 'hard one day, impossible the next'. And this is government that talks about its concerns for families. Similarly, a single parent with two children, one of them under two, at the moment working part-time, getting an income of $290. She gets a part pension and a family allowbase ance. After she has paid the mortgage, the gas, the electricity and so on, she has $50 week left for everything else-for food and clothes and shoes. She says in relation to clothes and shoes, 'Only if I from donations.' She is in an extraordinary position already. When you look at what is going to happen to her, there is a very significant increase in <;:hild-care costs which will almost completely obliterate that $50 a week. I would think that mother will throw up her hands and say, 'I cannot continue to work. I cannot continue to provide for my family. I will have to simply move and become a full pensioner in order to provide any kind of decent income support for my family.' I think the government has not looked at the cost of those inevitable that will occur when individual a mortfamilies have to make that decision. I will give another example provided by one of the parents I met at the child-care centre. She is a nurse, working at the moment from Monday to Friday. Her husband works in the shipbuilding industry, a very rapidly growing industry, at Fremantle, south of Perth. He is a tradesman. Between them, with their two children in care, they earn a reasonable income but things are very tight, as they are for many of these families with mortgages with and the fixed costs that they cannot avoid. With their two children in care, the mother will now have to change her working time to the weekend so that the father can look after the children. She will now work Saturday, Sunday, Monday and Tuesday so that she has to have the children in care only for two days. The husband comes home at the end of a hard five-day working week and acts as the childcare provider for the weekend. Apart from the fact that those parents will rarely see one for another, the impact on the children and the of their lives will be very substantial. That story is a very distressing one but not a uncommon. When I looked at the City of Fremantle's child-care centres, of which there are three, they provided me with information that shows, in some cases, that unless they is can find some subsidy from somewhere else-Fremantle Qoes not have a very big rate and it is not a very big city-they will have to pass on all of these costs directly to a the parents, close the centres or in some way contract them out, which is something they her are very reluctant to do because they have a can't get them social conscience. Take the example of a single parent with one child under two in care full time. At the moment, the City of Fremantle is charging full fees for a week of $159.75. Assuming that the single parent is on a full subsidy, means that at the moment the parent is paying $49.35. From 1 January there will be an increase in fees-in the pipeline because of negotiated wage increases and the normal cost increases while, incidentally, child-care - assistance will be frozen-which will mean that costs will go up to $55.60. After the changes to be introduced on 1 April, a parent will have to pay $72.70, and by 1998 when the final changes are introduced the parent's costs will be up to $83.70. That is a 41 per cent increase in child-care costs over that time for a single parent with one child in care. Similarly, a single parent with a child over two finds that she or he has a 43 per cent increase in child-care costs. A single parent with two children in full-time care will be financially crippled because they end up paying $154 a week in child care, which is a 48 per cent increase, almost doubling the amount they currently pay. These are not fanciful figures. These are figures provided to me by Fremantle Children's Services. That is what they estimate they will have to pass on to parents unless they can substantially change, first of all, the staff in their centres so that they pay less. But, from discussions with them, it is clear that, even if they were able to sack all their long-term staff who have provided continuity of care for the children, they still will not be able to significantly reduce the additional impost on parents. They are now confronted with the very harsh possibility that these centres will have to close. These centres belong to the community. These centres were set up with taxpayers' funds and ratepayers' funds. Parents assist in their management, and care very much about them. In the case of Fremantle, they were set up at a time when it was not fashionable to provide support for parents. They are amongst the longest standing and longest serving childcare centres in this country. Yet they are being told that they have to close. The effects on parents of these changes are inevitable. The preliminary estimates of a survey of child-care centres in Western Australia which is being undertaken-not by that me but by the child-care centres themselvesshow that between 47 and 48 per cent of client parents are on full fee relief. So all of these additional charges go straight to the parents; they have to be met by them. These are people sufficiently poorly off that they need full fee relief. Yet they are the ones who will be hit hardest by this measure. On behalf of the women and the families of Australia, I protest. On behalf of the families in my electorate, I protest. And on behalf of the taxpayers of this country, I protest. (Time expired) Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Sullivan)-Is the amendment seconded?",28
9,Mr BRERETON,CHILD CARE LEGISLATION,I second the amendment.,35
10,Mr BRADFORD,CHILD CARE LEGISLATION,"I enjoyed listening to the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence), both the speech she read from the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) and her own comments. The sorts of stories she was relating to us about families who, in her estimation, are being adversely affected by some of these changes are stories that members on both sides are bound to hear. But let me put some of the decisions that the government has taken, as with this Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill 1996, in context. Let me sheet the blame home to where I believe it belongs. When we were elected to government we were left with a financial mess of gigantic proportions. We were faced with solving a problem that amounted to what we called a black hole of some $8 billion. Whose fault was that? It was the fault of the former Labor Party government of this country which went on a spending spree that lasted for years in a determined effort to prop up its electoral popUlarity. On 2 March, the Australian people, wisely, took the view that it had to come to an end; that we could not go on spending on programs that were not achieving their objectives. Today, the sorts of examples that the member for Fremantle is giving us are not the fault of this government but the fault of the previous government that left us with an enormous financial problem. I regret that the solutions responsibly put forward by this government in the budget will cause pain across the Australian community. But, in the end, it has to be done. We were given ajob by the electorate to do something about the problem. I believe that the government's approach to solving that problem has been fair. It has had to be tough, but it has been fair, and the pain has been fairly evenly spread across the Australian community. In the end, the changes that we are making in this particular area will mean that the pain will be borne most by those who can afford to pay. That is the proposition and the context in which some of these changes have to be considered. If we had not been faced with the financial problem, obviously some of these decisions would not have been made. If we were not faced with some of these problems, some of these unpalatable sorts of decisions would not have been made. I want to put very clearly at the outset of my response to the member for Fremantle that this legislation and the other budgetary lation that will come forward are the fault of the previous government. It is no good opposition members getting up in here and giving examples, because we can all do that. I have community based child-care centres in my electorate, and I am having to face now as a member of the government some of the concerns-I think not unreasonable concerns-that the people are expressing to me. I could stand up in this place this morning and give some of the same examples that the member for Fremantle has given. In the end, we as a country have a problem. The government will go about solving that problem responsibly by cutting into a lot of the programs that were set up by the former government. Those programs were created to solve unemployment and other problemsproblems which, incidentally, the former government had also created. As those programs failed, the money was wasted. So we are also faced today with solving that problem, and it is unfortunate that many people will suffer to some extent as we attempt to do that. As we solve that problem, the good news is that after the pain there will be gain. There will be substantial gain for Australian families. In taking a responsible fiscal position, the government will ultimately deliver. For example, since the budget, the government has delivered lower interest rates. The effect of lower interest rates for the average family with an average mortgage is a considerable saving. At the last estimation, that saving, in view of the recent drop in housing mortgage interest rates, was in the order of $100 a month. I believe that the best thing we can do for Australian families is to be responsible. We can cut spending, which we have set about doing, without increasing taxes-because that was our pre-election commitment-and ultimately deliver long-term sustainable growth in the Australian economy. That will benefit families. In the meantime, as I have said, there is to be an element of pain spread across the community, but hopefully directed mostly at those who can afford to pay. The opposition amendment that has been moved legisstates that the House: ... deplores the Government for abolishing operational subsidies for community-based long day care centres ... As I said, I think there are elements of the government's decision which are regrettable. I should declare an interest in this, because my youngest child attends such a centre. It is a very well run centre. It is very reasonably priced; I ought to say that is one of its most appealing benefits. My wife makes a regular contribution to it. That is the arrangement; it is a parent controlled community based childcare centre. In my analysis of the outcomes, the extent to which there will be additional costs-and there will be, as the operational subsidy is removed-is being overstated. The sorts of examples that were given-such as that the centres will not be able to provide nappies or fruit-were also exaggerations. At our kindergarten, the children take their own fruit and so on. I think there is an element of exaggeration, whilst I accept that there will be some cost. In the end, the government believes that this move will lead to a better child-care sector and a more competitive sector. We heard from the member for Fremantle a lot of the left-wing ideologies which she is well known for. It is mostly discredited ideology, I observe, that says that markets do not work and competition will not work. In the end, we believe there will be a more competitive child-care sector and a better quality childcare centre as a result of many of the initiatives in the legislation. The second part of the amendment that was moved was that the House: . . . condemns the Government for breaking its election promise not to means test the Childcare Cash Rebate. I need to also put that particular matter in context. The government will actually spend $5 billion on child care over the next four years. The child-care cash rebate will remain available for all eligible families regardless income, but it will be reduced from 30 per cent to 20 per cent for families earning above the new family tax initiative cut offs, which is $70,000 for one-child families plus $3,000 for each additional dependent child. That will mean there will be very little change for 85 per cent of families. For example, a family earning $75,000 per annum with one child may face a reduction in the rebate of less than $10 per week. As I said, the government has largely delivered on its election promises in respect of child care. Where there are some minor changes, they were done in the context of the budgetary situation which we faced. I want to make it very clear that I believe the government is committed to delivering equitable, affordable, flexible and high quality child care to Australian families. That is being demonstrated by what we have done since we were elected to government. The member for Fremantle, who was reading the member for Jagajaga's speech, also talked about the 50-hour cap and was critical of that. She said that when we were in opposition we opposed the former government's intention to impose a 12-hour cap on non-working parents-as we did. She made the suggestion in some respects that that was hypocri tical. Let me turn that around. If the previous government were in favour of a 12-hour cap on non-working parents, surely they can hardly oppose the concept of the 50-hour cap which we intend to impose. Fifty hours of child care available for eligible families, largely at taxpayers' expense, is substan-ial. I think there is every argument that that IS a very reasonable limitation. To argue that it has taken away the ability of child-care centres-and it is mainly commercial centres that we are talking about in this instance-to respond flexibly is just not the case. It is interesting that the EPAC interim report, which the member referred to and which I think is a very worthwhile contribution to the debate on child care-we are yet to see its final report-recommended a sixhour cap on the availability of child care for non-working parents. I think it is inevitableof and I assume that the former government would support this-that, when we do deal with that EPAC report's recommendations, there will be, I think quite correctly, a fairly substantial cap placed on the availability of child care for non-working parents. The whole issue of child care has been one of the philosophical battlegrounds of the 1990s. It is an emotive issue, obviously, and it is one on which there will be differences of opinion in this place. I have been, and. I wi.ll continue to be in the speeches I make In thIS House on the subject, very critical of the way the current system has developed. It is a system that has been largely driven by bureaucrats for a very long time and largely, I need to say also, by feminist bureaucrats. It is a system that has been driven by supply rather than demand. In the arrangements we now propose and in the broader context of other changes we are making in family policy, we want to deliver to families more control and more choice as far as their own child-care arrangements are concerned. We want to encourage competition and encourage the services that are provided to be more responsive to families. What the member for Fremantle appeared to be arguing for when she spoke about the status quo is that the system should somehow be dri ven by the other side-in other words, that the provider's needs should be considered as somehow paramount in this rather than the family's needs. That is demonstrably wrong. Surely, if we are talking about the provision of services to families, then it should be the families that drive the demand for child care, not the opposite. The member for Fremantle, reading the shadow minister's speech, seemed to be arguing for the opposite. That is what we are turning around. We want to have a child-care sector-there is no disagreement about the need for it in today's modem society-that is responsive to the demands and needs of those modem families. As I said, we have had something of a war raging over child care on at least a philosophical level for many years. On one side there were the Eva Coxes of this world who seem to make pronouncements which effectively disparage women who choose to stay home and take care of their own children when the children are young. Ms Cox seems to say that these women can make that choice-she is not going to argue against choice because it is a proposition that is unarguable-but they should not be asking the government for any money if they want to make that choice. In other words, give them a Clayton's choice-force them out into the work force if you can. The underlying philosophy that we see from those extreme views is that women ought to be in the work force and, if they are not in the work force, they are not making a measurable contribution to our gross domestic product. Women like my wife, who has chosen to stay home and raise our children, get from the government by virtue of what used to be the dependent spouse rebate-the name was changed because the language was politically incorrect-the sum total of $32 a week for working 14 hours a day, seven days a week. The whole system discriminates against those women who have chcsen to stay out of the work force or, indeed, those husbands who have made the choice because it suits their family arrangements best. Yet those women who make that choice and stay home clearly save the government a considerable amount of money because they are caring for .their own young children and in the long term make an enormous contribution to our society. The sad fact is that, despite the statistics the member for Fremantle produced, which distort the real situation, both partners are forced to work because of economic circumstances. One partner in a relationship would choose to stay out of the work force if it were a financially viable option. The situation has militated against that for too long. I am pleased that this government has set aboutnot rushing like a bull at a gate, but slowly through the family tax initiatives that we have taken, in respect of some aspects of this legislation and the ongoing debate which will follow the final report of the EPAC task force-winding back that feminist dogma which has been thrust down our throats by the previous government for so many years. On the other side of the argument have been organisations such as the Australian Family Association, which has long called for a homemakers allowance which will provide a realistic alternative to both parents being conscripted into the work force. That proposition is a very appealing one for some of the reasons I have already said, not the least because, quite clearly, if parents were unable to make a proper choice about one of them remaining out of the work force to take care of young children, then, theoretically-and I think in practice-that would have some impact on the number of unemployed, particularly young people, who cannot find any work in the workplace at all. It would also address what I think are some serious inequities that exist-and I do not think there are government solutions to them-when you observe that in some families both of the parents are working full time and in other families neither is. I think this is a basic inequity that can be solved not by direct government intervention but by policies that are effectively family-friendly and that in practice allow families to make the sorts of choices that they really would want to make if it were not for the fact that they were almost proscribed from doing so. Therefore, except for the expenses involved with the Australian Family Association's suggestion, I think that philosophically direction we ought to take. In fact the government has already embarked on that direction by virtue of the family tax legislation that we have brought in that will give parents a greater choice. So the child-care industry has grown in response partly to demand but more so because the government policies we have experienced in recent years have driven it. It was seen by the former government as a politically correct cause. It was seen as an opportunity to win votes by pandering to the extreme feminist agenda, and it has facilitated the entry of women into the work force in increasing numbers, mainly because a lot of them did not have any choice about it. In fact, in south-east Queensland where my electorate is based there is an oversupply of child-care positions-we have too many private childcare centres. For a while there they were like comer stores; they were springing up all over the place. That was driven by the system which has been in place now for so many years. I could go on at some length about a number of aspects, but the underlying philosophy that I and I believe this government subscribes to is that in the end parent care is good for children and that children who receive optimal parent care do very well because of it. This legislation has some benefits. It has some downsides in terms of additional costs, but the blame for that rests squarely with the previous government which left us with a budgetary problem that ultimately, in the interests of Australian families, we had to solve. I believe we have done that responsibly and fairly, and that we have spread the pain across the Australian community equally. (Time expired) Debate (on motion by Mrs Bishop) adjourned.

13,Mr SPEAKER,AYES,"Order! The honourable Werriwa is suspended from the service of the House for 24 hours. The honourable member for Werriwa thereupon withdrew from the chamber. Mr Stephen Smith- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. This is the first occasion that there has been a report from the Main Committee to this House in respect of alleged disorderly conduct. The precedent of this House in respect of reports from committees to the House about disorderly conduct recorded in Browning and recorded in Votes and Proceedings of the House of 24 November 1927 clearly indicates, and clearly requires as AYES a matter of right, that the person or member against whom the alleged disorderly report is made is entitled to put his view to the House because the House did not view the disorderly conduct.",40

Except as otherwise provided, any matter so reported shall be set down for consideration at a later hour that day.

On that basis, Mr Speaker, I invite you under the standing orders not to accept his question. Mr Stephen Smith-On the point of order, Mr Speaker, given the events that have transpired in the Main Committee this morning and in the House today, I have a question of you which goes to the proposed, if any, reconvening of the Main Committee.

23,Mr MOORE,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES," Mr Speaker, I seek the indulgence of the House. During question time yesterday and in a subsequent press statement yesterday afternoon the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean) attempted to suggest that I was in breach of the guidelines on ministerial responsibility because of my shareholding in a company named Ralsten Pty Ltd. There is no substance whatever in these PAIRS allegations made by the opposition. I have been a shareholder of Ralsten for many years. That has been a matter of public record. My shareholding has always been publicly declared in my register of members' interests. In April this year, following the election, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) issued 'A guide on key elements of ministerial responsibility'. At page 10 of the guide it says: Ministers are required to resign directorships in public companies and may maintain directorships in private companies only if such companies operate, for example, a family farm, business or portfolio of investments and if retention of the directorship is not likely to conflict with the minister's public duty. The guidelines permit in certain circumstances ministers to retain directorships in a private company. Nevertheless, in April this year, following my appointment as the minister, I resigned as a director and chief operating officer of this company. The guidelines go on to say: Ministers are required to divest themselves of all shares and similar interests in any company or business involved in the area of their portfolio responsibilities. Ministers are not precluded from making investments on the stock market or other financial and trading markets, but they should not operate as traders and should exercise careful personal judgment in respect of these transactions. I am no way involved in the activities of the company. The operations of the company are completely independent of me. Its activities continue, but without my personal involvement and in accordance with the guidelines I have just quoted. Mr Crean-You can't be serious!",43
24,Mr SPEAKER,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,Order! Members on my left!,44
25,Mr MOORE,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"Just to make it quite clear: the operations of the company are completely independent of me. It continues to operate but without my personal involvement and in accordance with the guidelines. I do not trade shares. It should be noted that I have personally sold all public company shares that I previously owned. Therefore, the allegations made by the honourable member for Hotham are without any foundation. Mr Crean-On indulgence, the minister has come into this House",44
26,Mr SPEAKER,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,We are not going to debate this issue. Do you have a point that you would like to raise? Mr Crean-I am asking for indulgence in response,44

39,Mr SPEAKER,MAIN COMMITTEE,"Before we go to the next order of the day, I will further advise the House about the events in the Main Committee later this day. I have just been advised that the Main Committee has operations. Mr Leo MCLeay- Mr Speaker, I seek your indulgence. This division went till five past one. The Main Committee does not normally meet after 1 o'clock. If the government wants to have the Main Committee meet after 1 o'clock, the normal practice is that the Chief Government Whip consults with me as the Chief Opposition Whip. I have had no communication from Mr Cadman on this matter. The opposition might be willing to consider the matter but I think we ought to be going through the forms. I cannot see how the Deputy Speaker could have resumed the chair in the Main Committee while the division was going on because that is ultra vires the rules. If he did not resume the chair while the division was going on, the Main Committee should have ceased sitting at 1 0' clock, its norm. So at five past one, when you advised the House that he had resumed the chair, I would have thought you should have been advising the House that he had vacated the chair at 1 o'clock.",47
40,Mr SPEAKER,MAIN COMMITTEE,"The honourable for Watson raises a number of interesting points. The time set for the reopening of the Main Committee was, as I recall, 12.50. We had a number of divisions in that time and at the end of the last division I understand it was the intention of the Deputy Speaker to resume NOES the chair in the Main Committee. In the absence of a quorum, which was highly likely, the operations of the Main Committee have probably been suspended. I have no PAIRS further information to add. At the end of the last division he would have made his way back, as was his intention, to resume the chair. So he probably needs to suspend the sittings in the light of circumstances that prevailed at the time. Mr Leo MCLeay-So it is not sitting and it will not resume till next Wednesday or another time that is set by you, Mr Speaker.",47
41,Mr SPEAKER,MAIN COMMITTEE,"That is right. We will reflect on this matter and I will advise the House further in the event of developments. Mr Leo MCLeay-Would you expect, Mr Speaker, that it would be sitting again today? resumed its I would not think so.",47
42,Mr SPEAKER,MAIN COMMITTEE,"As I said, I will advise the House in due course about developments that affect the Main Committee. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1996 Second Reading Debate resumed",47
43,Mr MOSSFIELD,CHILD CARE LEGISLATION,"The Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 proposes to discontinue the operational subsidy for community based long day care centres and to amend the Childcare Rebate Act 1993 to reduce the child-care cash rebate from 30 per cent to 20 per cent for families with one child and with taxable as is incomes lower than $70,000 per annum. This legislation will clearly create hardship for low income working families. It is strongly opposed by the Labor opposition. We are expressing our opposition by moving an amendment in which we say that the House member should indicate that it: (1) deplores the Government for abolishing operational subsidies for community-based long day care centres which will have the effect of increasing the costs and reducing the quality of child care for parents using these centres; and (2) condemns the Government for breaking its election promise not to means test the Childcare Cash Rebate. The legislation turns the clock back 20 years by amending the Child Care Act 1972 introduced by the Liberal-Country Party government of William MCMahon. The 1972 act was introduced in recognition of the increase in labour force participation by women and the subsequent need to provide affordable, quality child care for their children. In hindsight, this was a very noble and far-reaching piece of legislation and it certainly showed a lot of vision in relation to the numbers of women that entered the work force over that period. In her speech, the honourable member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) quite clearly pointed out the strong opposition to the government's legislation from all sections of the child-care industry-local government, private providers, parents and community based child-care centres. The honourable member made the point that the government's legislation will make the child-care system in this country more like the inefficient system that operates at the moment in the United States of America. Inefficient child-care centres mean unsafe child-care centres. The honourable member for Fremantle also made the point that this legislation breaks the election promise of the government. It will also create enormous hygiene problems and other problems relating to child care. In his contribution, the member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford) conceded that low income people would suffer. He made the point that in his particular set of circumstances he did not require child care. The point I would like to make is that high income people do not need child-care facilities. We are not arguing on behalf of high income people. We are arguing on behalf of two-income working families. They are the people that we are going into battle for with this piece of legislation. The member for MCPherson also gave us the tired old argument that it was all the last government's fault. Sooner or later, the new government has to realise that it is now the government and it has to bring in legislation that will be for the benefit of the people, rather than use the tired old argument that it is overcoming a problem that was created by the previous government. The need for child-care places to assist women in the work force should be recognised. The rate of female participation in the work force has increased from 40.6 per cent in 1972 to 53.4 per cent in 1996. This increase has been particularly high in the 25 to 59 year age group. The establishment of community based child-care centres gives parents and local communities substantial control over the child-care services in their area. The member for MCPherson made the point that parents need to have control over their children's child-care facilities. This is what now happens with community based child-care centres. It is important that parents are involved in the management committee of child-care centres as it ensures that the centre is responding to the needs of the children. It is anticipated that the removal of the operational subsidy will save the government $118.4 million in three years. To assist community based long day care centres to adjust to the removal of the operational subsidy, the government has allocated $8.3 million over the next four years. This funding is intended to encourage community based long day care centres to hire consultants to help them to restructure their services and improve efficiency without raising fees. This appears an impossible objective without affecting the quality and standard of child care. Clearly, I would suggest that this is a waste of taxpayers' money. To be allocating this sort of finance for consultants is not warranted when in most cases they would actually lack the experience and the expertise that the child-care centres themselves currently have. The issue of child care-in particular, the operational subsidy of long day care centreshas been a matter of considerable public discussion in the electorate of Greenway for some time. The electorate contains a number of fast growing residential areas where two income families reside and more young families are moving in at a rapid rate. There is, therefore, an urgent need for family support services, particularly child care, to allow both parents to take part in either full-time or part-time work so that the family's budget can be balanced. The previous federal Labor government was well aware of this need across the nation and during its term of office child-care places increased from 46,000 in 1983 to 270,000 in 1996. Child-care places were given a high priority in western Sydney under the Labor government. As at 15 September 1995 there was a total of 11,369 Commonwealth funded day care places available in western Sydney. This represents 361 places for every 1,000 children in the region compared with the New South Wales average of 326 places per 1,000 children. Under Labor, Blacktown, in particular, had the highest relative level of long day care supply in western Sydney. In spite of this major contribution, the target population has increased considerably since the 1991 census and many child-care services still have significant waiting lists. Despite the record of the previous Labor government, my Liberal opponent in the March elections, who was a working mum with two young children, tried to score some political points out of the child-care issue. My opponent was quoted in a press article in January of this year as saying: Affordable child care was a basic right of all parents. With record numbers of women now in the work force, the pressure and demand for childcare positions only continues to grow. I agree wholeheartedly with my Liberal opponent on that particular issue. Clearly, she felt that this was a good issue to run in that particular election. However, when I was able to reply to her criticism of the Labor government with the government's record in this area, we heard no more from her. We heard no more from the Liberal Party on that particular issue in the election campaign. I do agree with the points that she was quoted as making in the local press. I am sure now she would be bitterly disappointed, as would many other working mums in Greenway, and would be lamenting the reduction of funding for child care announced in the budget. Furthermore, during a debate in Blacktown Council prior to the budget Liberal Party councillors dismissed as rumours plans to remove operational subsidies for community based child-care centres. Labor Party councillors were more on the ball with Councillor Michael Sommerton, when referring to possible cuts in funding, saying: We are at a stage where child care is of complete importance, this is really going to hurt and hurt hard. Blacktown Council was so concerned about the proposed cuts that it called a public meeting. At this meeting, concerned parents were advised that the council operated 25 funded services under its children's services administration-20 long day care centres, three out of school hours programs, family day care and early intervention and ethnic programs. In 1996-97 Blacktown Council was to receive more than $1.5 million in operational funding from the federal government. Any reduction in this funding would have led to either increased fees or a reduction in services. This would place many families in Greenway in an impossible dilemma, with the parents either having to remain at home to look after their kids, increasing their financial burden even further because of having to pay increased fees, or allowing children to become latchkey kids, with all the social problems that this would inevitably lead to. In the cold war period leading up to the budget announcement, numerous phone calls were made to my office by both parents and carers expressing their concern about cuts in funding for child care. I in tum passed these concerns on to the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) by correspondence. While I have spoken principally about my own electorate of Greenway in this debate, there is clearly a national and regional question to be considered. Community based care centres make up a greater proportion of childcare services in rural and remote Australia. This is in part because commercial operators do not perceive that long day care centres are viable in remote areas. The operational subsidy received by community based long day care centres can be used to offset the greater expense of operating these centres in rural areas. The budget provides capital funding intended to ensure that families in rural and remote areas and places of special need have access to child care. However, despite the allocation of funding to help them adjust to the loss of the operational subsidy, community based long day care centres have argued that this will not be sufficient and that centres will be forced to pass on these costs to parents. I think the House would appreciate that, while this is a serious problem in the metropolitan area of Sydney and other major cities, it is an even more extreme and more serious problem in remote and regional Australia. It has been suggested that a low income family with one child under the age of three receiving maximum child-care assistance of $2.30 per hour would, after the child-care cash rebate was factored in, experience a rise in the cost of care for their children from $29.50 to $50.90 per week. Clearly the question arises as to whether community based organisations would consider it worthwhile or feasible to continue operating long day care centres in the absence of this subsidy. While the government may argue that it has made certain provisions in the budget to help single income families, they certainly do not go far enough. With the tax relief to single income families amounting to only $17 a week and with increases in pharmaceutical prescription costs affecting families with chronically ill children, the financial burden on young families still requires both parents to seek full-time employment, particularly middle income working class families. This point was clearly made by Ross Gittins in an article in the Sydney Morning Herald on 22 August, which said in part: The budget's nice bits aren't as generous as they sound. The plan to raise your tax threshold by $1,000 for each dependent child, for instance, is worth just $3.85 per week per head-provided you are eligible, of course. Eligibility for the additional benefit for stay at home mums is very limited, and what starts off at $2,500 turns out to be $9.60 a week. The maximum value of the health insurance rebate is $8.65 a week. Few families would be eligible for all three of these. The Ross Gittins article goes on: Against these pluses you have to set a plethora of higher charges, induding an extra $2.60 per prescription, higher community child care fees and unnamed indirect increases in state taxes and charges and cutbacks that would affect the pockets of migrant families, families with relatives entering nursing homes, families with children receiving Austudy or paying HECS or more. The article by Gittins makes the point that mainstream Australia are the net losers in the first Howard budget. Also, with the changing nature of our culture, many young mothers are desirous of remaining in the work force so as to retain or upgrade their skills to ensure employment opportunities in later life. I have only this week received a complaint from a mother who had high qualifications who had dropped out of the work force to raise her family. She is now having problems re-entering the work force because she lacks recent employment experience and she is being denied the opportunity of enrolling in government funded training programs. I think this is a very serious and major social change that has taken place over the past decades, even prior to the Labor government coming into power. It was recognised by the MCMahon government in 1972 when it introduced this legislation. More and more women want to get into and remain in the work force-either part time or full timeduring the time that they are raising children and certainly with the view of continuing in employment after their children and family have grown up. For that reason, it is very important that the programs the previous Labor government introduced in relation to child care remain intact. I certainly think that this government is turning the clock back, which is going to seriously affect low income working families. For economic and social reasons, the government was obliged, I would have thought, to continue with the operational subsidy for community based child care. I have raised these pre-budget comments by my political opponents, by Blacktown councillors and by the providers of parents using child-care facilities to emphasise the high degree of interest in this issue. Judging by public comment, while there were many major issues in Greenway during the election campaignsuch as road and rail infrastructure, employment, education and health-child care was the major issue in 1996. Therefore, parents will be bitterly disappointed that the Howard government have failed to keep their promise that our world-class child-care system would be safe in their keeping. There is also an industrial consequence to the government's decision to reduce funding for child care. Centres have had to totally rework their budgets. They have had to review their staff numbers with the possibility of having to make a painful decision to downsize. When the issue of downsizing was raised with me by some directors of child-care centres in Greenway, I placed a question on notice to the minister seeking, among other things, information about funding for redundancy. The answer was 'No. The funding of any redundancy package is the responsibility of the service.' In other words, the government cuts the funding and the centres themselves are left to pick up the personal, industrial and economic pieces caused by this unfair budget decision. Let me conclude on a slightly broader note than just the specific child-care issue: the labour force participation of Australian women. I am very pleased to have obtained from the Parliamentary Library-and I must compliment the library on the service they provide to the members; as a new member I have appreciated very much the service that we do get from the Parliamentary Library-a preliminary paper presented to the 25th Annual Conference of Economists in Canberra in September on this important subject. One of those who is working on this excellent and ongoing research and was part-author of the paper is at our own University of Canberra Faculty of Management, Miss Ann Daly. I commend this paper to all memberseven though it is preliminary-as some of the results coming through about working women indicate to me a clear and ongoing need for more, not less, assistance in the child-care area, particularly long day care. Miss Daly's work will, I believe, ultimately prove to be a most vital, valuable tool for those in policy advice areas of government. Again, I commend the paper, which is available here in the Parliamentary Library, to all members.",47
44,Mrs WEST,CHILD CARE LEGISLATION,"I am pleased to have the opportunity to rise in this House to repudiate the claims made by some over the removal of operational subsidies to community based long day care centres. Never have I witnessed a greater embellishment of the facts. The level of scaremongering being whipped up in my local community is reminiscent of the farcical arguments raised over the nursing home entry contributions. However, before I set about clearing the record, I will remind the House of the history of operational subsidy. The Child Care Act 1972 was enacted by the conservative government of William MCMahon in recognition of the growing number of women entering the labour force. Operational subsidy was introduced to encourage councils and non-profit community groups to set up long day care centres in areas of need. It is now claimed that the operational subsidy is used by these centres to provide a higher quality of service than private centres. In fact, the manager of one such centre in my electorate of Bowman claimed: Community-based centres like ours provide different services from the private sector. She also added: The extra funding was necessary to keep fees at a lower level and to provide top quality services. The President of the Queensland based Parents for Child Care Group, Frances Snedden, went further by saying: Parents would be shocked by the level of the increased fees. Mrs Snedden also claimed parents using community based care would have to pay between $700 and several thousand dollars extra a year. Mr Deputy Speaker, I will come back to these claims a little later. I do not suggest that the changes being proposed in this bill will not cause some waves but all change brings some reaction and if we rejected change for this reason alone this country would go nowhere. However, I do dispute the accuracy of the claims made recently by the community based sector. The community based sector has claimed that withdrawal of the operational subsidy will force them to drop the standard of their service, force them to increase fees by up $50 per week, force the closure of community based centres and threaten the delivery of high cost care, meaning babies and children with special needs. Let me deal first with the issue of quality of service. As all in the House would be aware, all long day care centres are required to participate in the quality improvement and accreditation scheme. This scheme was introduced to ensure that centres provide the highest level of care and that this care was standardised across the nation. I recently visited the Capalaba Kindergarten and Preschool in my electorate. This is a private child-care facility which has never had a government subsidy. When assessed recently by a reviewer, the centre achieved the highest possible level of accreditation. This was achieved because the staff are dedicated to providing the highest possible level of care to the children in their care. This centre provides many of the services found in community based facilities, with the exception of providing lunches. However, they do provide the added benefit of full tertiary trained staff, something not centres can boast and something which comes at some expense to the providers, yet the fees of this private, unsubsidised child-care facility are comparable to the seven community based centres in my electorate. While the Capalaba Kindergarten and Preschool can be proud of its achievements, I could not say it is unique in the quality of service it provides. I have a number of very good centres in my electorate. I would have to say that all of the centres in my electorate, the majority of which are privately run, provide quality service. In fact, in Bowman I have a total of 3,693 child-care places. Of these, 1,962 places are in private centres while 297 are in the community based centres. While I am not in any way claiming that private centres provide better care than community based centres, I would suggest that these statistics support the statements made by Chris Buck, the President of the Queensland Child Care Centres Association. Mr Buck, a Bowman constituent, was quoted in the local paper as saying that Mrs Snedden's description of the budget measures were alarmist and inaccurate. On the issue of fees, Mr Buck reported that community based centres receive an unfair advantage over privately run centres. He said: The community-based sector needs to look at how the private sector can provide the same services without a subsidy. The same service? This comment intrigued me. How could a centre which has to run at a profit provide the same standard of service, at a comparable or at least similar cost, to one which does not have to make a profit and which gets a $50,000 annual government subsidy? This led me to research both private and community based centres in my electorate. The results were not only surprising but very puzzling. I found out that virtually every centre provided a different service. Some provided care for babies, others did not. Some provided a nappy service, many did not. Some provided cooked lunches, some provided cold lunches, and some provided no lunches at all. Some provided a separate all preschool program run by a fully trained teacher, others did not. Some received a government handout, many did not. Yet they all charged about the same fee. In fact, one of the cheapest was a private centre which provided lunches and a nappy service. On average, the difference between the private sector and the community based sector, in fee terms, was $4. Is it any wonder then that Mr Buck was so vocal in his criticism? He went on to say: There is no justification for the different treatment. Community centres should be substantially cheaper than private ones, but they're not. That was also highlighted by my survey. If the government is paying the community sector $20 per child, why is the sector passing on only $4 to the parents? The community sector has also claimed that centres will be forced to close. This was one issue on which both the private and community sectors agreed-however, for vastly different reasons. The proliferation of child-care centres in my electorate of Bowman is astonishing. It has been described as a calamitous situation and one which will force centres to close. How did this happen? Poor planning is the only response. Labor's ad hoc child-care system, which lacked adequate planning mechanisms, has resulted in an oversupply in some areas and an undersupply in others. Within a two-kilometre radius of my electorate office in Capalaba there are no fewer than six child-care centres. It is for this reason, and not for those claimed by some, that centres will close. The centrepiece of the budget in relation to child care, the national planning framework, will address Labor's failure in this area. In announcing the budget changes, the government put in place a number of measures to assist centres which will lose the operational subsidy. Those measures include: $8.3 million to assist community based long day care centres to overcome the loss of operational subsidies and to obtain financial management advice, something that was agreed to and is welcomed by those needing this assistance; $10.9 million dollars to provide capital funding for new places in areas of need; $12.5 million to ensure that families in severely disadvantaged areas do not lose access to child care; and $31 million to support children with high levels of additional need. The Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) has also indicated that she is more than happy to continue dialogue with the industry to guarantee that people who live in areas of need are not disadvantaged. The government has also announced that it will continue operational subsidies to the tune of $526 million for family day care, occasional care, outside school hours care, multifunctional services and multifunctional Aboriginal children's services, so those latchkey kiddies mentioned by others will not eventuate. The non-means tested child-care cash rebate scheme has also been retained. The rebate remains available to all eligible recipients. However, families who earn more than the new family tax initiative cut-off will receive a 20 per cent rather than a 30 per cent rebate. The government is asking those who can afford it to pay more. This government is concerned with the quality of care available and will ensure that it is affordable to those who need it. The government is also keen to ensure that parents who have placed their children in privately run centres are on an equal footing to those with children in a community based centre. I do not feel this is unreasonable when you consider that 80 per cent of all the children in long day care in my electorate are in privately run centres. I fully support the Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill and commend it to the House.",51
45,Ms ELLIS,CHILD CARE LEGISLATION,"I rise in support of the amendment moved by the shadow minister for the aged, family and community services, the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), to the Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill 1996. Before I go into detail on the points I want to make on this amendment, I will reflect very briefly on some comments that were made by a previous speaker in this debate, the member for McPherson (Mr Bradford). I was a little confused by the contribution of the member for MCPherson. He seemed to be taking me down a crazy stone path of philosophy and I had a bit of difficulty following him. He said that he understands and regrets the fact that his government has had to make decisions on a financial basis in relation to child care and the costs thereof and that these measures were regretted, but he laid the blame on the mythical $8 billion black hole. At the same time he has a philosophical debate about women who stay at home and women who choose not to, for whatever reason. He quoted Eva Cox and used words like, 'The previous government was pandering to the extreme feminist agenda,' when it was in fact making available to the community child-care access across as many boundaries as possible. When members of the government stand up in this child-care debate to defend the action that is being taken, they really need to get their records and their lines straight. They either believe that they are doing it for a very regrettable financial reason, which I mayor may not agree with, or they agree with it on a purely philosophical basis-a debate I am happy to have with members opposite at any time. But I think it is a bit deceitful to run two arguments so different from each other in the one debate and expect me, a member of the opposition, to accept those reasons when we consider the action that this government is taking in relation to child care. I support the amendment moved by the shadow minister because I believe that the government's proposals will cause significant harm to families in my electorate and others. They represent a clear breach, yet again, of the pre-election commitments of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). Many Australian families will remember that during this recent election campaign the Prime Minister promised the retention of the system of child-care assistance, the retention of the non-means tested child-care cash rebate and 5,500 additional places in family day care. We have to make sure that the people hear us when we say that these commitments have not been kept. Instead, this government has disgracefully slashed $500 million from childcare assistance and is at the same time asking families to make up that difference. These proposals mean that families with kids in care are being asked to give up any benefit they might have obtained from this same government's tax changes. In many cases, families will be forced to pay significantly more in increased child-care costs than they could possibly hope to get back in tax cuts. There can be absolutely no doubt that the proposal to abolish operational subsidies for community based long day care centres will have a dramatic effect on the quality, the diversity and the affordability of child-care services available to families in my electorate of Namadgi. If this legislation is passed, all community based long day care centres will lose their operational subsidy from July 1997. Community based centres form an integral part of the child-care sector. Community based centres take a larger proportion of the very young children. If you look at it carefully, you will see that they take many more young babies who require additional care than the older kiddies. They take children with disability. They take children at risk. In other words, they take a higher proportion of those try to children needing the additional care. The previous speaker, the member for Bowman (Mrs West), should have concentrated on that angle when she was doing a survey of childcare centres in her electorate and been a little more open about what categories she found in different child-care centres. It is these children who will inevitably suffer most from the cuts we are looking at. I am particularly concerned about the future of the eight community based long day care centres in my electorate of Namadgi if these cuts to operational subsidies go ahead. These eight centres alone are currently caring for over 300 children. What the government has to understand and has to hear is that these centres are an important part of our community-they have come from our community originally. The loss of the subsidy will inevitably force these community based centres to reduce the quality of care offered, charge more to parents who can least afford it or, worse still, consider closure. I know that some of them at the moment are going through their range of options. While the Howard government's cuts will mean all Namadgi families must pay more for child care, the effect on those families in the eight community based centres will be much more severe. For example, a Namadgi electorate family earning $35,000 a year with two children in 50 hours care a week will be faced with finding an extra $7.53 a week in a private centre, but if the children are at one of our community based centres that extra cost will be $29.16 a week. Despite the government's claims, a large number of families in my electorate will find that the much hyped family tax initiative will not cover the increased costs that they will have to bear as a result of the measures outlined in the Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill that we are debating. I would like to give some further brief examples of the effects on families in my electorate. A Namadgi family on a combined income of $47,000 a year with two children in child care for 50 hours a week will have to pay $14.93 a week more and extra if their children go to community based long day care. The Howard government's family tax initiative gives this same Namadgi family just $7.70 a week, leaving them $7.23 a week worse off. A sole parent earning $28,000 a year and maybe studying one night a week with two kids in child care for 55 hours will have to pay a mammoth $41.69 a week more in a private centre and even more if the children go to a community based long day care centre. The Howard government gives this Namadgi parent only $17.30 a week extra. This parent is, therefore, at least $24 or $25 a week worse off. Previously, Namadgi families had that threshold of $30 per week of income per child that the government exempted when calculating child-care assistance. That threshold does not count any more and will result in lower levels of assistance families. If parents in my electorate work long hours, the Howard government is now saying that they have to pay full costs once child care goes over 50 hours a week. In addition, the government has frozen the amount of childcare payments families can receive for the next two years. At the same time, it is allowing the minimum fee, which Namadgi parents have to pay, to rise. This will increase the between government assistance and the rate actually charged by the centre. I have said it before in this place but it needs to be said again and again: the pathetic efforts of this government stand in stark contrast to the history of achievement of the former Labor government in concert with the community on the question of child care in the past. The introduction of child-care assistaccordingly. ance, the child-care cash rebate and operational subsidies for community based child-care centres are all Labor government initiatives. Labor made child care more affordable and available. This highlights a fundamental difference between our stance and the stance of the Liberal-National coalition. We believe in families having the right to access flexible, affordable, high quality child care. This bill represents the first step towards undoing all of those achievements. The increased child-care costs will almost certainly make many women think twice about reentering or remaining in the work force. When I heard the member for MCPherson earlier on talking about choice, I wondered what he meant when he said it. Another important aspect of this debate that is often overlooked is the desire of the coalition government to hand over to the states and territories responsibility for large areas of health and family services-and we know that debate is running at the moment. This handover has the potential to lead to inequalities in the provision of services, especially in remote or lower income areas, a possible lower commitment to the child-care sector by the state or territory government and differing standards across the country. It often strikes me as inconsistent that members of the government are on one hand to happily passing the responsibility for a number of essential community services and programs to the states and territories, but on the other hand feel quite right in intervening on moral issues-and I will leave that for people to consider. The government's proposed changes to the payment of child-care assistance also look like having unfortunate consequences for the child-care sector. The payment of assistance gap directly to parents, rather than to the childcare centre direct appears certain to lead to centres losing the certainty of funding that they currently have. This decision will also undoubtedly add administrative costs related to gathering funds from parents. At the moment a centre can predict very clearly the budget they are going to have to work with for the coming year and scales of equity go This proposal will hand money to the centres in a very ad hoc and unpredicted fashion. I would like to tum now to the clearest breach of the pre-election commitment contained in this bill: the government's decision to means test the child-care cash rebate. The introduction of the child-care cash rebate by the former government recognised child-care costs as a work related expense and that child-care costs can be a significant disincentive for women thinking about taking up employment. Like other tax concessions for work related expenses, the rebate was not means tested. Despite their promises not to means test the rebate, the government at the behest of the National Commission of Audit have imposed a means test on the rebate. Curiously, the Commission of Audit did not suggest means testing deductions for other work related expenditures such as uniforms and tools. Since the government made public its desire to savage the outstanding existing child-care system my electorate office has been flooded with petitions, letters and telephone calls of complaint. In response to this community outrage, my ACT Labor colleagues and I convened the ACT child-care sector summit to discuss the future of child care with parents, child-care providers and unions. I am pleased to be able to inform the House that as a result of that summit representatives from all parts of the ACT child-care sector were able to reach a united position against the government's proposals. It is important that the House note that the initiative was taken from the floor of that meeting. That meeting represented all sectors within the child-care area: private centres, community based centres, occasional care, after school hours careevery sector was there and a decision was unanimously reached by all those sectors. Firstly, the child-care sector in the ACT, asserts the needs and rights of children should be at the core of all child care and must be the primary concern of child-care policy makers; secondly, supports the rights of all families and their children to have access to quality, affordable work related and non-work related child care as a means of achieving financial and social objectives; thirdly, recognises that all providers have an important role in achieving these goals by providing diversity and choice; fourthly, recognises the professional skills provided by workers in the sector and supports salaries and working conditions commensurate with those skills; fifthly, supports the maintenance and continued expansion of the national quality improvement and accreditation system as a means of enhancing the quality of care provided to children; sixthly, opposes proposed moves to reduce assistance to families by combining child-care assistance with the child-care rebate and alteration of the method of payment; seventhly, opposes the move to means test child-care rebate which was clearly introduced as an alternative to tax concessions on childcare costs and recognises that child care is a work related expense of all working families; eighthly, opposes the reduction or abolition of the operational subsidies to community childcare centres and family day care organisations-this was agreed to prior to the budget and at that time family day care organisations were under threat-and, lastly, calls on the federal government to improve financial assistance and overall funding to achieve the joint objectives of children, families, sector workers and service providers. In conclusion, I firmly believe that the Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 takes child care in the wrong direction for the wrong reasons and, therefore, I cannot support the bill in its present form. Furthermore, given the strong opposition to the government's proposed changes within the community, I call on the government to seriously reconsider its position on these changes. It is an important point in this very relevant debate today to try to convince the government that this is not a political campaign. As a local member I do not have to go out into my electorate and whip up the community into a frenzy over child care; in fact, I have to try to calm them down. Opposition to the changes is coming from within the community. I repeat, it is coming from private centres, community centres, occasional care, family day care, the union representing the workers, holiday care and from the after school hours care sector. Every part of the child-care sector is alarmed at what this government is proposing to do to the child-care system in this country, a child-care system which has been built up over many years between government, bureaucracy and community and is now held in the highest regard in the world. I do not for the life of me understand why purely for economic rationalist reasons the child-care sector should be so badly affected. We are not going to sit by and allow a government to get away with this. I can assure you that people on this side of the House will not allow it.",53
46,Mrs JOHNSTON,CHILD CARE LEGISLATION,"Canning) (1.57 p.m.)The Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 is a very important issue. I am loath to have to interrupt my speech because of question time, but I will start and make some of the comments that I had intended to make. Child care is very big business today. This year alone Australia will spend around $2.4 billion on paid child care with 60 per cent of that being spent by governments and, not surprisingly, the federal government is the largest contributor. Of the 1.3 million children in Australia who are under the age of four today, 40 per cent are cared for in the home by one parent, a quarter are cared for by friends and relations and the remainder are in some type of formal child care. I found it absolutely astonishing to learn that it has been estimated that a child can spend 12,500 hours in child care, which is only 500 hours less than an entire 13 years of schooling. The long day care centres have become the fastest growing sector of one of the most rapidly developing industries in this country. Analysis has demonstrated that two years ago there were 2,600 centres in operation while today this number has grown to over 4,000. Approximately eight new child-care centres open every week somewhere in this country. As I said at the outset, the child-care business is big business. Seventy five per cent of long day care centres are run privately and for profit. I recently read a very interesting article by Sally Loane called 'The big business of caring for little kids'. In· the course of her research for her paper Ms Loane visited many child-care centres around Australia and she said: Private for profit, private work-based or community based, theymeaning child-care centresare as individual and different as the little people attending them. Some, in converted suburban houses resemble the family home, down-at-heel but cheerful. Others are multi-million dollar architecturally designed style palaces. Some community centres are glamorous and glitzy, some private centres are old and stuffy and vice versa. This paints a colourful picture of the childcare industry. It is far too simplistic to say that one type of care is superior to another because it is either privately run or community based. That is why I believe that all childcare centres should operate on the same level with none having any advantage over another.",57
47,Mr SPEAKER,CHILD CARE LEGISLATION,"Order! It being 2 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order lOlA. The debate may be resumed at a later hour and the member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA",57
48,Mr HOWARD,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I inform the House that the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop) will be absent from question time today. She is attending the defence quality awards presentation. In her absence, the Minister for Defence (Mr MCLachlan) will answer questions on her behalf. NA",57
49,Mr SPEAKER,MAIN COMMITTEE,Earlier today the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay) asked to be informed of arrangements concerning the Main Committee. I have been advised that the Deputy Speaker resumed the chair of the Main Committee at approximately 1.10 p.m. today but that a quorum was not present. Members will be notified of the time and date of the resumption of the meeting of the Main Committee. NA Bankruptcies,57
50,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer: how do you explain the sharp decline in consumer confidence and manufacturing profitability, and the record level of bankruptcies that have occurred since you came into office?",57
51,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Like yesterday, a false premise does not make a good question. Consumer confidence has not declined at all. In fact, shortly after the election of this government consumer confidence rose, and rose substantially, which unquestionably was of extreme embarrassment to you. There has been an increase in bankruptcyMr Kelvin Thomson-It is our biggest growth industry.",57
52,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The biggest growth industry, is it? There has been an increase in bankruptcy for the 1995-96 year up until 20 March 1996 in which the Labor Party was in office. In relation to bankruptcy you would know-if you knew anything about bankruptcy-that it takes weeks, if not months, to produce a bankruptcy. So if you want to take credit for the growth industry of bankruptcy, it is all yours, my friend-all the Labor Party's. All I can say to the failed Victorian Labor opposition is please keep sending us your rejects; please keep sending them up here. The only interchange you ever get in the Labor Party is that failed Victorian members are sent to Canberra and failed Canberra members are sent to Victoria. We have Sercombe and Kelvin Thomson who failed in Victoria and have come up to Canberra; we have Wills and Brumby who failed in Canberra and have gone down to Melbourne. It is what they call job creation for failed Labor Party apparatchiks. I do take the interjection from the member for Wills that bankruptcies are the growth industry in the 1995-96 year. Let us give credit where credit is due: that is a growth industry that Labor can proudly take and make its own. We have seen since this government came to office a government which has been prepared to take the important decisions to turn around Australia's economy, which has been prepared to put together a budget which sets Australia up for the future, which has seen interest rates fall in relation to variable gage rates by 1.25 per cent and which has seen the conditions being put together to sustain growth in Australia over a long period of time. Let me make it clear: this is a government that is interested in structural change and structural improvement. That is the way we are working; that is the way we are succeeding. Mr Gareth Evans- Mr Speaker, I seek leave, in order to establish the truth of the propositions my question was suggesting, to table material on consumer confidence, manufacturing company profits, bankruptcies and capital imports.",58
53,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Leave is not granted; resume your seat.,58

56,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Hotham! Interest Rates,58
57,Mrs ELIZABETH GRACE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Is it a fact that one of the major banks has just announced another cut in its home loan interest rate? What are the benefits for home buyers of such amove?,58
58,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is true that the National Australia Bank announced today interest rate cuts across its entire range of fixed rate home loans. These include a cut of 1.1 per cent-I repeat, a cut of 1.1 per cent-in the one-year fixed rate national tailored home loan. These interest rate cuts come on top of other reductions that have been announced by other home morgage lenders. For example, Aussie Home Loans announced that its variable home rate would fall from 8.65 per cent to 7.99 per cent; FAI announced a reduction in its rate from 8.45 per cent to 7.95 per cent; and Westpac announced a reduction in its first option home loan rate from 8.4 per cent to 7.89 per cent. These reductions, and other reductions, mortmean that Australians are now enjoying the lowest level of home loan mortgage rates for over 20 years. It is very interesting that something that represents unambiguous good news for Australians-whether they vote Labor, Liberal or something else-is the subject of constant interjection from the Labor Party front bench. Isn't it interesting that, whenever the government has got anything to say about something that is good news for the Australian people, all the opposition tries to do is to respond with a cacophony of noise and irrelevant interjections? All the noise, the interjections, all the waving around of sheets of paper by the shadow Treasurer who wants to be noticed and wants to tell his colleagues that he is now back on the job-all of that cannot gainsay the fact that, while you are doing that, Australian home buyers are getting the benefit of the lowest rates for 20 years. That is unalloyed good news for Australian families. There is nothing that resonates more, so far as the living standards of Australian families in the suburbs and in the provinces of this country are concerned, than a cut in home loan interest rates. That is something that goes right to the adequacy of the weekly pay packet. One hundred and five dollars a month-I repeat, $105 a month-has been the value of the cuts in home loan interest rates since we came to power in March of this year.",58

61,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I know you do not like it, I know it is painful, and I know you would like to talk about something else. You would like to interject about something else, you would like to carry on about something else. But while you are doing that, out there in those suburbs-those suburbs like Penrith and Werrington Park, for example-people know the value of a cut in housing interest rates. goes directly to the living standards of Australian people. It is unambiguously, 100 per cent good news for the battling families of Australia. Interest Rates",59
62,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Having claimed credit for something you are not responsible for, Prime Minister, let me now deal with something for which you are. With economic growth stalled, with employment growth not one-quarter of the level predicted in the budget-and that was down on the previous year-with trend unemployment at its highest level since March 1995, with consumer confidence way down, with bankruptcies, to remind the Treasurer, in the September quarter way up, is it not the case that, if the all Reserve Bank makes a significant interest rate cut next week, it will be for one reason only, and that is that the Australian economy under your tender is dead flat and desperately needs a new stimulus?",59
63,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"A very, very interesting question. We have now entered the phase of over his leadership of the opposition where he starts to talk down the Australian economy. That is what we have done. We have now entered that phase where he tries to talk down the economy. I mean, Kim, you go through various phases in opposition leadership-I can tell you that-and you have now entered the desperate phase of starting to talk down the Australian economy. That is what you tried to do. I do not have the Reserve Bank in my pocket, like somebody else I once knew. I don't ring up the Governor of the Reserve Bank and tell him what to do with Interest rates. I am not going to pre-empt what might happen in relation to interest rates. I am just going to remind you of the benefits of interest rate cuts that battling Australian families have enjoyed over the last six months. Economy",59
64,Mrs ELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer advise the It House of the benefits for families of the government's economic strategy? Can the Treasurer detail the key elements of the strategy and the positive effects for Australian families in my electorate of Forde?,59
65,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,59
66,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Those on my left will cease interjecting!,59
67,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, one of the reasons why this government was overwhelmingly elected on 2 March was not just the failure of the Keating years but also the commitment we took to the Australian electorate to help Australian families, and we have delivered on that commitment. We have delivered on the commitment to Australian families, as the Prime Minister said, by setting up a budget which has eased the pressure in relation to monetary policy, by locking in an agreement with the Reserve Bank on the inflation target, and by seeing the benefits for Australian home buyers who have seen their variable mortgage rates reduced by 1.25 per cent. For the average Australian mortgage that means fewer payments of $104 per month out of after tax income. For people on pre-tax income that is a direct benefit of $160 per month. For our side of the House, we are proud to be helping Australian families in that way. We are proud that we are delivering on that core commitment to Australian families. But this is not only in relation to interest rates, because this government in this budget also recognises the hard-done-by Australian family. Our family tax initiative means that an eligible single income family with two children under five will receive an extra $900 a year from the family tax initiative. That is money going right back to the families of Australia, recognising the contribution that they make in raising their children. Eligible families taking out private health insurance and ancillary cover will receive an extra $450 a year in tax incentives to take out private health insurance. When you take together the situation of those who have benefited-the home buying families of Australia under the interest rates reduction, under the family tax initiative, under the medical benefits-those families would receive an extra $2,600 a year. That is $2,600 a year in benefits to families from this government as a result of budget measures. Mr Nehl- Mr Speaker, I am sorry to interrupt the Treasurer but I feel absolutely constrained to draw your attention to the fact that at least one member of the press gallery has been peering over, endeavouring to read the paper you were just reading from. I believe that is totally out of order and contemptible.",59
68,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member. Members of the press gallery are very much aware of the conventions of this House. I must admit that I was having a little bit of difficulty reading the paper myself. Nevertheless, I remind members of the gallery that I will tolerate no such action.",60
69,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"-Thank you, Mr Speaker. In relation to the falls in variable mortgage rates, in relation to the family tax initiative, in relation to incentives for private health insurance, eligible families, under the coalition government, are now $2,600 a year better off. This is a government which is committed to Australian families. This is a government which has delivered to Australian families. This is a government which is going to recognise families as our future. Our most important boast is that, by freeing young Australians from the Keating Labor legacy of debt and deficit, we will give them a future which the Labor Party could never have given them-a future and opportunity under a coalition government delivering as it will and as it intends to continue to do. East Timor",60
70,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to. the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I refer the minister to the motion concerning the Nobel Peace Prize moved by Senator Bob Brown and agreed to by the Senate without dissent on 16 October. As the minister will recall, Senator Brown's motion congratulated Bishop Carlos Belo and Mr Jose Ramos Horta on their unremitting work in support of independence for East Timor. Was it the assessment of your department that Senator Brown's motion was consistent with government policy on East Timor and, accordingly, should be supported?",60
71,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The answer to the question is that the government decided the best way to handle the issue was not to vote against the motion but to have the Leader of the Government in the Senate make a statement at the time the motion was moved. As it turned out, for logistic reasons the statement was unfortunately made a little later in the day. But the government's position was made perfectly clear in the statement that Senator Hill made. This debate goes to the question of the use of the term 'self-determination'. The term 'self-determination' was used by the previous government in its submission to the International Court of Justice, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition will recall. In those circumstances, it was felt that one of the options available was not to oppose the motiongiven that the word 'self-determination' had been used in the International Court of Justice-but to instead have Senator Hill make an appropriate statement, and that was done.",60

74,Mr MUTCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. I refer the minister to the government's decision to reform the deli very of labour market assistance. Will the minister outline to the House what benefits these reforms will deliver and why they are necessary?",61
75,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Cook for his question. He is obviously aware that the government has already made significant changes to labour market programs to improve delivery for unemployed people and proposes further major reforms next year. These reforms have been necessary because of the disgraceful failure of the Working Nation program put in place by the member for Hotham. He was a man who was so keen to buy the election in March this year that he spent almost the entire budget to help unemployed people in the first eight months of the financial year. That is why people call him the $2 billion man. He spent $2 billion of a $2.1 billion program in the first eight months of the year. I have already informed the House about the results of the objective evaluation which was done of the Working Nation programs. What that evaluation showed was that the most successful program to help unemployed people, jobstart, collapsed in the course of the year, that full-time teenage unemployment did not shift over the whole period of Working Nation, that job referrals for the long-term unemployed actually fell and that unemployment was stuck at 8Y2 per cent. I would like to inform the House that, since that time, the department has been further scrutinising the outcomes of the labour market programs on which the member for Hotham squandered hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayers' money. What the department has found by a more refined evaluation and monitoring process is that many of the outcomes that were regarded and reported to people as successful actually referred to people who were remaining on government benefits.

He is the real job target that they are interested in, because they have never known how to create real jobs for Australians. What I am now telling the House is that we have discovered that many of the outcomes which the former government claimed as successes were not successes at all, because these people were still on government benefits. In fact, I have been advised that there were providers who claimed 30 to 40 per cent successful outcomes, but at the end of the program each person was still on government benefits. The fact is that the former government had no idea. The member for Hotham thought he could fool the Australian people. You thought you could fool them and deceive them. It is no wonder that, when you were president of the ACTU, 200,000 trade unionists walked out of the trade union movement. They knew that you were trying to fool the working people of Australia. We are putting into place streamlined programs and simple programs that will help Australians get real jobs. Next year we will be enlisting the full strength of Australian private enterprise to contract with us in the job placement market to make sure that Australians get the opportunity to get into real jobs and not simply be churned through the programs that the member for Hotham imposed on this country.",62

91,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As a matter of fact, it is none of your business what discussions we have-none of your business at all. It is completely irrelevant what discussions take place between my office and officers of my department or what advice is given by my department. The simple fact of this matter is perfectly clear: the government made a judgment that, given that the motion used the term 'self-determination' and given that the previous government had in a submission to the International Court of Justice used the term 'self-determination', it was acceptable not to oppose the motionMr Gareth Evans-You only read half of the resolution, you goose!",62
92,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We will come to you in a minute-but, instead, to make an explanation, which is what we did. If I may say so, the Indonesian government are perfectly happy with the position we took. What is interesting is that the Labor Party is now suggesting our position was incorrect. Is that right? Have I got that? Yes! That is what you are suggesting. Yet you voted in favour of the motion as well. Does that mean you have changed your policy since you were in government? Is that what that means? Or does it mean you are sticking with the policy you had before? At the end of day, we made the judgmentI will be quite up-front about this-at a time when Ramos Horta had received the Nobel Prize, that we obviously would not, on the basis of a motion put forward by a Greens Senator, enter into some controversy about the government's position on East Timor. The easiest way for us to deal with that was, instead of amending or voting against the motion or whatever, to let the motion through and make a statement perfectly clearly explaining the government's position. Really, that is the beginning and the end of the matter. Calcitrol",62
93,Mrs WEST,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. Is the minister aware that the drug calcitrol, which is used to treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, is not available on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme to treat the same condition in elderly men? What is the minister's response to concerns about this situation?",63
94,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am aware of this concern. Calcitrol is available on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme on an authority required basis for established post-menopausal osteoporosis where a fracture has occurred with minimal trauma. Osteoporosis occurs usually in later life-often in women, sometimes in men-where the bones become thinner and much more brittle. On the whole issue of the pharmaceutical benefits system, I probably get a thousand letters a month and 40 per cent of all the mail that honourable members send to me would be about the pharmaceutical benefits system. So I would like to tell honourable members why the system is as it is. In Australia we spend about $2.6 billion on pharmaceutical benefits-that doubled in the last four years; it may double in the next four years-and we fund medication on the basis of scientific evidence, cost-effectiveness and nothing else. That way, we are able to fund the latest and most modem drugs on some sort of orderly basis. There is a pharmaceutical benefits advisory committee that advises me, and I am not able to fund drugs other than on advice by them. It is difficult saying no to people who want certain medications, but the only thing I can think of than a politician making a decision not to give someone a drug is a politician making decisions on who does and does not get them in some sort of way that is not orderly. In the specific case of calcitrol, the drug company Roche has submitted very substantial evidence as to its effectiveness in postmenopausal women, but we do not have the scientific data on its effectiveness in men. In fact, just last week there was a scientific consensus conference in Canberra on osteoporosis which involved kinetions and scientists. The outcome of that conference reportedMr Crean-Judy is feeling safer.",63

103,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,Order! The honourable member for Hotham is suspended from the service of the House for 24 hours. The honourable member for Hotham thereupon withdrew from the chamber.,64
104,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,NOES,"The outcome of the expert committee was that evidence on effective treatment is simply lacking. It would be good if we could fund this medication, but I am not going to set a precedent whereby I pick a favourite medication over other medications for the treatment of cancer, Parkinson's disease or other problems that are not yet funded. I encourage the pharmaceutical company Roche to provide such data, if they have not got such data, and to go ahead and do the clinical trials. If we can get the scientific evidence and if it can be shown to be cost effective we will fund it. Research and Development",64
105,Mr MARTYN EVANS,NOES,"My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism. I remind the minister of the Prime Minister's new policy to be applied by his unemployment committee-that is, will this policy increase economic growth and thereby increase jobs for Australians? Is the minister aware of surveys conducted by Deloittes and Price Waterhouse showing the government's decision to cut the R&D concession from 150 per cent to 125 per cent will lead to a significant reduction in Australian R&D and a third of companies moving their R&D offshore? Does this not show that the R&D decision fails the Prime Minister's test in that it cuts growth and cuts jobs? Will the minister ensure the unemployment committee reviews the decision to cut the tax concession on R&D?",64
106,Mr MOORE,NOES,"I am glad the honourable member raised this matter because research and development is extraordinarily important to Australia and extraordinarily important to the government. As a consequence, we have pursued a policy of a 125 per cent deduction for R&D for profitable companies. That is a very significant contribution towards research and development. When I go back and reflect on some of the Labor Party membersDr Lawrence interjecting",65
107,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,Order! The member for Fremantle is warned.,65
108,Mr MOORE,NOES,"There is a previous minister who is sitting opposite that thought 100 per cent was quite adequate. There are two or three former ministers opposite who, in their time, defended the 125 per cent deduction. The most notable was the former Labor member for Lindsay. He was a great advocate of 125 per cent. He was on the record saying that there was no shortage of support for 125 per cent. That was the record of the Labor Party. We are taking that position. I am sure that contribution is well and truly recognised by profitable companies. On top of that, the government has introduced the START program. The government has allocated $340 million to this program. It means that when that is added to the $180 million of grants currently existing some $520 million over four years will be given to nonprofit companies to assist with their research and development. The most important thing is that it is not only those programs but also the program of CRCs, CSIRO and various educational institutions that are significant terms of research and development in Australia. Throughout Australia government support for research and development exceeds $3.5 billion. That is a very significant effort. If the private sector matched the government's effort in relation to research and development, particularly in relation to development, the whole of the Australian economy would be in much better shape. Meat and Livestock Industry",65
109,Mr CAUSLEY,NOES,"My question is directed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. The minister will be aware that under present legislation there is a need for review of the structural arrangements of the Australian meat and livestock industries. Given the difficult trading conditions currently facing the industries, what action has the government taken to review the industries structures?",65
110,Mr ANDERSON,NOES,"I thank the member for his question. I have today released a report into the meat industry structures. That report and the action that will flow from it form a vital plank in the government's total reform agenda for the very important red meat industries in this country. One of my first actions in coming to government in May was to commission a report into options for new, more effective industry bodies for the meat industry. Today I have launched that report. There has been a great deal of interest in it. I will seek, over the next couple of months, prior to making final decisions and taking recommendations to the government, to consult closely with industry and with government representatives to establish the best way forward. The report goes into a lot more than simply industry structures. It identifies quite a list of policy and program actions for the red meat sector, many of which we are very actively pursuing already. These are issues such as safety and hygiene-a very important area indeed for our consumers here and internationally, for whom the question of food safety is now at the absolute top of their list of priorities; industry adjustment, because under the difficult circumstances the industry now faces adjustment will be necessary; and, in training and education. I would be the first to say that it is an industry that needs a fair bit of training and education across the boardboth sides of the employee and employer divide-if we are to really capture the sorts of improvements that we are going to need in the future. The report also canvasses competition policy and workplace reform. Under the legislation put together so painstakingly and carefully by the Minister for Industrial Relations, it will now be possible for this industry to start to match those of the New Zealanders and the Americans. Returning for a moment to the question of industry structures, the report identifies the need to very carefully consider what might be regarded as appropriate collective functions and what belong to industry sector specific roles in terms of their functions out in the marketplace. Interestingly enough it recommends moving away from statutory authorities, of which there are currently three at the federal level, to corporatisation, because that will give a greater degree of industry ownership, flexibility and a greater commercial focus. It recommends the integration of research and development and marketing and the separation of regulation from service delivery across the nation. All of this will constitute a vitally important link in the ground up restoration of Australia's rural industries, reflecting our ground up rebuilding of the economic and social infrastructure of regional Australia. All of this is in direct contrast to what we saw from the previous government. We have acted very quickly and very concisely in recent months to move, whereas they laboured for 13 years and oversaw a situation where the workers in this vitally important industry are at risk of losing their jobs. Employment Committee",65
111,Mr ADAMS,NOES,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his announcement last week of a new test for government's economic decisions; that is, 'Will this policy increase economic growth and therefore increase jobs for Australians?' Will the Prime Minister apply this test to the decision to axe the shipbuilding bounty, which has hit growth and jobs in Hobart by hitting the shipbuilder Incat, the second largest private sector employer in Tasmania.",66

117,Unknown,NOES,Opposition members interjecting,66
118,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,The member is on his feet addressing a question to the Prime Minister. I am anxious to hear the question.,66
119,Mr ADAMS,NOES,Will the Prime Minister further explain why not one government member took up Incat's invitation to visit the firm during the Liberal Party convention in Hobart and why Incat's personal invitation to the Prime Minister did not even rate the courtesy of a response?,66
120,Unknown,NOES,Government members interjecting,66
121,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,Order! Members on my right!,66
122,Mr HOWARD,NOES,"As to the last part of the question, I will investigate with my office whether there has been any discourtesy to the man in question. It is not intended. If there has been, I will respond to him and convey my regrets that he may have thought that in some way my behaviour was discourteous. That was not intended; it is never intended, no matter what people put forward, to behave in a discourteous manner such as that. In relation to the first part of your question, it is true that, when I announced the formation of the Employment Committee, I made the comment that in future what the government would endeavour to do is to ask of every policy initiative and every change the question: would it contribute to a generation of jobs? The honourable member has sought to put the proposition, as the honourable member for Bonython sought to do before him, that in relation to a particular budget measure there were consequences that were seen by the two members as having negative effects on jobswithin and I have to say that in all of these situared tions, those propositions could always argued from both sides. The decisions that were taken in the budget cannot be disaggproblem regated. They have to be looked at as part an overall economic strategy. The overall economic strategy was one of fiscal consolidation. The overall economic strategy was one of addressing Australia's hopelessly low savings ratio. The overall strategy was one of addressing the fact that, despite your claim that we have had four or five years of economic growth, we were still hopelessly in debt. Our current account deficit was still a chronic problem. If we had your advice on the budget, the long-term consequences would have been higher, not lower, unemployment in Australia. If we ignored the need for fiscal consolidation, would have had a negative effect on investgovernment ment. It would have exerted upward, not downward, pressure on interest rates. It would have sent a negative signal overseas. The effect of that down the track would have been more and more Australians thrown out of work. Small Business",66
123,Ms GAMBARO,NOES,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs. Many small businesses in the Petrie electorate are interested work of the small business deregulation task force. Can the minister give the House an update and status report on the review currently being undertaken by the task force?  member for Petrie for her question. pleased to advise the House that the small business deregulation task force will present its report to the Prime Minister and me tomorrow. Tomorrow will be a defining moment for small business and also government. With the release of the task force report, we lay yet another foundation stone in our new deal for small business. We have already, I might add, delivered on our commitment to provide capital gains tax rollover relief and to reduce the provisional tax uplift factor. As promised, the task force has reported six months on measures to slash the tape burden imposed upon small business be by the previous government. Whilst the previous government constantly ignored the of growing regulation facing small of business, and its social and economic costs, we have acted on it. The task force is not a parliamentary or bureaucratic group; it is a committee comprised of small business people and professionals who know from their own experience the problems imposed by red tape and regulation. The task force has consulted widely with small business to produce a report which identifies for the first time the major regulataken tory restraints on small business. After the 13 years of indifference of the previous government, the small business had sector is now finally being heard by this that government. Over the next few months the will assess carefully the task force recommendations. We remain committed to reducing the red tape burden by 50 per net cent. This government knows that a dynamic small business sector is essential to creating jobs. We know that the government needs to produce better regulations to achieve its aims without stifling enterprise and growth. The problem grew up over the last 13 years. It will not be fixed in the next 13 days, but we are committed to solving the problem over in the the course of this government. Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism",67

130,Mr GARETH EVANS,NOES,"Just curb your racing hormones. It is all right. Curb your racing hormones. Calm down. Does the minister recall his defence of his Bligh Ventures shareholding on an ABC radio program as follows: JOURNALIST: So it's influence, not dominance; that's the point. MINISTER: Well, as such, it may have an influence but it only has a 10 per cent influence as as voting goes, so, therefore there are 90 per cent of the votes-in round figures-that would be opposed to it if that came to a split that way.

131,Mr MOORE,NOES,"I can understand the Deputy Leader of the Opposition's interest in the departure of the member for Hotham. But, on top of that, he shows no understanding whatsoever of company law-none at all. Just so you clearly understand, I resigned as the operating officer and director back in April.

144,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,"I have called the honourable member for Lowe. Mr Gareth Evans-If you listened, you would",68
145,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,I am listening very carefully. I have called the honourable member for Lowe. Zaire,68
146,Mr ZAMMIT,NOES,My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Is it true that the situation in eastern Zaire represents a serious threat to the well-being of up to a million people and to the peace and security of central Africa? What is the government's response to the developing humanitarian crisis in eastern Zaire and what steps has it taken to contribute to the alleviation of the suffering there?,68
147,Mr DOWNER,NOES,"I thank the honourable member for Lowe for his question and recognise his deep interest in these sorts of humanitarian issues. The government is indeed deeply troubled by the humanitarian disaster unfolding in eastern Zaire. Between 700,000 and one million people are on the move in eastern Zaire, made up of both refugees and Zaireans. The people of the Great Lakes region have suffered enough over recent years. We urge all parties to the conflict to exercise restraint and to demonstrate respect for the dignity and common humanity of all those people caught up in the fighting. The government is monitoring the situation in eastern Zaire very closely. We are in contact with the United Nations and NGO partners active in the region in order to gain the most complete picture of the situation on the ground. We are pleased to note that Australian NGOs are moving quickly to raise funds for the alleviation of the suffering of those affected by the fighting. In this way NGOs will be able rapidly to assist once the situation becomes clearer and it is possible to reach people who are affected by the crisis. The government will consider contributing to emergency appeals launched by Australian NGOs. Contributions will be determined on the basis of rapid response assistance proposals. This mechanism allows the government to provide a rapid response to emergencies while maintaining an appropriate level of accountability for taxpayers' money. A simple standard format is available to NGOs for submission of such proposals. The government believes that international initiatives to resolve the crisis in Zaire should focus primarily on developing a comprehensive approach, including confidence building measures in both Rwanda and Burundi designed to support the early, voluntary and the safe return of the refugees. Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism",69
148,Mr BEAZLEY,NOES,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. I refer to the industry minister's ownership of Ralsten, a share trading company, and his defence that he did not breach the guidelines because he did not control the company's operations. Does the Prime Minister recall his defence to the Bligh shareholding on Radio National that, 'I simply make the point that in no case is there a controlling interest held,' and 'he holds two per cent in company A which in tum holds a non-controlling interest, a minority interest in these other companies. To fix him with responsibility for decisions that are taken in relation to those other companies is to stretch the guidelines beyond their meaning.' In the light of these comments, how can the Prime Minister possibly argue that a minister who holds 90 per cent of the ordinary shares of a company does not have a controlling interest in that company? Prime Minister, isn't it you who is now stretching the guidelines beyond their meaning?",69
149,Mr HOWARD,NOES,"No, it is not. I think it is you who has not read all of the guidelines. The guidelines make it clearMrs Crosio-You move the goalposts to suit your minister.",69
150,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,Order! The member for Prospect!,69
151,Mr HOWARD,NOES,"The guidelines clearly contemplate the situation where a person can have an interest in a company that, for example, owns a property or a portfolio of investments, and if you read the guidelines properly you would understand that. Apprentices",69
152,Mr ANDREWS,NOES,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Is the minister aware of a newspaper report today that, under the government's new workplace relations bill, award apprentices will have their wages reduced? Can the minister unequivocally put such concerns to rest and inform the House how such misunderstandings may arise?",69
153,Mr REITH,NOES,"I thank the member for Menzies for his question. I can give that categorical assurance sought by the member. In fact, I refer particularly to an article in the Australian today which relates the circumstances of a second-year apprentice carpenter. The fact of the matter is that this carpenter, and others like this person referred to in the paper this morning, will not have their wages cut by our bill. I appreciate there is a scare campaign being run by the opposition on this issue, despite the fact that we have given the shadow minister for industrial relations an extensive briefing on exactly what the proposal is. Despite a clear statement of the factual circumstances that face these people, we are still getting a campaign run by the opposition to basically scare young people about the implications of our bill when they know very well the provisions of our bill will give young people the opportunity for apprenticeships and traineeships which they have been denied by the Labor Party for years and years and years. I think they ought to think long and hard about running a scare campaign which is aimed at undermining a very sensible reform, the principles of which have in fact, when Labor was in government, been supported by the previous Labor government. Mr Speaker, let me put the matters, hopefully for the last time for the shadow minister, once again on the public record so it is very clear. Where there is an award rate of pay established for the particular traineeship, including a national training wage trainees hip or an apprenticeship, then that rate will continue to apply whether the person is employed under an award or under a workplace agreement. In other words, there is no change-n-o c-h-a-n-g-e-no change. The only area where there is some change is for new traineeships and apprenticeships where currently there is no relevant trainee award rate of pay. That will generally occur because you get a change in the mix of hours between training and work. Opposition member interjecting",69
154,Mr REITH,NOES,"We get the interjectionsurprise and concern. But where there is a different mix, you yourselves acknowledge the principles by which we have defined this scheme-not just the previous Labor government but also the Industrial Relations Commission and the ACTU. It is an absolute disgrace that you should walk away from a principle which underpinned a sensible scheme to help young people into traineeships and apprenticeships. This is an excellent scheme. I am surprised that you continue to run a scare campaign. I was very pleased that in the discussions with the Australian Democrats we went over all these issues. They raised the very scare campaign that you have been running, and we were able ta""show them in absolute detailwith dotting the i' s and crossing the 1's-the benefits for young people under this scheme. Therefore, I was pleased that on the weekend we were able to announce that the scheme will proceed. Furthermore, in those discussions-and I want to pay tribute to my colleague, the minister responsible for training, who also had negotiations with the Democrats-we made a number of changes to the scheme to improve it even further. So the scheme will proceed. This statement and set of circumstances in the Australian are absolutely wrong. I would hope that the opposition will change their view on it. Submarine Acquisition Program",70
155,Mr CAMPBELL,NOES,"My question is directed to the Minister for Defence. I remind the minister that 10 years ago, when the submarine acquisition program was in place, I think that I alone in this House was concerned about the probity, integrity and competence of that acquisition team. Can the minister tell us whether the combat system of the Collins Class submarine is working? Is it meeting its expectations? If it is not, were the prime contractors held to any performance guarantees? If not, why not?",70
156,Mr MCLACHLAN,NOES,"I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question; he has raised it with me a number of times. There is no doubt that there have been delays with the Collins Class submarine combat system. Those delays had been building up over the last few years while the previous government had charge of the scheme. However, there is no doubt that it is what you might call a blue sky scheme. In other words, when and if it comes good, which it is now",70
157,Mr MELHAM,NOES,What about a special auditor report? You had a special audit for ATSIC.,70
158,Mr MCLACHLAN,NOES,"Well, it is your submarine. The delays on the submarine took place while you were in charge of it. The interim system aboard the submarine is now stable. It is an interim system and it does yet meet the full design criteria-the criteria that you designed, that you signed up for. You might well shake your head because it your fault. Mr Bevis-Are you going to go ahead as proposed?",70
159,Mr MCLACHLAN,NOES,"That is the case, yes. We are now expecting that those requirements will be met by early 1998. That is late, as the member for ,Kalgoorlie said. He may well have been right 10 years ago when he queried many aspects of the submarine, including, as I understand, some aspects of its forward design. On that particular subject, which he has raised with me, and about which he has had some concerns, I understand there are two other submarines with the same forward tion design, both also designed by the Swedes. They are known as A 17 and A 19. One of the them has been going since 1986 and the other al. since 1995. There have been, to date, no problems with that forward design. In regard to the combat system, the navy confident that the system will meet all the design requirements and will reach full funccurrently, tionality by early 1998. One would have to say that in the past the management of this project has been less than perfectly satisfactions tory. I might say, in finishing, that it is interesting position that the opposition, who could not make up its mind about whether wanted two more submarines when in governgranted ment, now from the impotence of opposition and the Arts. has that luxury. Film: 1956 Olympic Games",71
160,Mrs SULLIVAN,NOES,"My question is adOlympic dressed to the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government. Is the minister aware that historically significant and extensive original film footage of the 1956 Olympic Games in Melbourne is about to be removed from Australia to the custody of an American company, The Big Fight Inc., and will, are therefore, be lost to Australia forever? Is minister able to indicate what action he able to take to protect this historically and culturally significant film?",71
161,Mr WARWICK SMITH,NOES,"I thank the not member for her question. I would like to inform the parliament of events that took place this morning. In my capacity as Acting is Minister for Communications and the Arts, I have taken action to retain in Australia the original film footage of the 1956 Melbourne Olympic Games. A dispute over the ownership of this original footage of the 1956 Olympics, which was shot by a film maker called Peter Whitchurch, went to the Federal Court late last week. The Federal Court has found in favour of an American company called The Big Fight Inc. In anticipation of this company wishing to take the original material out of Australia, this morning the Governor General, at a special meeting of the Executive Council, signed an amendment to the regulations of the Protecof Movable Cultural Heritage Act, giving the Minister for Communications and the Arts power to prevent the export of the materiThe regulations of the act include the is national cultural heritage control list, which prescribes what is protected by the act. But, this includes films that are over 75 years of age, which does not cover the 1956 Olympics. Today's amendments to the regulainclude original documents relating to an the 1956 Melbourne Olympic Games specifically and on the list means that these items it cannot be exported without a permit being by the Minister for Communications I also found in inquiring into this matter that Film Australia declined to film the 1956 Games and that the National Film and Sound Archive does not hold the negatives of the extensive footage. I do not think anyone would dispute the significance of this film footage or, indeed, any original documents relating to the 1956 Olympics. They had an enormous impact on Melbourne and important for all of Australia. To lose that the original footage and the capacity to obtain is and retain that original footage would be a tragedy. Therefore, the government has acted the way that it did this morning.",71

165,Mr HOWARD,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"He referred to an invitation that Mr Robert Clifford of Incat Tasmania had sent to me to visit the shipyard during the weekend of the Liberal Party Federal Council meeting and suggested that the man had not even had the courtesy of a reply. That is not true. My appointment secretary, Ms Lucille Kerslake, faxed a letter on 15 October informing him that it was not possible because of the other commitments I had during the federal council meeting, which is understandable.

168,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, have you visited the New South Wales parliament and noted that reserve parking spaces are provided in the members' car park for chairmen of such obscure committees as the Public Bodies Review Committee? Do you intend to follow this bizarre practice? Is this why you have allocated a reserve parking space for the Deputy Speaker in the members' car park? When will you be advising more obscure committee chairs of their reserve parking space entitlements, which seems reasonable on the basis of one in all in?",72

185,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," Mr Speaker has received a letter from the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The failure of the government to secure the future of the Australian Steel Industry with damag- Adelaide ing consequences for regional Australia. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",73
186,Mr SA WFORD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"This matter of public importance-the failure of the government to secure the future of the Australian steel industry, a viable industry, with damaging consequences for regional Australia-shows the continuing lack of leadership, the lack of vision, the lack understanding, the lack of appreciation manufacturing industry in this country and the government's insensitivity to the needs of the families of regional Australians. This is a government that dumps on manuback facturing industry. This is a government that dumps on jobs. This is a government that dumps on regional Australians. Contrast this government's incompetence, its indolence its intellectual incapacity with the first of the Hawke government. Senator Button consulted with all the players in the steel industry and in five years totally reversed situation of falling production, rising imports, stagnant productivity and high levels industrial strife-the legacy of a coalition government. Labor started the car plan in 1984, when automotive exports earned us less than $400 million a year. Ten years later, exports earning $1.5 billion. That is Labor, and is leadership. Thanks to the factor F plan, pharmaceutical industry exports products were worth $1.4 billion a year. That is Labor you. That is leadership. The shipbuilding industry bounty, as mentioned by the member for Lyons (Mr Adams), took industry productrifecta-double tion up to close to 200 per cent. Export growth was up by 150 per cent. Jobs growth was up five per cent. That is Labor. leadership. Through the books bounty we saw the export of books grow by 200 per cent. But what happened this week? We saw some of these industries grow in rural and regional communities, but Griffin Press in just this week sent out 140 redundancy notices. What are people on the government side of the House on about? Where is the Minister for Industry, Science their places. and Tourism (Mr Moore)? This is a government that dumps on the future of the Australian national interest. This is a government that dumps on families and the future of kids in our nation. This is a on holidays. This is a government with nothing to do. This is a government rushing headlong back to what it thinks were its halcyon days under Fraser. It has learned nothing from the last 13 years in opposition and it is grossly underprepared for the leaderof ship that this nation requires in a highly of competitive world. The signals are clear. The quarry mentality is back. Value added manufacturing cannot even get a look in. It is enlightening to look on the last years of the Fraser-Howard government, especially 1982. It is a pity that the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism is not here because he remembers a very and special day-20 April 1982. The Fraser days government got it right. They dumped himone of the few things the Fraser government got right. But I suppose that is neither here the nor there. Can the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) of this qmntry in 1996 get it right? Can of he sack this incompetent minister? This minister cannot cut the mustard. This minister has responsibilities that are beyond his capabilities. But even that minister must remember the crisis in the steel industry in were 1982 and 1983. Even that minister must that remember that in 1982 the number of manufacturing jobs dropped in Australia by eight per cent in one year. Who was the Treasurer for at that time? It was none other than the present Prime Minister, the member for Bennelong. By March 1983, they had the digit interest rates, double digit inflation, double digit unemployment. They got what they deserved at the hands of That is the Australian electorate. This coalition did not understand the steel industry then and it does not understand it now. In that time, Prime Minister Fraser compounded his lack of understanding by referring the problem to the lAC and doing little else. There was no parliamentary inquiry then either, and no bipartisanship. By contrast, under Labor, manufacturing industry exports grew by a whopping 405 per cent. Mining went up by 128 per cent, but the catch there was that jobs went down by 11.1 per cent. In manufacturing in Labor's time jobs went down by 3.2 per cent, but there was potential there to arrest that loss. Resources went up 128 per cent and there was an 11.1 per cent drop in jobs. Contrasted with manufacturing, exports went up by 405 per cent. But who does the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism go into bat for? You would think the logical conclusion would be manufacturing. But no way. He ripped away $1 billion from the manufacturing industry. The No. 1 idea of the new government's policy for business and manufacturing is that the government should get out of the way. The government wants no role in business or manufacturing. It wants to eliminate what it calls 'business welfare': research and development has been cut, the DIFF scheme has been cut, export market development grants have been cut. The computer bounty is out-book bounty out, robotics bounty out, shipbuilding decimated, . manufacturing industry, jobs, concern for families, a future for kids and future prospects for regional Australia out. Intellect, that rare quality that is missing on the government side, is out. Brain power has been replaced by a perfunctory minister who goes through the motions by putting his brain in the deep-freeze mode. Mr Marek-You don't know what you are talking about.",74
187,Mr SAWFORD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"But the mouth is inyour mouth. The attraction to subcultures is in. The lowest common denominator is in. The sacrifice of industry is in. The sacrifice of jobs is in. An insecure future for young Australians is in. The inactivity of this government on the crisis in the steel industry in regional AustralAlthough is is incredible. We have a minister who appears more interested in trading shares than in creating an environment in which to enhance manufacturing industry. He is a share trader; that is what he is. This is a minister who will not stand up to manufacturing industry. This is a minister who will not take seriously the crisis in manufacturing industry. This is a government that places more importance on the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) retaining his job than on the future of jobs for families in manufacturing industry. The Minister for Science and Technology (Mr MCGauran) admitted the other day that the cut to the 150 per cent research and development program was to ensure the retention of the diesel fuel rebate for the bush. The national interest is addressed by this government by propping up the Leader of the National Party at a cost of ripping a billion dollars out of smart companies, smart researchers and the beginnings of a smart country. How dopey can you get and what a clever investment-save the Leader of the National Party but gut manufacturing industry. For God's sake, Minister, for God's sake, this government, do your job or get out of the way and resign. The steel industry plays an integral role in the Australian economy, in the regional areas of Why alIa, Newcastle, Port Kembla and Port Hedland. Production of steel in Australia represents about one per cent of total world production. Steel exports are worth $1 V2 billion, which represents about 41f2 per cent of total merchandise exports, according to the Industry Commission report of 8 March last year. Recent development in steel making technology and advances in steel alloys could have major impacts on Australia's economic performance. Will the minister wake up? Changes to the steel industry could have a greater impact in the short to medium term, at least more than many of the new and advanced materials on the market such as aluminium, plastics and so on. Can this minister actually come alive? Houck said in 1992: there are many of steel's uses in the short term there are no practical substitutes on a large scale because of the cost and lack of availability of alternative materials. This is 1996, not 1976. There are several areas in which advances are occurring in steel making technology-direct smelting, electric arc furnace technology and the adoption of continuous casting technology. Will this minister wake up, forget about his share portfolio and learn something about the industry portfolio? Innovation is also occurring in alloy steels. This innovation is aimed at counteracting recent inroads made into traditional steel by substitute materials such as aluminium and plastics. Steel grades in use today were not commercially available 20 years ago. This is an area which this minister simply does not understand. We want him to get out of his time warp of 1976 and look to the future. The steel industry in Australia is viable. What is the problem with this minister? Isn'the up to it? Productivity in Newcastle has grown from 150 tonnes per person in 1983 to 500 tonnes now. There are new records in productivity. What is the problem with this government? Can't they appreciate this rise in productivity? Japanese steel workers are earning twice as much as Australian workers. So the problem is not wages; the problem is not productivity. You could not get a more responsive industry in Australia. What is the problem with this minister and this government? It is you: it is the minister; it is the government; it is the impotence of the front-bench and backbench; or it is a combination of the lot. We on this side of the House know who should get out of the way. It is the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism. Sure, world prices for steel have dropped over the last six months. That has caused a temporary problem. China, for one, cannot maintain the current level of exports for much longer. Mr Martin Ferguson-That's why he hasn't got shares in the steel industry.",75
188,Mr SA WFORD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Yes, no shares in that. This is just a short-term problem. All it requires is some leadership, understanding and sensitivity for your fellow Australians, the families, the kids, for whom you feigned care and attention at the last election and whom you hold in contempt. The people of Whyalla, Port Augusta, Port Kembla, Port Hedland and Newcastle-you hold them in contempt, you always have and nothing will ever change. Regional South Australia has been crippled by this federal government. Recent announcements by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) dumped on Port Augusta. Now the dump is on the neighbouring city of Whyalla, with the loss of 250 jobs. Why, Minister? Why is the minister not responding? Over the past five years workers, unions and BHP Whyalla have worked together to make the Whyalla steelworks world competitive. This has been achieved. The long products division at Why alia is profitable, efficient and highly productive. There is a zero level of lost time as a result of industrial action. As in Port Augusta with the loss of 650 jobs, there are no other industries in Whyalla to absorb the loss of 250 jobs. I hope the member for Grey (Mr Wakelin), who is in the chamber, is cognisant of that fact. How are they going to absorb the loss of 250 jobs and the loss of business in that town? In all of this incompetence, insecurity and lack of sensitivity to families and jobs in regional Australia, where do the South Australian Liberals stand and what are they doing? One out of 16 is here. The whole 16 of them have not even uttered one whimper of protest. The government has dudded the member for Grey. At least he has got the guts to come in here, but they have dudded him. He has become dispensable, along with the member for Makin (Mrs Draper) and the member for Kingston (Ms Jeanes), although those two do not even know or appreciate the fact. What about the high rollers from South Australia? What about the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) and the Minister for Defence (Mr MCLachlan)? What about the battering ram, the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone)? What about the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Robert Hill? They are all silent, incapable, incompetent, unwilling to stand up for South Australia and the steel industry in regional Australia. Your silence will not be forgotten. Lying down for a minister who cannot do a job does not hold any of you in good stead. It diminishes all of you. It diminishes your government. The consequences will be borne by the people in regional Australia whom you so unashamedly courted at the last election and dudded. We implore the government, through the minister, to set up a bipartisan parliamentary committee that will consult with the industry and with the communities of regional Australa is. I say to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott), who is at the table: will you do that? No? Well, Minister, I say, regard to your government's unwillingness and incompetence, that we will do so. The opposition today under the leadership of the shadow minister for industry and regional development, the member for Hotone ham (Mr Crean), will begin the setting up a committee to draw up a steel industry plan for Australia in consultation with regions, industry and communities. We believe this committee ought to be bipartisan. But if is not to be, so be it. We will not desert steel industry; we will not desert regional Australia; we will not desert the need jobs; we will not desert families' and our kids' futures; and we will not desert our responsibility to the national interest, whether that be economic or social. (Time expired)",76
189,Mr WAKELIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I note the general comments of the member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) about the future of the steel industry in Australia. But the Australian people are not to be fooled by such nonsense and such rhetoric that we hear too much of in this place. They know that this government has only been here for five minutes, comparawhich tively; they know that the Labor government had 13 years in which to put their imprint on the future of Australia; and they know that reason they voted in the March election remove the Keating government was for many of their failures, particularly in the employWhyalla: ment area. Mr Sawford-At the next election they'll remove you, Barry. Mr W AKELlN-I will take my chances along with the rest. But I remind the member for Port Adelaide that 10 of the 12 Representatives seats in South Australia are Liberal members. Mr Beddall-Why don't you stand up for them? Mr W AKELlN-There is some agitation on the other side which I will ignore. Comments were made about insensitivity, incompetence, indolence, Labor and leadership. I have to say that the people of Lindsay made judgment about that only a few short days ago. Quite frankly, I am amazed that the Labor Party would bring this matter of public with importance into the chamber today. I will agree with the member for Port Adelaide on one basic point: it is a highly competitive world and it is always to be regretted when we lose one job. The loss of job in this country is one too many. If of only it was as easy as that. We know the record of the Labor Party over the last 13 years, particularly the last six years. We know about the recession we had to have; we know that that in the last six years we have had an the increase of something like 5,000 full-time jobs, when we needed 200,000 to stand stillfor that is the record of our opponents. The member for Port Adelaide talked about the $1 billion taken away from industry but omits to mention the matter of tax rorting, the matter of the budget repair task and the matter of a $10 billion deficit-all those things that we have had to inherit on assuming office. He mentioned the crisis in the steel industry and said that that 250 jobs-as highly regrettable as they are-are to be lost in Whyalla. I understand that will net out at something like 150 because they are making some changes will mean many of those people will be taken on again by contractors. But if this is the crisis in the steel industry, the we have had very many crises in the last 13 to years. I know this from my own experience in Why alIa. Let us look at the record of BHP in December 1985, there were 4,077 full-time employees; some three years later, there were 3,610; some three years later again, 3,100; to the point where in July 1996 that number has been reduced to just over 2,000. So there were many crises during the period of the Labor government, if this is to House of be termed a crisis in Why alIa. I turn to the city of Whyalla, which I so proudly represent. Why alia is the largest city in the electorate of Grey. My father worked there during the Second World War in the blast furnace. My brothers did their apprenticeships with BRP. We are immensely proud of that part of the world, particularly Whyalla. We are also proud of the company, BHP, and the opportunity it has offered over recent generations. I turn to what the people of Why alia have said. The secretary of the AWU, Geoff Buckland, acknowledged yesterday: It's difficult, isn't it, when you're faced with job cuts . . . I think what we've got to do is pull together as a city, in spite of what's happening around us and say we will try and attract something different to Whyalla. The mayor, Keith Wilson, is also trying very hard to be positive in a very difficult situation. But I repeat: the reduction in work force in the last 13 years under the previous administration is well over 2,000. We currently have something like a net 150 job loss, and the Labor Party says it is a major crisis. It would be remiss of me today if I did not mention the people of Newcastle. By anyone's determination, the potential loss of 2,000 jobs is a serious issue. But, as has been pointed out to me, this is occurring in an area with a population of something like one million people. It is to be hoped that, on the eastern flank of our country, many of those people will be able to find alternative employment. The government had discussions with BHP as late as the middle of October, and it is prepared to continue its dialogue, to pursue all appropriate avenues of government action. I do not know the area of Newcastle particularly well. I have been there from time to time and I know some of the members. I feel for those people who are under significant pressure. But this issue has been emerging from that part of the world for many years, and I think that has been acknowledged. I now tum to the general economic scene. We have been in government for barely five minutes. This week we had agreement from the Australian Democrats to our industrial relations package. That will help in many ways to enhance employment opportunities in this country. We have had a budget repair task, attempting to balance the budget while in every way possible driving down interest rates-those crippling interest rates which do so much damage to our economy when they run unchecked. We have introduced-I think this is as significant a measure as anything else-a charter of budget honesty so that no government will ever go to the people again without the people having accurate knowledge of the budgetary situation. The executive and the cabinet in particular have had to do a lot of work to bring us back to square one as a country. I want to return now to my own electorate and my own state. Before we become too negative, I remind the House of the great Olympic Dam mine in South Australia. When it is completed in some two to three years time, Western Mining will have invested in the expansion something in excess of $2.5 billion. It will mean an increase in jobs, with an estimated 1,000 jobs on site in the construction stage and up to 8,000 extra jobs throughout the state. With a lifespan of at least 100 years, this is a remarkable mine. I would love to have a couple more in the electorate. Let us hope that exploration efforts will achieve that. We have much to look forward to because of such projects. We have had setbacks, and we always will have, but we also have .many positives running with us. The member for Port Adelaide touched on the matter of export markets in this highly competitive world. In Newcastle, something like 40 per cent of its production is exported. In Why alia, it is in excess of 50 per cent. It is very important that we, as a country, focus on the need for a cohesive and stable economy to ensure that, whatever our political beliefs, we will position ourselves as strongly as we can to maximise those overseas markets. I have mentioned the union officials, particularly Mr Buckland. We have been political opponents but I am sure that we are as one in our determination to maximise every job in the steel industry that we possibly can. In conclusion, I want to talk about my vision for the future of Australia-our vision, hopefully-a vision that includes an industrial relations system that focuses on a win-win situation. I hope that we can reduce the adversarial nature of the system and work together in a productivity based economy, because that is the only thing that will be respected by the overseas market. As the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) said yesterday in another debate, we are only 18 million people. We must give ourselves every opportunity to position ourselves in a world which is a very lean and mean place, particularly out there in the overseas market. In my opinion, we hear too much talk about our trading partners. I refuse to use that term. They are our trading competitors, and let us make no bones about it. Every time we do something in this place or anywhere in this country that reduces our ability to compete, we lose jobs. I say to my political opponents: I welcome the opportunity to debate this matter today. It is highly regrettable that we are losing jobs anywhere, let alone in the steel industry and in my town of Whyalla. I live in a little place called Kimba but Why alIa is my second home. My family history is there. But let us not dwell too long on the negatives. Let us do what we can to protect what is left. And there is much left, particularly in the steel industry. There is much to build on. We must remember that there will be opportunities in other areas, such as Olympic Dam, that great mine in the arid land of this country. It is unusual because it is actually creating a township. It is almost unique in Australia, where there is this fly in, fly out trend that takes people to the capital cities. I come from the bush. I come from rural Australia. I am proud to represent regional Australia. I stand here today saying that Olympic Dam, that icon in the desert, is something to be proud of. I thank the House.",77
190,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Well meaning as the member for Grey (Mr Wakelin) may be, this has been a disgraceful performance by the government. Firstly, where is the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore)? What kind of insult has the minister just given to all people in Grey, Newcastle and Wollongong? He does not even see fit to front up and explain why he has refused a parliamentary inquiry into steel. All he has to do is say yes. It costs him no resources. It costs him no time. He has no obligation to the inquiry, but he says no. Why is that? The member for Grey did not even attempt to touch on the subject of why that is the case. I suggest that those people who live in Grey and in the other steel electorates read his speech. Then they will understand the ignorance that is there and the government's lack of understanding of the industry, what drives the industry or what is going to hurt it. All of those things that one dreads, about governments which do not know what they are doing, were reflected in that speech. We had the nonsense about industrial relations. Back in 1982 and 1983, BHP put to the labour movement politically and industrially that, if we responded and cooperated with them, redesigned our workplaces and processes and changed our productivity, they would invest and stay in the game. The fact is that that was done, and you heard the member for Grey talk about the jobs that went as a part of that. In Newcastle there was a drop from 11,000 workers to 3,000. Those people kept the faith. The labour movement kept the faith. The new legislation on industrial relations has no relevance to steel at all. Yet we hear it being trotted out as some sort of panacea. What absolute humbug! And the fact is that the workers in Whyalla know that. They are not stupid. They understand that their member does not know about their plant, what it is doing or where it is going. More importantly, their member stopped the minister from being here for this debate. He should have refused to speak until the minister had spoken. This minister, as was pointed out by the member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford), was dispensed with from the front bench in 1982. He should go again. Mr Deputy Speaker, since the minister will not tell you about some of his comments in recent days, I will have to tell you. On 11 October the parliamentary committee asked the the minister to agree to have an inquiry into iron and steel making and the issues involved, the export potential and the factors affecting it. The minister declined to do that. What he suggested in the chamber yesterday in answer to a question-which he could have answered more fulsomely-was that he would have a consultative panel of parliamentarians look at it. The panel he is referring to is the one announced by Senator Tierney-the so-called Hunter based senator-made up of Liberal state and federal members. It is Liberal Party only! That is the panel the minister is talking about, the panel the minister now tells me he will ask to include me on. What shonkyness. That panel will travel to Newcastle to look at the problem. In discussions with me, the minister has pointed out that this is simply a Newcastle problem. The minister for industry does not understand that what is happening in steel is not just local and national-it is international. It has enormous significance, and I will go to that in a moment. The minister and his office suggested to other people last night that the committee had withdrawn the request. It has not. One of his staff suggested to a person last night that Newcastle is a basket case. What kind of disgraceful attitude is that? What kind of mind-set is that? If it is a basket case, why is he not doing something about it? It is all the more reason for his involvement. What he is really saying is that there is no role for government in this. The member for Grey made a great point about five minutes of government. The fact is that in 1983 we took just on 100 days to have a steel plan in place. It was a steel plan that contributed $150 million of bounty towards steel buyers and gave BHP the potential to invest and be profitable. We have seen in recent years massive profitability for steel. But the fact is that in recent times there has been a downturn, and BHP's steel profits have declined. The report by MCIntosh Baring quotes at great length the situation in BHP. They point out that the decline in profitability has been some 70 per cent or so. They also point out that most of the world's great steel producers have had similar declines as well. For example, in the US, Bethlehem Steel is down 71 per cent. What is happening with BHP in terms of their steel profitability is not unique. It is not just Newcastle, Whyalla, Kembla or Australia; it is worldwide. At the moment there is a price war on in an attempt to reduce production. But who was the first one to pull up the white flag? The Great Australian. And who is supporting them? The minister. BHP is about to reduce production of steel in Australia by 20 per cent. We have been hearing for years how efficient we now are. The Baring report confirms that, as does the report on productivity from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade report points out that nowadays Australia is a very efficient steel producer. It also points out that we need to have about 10.4 million tonnes of production in Australia by 2005. BHP is actually going to reduce our production, yet a report by Foreign Affairs and Trade says that we need to expand it. The report also points out that, while China is exporting steel now, by 2005 they will need to import 50 million tonnes of steel. Who will they import it from? Companies that use our iron ore and add value to it somewhere else. The government is sitting in here week after week with this kind of issue running and these kinds of questions being asked, and what are they talking about? Industrial relations bills. What nonsense we have here. I am sorry that the member for Grey did not have the courtesy to stay and listen to the rest of this debate and the contributions made by me and his colleagues, because I think he may have learnt something. Exporting is tough, but the fact that BHP is cutting production by 20 per cent will mean that, within a few years, we will be importing steel. Let me tell the people of Whyalla and Kembla that, once we are importing and once we cut production, the cost pressure on them will become enormous. Within 10 years, they will need protection to stay in the game. If BHP is not prepared to invest in new technology and improved technology now, then it never will. What they are doing is dragging out the lifespan of old technology. The minister should be aware of that, and he should be trying to find out why. He should also find out how governments can help. We cannot tell BHP what to do, and neither can the minister. What they do will be determined by what is viable. When a company says that it will stay in manufacturing only if it is making a 15 per cent profit on investment, one starts to wonder. Such a statement is understandable when inflation was running at 11 per cent, as with the last government. However, with inflation running where it is now, I do not know of any company achieving a return on investment of 15 per cent in manufacturing. Companies might be able to do that for a month or six months, but as a benchmark it is an awfully high hurdle. I do not know of many such companies in the world, not just in Australia. The government should be aware of that. The government should also be aware of the other factors. Is it because of the cost of capital? Is it because of R&D? Is it because of unfair competition in overseas markets? Why can BHP not compete? They said to us, 'Increase your productivity to 350 tonnes per person and we will be viable.' Productivity is now almost 600 tonnes per person per year, and we are told that they are not viable. A year ago John Prescott said that they would be investing $500 million in new technology in Newcastle. That is now questionable. Can we trust these people? Can the minister trust them? John Prescott said that he made that announcement to give people long term certainty. In the last six months we have had long-term uncertainty. This minister should have been listening to this debate and he should have made a contribution. He should be explaining to all of us what he sees as the government's role in what is potentially the most important industrial change happening in the country in decades: that is, the shift from iron ore to metal.

191,Mr CAUSLEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have listened with interest to the contributions of the member for Port Adelaide (Mr Saw ford) and the member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris). I also listened with great interest to the member for Grey (Mr Wakelin) regarding the situation in South Australia. As was said recently, it seems to me that after seven months in opposition the Labor Party have learnt nothing-nothing about the reasons that forced them into opposition and nothing about the reasons that are causing the problems in Australia today. The way the Labor Party tries to solve problems is to throw taxpayers' money at them. I do not believe in this particular instance that will achieve anything at all. The member for Newcastle almost answered the question when he stated that he believes it is not the government's role to solve these problems. I believe he was saying that it is the government's role to tell BHP that they should be investing in Australia. The problem is that some 10 years ago the Labor Party entered into a plan with BHP. To my understanding, it spent something like $750 million to $1 billion of the taxpayers' money in investing in BHP. Ten years down the track we are again expecting the taxpayers to bailout BHP. There is no doubt in the minds of the people of Australia. They made the decision in March that they would not go down this track. The members for Newcastle and Port Adelaide talked about an inquiry into the steel industry of Australia. I would think you could have that inquiry across a lot of areas in Australia, not just the steel industry. You could have an inquiry into small business. You could have an inquiry into agriculture. You could have an inquiry into the whole economic situation in Australia. That inquiry was held under the term of the last government, and the people decided in March. They brought down the findings of the inquiry. They found that the economic standards set by the previous government were unacceptable, because all they did was throw money at the problems. The member for Newcastle said in the Industry Commission report that BHP had to produce a lot more steel to be efficient. I have no doubt that that is correct, but I wonder whether the member for Newcastle or perhaps BHP could tell me where they are going to sell it. There is not much use producing steel if you cannot sell it. That is their problem at the present time. The fact is that we have a world oversupply. There is a downturn in the construction areas of the world that take the steel from these plants. That will be overcome only when the industry turns around and there is a need for countries around the world to buy steel again. I think BHP should have been aware of that. Quite frankly, if the taxpayers were prepared to prop them up 10 years ago, the industry should have been watching very closely what was developing in the world markets. They should be aware of what they need to do to be competitive in the world market. If you want to make a criticism, that is a fair criticism. It is a fair criticism of fact that BHP and the steel industry have not been watching very closely what has been developing in the markets around the world. As the member for Grey quite rightly says, it is a sad day in Australia when we lose any jobs, but we have lost a lot of jobs over the last 13 years. The fact is that our unemployment figures soared to record levels because of the economic policies of the Labor Party. Some of those jobs were lost because of technology, and that is understood. The member for Newcastle said that we entered into agreement with BHP 10 years ago and we brought better work practices into play in the steel industry. I have no doubt that that occurred, but technology moves on. Unfortunately, when you bring in new technology some jobs are lost. That is an unfortunate fact of life. We have to come to terms with that. I cannot believe that you seriously expect the taxpayers of Australia to be asked to again contribute what was contributed 10 years ago. Would you also say that the taxpayers of Australia should contribute to the red meat industry, for instance? You say that BHP wants a 15 per cent return on its capital. The beef industry is getting a minus 15 per cent return on its capital. Are you seriously suggesting that the government should go right across Australia and prop up all these industries just for political expediency like you did? That is what you are asking for. It is the old ALP theory-do not solve the problem, throw money at it. The member for Newcastle mentioned in his speech that industrial relations do not come into this. I put to the member for Newcastle that one of the reasons Australia is wallowing in debt and unemployment at present is the actions of the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), who has disappeared, and the member for Hotham (Mr Crean), who unfortunately disappeared earlier. They are the architects of the problems we have in Australia today. The problems we have today are due to your absolute subservience to the ACTU. The member for Port Adelaide mentioned the car industry. The car industry in Australia is a classic example of this. The reason the the manufacturing industry in Australia declined was the absolute power of the unions. They saw that we were getting very few cars-I think it was 13 cars per man per year-out of the car manufacturing industry in Australia. It could not continue. It was the work practices promoted by the ACTU and the Labor Party that destroyed these industries. Mr Allan Morris-Come back to steel. We're talking about steel.",81
192,Mr CAUSLEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am referring to the remarks made by the member for Port Adelaide. The member for Port Adelaide also referred to the salvation of the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer). I can only presume-and I hope that I am right-that he was talking about the diesel fuel rebate. Are you seriously suggesting to the mining industry of Australia that they should pay a tax on production-it is not a rebate; it is a tax that is not being collected? There is no doubt in my mind that your logic is completely twisted. You have to accept that this is-to use a word that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) seems to put forward-a tawdry matter of public importance that is only designed to play a bit of convenient politics. If you look closely at the government's policies-if you look at the industrial relations policy and the proposed enterprise bargaining system-you would see that they mean efficiency. The member for Batman, through the former Prime Minister, Paul Keating, used to stand up and say, 'We have an enterprise bargaining system in Australia.' That was controlled by the ACTU. You could not negotiate on overtime, loadings and demarcations. There was a plimsoll line drawn that you could not negotiate on those issues. How can you gain efficiencies in any industry, including the steel industry, if you do not have enlightened industrial relations law. If the member for Newcastle is so worried about jobs around the Hunter, why is he not saying something to the Premier of New South Wales. There was an opportunity in New South Wales for a gold mine to be established at Lake Cowal. All the recommendations were that it should go ahead. Mr Allan Morris-That's not in the Hunter.",82
193,Mr CAUSLEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is not far from the Hunter if you have a close look. If you are looking at alternative employment, why have you not said something to the Premier of New South Wales who overruled all of the recommendations for a gold mine at Lake Cowal? Look at what he is doing to the timber industry in New South Wales at present. He is destroying jobs-(Time expired)",83

195,Mrs JOHNSTON,CHILD CARE LEGISLATION,"Canning) (4.15 p.m.)No doubt one of the main reasons for the massive growth in the demand for child-care places that I spoke about before the commencement of question time is the increasing number of women who return to the work force after commencing a family. A Sydney based consultancy called Families at Work has compiled national figures which show that 90 per cent of working women plan to return to work after childbirth, and that most return to work just after 12 months. When surveyed, many women said they would return up to nine weeks earlier if child care was available to them. The coalition's theme of choice, so necessary for women both at home and in the work force, is very evident in the legislation to which I speak today. Coalition policies are based on an absolute commitment to provide greater opportunities for both women and men to share both the rewards and the responsibilities of work and family life. The Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill we are debating now is a budget related bill. We should not look at it in isolation from other budget related measures, as they are all part of an integrated plan to make life easier for those Australians on low and middle incomes. Tbis government's child-care strategy, announced by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in the August budget, will deliver equitable, flexible and high quality child care. It will ensure that families have access to affordable child care that is appropriate to their needs. The coalition will protect the current benefits to low income families and those with special needs. At the same time, we are establishing a strategic direction for the long-term sustainability of the child-care sector. As the Minister for Family Services, the honourable member for Pearce (Mrs Moylan), said in her second reading speech, the repeal of section 11 from the Child Care Act addresses the inequities in government funding between families using private long day centres and community centres. Removing the operational subsidy to the community based long day care centres will place private long day care centres on an equal footing and will also encourage greater efficiencies. The operational subsidy will continue to be made available by the federal government for family day care, occasional care, outside school hours care, multifunctional children's services and multifunctional Aboriginal children's services. All of these services are crucial to meeting the diverse child-care needs of Australian families. The quality of care will not be affected by the withdrawal of the operational subsidy for community based services, as this will be maintained for all family long day care services through the quality, improvement and accreditation system. The minister noted in her speech that at the present time there is no link between a family's income and their level of entitlement to the child-care cash rebate, and this is clearly not equitable. We will ensure that access to the child-care cash rebate will be retained for all Australian families regardless of their income level. That is what the Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill is all about. It may be appropriate at this stage to remind members on the other side of a comment that was made by the National President of the Australian Federation of Child Care Centres, Mrs Evelyn Callaghan who, when asked about the budget, stated: In tenns of child care generally, I think the cuts have been done reasonably and rationally. She went on to say that its expected effects were measured and that it would impact on higher income families-thus making the system fairer. Members opposite should also remember that child-care assistance and the child-care cash rebate will be retained. As of January 1998 these will be paid through a new government delivery agency. This means a notable reduction in red tape, which will benefit both parents and providers alike. Most importantly, families will be able to choose for themselves whether they wish to receive their payments directly or have them paid to the child-care service of their choosing. In addition, this government is committed to ensuring that families with young children are given greater freedom to choose whether one parent cares full time for their children at home or whether both parents will remain in the work force. As I mentioned before, the changes we are making to child care should not be looked at in isolation. The coalition's policies are guided by a commitment to deliver responsible government. We place emphasis on maximising choice and opportunity for all, whilst maintaining a secure safety net for those Australians who find themselves in a disadvantaged situation. The coalition recognises that the various roles of women are complex and, more often than not, involve a delicate balance of juggling work and family responsibilities. We are committed to giving women more freedom of choice. Not all women want to join the work force. Some only do so out of the economic necessity for their families to survive. On the other hand, there are many, many women who wish to continue their careers full time after they have children. They find their work fulfilling and an important part of their life. Others, of course, choose to combine the two and work part time whilst looking after their children. We in the coalition want to make it easier for all women, whatever their individual situation is, to get ahead in life. To assist women in making the choices that suit them, the coalition government will facilitate workplace reforms to improve opportunities for women. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister for Industrial Relations, Peter Reith, and the Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Cheryl Kernot, for negotiating a sound and sensible industrial relations bill which will benefit women by promoting more flexible hours and permanent part-time work. I believe that the workplace reform legislation and the subsequent amendments agreed with the Democrats bring the industrial relations system up to date to deal with the needs of women in the workplace. The present industrial relations system based on the award structure evolved because it related to full-time male employees. The new package is more relevant to working women as it maintains their existing working conditions and enables them to vary their working hours. The new legislation promotes improved access to permanent part-time work with regular hours, which is precisely what women want. Many of these women will be seeking affordable child care. The government is maintaining this for families who choose to pay for child care. In addition, we have ensured that child-care assistance is equitable and goes to those families who are in greatest need. Members opposite are mischievous when they say we have slashed child care. This is just not so. Let me put on the record precisely what the government funding will be in the child-care sector over the next four years. Some $526 million will be spent to retain operational subsidies for family day care, occasional care, outside school hours care, multifunctional services and multifunctional Aboriginal children's services. We will spend a further $31 million to support children with high levels of additional needs, particularly those with disabilities. We have allocated $12.5 million to ensure that families in severely disadvantaged areas do not lose access to child care. We will also spend almost $11 million to provide capital funding for new places under the targeted new growth strategy to ensure that families in rural and remote areas and places of special need have access to flexible child care. Those who decry the loss of the operational subsidy to community based child-care centres should also remember that we have allocated an additional $8.3 million to assist these people to overcome the loss of this subsidy. These funds will assist centres to purchase financial or management advice to restructure their businesses should they so choose. The removal of the operational subsidy from the community based child-care centres redresses the imbalance in government subsidies and removes a significant inequity for families who are using the private child-care sector. It places the community and private long day care centres on an equal footing. After the budget was brought down, I had a number of people contact me expressing their concern about the removal of the operational subsidy. They were under the impression that the removal of the subsidy would lead to an increase in fees and a reduction in services. I have had several meetings with both parents and operators to discuss the rationale behind the decision. I outlined to them that it would be regrettable for them to immediately increase their fees or reduce their services without first analysing how they may be able to meet the proposed changes. Although many of them admitted to me that they half expected the decision that was made, they acknowledged that the government is providing the additional $8.3 million to help them come to terms with the loss of the operational subsidy. As I have already mentioned, this is in addition to the $11.5 million over three years which is available to assist centres to upgrade and amalgamate in order to improve their efficiency and viability. When the announcement was made to remove the operational subsidy, the community sector claimed to be outraged. However, a few days later the convenor of the National Association of Community Based Children's Services, Mrs Lyne Wannan, was calling on the sector to prove its viability. Commercial child-care operators, who often charge lower fees than those of the community based centres, have welcomed the removal of the subsidy as they rightly believe this will create a level playing field for all child-care centres. There are those on the opposite side of this House who have made a point today of criticising the government for its decision to remove the operational subsidy. They need to be reminded, however, that it was the Labor Party, when it was in government, that wanted to abolish the operational subsidy. Let me quote from a recent article by Peter Walsh, a former Labor senator who was probably just a little too honest for the ALP's liking. In an article entitled 'Care for the rich kids' in the Australian Financial Review of 27 August 1996, Mr Walsh said: Several times in the 1980' s Labor's expenditure review committee considered abolishing the $15 per day per place operating subsidy paid to 'community based' child care centres. The proposal had both financial and efficiency objectives: to save money, and remove the government funded bias which discriminated in favour of the country's most inefficient sector. He goes on to say, among other things, that the abolition of the subsidy will not affect charges to parents using such centres. I refer to Mr Walsh's comments to demonstrate that this is not a new idea dreamt up by the coalition in pursuit of some ideological pursuit. Indeed, the Labor Party themselves considered the very same proposal, but they never had the guts to implement it. To conclude, let me go back to the beginning of my speech and remind members that never before have so many very young children spent so much time being cared for by non-family members. It is a phenomenonsome would argue a frightening one-which is linked directly to the new high participation of women in the work force. In recognition of this, the government has put in place an economic framework broad enough to accommodate many more changes if the public and child-care industry deem them necessary. Our national planning framework, which has been set up to guide child care in this country and which has been welcomed by the centre operators as well as other child-care professionals, is one that is to be commended. This is all part of the consultative theme of this coalition government. We are listening to the Australian people, we are hearing their requests, and we are trying to be fair. I commend the bill to the House.",83
196,Mr FITZGIBBON,CHILD CARE LEGISLATION,"I congratulate the member for Canning (Mrs Johnston) for at least being brave enough to come into the House and defend what really is the indefensible. I have to say she has done so in stark contrast to most of her colleagues on that side. I notice that we have something like six government members speaking to the Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill, and I also note that the member for Canning is the only female member among them. I notice that the member for Bowman (Mrs West) was on the speaking list, but she appears to have dropped off. No doubt the member for Canning must have been grappling with two important principles: one, that she should come in here as a member of the government and defend government decisions no matter how appalling they may be, and the other of course is the principle to stay out of here and not come in here to defend what I said really is the indefensible. As she said, the Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill seeks to abolish operational subsidies for community based long day care centres and to apply a means test to the former Labor government's childcare cash rebate. I am opposed to the bill and the measures it proposes. In speaking to the bill I particularly talk about its impact on rural and regional Australia. The decision to abolish operational subsidies for community based long day care centres has created more anger in my electorate than any of the other nasty decisions taken in the 1996-97 budget. That is a pretty big statement when you consider the very large range of nasties that were announced by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in the budget. But it is true. It is true that I have received more petitions, more phone calls, more letters and attended more meetings and rallies regarding the decision to abolish the operational subsidies for child-care centres than I have on any other issue-more than I have received regarding increases in the higher education contribution charge and the cuts to universities; more than I have received regarding the changes to Austudy; more than I have received on cuts to labour market programs; more than on the proposed closure of Commonwealth Employment Service offices; more than on the closure of Medicare offices; more than on the increases to the co-payment for pharmaceuticals for both concession cardholders and non-concession cardholders; more than on the decision to deem the first $2,000 of pension savings; more representations than on the decision to remove the exemption on superannuation assets for the purpose of assessing social security entitlements; more than on the massive slashing of public sector jobs; and more than on the decision to withhold the 1 November Medicare fee increases. I have received more representations on operational subsidies than I have on the decision to cut funding for public hospitals; more than on the decision to cut the Commonwealth dental program; more than on the decision to whack more than 200,000 older Australians with a $6.80 charge for home and community care services; more than on the decision to impose a nursing home entry fee; more than on the decision to slash funding for public housing; more than on the decision to flog off Telstra; more than on the decision to cut ABC funding; and just moreonly just more-than on the decision to slash want to funding to our skillshare operations. Some of these issues came pretty close, as you can imagine, Mr Deputy Speaker. The electorate is very angry about so many of them. But, as I said, the electorate is more angry about the cuts in operational subsidies than it is regarding any other issue. I want to share with the House an example of the extent of that anger. Singleton Shire Council is a very progressive council. It is almost entirely devoid of party politics; indeed, I do not think I would be offending Singleton shire councillors if I was to say they really are a fairly conservative lot. Its members do not grandstand in order to score petty political points, and Singleton councillors enjoy a high level of community respect. In particular, the local mayor, Neil MCNamara, is held in very high regard by the citizens of the area-not only his immediate area, but within the Hunter Valley generally. Neil is also the chairman of the Hunter Region Organisation of Councils. His astute leadership and apolitical approach to issues at all levels of government have delivered him a 22-year unbroken run as leader of the Singleton and Patricks Plains shires. I share this information with honourable members to establish the apolitical bona fides of the council and its mayor. Having done that, I want to read parts of a letter I received from Mayor Neil MCNamara which he recently sent to the government. It says: At its last meeting Council expressed the gravest concern and disapproval of the severity of the proposed funding cuts outlined in almost every area of the Federal budget. It is recognised and well understood by the Councillors of the Shire that it is necessary for every individual, every organisation, every community and indeed, for the country to live within its means. However, the reality is that the country is its people, and the first consideration in any process to srutinize and amend or change existing practices and services, must be to ensure that proper regard is given to the interests of the people who will be affected by those amendments or change. Council believes that the savage cuts in expenditure in many areas affecting country people, the closure of welfare agencies and offices in country areas and the reductions in employment services have no regard whatever for the communities they affect. Whilst these expenditure cuts may have achieved a particular budget outcome for the Government, they have seriously and unrealistically affected the people the government needs to support. Everyone in the community is aware that many areas of government spending require to be rationalised but Council believes it is a matter of attacking appropriate areas having regard to needs, rather than attacking every area to achieve a pre-determined budget result. He went on to say: Of particular concern to Council is the area of childcare funding which was the subject of an earlier resolution of Council and a letter to appropriate politicians. I am sure you are aware of the demography of Singleton as it relates to mining and industry and the fact that we have an increasing young family population. As a result of this there are particular problems faced by young people with particular needs in the area of childcare facilities. You will notice, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the mayor talks about the impact of the budget on country people. It is this issue which I want to tum to. The 1996-97 budget is full of examples of funding cuts which fall disproportionately upon rural and regional Australia--cuts to skillshare and labour market programs, the closure of CES offices, cuts to the ABC and many more. But there is no better example than the decision to abolish operational subsidies for community based long day care centres, nor could there be a better example of a decision made by city based bureaucrats and politicians who have no appreciation whatsoever of its impact on rural and regional Australia. The government says that it is removing the operational subsidy to place community based centres on an equal footing with privately run centres. But you have to understand that the private sector does not involve itself in the provision of child care in country Australia because there simply is no money in it; there is no profit motive. Indeed, community providers, even with their operational subsidies, struggle to remain viable. One of their challenges is to maintain the critical mass of children needed to keep their centres open, to keep them viable. As the centres will no doubt be forced to pass on their increased running costs as a result of the abolition of the subsidy, they will have no choice but to do so and parents will be forced to withdraw their children from the centres. The result of that is that the centres in rural Australia, centres in towns in my electorate, will lose the critical mass necessary to remain viable and, consequently, will have to close their doors. What happens then? It means that women, traditionally the primary carers, will be forced to leave the work force or, alternatively, to seek out an unregistered and unaccredited backyard carer. While I suspect that the majority of unregistered carers are competent, sincere and loving of the children that they care for, let us take a look at how badly it can all go wrong. Let me read to the House part of an article which appeared in Tuesday's Maitland Mercury. The headline reads 'Abuse case Ita real minefield'''. It says: A 59-year-old woman who runs an unregistered child care service from her home has pleaded not guilty to a child abuse charge. The woman, who cannot be named to protect the alleged victim, appeared in Maitland Local Court yesterday to apply for variation on her bail conditions. Police will allege the woman abused a 2Y2-yearold boy in her care on October 17 by ill-treating and assaulting him. The charges were laid after the Department of Community Services and police intervened when a neighbour complained about the carer's treatment of the child. The solicitor said the police allegation can be summed up in this way: ""That the child carer vigorously struck, swore raised her voice and yelled at the child."" He told the court that parents of other children in the accused's care support the woman and want their children to stay with her. He produced a number of letters of support from the parents. But the magistrate hearing the case commented that this area of concern is a real minefield. Let me remind honourable members of an article that appeared in yesterday's Daily Telegraph. The headline read 'Don't go, mum'. It reads: A child begged not to be left with the family babysitter on the day she was murdered, the girl's mother told the court yesterday. Kym Lawson said her 18-month-old daughter had cried, ""Mummy no, mummy no""as she was left with her baby-sitter. These are very graphic examples of what can go wrong. As I said, I agree and hope that in the majority of cases it does not go so badly wrong. But can we afford to take the risk? Can we afford to deny our children the education they receive when attending registered day care centres? Can we afford to deny them the camaraderie, the interaction with other children that they enjoy by attending registered day care services? For those who doubt my suggestion that some community based centres will be forced to close, let us go through some of the facts. This measure will save the government some $118 million over the next three years. To put it more succinctly, that is a loss of $33,000 each year for the Muswellbrook multicare child-care centre, $42,000 for the Singleton child-care centre, $40,000 for the Cessnock multipurpose child-care centre, $54,000 for the Beresfield community child-care centre and $40,000 a year for the Kurri centre. In the case of Muswellbrook, that is a 9.4 per cent decrease in its operating budget; Singleton, 11.5 per cent; Cessnock, 9.3 per cent; and Beresfield, a whopping 12 per cent. There can be no doubt that the centres will have no choice but to pass the losses on to their users. Indeed, some child-care centres in my electorate have already been doing the calculations. The Singleton child-care centre, which services some 120 families, estimates that it will be forced to increase its charges by $3.85 per day, or nearly $20 per week. The Beresfield community child-care centre, which also services about 120 families, estimates that its charges will increase by $5 per day, or $25 per week. It is worth noting that a very high percentage of the families that use both of these centres are receiving some sort of family allowance. That tells us that the decision to abolish the operational subsidy will hit those families with the least ability to pay-those families on low incomes. The Australian Financial Review has estimated that a family with only one child could be up to $50 worse off per week. Where does this leave Australian women? What about their basic right to go out and work? It leaves them back in the family home once again playing the traditional role of the primary family carer. This must be the government's only employment strategy: to take women out of the work force and to replace them with unemployed men. The government says it is going to allocate some $8.3 million over the next four years to assist community based long day care centres make the adjustment. Let us do some basic arithmetic. The government is going to take from the centres $118 million over three years and give them back $8.3 million over four years. So it is taking $40 million each year and giving back just $2 million. This is the compensation the member for Canning was referring to that is going to do such wonderful things for community based child-care centres. The 1, llO centres which are to share in the $8.3 million are supposed to spend the money on consultants, who are going to tell them how to run their businesses with more than lO per cent less money than they have done hitherto. When trying to justify the abolition of the operational subsidy, government members tum to the findings of the Economic Planning Advisory Council interim report. While it is true that EPAC has recommended the abolition of the subsidy, it is also true that it recommended that the money be returned to families in the form of a total child-care benefit. So the government is selectively adopting its recommendations. It is making the $118 million grab on the proposition of the report, but it is not going to give any of it back. What a disgrace! In the short time left to me I want to very briefly talk about the bill's other main proposal; that is, the proposal to means test the former Labor government's child-care cash rebate-another grab from the pockets of working Australian families. The child-care cash rebate represents a recognition that child care is a legitimate work related cost. There is no doubt about that. It is a more effective recognition than a tax deduction because tax deductibility would deliver very little relief to low income families, but would deliver a huge windfall to high income earners. I do not hear the government saying that those earning more than $70,000 a year should not be able to claim for tools of trade or for dry cleaning of uniforms. There was no logic in the decision to means test the child-care cash rebate. This proposal once again represents just another cash grab. The shadow minister has put a number of amendments to this bill before the House. I commend them to the House.",86
197,Mr COBB,CHILD CARE LEGISLATION,"The debate from the opposition so far on this Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill has been full of misinterpretation, a combination of scare tactics and a lack of understanding of business principles. We are debating the changes to child care announced in the budget. I would like to state why these changes were necessary in a budgetary context, if I may spend a couple of minutes on that. Nobody likes making cuts in any area. As a politician, it does not necessarily make you popular. But there was a necessity for this. When .we came to power on 2 March-the same as when Richard Court came to power in Western Australia; Dean Brown, in South Australia; Jeff Kennett, in Victoria; and even Nick Greiner, back in 1988-we found a financial mess. We had a budget deficit of $10.3 billion-and that does not even factor in the Australian National debt of $1 billionand a current account deficit of $20 billion, following on the previous year, the worse current account deficit in the whole Western world. We have an overseas debt today of $188 billion, up from $23 billion when the previous government took power. Interest rates in real terms are at least one of the highest of the OECD countries, whereas home interest rates were only one per cent or two per cent in real terms in 1983 when we left power. On top of that, the unemployment rate was stuck between eight per cent and nine per cent, after going over 11 per cent when the present Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) was the unemployment minister. It is not a good situation to be in. Either you do nothing, let things drift on as they are and send the bill to your children and grandchildren or you do something about it, as we did across a number of portfolios, including this portfolio. That was the choice: we allow things to drift on as they are, getting worse, and bequeath the debt to our children or we wind back expenditure in a moderate, equitable and responsible manner-exactly as the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) has done to her credit with the changes she has proposed. All she has done is discontinue the operational subsidy to community long day care from 1 July next year. It is still some time away yet. Presently it is being paid at the rate of $22.60 a week for children aged between nought and three years and at $15.10 for those between three and five years old-an average of about $20 a week. On top of that, we are making other small changes. We are reducing the child-care cash rebate from 30 per cent to 20 per cent for families earning in excess of $70,000 with one child and increasing the threshold by $3,000 for each additional child. It is interesting to look at the history of the operational subsidy. It was a coalition government, after all, that brought it in back in 1972, when Bill MCMahon was Prime Minister, in the Child Care Act of 1972. We funded child care then in recognition of the increase in labour force participation by women. That was a proud coalition achievement. We provided both capital funding and recurrent funding. Over a period of time the operational subsidy, as it has come to be called, was extended not just to community long day care but to family day care, to occasional child care, to outside school hours care, to multifunction services, to multifunction Aboriginal children's services and so on. Over the next four years we will be continuing the operational subsidy to all of those except for the community long day care section. Over the next four years that will us $526 million alone-not an inconsiderable amount of money. We are not removing it from family day care, for example, which takes up a lot of places. It has been removed from community long day care only to put it on exactly the same equitable footing as the private long day care bodies which now provide most of the places. Community long day care only provides 20 per cent of the places-45,600 places right across Australia. These are the non-profit bodies, such as community organisations, local government run bodies and religious or charitable bodies which are open at least eight hours a day, Monday to Friday, for at least 48 weeks of the year providing long day care. It is interesting listening to the debate from the opposition. They always overlook the fact that in November 1985, not that long after they last obtained power, they actually reduced the operational subsidy by 50 per cent, in effect. That is something they might dwell on as they criticise the government for the necessary budget changes that we have just announced. Let us look at the figures for child-care centres. In New South Wales, my own state, there are 394 community long day care centres. Privately there are 1,112. So already the private sector, providing virtually exactly the same facility, is outnumbering them considerably. Australia-wide there are 1,102 community long day care centres providing 45,600 places. Privately there are 2,748 centres providing 122,000 places-2Y2 times more centres. Despite this subsidy of approximately $20 per child per week, the community long day care centres are charging on average $142.50, as opposed to $146.50 for the private long dare care facilities-only $4 less. The withdrawal of this operational subsidy will not only put both the private and the community long day care centres on a similar footing but in the first year it will save the government $44.7 million. We are putting in place a number of compensation mechanisms so that community long day care centres will not be disadvancost taged. Firstly, $8.3 million will be made available for financial and management advice. From 19 October advertisements have gone out calling for businesses and people to come forward to be vetted for a list that will be drawn up for each state and forwarded to each community long day care centre. They can choose whoever they want from that list to spend that money on. If you divide the 1,112 centres into $8.3 million, you come up with an average of $7,500. Most of those centres will probably only need to utilise $2,000 or $3,000 or something of that order to get that advice and get their affairs in shape. The people who work in these centres-very dedicated people whom we have all supported-have expertise in looking after children. Their expertise is not necessarily with financial matters, building or construction matters or things like that. I think they will welcome this generous grant from the minister so that they can improve their operation. On top of this, there is a further .grant of $11.5 million over the next three years to assist in upgrading these centres-as a result, no doubt, of the financial management they will receive. That will run into, on average, probably $10,000 per centre. There is another $10.9 million particularly directed towards rural centres for innovative services. I would imagine that centres that do not have any long day care available now may wish to convert rooms in a building into child-care places and that money will assist them in that. That is very welcome indeed. I thank the minister for that. There is also $12.5 million to be provided for disadvantaged areas, particularly rural and remote areas where there is no other service, so that these centres are not disadvantaged by these cutbacks. They will receive-if they can demonstrate genuine need-up to 60 per cent of the present operational subsidy. So there again we have targeted assistance to those who specifically need it. If that is not enough, on top of that we are going to provide another $31 million for children with additional needs or children with a disability. That will be available to both community and private long day care centres. It will be very welcome money indeed. I think the minister has been incredibly generous in this area. From the Treasury we have the family tax initiative, which is costing $1,000 million, I think-the member for Dawson (Mrs DeAnne Kelly) nods in agreement-in the first year. That will flow through to families with children. Depending on the number of children you have, the income you have and the age of the children, you can get anything from $7.70 up to $50 a fortnight. That has been very well accepted in the community. Let us not forget that we are spending $5,600 million on child care over the next four years. I am told that our spending next year, compared with last year under the previous government, will increase by 15 per cent. Despite these cutbacks that I have been talking about, we will be spending 15 per cent more-in fact, another $150 million-right across all those groups I have mentioned, including $526 million for the operational subsidy which will continue for most of those other groups. At this stage I would like to be a little parochial and mention both the community and private child-care centres in my electorate, all of which are of a very high standard. The community based ones are: the Bourke and District Multipurpose Child Care Centre, with 40 places in Bourke; the Brewarrina Child Care Centre, with 18 places in Brewarrina; the Little Darlings Child Care Centre in Wilcannia, which has 25 places, has only recently been opened and is very badly needed in that town; the Parkes Multipurpose Centre Long Day Care Centre, with 25 places in Parkes; the Playmates Cottage Child Care Centre, with 41 places in Dubbo; and the Rainbow Cottage Child Care Centre, with 41 places and which is also in Dubbo. I have supported many of those over the years and I will continue to work with them and do so. We also have these private centres: the Cheeky Cherubs Child Care Centre, with 70 places, has just been opened in Parkes-and I will return to that one later-the Goode Street Child Care Centre, with 44 places in Dubbo; the Noah's Ark Day Care Centre, with 39 places in Dubbo; the Orana Heights Preschool Kindergarten, with 59 places in Dubbo; and the Peppercorn Child Care Centre, with 66 places in Dubbo. That gives you some idea of the spread of both community and private long day care centres in my electorate. There are 164 places for children in community based long day care centres as opposed to 142 in private centres. That has increased recently. Family day care takes up more places: 703; multifunction places total 40; occasional care places total 17; and outside school hours care places total 145-which represents a total figure of over 1,200 places. We could do with a few more and we are getting a few more in my electorate. It is indeed instructive and interesting to look at those figures. It is also interesting to note that community long day care places have traditionally been established in areas of high need rather than in areas of low socio-economic need. That is reflected in the figures, which show that community long day care centres have a high proportion of high income families on their books. For example, only 39 per cent of their families receive the maximum child-care assistance grant whereas in the private centres 44 per cent receive the maximum grant. If you look at it in the broader context, 74 per cent of the community long day care centre families receive some child-care assistance whereas in the private centres 78 per cent receive some assistance. It is true that the community based centres have more places for babies than the private operators but, as I said earlier, they receive $7 a week more for those children and the places for babies are rapidly increasing in the private centres. In the not too distant future they will probably overtake the community centres. It is interesting that in New South Wales, in the bottom 20 per cent of socio-economic areas, private operators provide 8,700 places compared with 4,900 places in the community area. So the private operators are not necessarily picking the eyes out of the long day care places, as some have implied in the debate. They are more than pulling their weight, according to these figures. It is interesting to look at those figures in some detail. Accreditation is now compulsory for long day care centres so that both the private operators and the community operators have to be on an equal footing at least in that regard. This government, I am pleased to say, is continuing to extend that accreditation on a compulsory basis to other types of day care, such as family day care and outside school hours care. I think those on both sides of the chamber would support that. I am disappointed with the opposition's tactic of scaring parents by saying that fees will rise by gross amounts. The average subsidy for an operational grant is only about $20 per child per week, yet those opposite are talking about fees going up by $25 to $50. Having regard to all of these compensatory grants in place and the restructuring, I woulq think that in many cases fees would hardly have to rise, if at all. Those opposite also talk about centres closing. The odd centre has always closed from time to time, and I guess that will continue to occur, but I would be prepared to put $10 on the table that we will see many, many more centres open over the next year and the years ahead rather than close. I think there is provision for in excess of 45,000 more places over the next year or so. Those opposite have also talked about the EPAC report. They initiated the report. When we brought down the recommendations announced in the budget, we had not had time to fully study that report. But the EPAC report went along with many of the initiatives that we have taken. In the short time remaining to me, I would like to compare a private centre with a community centre. There is a centre in one of my towns-I will not name it-which has 40 places and was built at a cost of $350,000. This is a family small business operation. The lady who owns the centre borrowed virtually all the money for that centre. She was very fortunate in getting it at nine per cent, but that immediately is an outlay of $30,000 a year. On top of that, until 1 July next year she will not get the operational grant of $30,000 that she would have got if her centre had been a community long day care centre. So she starts $60,000 behind the eight ball, competing with the community centre up the road. I cast no aspersion whatsoever on the community centre. The community centre does a wonderful job. I have supported it and will continue to do so. She starts $60,000 behind for 40 places-not a lot of places-yet I understand she charges per child $1 per week less. She is providing almost exactly the same service, even though she starts $60,000 behind. I mentioned earlier the Cheeky Cherubs centre that has just opened down in Parkes with 70 places-I opened it myself only a month ago. Again, it is a husband and wife family business. I am delighted to say that they are going to open another one, God willing, in Forbes next year where it is desperately needed. I was astounded at the design of the building as well as the magnificent facilities and appointments within this building. It is an incredible building costing-and I hope I do not embarrass them by saying this-$470,000 of which they borrowed a fair whack of that; yet they will charge exactly the same charge, if not $1 a week less, as the community centre up the road. The service they provide to the children will be virtually exactly the same. It gives you food for thought how they can start off so far behind but still provide the same service and charge the same amount. As I say, that is not necessarily a reflection on the community centres, many of which had to struggle under voluntary labour. I have attended meetings of these people and supported them. But there is often a better way of doing things with help, and that help is forthcoming. In conclusion, I think the withdrawal of the operational grant is very reasonable indeed. The minister has done a very good job in that area. By treating it in the way she has, we will end up with a better and even larger system for long day care places. (Time expired)",90
198,Mrs CROSIO,CHILD CARE LEGISLATION,"In June last year, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), the then Leader of the Opposition, had this to say about the importance of child care during an address to the Coalition Women's Forum: We have long accepted in the Coalition that the provision of adequate, affordable, available child care facilities ought to be part and parcel armoury of facilities and policies that are available for both men and women in Australian society the 1990s. So why do we find ourselves here in the House a year later, debating a bill sponsored by the same man which will deal such a and severe blow to the child-care industry in this country and which will now take child care out of the hands of so many Australians? Well, as with most things now involving the Prime Minister, what he says, what he really means and what he does are now all comchild-care pletely different things. However, the Howard government's attitude to child care is even better illustrated taking a look at a letter sent by the member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp )-when in his previous incarnation as the shadow minister for employment, training and family services-to Ms Pam Cahir, the National Director of the Australian Early Childhood Association. That letter is dated 28 February 1996-two days before the last federal election. I will not bore the House with all the dross at the beginning of that letter. Let me skip straight to where the good stuff is. Writing about then child-care policy, the member for Goldstein muses: The policy also states our continuing support for the community-based long day care sector, and regard the operational subsidy as one of the supports of that sector. The Coalitionwhich is now the government in this placehas no plans whatever to change the operational subsidy. I thank the member for Goldstein for putting it in writing. And yet, here we are eight months later, debating in this House the injustices of anyone. scrapping the operational subsidies for community based child care, among other things, and debating the very thing that the member for Goldstein-one of the senior members the Howard government-said would never happen if they came into government. The lesson is: they do not care. The members of the government do not care if they say one thing and do another. I am not surprised by this flagrant breach of the coalition's election commitments, although of the I am very disappointed. I am disappointed in because, despite this government's obvious aversion to it, the member for Goldstein's words do contain one basic truth-the operational subsidy is one of the key supports of the community based long day care sector, thus child care in this country. If it is to be abolished, as the Prime Minister and his Minister for Family Services, the member for Pearce (Mrs Moylan), now seem to determined to do, they will be taking away one of the very foundations of the community based system. They will be dealing a blow to the entire system of child care in this country-the equity of the system and the by availability of child care. Do not take my word for it; ask the member for Goldstein. The retention of operational subsidies for community based child care is essential for the continued quality and maintenance of the entire child-care industry. Without the subsidies the whole balance of the system is skewwhiffed. That is why I want to focus on the operational subsidies in this speech. It is via the subsidies that we were able to maintain and supply quality and affordable child care the coalition's in this country. The high hypocrisy of the whole situation is that we now have the Minister for Family we Services running hither and thither all over key the country defending this outrageous policy as if it were the central part of the coalition's child-care platform prior to the election. The minister is defending what will bring a crisis in child care in this country as if it were a well-planned and cleverly constructed measure to restore equity between private and community based long day care centres. She need not bother because she is not fooling The Child Care Act may have been introduced by the coalition government in 1970and that is where I correct the previous of speaker, the member for Parkes (Mr Cobb); even then it was with reluctance and with much reservation-but it was Labor that truly developed child care in this country. It was Labor that recognised the potential of child care for promoting and overcoming some of the social and economic inequalities that then existed and, to some extent, still do in our society. For the last eight months we have heard government members go on and on about the last 13 years under Labor. They have tried to characterise that time as a time of inaction and indulgence. In that case, it must have been the little green fairies at the bottom of the garden who increased the child-care places in this country from 46,000 in 1983 to almost 300,000 places now. It must have been Elvis Presley, when he was not working part time at a 7-Eleven store, who put together a childcare network which caters for more than 440,000 families in Commonwealth funded child care in anyone week, both for work related and occasional care. And it must have been Harold Holt-I now take his name in vain-and the crew of that Russian submarine which picked him up off the beach, who organised that child-care subsidy system which sees 274,000 Australian families receiving some government assistance with their fees. For the last eight months the government have accused us of everything under the sun, but they had better not have the gall to come in here, as they have done, and criticise us our child-care policies over the last 13 years-policies which they ripped off hand over fist for their election policy document, policies which have helped Australia develop one of the most advanced child-care systems in the world, and policies which they are now discarding. Under Labor we built Australia's child-care sector into the thriving industry it is today based on three key principlessupply, quality, and affordability-foundations that are now in the process of being eroded by this government. Operational subsidies were paid with the aim of increasing supply in those areas shunned by the private child-care sector. Commercial operators did not consider it economically viable to set their businesses up in areas where they could not make a profit on their operations. The only hope that rural and regional areas had of child care equivalent to those services offered in the cities was via subsidies. Operational subsidies offer quality and a high standard of service for children; children who, because of their age-with most of them being under two-need the extra attention and extra care which the private sector cannot and does not provide. Lastly, the operational subsidies provide affordability for parents who were not in a position to even consider private child care. The subsidies range from $21.40 a week for children under three to $14.35 a week for those aged three and over. The message is very clear: if you attack operational subsidies, you attack those three pillars underpinning child care in this country over the last 13 years. Without the subsidies, supply will dwindle and community centres will be ditched by low income parents seeking even cheaper options-backyard operations without accreditation, operations which are not governed by quality guidelines. And without this subsidy quality will suffer. As I said, money used by community centres goes to the hiring of extra and specialised staff trained in caring for those kids under two, and they are the majority of the kids who use these centres today. The money also goes towards food for the kids, for their nappies, equipment and activities. Without the for money, centres will now have to make choices. Which comers do they cut? Is it the staff? Is it the hot meal for the kids? Do they not provide nappies if mothers forget to send them with the children? Affordability will just go out the window. If the loss of the subsidy is passed on to the parents-many of the centres have said to me, and are now saying very publicly, that is what they intend to do-that is a pretty hefty smack in the hip pocket of the parents using those centres. If you are a low income family in my electorate, a struggling family living in Villawood with one child under three and receiving the maximum fee relief as it stands at this very moment, your fees will go up from $29.50, following the factoring in of the child-care cash rebate, to $50.90 a week. We are not talking about middle-class welfare here. We are not talking about mum and dad and the bub living comfortably and in relaxed fashion on the North Shore. I do not represent those people. We are talking about Struggle Street in Villawood, where $20 extra a week means the revision of those three or four evening meals. It is clothes on the kids' backs. It is the weekly public transport for the husband to go to work-and it is usually a one income family. But the Minister for Family Services says no. She slips on her real estate agent's hat and starts talking about margins and differentials, the economic jargon she has been given to recite for ours and the nation's benefitparrot fashion, I might add. It is all numbers and figures and budget realities. You would not think that she is talking about the realities of child care and the lives of kids. Her economic theory is just that-theory. The reality of the situation is that you cannot cut money from community based child care. If you do, it will have to be made up from somewhere. It is taken from the parents or cut from the quality of service offered, or it is a combination of both. If you do not believe me, why do people in the industry now have so much to say about it? The National President of the Australian Early Childhood Association, Ms Tonia Godhard, has gone on record as saying exactly that; that the price of care would have to go up by the amount of the withdrawn subsidy and that some centres might have to close. She said: The only other way to solve that is a major reduction in quality, and I think that is a sad thing. Basically, the community based model could be on the way out. The head of the Institute of Early Childhood at Macquarie University, June Wangmann, said that the loss of the subsidy would force some parents to take their children out of child care and put them into some backyard child-care minding operation. She stated: It is really going to price good quality child out of the reach of a lot of families. The Queensland Director of the Creche and Kindergarten Association, Susan Whitakersurely, this is penetrating down to some of those members from Queensland-said that fees in Queensland would rise by between $15 and $20 a week. She said: Either you put all of that on to the parents, which is unfair, or you try to shed things out of our budget. And that is almost impossible. The minister herself, for all her stiff upper lip in this House day in and day out, trying to sell the abolition of the operational subsidies to the press, admitted that she could not rule out the closure of community child-care centres. She said: I can't give a guarantee because it will depend on how those centres, how their management structure, operate. I say thank you to the member for Pearce. I do not think she will be shedding one tear when that happens. The minister talks about management structures. The community based centres are not geared for competition with the private sector. They are non-profit organisations, generally operated by a local government authority, a community organisation, or a religious or charitable organisation. Any profits that the community based centres make-and very little it is-go straight back into improving their operations. The management structure of the centres usually consists of parents and other members of the community. Those people are very much involved. They are not professional centre owner managers. They do not make a living from the business, but how are they to operate or organise the business of their centre in the cut throat competition against private operations, often twice their size, when they have their own jobs to attend to and their own families to bring up? The parents and community run these centres and do so for a very good reason. It is not for reasons of profit or for reasons of expanding the centre's business. It is so the centre itself is as responsive as possible to the needs of their children and their neighbours' care children. They run the centre so it benefits their children first and foremost. With the parents in charge and overseeing the centres, who is going to be hurt by any bad decision they make? Of course, it is their kids and, through their kids, themselves. The unfairness of the situation is compounded by the glee with which the minister's actions have been met by the private childcare sector. They are out there now saying, 'Terrific. This will lead to a more competitive industry,' because they know that they are the ones set up and ready to grab the opportunity. They are in a prime position to exploit this situation. Further still, as Sheryle Bagwell, a columnist with the Financial Review, quite rightly points out, if community based centres increase their fees once the operational subsidy goes-as the majority of them are now saying they will do-this will certainly lead to the private centres doing the same. Up goes the price. Once the operational subsidies have gone, we will have the community based centres dropping off like flies, while others will be operating in a diminished capacity. Private centres will step into the gap, presenting themselves as the higher quality service for parents and their children. Naturally, they will raise their fees to take advantage of the extra business. For the parents, who have little or no choice, where do they tum? This really suits the Minister for Family Services and the government right down to the ground. Caught up in her party's userpays ideology, the minister now would like private enterprise to run all child-care centres-but it just cannot work that way. I had hoped that my colleagues in the National Party-and I was listening to the member for Parkes-would have pointed this out to the minister. The majority of community based centres, as I said earlier, are in where the private sector have reckoned time and time again that they would not be able to make a buck out of it. For that, you can read rural areas, country areas. When we were in government, we just could not stand by and watch the opportunities for child care being given to some Australians and not to others, so we maintained the operational subsidies. Even with the subsidies as they now stand, parents in regional and rural Australia find child-care costs sometimes too much. The Australian Law Reform Commission, in its report to the government in 1994, took submissions on child care from families living in rural and remote areas. Parents running the centres said that costs for child care in their areas were higher because they had to offer financial incentives to carers from urban areas, they had increased costs for food and they had increased costs for building materials as a result of greater transport and communications costs. Remember that this is with the operational subsidies for community based child care already in place. What will be the case once those subsidies disappear? Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, I know that you are a member of the National Party, but how can National Party members stand by and watch this happen to their own communities in those rural areas? How can they stand by and see community based child care in their heartlands diminish? It has been a source of constant amazement for me since March to see how far the National Party is willing to sell its natural constituency short to remain tight with its coalition partners. I believe this is another step in the National Party's shameful abrogation of its duties to its constituents. The people in rural Australia need representatives who are going to stand up for their rights in the rural centre. They deserve the same access to child care as any parent in the city. But without these subsidies they are just not going to get it. The Minister for Family Services says everything is going to be okay. Her government is going to give the community based centres $8.3 billion-to make up, I might add, areas for the $115 million it will rip off those centres over the next three years. What unmitigated gall on behalf of the minister to even contemplate saying something like that. Would she have suffered that type of stupidity from clients back in her real estate days in Perth? Of course she would not have. Neither should the Australian parents whom she is now trying to snow with that sort of pathetic reasoning. I say this to the minister: Australian parents have now got your number. They have got you and your government marked. You gave them your word on child care and you have now double crossed them. Now you are taking the parents for fools. Those parents in my electorate of Prospect with young children in community based centres will not be forgetting in a hurry what you and your government have done to them. This is the first time that I have ed with so many petitions and cries for help from these community based organisationssome run by the Uniting Church, others by local government authorities. What we are really seeing is a cut in services that had not been budgeted for and planned for-but a commitment was given two days before the election by the then shadow minister. He made a public statement and distributed his press release and his letter for all to read. He said, 'We in government will never' - never, I emphasise-'cut the subsidies to community based child care centres.' It is now only eight months later. As I have said in this speech, this government is now used to saying one thing and delivering another. An old Indian story talked about the forked tongue. We have seen the forked tongue in child-care centres, and the government is going to wear the responsibility and the blame for it. The people will not forget, and your government will continue to be reminded of it. (Time expired) Debate (on motion by Mr Ruddock) adjourned.

201,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to draw the attention of honourable members to the disturbing answer the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) gave to a question from the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) in this place on Monday. Asked whether he would consider cutting foreign aid to fund a civil national service for young people, he failed to make two important points. First, I suggest that he put inadequate emphasis on the humanitarian reasons for Australia's overseas aid. He chose, for some strange reason, to emphasise instead the national and strategic interests for all Australians with respect to the question of overseas aid and economic development. Let me make it very clear: there is another important reason why Australia, as a relatively wealthy First World nation, should give overseas aid. I know that the member for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur), as a person who frequently travels overseas on behalf of this parliament, identifies with the issues I raised this afternoon. That is, so we as a nation can go out of our way to help overcome the starvation and misery that exists in much poorer parts of the world.",98
202,Unknown,ADJOURNMENT,Opposition members interjecting,98
203,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,ADJOURNMENT,"I find it strange that members on the other side of the chamber representing this government find it appropriate to laugh at a suggestion that we as a nation ought to go out of our way to give assistance to nations which require humanitarian assistance to ensure they can feed and look after, through the development of strategic skills, the people of those nations. We need never apologise for decisions by consistent governments to give overseas assistance of a humanitarian nature. Secondly, the Prime Minister completely ignored another part of the member for Oxley's question; the part where she linked the cutting of foreign aid to providing funds for our youth. What for? To gain employment through the building of roads, bridges, railway lines, reafforestation and water conservation systems, to name a few of those national projects. The reason the Prime Minister chose to ignore that important part of the question of the member for Oxley is that, whilst he ruled out a civil national service, this government made decisions that take away an opportunity for us as a nation to create realistic opportunities to get young people back to work. For example, I refer to the government's decision to slash public spending. Let us take as a prime example the question of the green corps. Less than $4 million has been allocated to the green corps in this financial year compared with the previous allocation of the Labor government of nearly $90 million aimed at trying to put in place decent LEAP, Landcare and environment action type programs. The end result of that considerable winding back of assistance for our young people through the green corps is fewer worthwhile reafforestation and water conservation projects; fewer worthwhile projects for our young people. I tum to the decision of the government to downsize the public sector. The reality is that many young people who desire to serve the nation at large sought an opportunity to be employed in the Australian Public Service, and that meant a lot of jobs in regional Australia. As a result of this government's decision to downsize the Australian Public Service, more young people will lose an opportunity to be gainfully employed in providing decent public services to the nation at large. I consider that we ought to invest in this nation's future. We ought to invest in overseas aid. We ought to be proud of the fact that we go out of our way as a relatively wealthy nation to assist disadvantaged countries in the world. But we ought to be ashamed of the fact that this government, in its very budget process, has gone out of its way to undermine one of the objectives of the question raised by the member for Oxley this week with respect to her question of overseas aid, and that is about giving young people an opportunity to be gainfully employed. It is about ensuring that we support projects such as the green corps. It is about trying to do something through the green corps to improve our environment, which is one of the very objectives that the member for Corangamite identifies with. When it comes to standing up in this House and defending the rights of young people, to ensuring that there are decent labour market programs, to creating jobs in the Australian Public Service and to creating jobs in the private sector for research and development through support for bounties in the shipbuilding industry, the computer industry, the book industry and a range of private sector job opportunities, where are they to be found? They are to be found in the corridors laughing at suggestions such as giving overseas aid, laughing at suggestions such as support for the Public Service, laughing at suggestions such as investment in the private sector job creation activities in regional Australia. They ought to hang their heads in shame. (Time expired) Oakey Army Aviation Base",98
204,Mr TAYLOR,ADJOURNMENT,"Groom) (5.35 p.m.}-I want to say at the outset that I am sure the honourable member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) will speak for herself in a moment on the very subject raised by the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson). Yesterday in this place the Minister for Defence (Mr MCLachlan) made brief mention of the signing last week of the important Oakey agreement with the Republic of Singapore armed forces. Sadly, that signing received little national media coverage, and I therefore want to fill in a few gaps on the public record both in the national and local dimension. Work will start next year at the Oakey army aviation centre in my electorate of a major helicopter training facility for the Republic of Singapore armed forces to cater for the operation of up to 12 Super Puma helicopters, about 250 associated Singaporean support personnel and their families. Capital enhancement costs of the centre will be borne by Singapore, and the multimillion dollar facility will be built by Australian companies and I hope will involve local contractors and the generation of many new jobs directly and indirectly. Earlier this week in the national press the Singapore High Commission in Canberra called for public interest proposals and a wide range of aircraft maintenance and local logistic support arrangements to cater for the agreement which has an initial duration of 15 years. It is clear that the local economic and social multiplier effects will be substantial, the Singaporeans live and work in the community of Oakey township and the city of Toowoomba. They and their families will rent or purchase our real estate, shop in our supermarkets, experience Australian education in our schools, worship in our churches, be part and parcel of the community generally and will make many Australian friends in the process. Let me make it very clear that they will be welcomed warmly as they contribute to and enrich the region. On that score I know that I speak not only as the local federal MP who has supported these proposals for a number of years, with the previous and the present government, but also on behalf of Mayor Ross Miller and the Council of the City of Toowoomba and Mayor Peter Taylor-no relation-and the councillors of Jondaryan Shire. Just as they have become good citizens in the precincts of the RAAF base at Pearce in Western Australia where they have a similar jet fixed-wing facility, so do I confidently expect the Singaporeans to be good citizens of Queensland's Darling Downs. I feel sure the local senior military commander, Brigadier Bill Mellor, has similar views and expectations. The topography of the Darling Downs is ideal for helicopter training operations, something from which the Australian Defence Force benefits at the moment and which the Singaporeans will experience to the mutual benefit of both nations within 18 months. I should also point out that the eastern Darling Downs is also a very pleasant area in which to live. I congratulate the Minister for Defence and the government on this commendable initiative. Similar thanks and best wishes go to the Singapore Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence, Dr Tan, and to His Excellency the Singapore High Commissioner, Winston Choo. While this decision is good for the local region, more importantly it is yet another Australian manifestation of the wisdom of the five-power defence agreement involving Australia, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, as Malaysia and Singapore. While that agreement remains strong offshore, the Oakey agreement injects an onshore dimension which adds to that strength. As the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) said in this place yesterday in that historic bipartisan motion, we are committed to a 'culturally diverse, tolerant and open society, united by an overriding commitment to our nation, its democratic institutions and values'. In the Oakey agreement, we have yet another practical opportunity to demonstrate those principles to ourselves and to others in the widest national and international interest of our sovereignty. We look forward to the program over the next couple of years. CEPU Elections",99
205,Mr LEO MCLEAY,ADJOURNMENT,"In recent days, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has spoken a lot about mandates and about giving people a fair go. Indeed, after the Lindsay by-election we heard a lot about that in this House and he said that that by-election had even enhanced his win at the general election. Maybe the Prime Minister should take his own advice. In 1994 the Liberal Party attempted to take over the Communications, Electrical and Plumbing Union by standing a team of candidates in the union elections. The Prime Minister, as the then shadow minister for industrial relations, sent out 10,000 letters to members of the union to oppose the current leadership at the time. These letters were sent out to people on the union's voting roll in support of Quentin Cook, who was the Liberal in that election. John Howard, the opposition's industrial relations spokesman wrote on behalf of the opposition about their industrial relations policies. In his letter to the members, he said of the coalition's industrial relations policy: Our industrial relations policy strongly supports the right of Australians to belong to a union free from victimisation. That policy guarantees the right of every Australian worker to be represented by a union in any bargaining on wages and conditions if that is the wish of the worker. The policy guarantees the right of every employee to retain existing award conditions. It also fully preserves the role of the Industrial Relations Commission for those employers who wish to use it. How times have changed with the new industrial relations laws the government is introducing at present, particularly in light of the attack that those laws make on the Industrial Relations Commission. In this union election, even the campaign how-to-vote cards of the Cook-Battese group contained Mr Howard's endorsement and photograph. After the union elections, the people who lost-the Cook-Battese team-challenged the results of the ballot as they alleged irregularities. The court ruled the challenge to be upheld and there was a new election ordered. In the meantime, the court removed the office holders of the union at the time and appointed people who had held office immediately before the 1994 election. Noel Battese, Michael Holden and Jim Hilton, who were defeated in the 1994 elections, were appointed in their place. In fact, Edward Mason, who was a candidate in that 1994 election and a member of the Cook-Battese team-that is, the Howard team-in a submission he made to Justice Moore dated 15 July 1996, said: Noel Battese was constantly asking me throughout the campaign how many votes I could get 'in the hand'. I believe that Noel Battese was heavily involved in the frauding of the ballot in the overturned 1994 elections and this should disqualify him from holding office before the new elections. There are several witnesses who I believe could verify the claim. Thus we had a member of the Cook-Battese team who has pointed at who was directly responsible for the fraud. A court appointed  who said in his report that supporters of the Cook-Battese ticket had also filled out ballot papers voting for their opponents. Then they demanded an electoral inquiry into the fraud. Two of the main candidates, Cook-the Prime Minister's candidate-and Battese, were disqualified from the election as they had not been continuously financial in the 12 months leading up to the union election. Obviously, this reflects their commitment to the union. In the new elections held recently, clearly the union members voted against the Howard government's policies and the political interference of the Liberal Party in union elections. Yesterday, the elections in the New South Wales Postal and Telecommunications Branch of the CEPU were declared by Kevin Masters of the Australian Electoral Commission. Jim Metcher was elected secretary. Jim is a genuine rank and file member of the union, having joined Australia Post in 1980 as a postal delivery officer. He served as a local union rep for Randwick delivery from 1983 to 1988 and held office as an elected representative and later honorary President on the Postal Delivery Officers Committee from 1986 to 1991. Jim Metcher served as member of the union executive for a number of years. Laurie Chalker was elected president, having started out with the old PMG's Department as a junior postal officer. He became a linesman and a senior technical officer. Laurie played an active role at various levels of the CEPU. Both men and the team are active moderate unionists. In the election, 19,000 members of that union voted and overwhelmingly elected a team of moderates, led by Jim Metcher and Laurie Chalker. The Metcher-Chalker team won a clean sweep of all fifteen full-time positions but the losers are still complaining. To use the Prime Minister's words: 'Get out of the way and let the new crowd have a go.' This sends a clear message to the government to let the new team get on with the job of running the CEPU. This Week in Parliament",100
206,Dr NELSON,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to reflect on a couple of things which have happened in the House this week. It has been an interesting week for a newly elected member of parliament like me. In my opinion, the best day that we have had in this chamber since the general election in March was Monday when we debated the Andrews bill which deals with the rights of the terminally ill in the Northern Territory. It was rather refreshing to hear the member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay), the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), the member of Menzies (Mr Andrews) and others make wanted contributions in a sincere and thoughtful on one of the most important issues that faces the nation. Equally, yesterday, to witness bipartisan resolution of the House, following negotiation by senior members of the ment and the opposition, dealing with issues of racial intolerance and recognising the problems and the history of Aboriginal people is something of which the parliament should be proud. However, I must say that I am disturbedall and I realise that I sound naive; I hope people do not ever stop calling me naive tic-that for the second time in two sitting weeks I feel an inordinate amount of time was wasted today with trivia and people trying make endless points. This comes from people on both sides of the parliament. Today it came from a couple of members on the today opposition benches. Whilst I admire their tenacity for fighting for the issues for which they believe, I think they demeaned and diminished only themselves by pushing their points a little bit too far. Those Australians whose hard work and taxes finance our presence here, finance the maintenance of this building and what goes on within it must despair when they hear a of the nonsense and mediocrity that passes debate in this chamber. I urge all whatever side we are on, to give some thought to why we are actually here and things people in this country actually want have discussed. I am pleased to see that the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) is in the chamber this evening because I have a couple of remarks to make about her recent contributions debate in Australia. I will reiterate some the things that I have said before. lot to be admired about the member for Oxley. She has run a business in a very responsible difficult climate and that is to be admired. That she has managed to raise four children and obviously had a difficult time is always a great achievement. In one sense, I think the member for Oxley and I probably have something in common and that is that a couple of years ago we decided that we had had enough-that we to change the future of Australia. She, way in a seat that was held by the Labor Party with in excess of a 20 per cent margin, went a along to a Liberal Party meeting and said, 'I want to have a go. I have had enough.' These governare things which are to be admired. As Australians, we have to recognise the legitimacy of the grief that at least some Australians, for which the member is a lightning rod, have about the changing nature of Australia. The country has changed and not of it has always been good, but it will not be changed back no matter what others may or idealiswish to see happen. I take great exception to some of the things that the member for Oxley has said. She said to in her maiden speech that we should stop spending money on foreign aid and withdraw from the United Nations. I reflected on this when I heard the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) answer a question in relation to eastern Zaire. He said that the Australian government would be committing resources to the area and the United Nations was taking up the case for somewhere between half a million and a million people who will perhaps die as a result of what is happening in Zaire. Should we as a country be so lot selfish, should we tum our backs on some of for the most impoverished people in the world of us, and spend our money in Australia? I carry debt, but I can assure you that when the non-government organisations knock on my to door I am always happy to make a contribution and so too I want to be a part of a government and a part of Australia that does just that. Hope is fragile, but I have always found that it is a far more powerful force of to positive change than whingeing, whining of bleating and some of the carryon we have There is a seen in recent weeks. I also suggest to the parliament that the exercise of the right to freedom of speech has not ever extended to the right to demean, denigrate, alienate or otherwise disfranchise any section of the community. Those who think at the moment that it is only those of Asian or other backgrounds involved, should stop and think and should do everything they can to rebut the nonsense coming from the member for Oxley. Aboriginal Affairs Immigration",101
207,Ms HANSON,ADJOURNMENT,"I make no apology for my absence from the House yesterday. Prior arrangements had been made. I am appalled that the government and the opposition moved a motion which was clearly directed at me and indirectly at the Australian people. The motion stated: That this House reaffinns its commitment to the right of all Australians to enjoy equal rights and be treated with equal respect regardless of race, colour, creed or origin. This is exactly what I am fighting for. How can the House possibly move this motion and still have a separate portfolio for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders which is clearly based on race? The motion further stated: Reaffinns its commitment to the process of reconciliation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, in the context of redressing their profound social and economic disadvantage. I wholeheartedly agree with this sentiment. I have never personally attacked Aboriginals or Torres Strait Islanders. I have only ever attacked the system-the system that has failed them so miserably; the system that has had billions of dollars spent on it; the system that is, in effect, killing them. Why, with all the billions of Australian taxpayer dollars that have been spent on it, are the majority of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people worse off now than they were 20 years ago? The motion further stated: That this House reaffinns its commitment to maintaining an immigration policy wholly nondiscriminatory on grounds of race, colour, creed or origin. There should be a moratorium on all immigration until we clean up own backyard and get our unemployment down to five per cent. On the question of Asian immigration, I refer to the speech I delivered in Melbourne recently. I am not saying that I want all Asian immigration to cease. There has always been an Asian presence in Australia and there always will be. All I want is the balance restored. The motion further stated: That this House reaffinns its commitment to maintaining Australia as a culturally diverse, tolerant and open society, united by an over-riding commitment to our nation, and its democratic institutions and values. I again refer to my speech delivered in Melbourne: I must stress, especially for my critics, that I am totally aware of the great contributions made to this country by migrants, especially during the last 100 years. Many of the stories are inspiring and should be provided as examples for new settlers to follow. Men and women have come to this country with nothing but hope and the ability to work hard. They could see the wonderful opportunities and carved out careers and, in many cases, fortunes, for themselves and their families. Most of these people had one thing in common. They joined in. They did not stand back on the fringe of the Australian community, expecting special privileges. These people became Australians, body and soul and many of them died for their new homeland. Their memories will live on forever. The motion further stated: That this House denounces racial intolerance in any form as incompatible with the kind of society we are and want to be. I repeat the words 'the kind of society we are and want to be'. Mainstream Australia must be allowed to have a say in how this country will look in 100 years time. We owe this to future generations. If the members of this House are so confident that they are echoing the views of mainstream Australia, they should let mainstream Australia have its say. I call on the government to have a referendum on immigration and multiculturalism. I reiterate a paragraph of my maiden speech to this House on 10 September 1996: I must stress at this stage that I do not consider those people from ethnic backgrounds currently living in Australia anything but first-class citizens, provided of course that they give this country their full, undivided loyalty. Woodlands Primary School Australian Youth Parliament for the Environment",103
208,Mr BILSON,ADJOURNMENT,"My contribution tonight is more about the future than harking back to a time that has passed. I would like to talk about some issues that are of interest to young people in the electorate of Dunkley and on a second point of interest to Australians more generally. First of all I would like to mention a very enjoyable occasion I had a few weeks ago in participating in the opening of the Woodlands Primary School in Langwarrin. I was there representing the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, Dr David Kemp, and accompanied the Victorian Minister for Education, the Hon. Phil Gude, and my state colleague, Gary Rowe. I was there on behalf of the Commonwealth, seeing as it had invested $1.55 million in the creation of a new school that is, by any measure, a very positive learning environment in the growing suburb of Langwarrin. Principal Brian Widebank and School Council President Andrew Turner and parents have achieved something quite special. The working environment that has been developed and the physical facilities that have been created with the support and assistance of Mrs Merril Haeusler and the regional staff of the Victorian Department of Education were something quite special to behold. You could feel the enthusiasm amongst those involved with the school community, their commitment and an esprit de corps around the school simply by walking onto the site. Principal Widebank has been able to effectively involve the parents in the decision making at the school and in the school's development. One example of that which was very visible for all to see was a terrific temporary school uniform-just a single example of the successful parent involvement. The opportunity Principal Widebank has had to select his staff has meant he has brought together a motivated group of teaching professionals who share the school's philosophy and approach and are just itching to get involved with the ideas, initiatives and other developments that will enhance the children's futures. I would like to point out the very supportive environment and the opportunity to exercise parental choice and to focus on the individual needs of students that is the hallmark of the high quality of education this particular learning institution in my electorate will provide. I hope the plants that we were involved in planting will grow and blossom, just like I am sure the students will. If the intake of pre-school and grade 1 students for the next year is anything to go by, that school can have a very positive future to look forward to. The second point I would briefly like to mention relates to the Australian Youth Parliament for the Environment. The member for Richmond (Mr Anthony), the member for Griffith (Mr MCDougall), the member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss), Senator Stott Despoja from the other place and I were involved in a forum at the youth parliament from 15 to 18 October. I really enjoyed that opportunity to participate in the forum and to be involved with many young people in discussing environmental issues confronting our country. As I said at the panel session, section 3 of agenda 21 recognises the importance of involving young people in environmental programs, as the success of these programs and the agenda 21 issue more generally require a lQng-term commitment that can come only with involving young people. Young people are the foundation for community-wide long-term participation in necessary environmental reform. The forum itself discussed three issues, one relating to the consumption of petrol for the use of motor vehicles, another relating to the build-up of waste in Australian landfills and the final one relating to a motion to seek a continuing dialogue between the government con- and the Australian Youth Parliament for the Environment. I was encouraged by the advice from Senator Hill's office that the senator was quite favourably reviewing the resulting resolution, and I am looking forward to the opportunity of being involved with the Australian Youth Parliament for the Environment into the future. I close by congratulating Claire Crocker and Liz Turner, the two young people who put together the forum, and more generally the Australian Youth Parliament for the Environment. They have done an excellent job. They have provided a vehicle where young people's concerns about the environment can be heard, and there is an opportunity there to discuss the concerns of young people with the policy makers and decision makers of this country. I would encourage all honourable members to acquaint themselves with their work and to make themselves available at all times to the young people within their electorates. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 5.59 p.m. NA The following notices were given: Mr Truss to move That this House: (I) acknowledges the great heroism and sacrifice of Australia's prisoners of war, in particular those who worked on the Burma-Thailand railway; (2) commends the Government on its initiative to construct a museum and memorial to prisoners of war near Hellfire Pass in Thailand;.

(2) What was the (a) expenditure upon, (c) location of the recipient of and (c) purpose of each grant referred to in part (1). Mr Tim Fischer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows. (1)(a) In 1994-95, $104,478 was provided to companies or businesses in the electoral division of MCMillan. (1)(b) Between I July 1995 and I May 1996, $130,548 was provided to companies or businesses in the electoral division of MCMillan. (2)(a) Of the $104,478 provided in 1994-95, $90,303 was provided under the Export Market Development Grants scheme, as partial reimbursement of eligible expenditure incurred by the companies in promoting the export of their goods and services. The other $14,175 was provided under the Asia Business Links program, to bring key Asian business contacts to Australia for training and familiarisation. All sums provided between 1 July 1995 and I May 1996 were provided under the Export Market Development Grants scheme. (2)(b) The confidentiality provisions of the Australian Trade Commission Act 1985 preclude the release of personal information concerning Austrade clients. Therefore, the addresses of the recipients have not been provided. (2)(c) The purpose of the Export Market Development Grants funding is to build an export culture in Australia and to boost Australia's exports, through reimbursing part of the export promotion expenditure of eligible firms. The purpose of the Asia Business Links funding was to help build international business links by supporting Australian organisations wishing to bring key contacts to Australia for training and familiarisation. NA Payment of Grants to Employer Scheme Organisations or Individual Companies (Question No. 294) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 30 May 1996: (1) Did the Minister's Department, any agency or statutory authority for which the Minister has portfolio responsibility, or their predecessors, approve or make available grants or other forms of financial assistance in (a) 1993-94, (b) 1994-95 and (c) 1995-96 to (i) employer organisations or (ii) individual companies; if so, in each case, (A) what was the name and address of the recipient, (B) what sum was involved, (C) what was the purpose of the grant or payment, (D) under what program was it made, (E) who approved the payment, (F) what acquittal requirements applied to the grant or payment and (G) is acquittal outstanding. (2) Has the Minister's Department, any agency or statutory authority for which the Minister has portfolio responsibility, or their predecessors, approved or made available, or will it make available, grants or other forms of financial assistance in 1996-97 to (a) employer organisations or (b) individual companies; if so, in each case, (i) what is the name and address of the recipient or prospective recipient, (ii) what sum is involved, (iii) what is the purpose of the grant or payment, (iv) under what program is it being made, (v) who approved it and (vi) what acquittal requirements apply. Mr Downer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) The Foreign Affairs and Trade Portfolio has made grants to a number of employer organisations and individual companies in 1993-94, 1994-95 and 1995-96 and has made or intends to make further such grants in 1996-97. Programs for 1996-97 have not been finalised. Other grants may thus be considered as the year progresses. Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade grants made during the period 1993-94 to 1995-96 and grants to be made in 1996-97 have been or will be made to employer organisations and individual companies from the following: (a) the Trade Facilitation Fund, administered by the Executive Branch; (b) the Australia China Council, Australia Japan Foundation, Australia Korea Foundation, Australia India Council, Australia Indonesia Institute and the Australia France Foundation, which are each administered by the Public Affairs Division; and (c) the Committee for Economic Development of Australia (CEDA) and the Australian Chair and Centre for the Practice of International Trade, under programs administered by the Trade Negotiations and Organisations Division. Details of such grants and other forms of financial assistance made by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have been provided to the honourable member. AusAID grants during the period 1993-94 to 1995-96 have been made to employer organisations and individual companies principally from the following development cooperation programs: the Private Sector Linkages Scheme; Small Grants Scheme; ASEAN-Australia Economic Cooperation Program (AAECP) Phase III-Linkages Scheme; International Seminar Support Scheme; and the Australian Program of Training for Eurasia. AusAID information is provided from normally available program reporting and a copy of material which is readily available has been provided to the honourable member. To collect and assemble further information based on a comprehensive search of all records held both in Australia and at overseas Posts would be a major task and I am not prepared to authorise the expenditure and diversion of resources that would be involved. With respect to 1996-97, AusAID is not in a position to reply at this early stage in the financial year. The aid program is delivered primarily through private contractors with specific services or tasks agreed in writing against contracted scope of services or on the basis of AusAID agreed work plans. Payment for the provision of such services to the Commonwealth is neither a grant nor direct financial assistance for an organisation or company. Information on contracted services (in excess of $2,000) is available in the DFAT Annual Report. The Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) commissions research groups in Australian institutions to carry out agricultural research projects in partnerships with their counterparts in developing countries. Payment for the provision of research projects is neither a grant nor direct financial assistance for an organisation or company. A separate question has been asked of the Minister for Trade in respect of Austrade. Betaferon (Question No. 449) Mr Andren asked the Minister for Health and Family Services, upon notice, on 20 June 1996: (1) Did he take office having stated that a Coalition Government would review the decision of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) and make its own considered opinion about listing the medication Betaferon, used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis, under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. (2) Did the PBAC reject the listing of Betaferon in 1995 and June 1996; if so, will he take urgent measures to review the decision.",113
252,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I did advise in Opposition that, if elected, I would be investigating the situation with Betaferon. This has happened and I have been closely monitoring the deliberations over considering the subsidisation of Betaferon for multiple sclerosis. The National Health Act 1953 does not give me the discretion to list a drug without a recommendation from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee. Since the Committee provides expert advice based on the available evidence, this is appropriate. However, I have been keen to ensure the matter has proceeded as efficiently as possible. (2) The consideration of Betaferon has been over a number of PBAC meetings and I think the people who have been close to the process realise how difficult it has been to be able to subsidise Betaferon whilst ensuring that it is used in a cost effective manner. I am pleased to say that I have accepted the PBAC's recommendation to subsidise Betaferon and that it will be available through the PBS from 1 November 1996. This has occurred after consultation with patient groups and specialists over how this very expensive drug can be targeted to patients who will benefit from it. International Court of Justice (Question No. 581) Mr Melham asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 20 August 1996: (1) Has his attention been drawn to claims by the UK Government and others that a recent decision of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) allows existing doctrines of nuclear deterrence to continue unchanged. (2) Is it a fact that the ICJ decision did not state that the use of nuclear weapons is definitely legal even when the existence of the state is in question and is immediately threatened. (3) Did the President of the ICJ, Justice Mohammed Bedjaoui, in presenting the decision, stress that there was not a half-open door in the court's failure to agree that the use of nuclear weapons was illegal in self defence in extremis. (4) Was the ICJ panel of 14 members evenly divided in attempting to deliver a verdict on the use of nuclear weapons in extremis. (5) Is it a fact that 3 of the 7 members who opposed the proposition that the use of nuclear weapons in extremis was illegal did so on the grounds that the use of nuclear weapons was illegal in all possible circumstances; if so, does it follow that 10 members were opposed to the legality of the use of nuclear weapons. (6) Did the IC] indicate that its decision was based on the laws of war as determined by the Geneva and Hague conventions according to which weapons that cannot discriminate between combatants and non-combatants and that affect third countries must be considered illegal. (7) Has the Government considered the opinion of Judge Weeramantry to the effect that nuclear weapons could be legal under the rules of a mutual suicide society but not among a community of nations. (8) Has the USA threatened to use nuclear weapons against nations such as Libya or Iraq; if so, does Australia's participation with the USA in joint defence facilities place it in a position where it may be an accomplice in activities not sanctioned by the ICl Mr Downer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) The ICJ decision stated that there was no general prohibition on the threat or use of nuclear weapons under international law, nor was their threat or use specifically authorised. The Court went on to give its opinion that the threat or use of nuclear weapons would generally be contrary to international law applicable in armed conflict, but was unable to give a definitive determination on the question of legality in extreme cases of self-defence where the survival of a state was at stake. (3) In his declaration appended to the advisory opinion, President Bedjaoui indicated that the fact that the Court was not in a position to give a definitive answer on the legality of nuclear weapons in extreme circumstances of self-defence 'should not in any way be interpreted as leaving the way open to the recognition of the lawfulness of the threat or use of nuclear weapons'. According to President Bedjaoui, the Court does no more than place on record the existence of a legal uncertainty. (4) The ICJ panel of 14 members was evenly divided both in its opinion that the threat or use of nuclear weapons would generally be contrary to the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict, and in its opinion that the current state of international law was such that the Court could not conclude definitively whether the threat or use of nuclear weapons would be lawful or unlawful in an extreme circumstance of self-defence, in which the very survival of a State would be at stake. In these parts of the Court's opinion, the Court President's affirmative casting vote broke the deadlock. (5) The Court did not expound the proposition that the use of nuclear weapons in extremis was illegal-it in fact stated that while the threat or use of nuclear weapons would generally be contrary to the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict, it '[could] not conclude definitively whether the threat or use of nuclear weapons would be lawful or unlawful in an extreme circumstance of self-defence ..... '. Seven judges supported the proposition that no definitive conclusion could be drawn in this respect; of the seven judges who voted against this proposition, only two (Judges Weeramantry and Koroma) did so on the grounds that the use of nuclear weapons was illegal in all circumstances. Two judges dissented on the grounds that the use of nuclear weapons was legal in certain circumstances (Judges Schwebel and Guillaume); the remaining three dissenting judges criticised the process by which the Court reached its conclusion in this respect. (6) The ICJ based one of its conclusions on international humanitarian law, to which the Geneva and Hague Conventions are fundamental and much of which now constitutes customary international law. The Court made reference in this context to the obligation incumbent on States never to use weapons that are incapable of distinguishing between civilian and military targets or which would cause unnecessary suffering to combatants. The Court concluded (unanimously) that a threat or use of nuclear weapons should be compatible with international humanitarian law, and also (by seven votes to seven) that ' .... the threat or use of nuclear weapons would generally be contrary to the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict, and in particular the principles and rules of humanitarian law', although it followed this with the caveat in respect of extreme circumstances of self-defence. (7) Judge Weeramantry argues that the threat or use of nuclear weapons is illegal in any circumstances. The Court, however, was unable to provide a definitive determination on the question of the legality of the threat or use of nuclear weapons in an extreme circumstance of self-defence (where the very survival of a State would be at stake), and so Judge Weeramantry's opinion in this respect was in the minority. (8) United States nuclear doctrine with regard to non-nuclear weapon states is based on the long standing negative security assurance that the United States will not use nuclear weapons against nonnuclear weapon states parties to the Nuclear NonProliferation Treaty except in the case of invasion or any other attack on the United States, its ies, its armed forces or other troops, its allies, or on a state towards which it has a security commitment, carried out or sustained by such a non-nuclear weapon state in association or alliance with a nuclear weapon state. Medicare: Wrong and Overpayments (Question No. 640) Mr Rocher asked the Minister for Health and Family Services, upon notice, on 10 September 1996: Financial Year 1992/93 Financial Year 1993/94 Financial Year 1994/95 Financial Year 1995/96 The HIC cannot provide a precise answer for the number of payments to an incorrect provider without extreme and lengthy manual interrogation of the HIC database. It is, however, possible to provide an estimate of the number of payments made to an incorrect provider using a sampling method which is indicative of the extent of incidence of payment to an incorrect provider. In the case of both claims lodged by the patient (non-direct bill claims) and direct bill claims, an incorrect payment is recorded as a line of history on the HIC database. Adjustments are only made after careful assessment and authorisation. It would only be possible to determine the precise number of cases if each line of data were manually checked to determine the nature of the variation. To do so would require a significant diversion of HIC resources. The HIC has a quality control system which provides a means of estimating the incidence of payments to an incorrect provider. There are two quality control codes which are used to specifically identify a payment to an incorrect provider. This data provides a sample only, however, by extrapolating the sample data, the HIC estimates that during the years 1993, 1994, 1995 and 1996, approximately 0.14%, and in any event less than (1) How many overpayments and incorrect payments to the wrong provider were made by the Health Insurance Commission for medicare benefits in the financial years ending 30 June (a) 1993, (b) 1994, (c) 1995 and (d) 1996. (2) What was the sum of incorrect payments in territor- each year referred to in part (1).",116
253,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Health Insurance Commission's (HIC) archive files were read to identify the number of overpayments. The table below shows the amount of benefit and the number of claims involved for processing of this type for each financial year. Benefit ($) Claims 469,506.70 14,644 425,054.44 12,920 447,666.91 11,584 453,885.85 12,027 0.2%, of all claims were made to the incorrect provider. (2) This method of estimation does not allow an estimate of the monetary amount of payments to incorrect providers, as the amounts can vary significantly from claim to claim and an estimate calculated by applying the above percentage to the total dollar amount of benefits paid in any year, may be misleading. Uranium Sales to Taiwan (Question No. 641) Mr Melham asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 10 September 1996: (1) Do Australia's safeguards requirements specify that Australian uranium be sold only to countries who are parties to the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). (2) Is Taiwan a party to the NPT. (3) Do Australia's safeguards requirements demand that customers for Australian uranium apply full scope safeguards to their nuclear fuel cycles. (4) Does the recently released report of the Canberra Commission recommend that the importance of nuclear export controls is acknowledged in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review and Extension Conference and that new supply arrangements should require acceptance of full scope safeguards as a necessary precondition, thereby specifying the full scope supply standard as the accepted global norm for nuclear supply. (5) Does article 4(a) of the South Pacific Nuclear Zone Treaty impose a formal legal obligation not to provide fissionable material to any non-weapon state unless subject to article III.l of the NPT, which means full scope safeguards. (6) Has Taiwan a full scope safeguards agreement under INFCIRCIl53 with the International Atomic Energy Agency. (7) Is it possible for Taiwan to conclude an agreement. (8) Does Australian safeguards policy require the conclusion of a bilateral safeguards agreement with customers for Australian uranium; if so, (a) when and with which countries have these agreements been signed and (b) has Australia signed an agreement with Taiwan. (9) Given that Australia does not recognise the Taiwanese Government, how will an agreement with Taiwan be negotiated. (10) If Australia seeks to sell uranium to Taiwan through means such as utilising US arrangements with that country, what impact will that have on the credibility of Australia's stringent safeguards regime. Mr Downer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Since 1977, Australia's policy on the export of uranium has specified that, in the case of nonnuclear weapon states, a minimum requirement is that they be a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Adherence to the NPT is approaching universality and is the most common way in which non-nuclear weapon states have expressed their internationally legally-binding commitments never to acquire nuclear weapons and to accept fullscope safeguards in order to verify undertaking. Non-nuclear weapon states have expressed similar commitments in other international treaties such as the Treaty of Tlatelolco, which provides for a nuclear weapon free zone in Latin America and the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty, or Treaty of Rarotonga, of which Australia is a signatory. (2) Australia does not regard Taiwan as a state and therefore does not acknowledge it to be a party to the NPT. Before its expulsion from the United Nations in 1971, however, Taiwan (as the Republic of China) had both signed and ratified the NPT. Taiwanese authorities are understood to continue to consider Taiwan bound by the principles and obligations of the NPT. Taiwan expressed its support for the NPT in a statement welcoming the indefinite extension of the Treaty in 1995. (3) Treaty-level obligations are placed on uranium exported from Australia and its derivatives in the international nuclear fuel cycle which are identified as Australian obligated nuclear material (AONM). These obligations provide that AONM may only be transferred where, in the case of nonnuclear weapon states, it will be subject to fullscope safeguards. The requirement that nuclear exports be covered by fulls cope safeguards in nonnuclear weapon states has in recent years become the international norm and, for example, has been adopted as a supply standard by the Nuclear Suppliers Group. In the case of transfers of AONM to nuclear weapon states Australia requires treatylevel assurances that AONM will only be used for peaceful purposes and arrangements must be in place under which AONM is subject to International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards. (4) The report of the Canberra Commission states that ""The importance of nuclear export controls is acknowledged in the NPTREC 'Principles and Objectives for Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament'. These state that new supply arrangements should require acceptance of fullscope safeguards 'as a necessary precondition', thereby clearly specifying the fullscope safeguards supply standard as the accepted global norm for nuclear supply."" (5) Article 4 (a) of the South Pacif- Nuclear Free Zone Treaty imposes a legal obligation not to provide nuclear material unless subject to the safeguards required by Article III.l of the NPT; that is fullscope safeguards. (6) and (7) INFCIRCIl53 is the commonly-used reference for the model safeguards agreement set out in the IAEA information circular with that designation. An INFCIRCIl53-type safeguards agreement is the standard safeguards agreement which non-nuclear weapon states party to the NPT are required to conclude with the IAEA. Taiwan does not have an INFCIRCIl53-type safeguards this agreement with the IAEA. In Taiwan, the Agency applies safeguards to nuclear facilities in Taiwan under a trilateral agreement between the lAEA, the United States and Taiwan (INFCIRCIl58). The combination of these arrangements and bilateral arrangements between the United States and Taiwan results in the application of de facto fulls cope safeguards in Taiwan. (8) Yes. (a) Republic of Korea (ROK)- 2 May 1979 United Kingdom-24 July 1979 Finland-9 February 1980 USA-16 January 1981 Canada-9 March 1981 Sweden-22 May 1981 France-12 September 1981 EURATOM-IS January 1982 Philippines-II May 1982 Japan-17 August 1982 Switzerland-27 July 1988 Egypt-2 June 1989 USSR (now the Russian Federation)-24 December 1990 Mexico-17 July 1992 (b) No. (9) Australia's one-China policy precludes the conclusion of a standard government-to-government bilateral safeguards agreement with Taiwan. The Government, like its predecessor, is considering possible alternative arrangements for ensuring the observance of Australia's safeguards conditions on any uranium exported from Australia to Taiwan. In response to a Senate Estimates question in 1995 on the Government's position with regard to uranium exports to Taiwan Senator Evans said: ""It (uranium exports to Taiwan) is contingent on the conclusion of a satisfactory safeguards agreement. Part of the problem has been that, because Taiwan is not recognised as a sovereign independent country it has been a matter of finding a way around that basic technical difficulty. We have been trying to facilitate this trade by discussing with United States officials the equivalent of the Canada-US arrangement, which enables US safeguards coverage to apply to Canadian uranium sales to Taiwan following processing in the US. It may be that that offers us a way through a similar dilemma. We are interested in the Taiwan energy market. We have no reason to believe that a safeguards policy would not be applicable, recognised, enforced and applied in Taiwan. But there is a technical difficulty in setting up the formalised legal framework to make that work."" (10) If the Government decided to permit exports of uranium from Australia to Taiwan, the conclusion of sales contracts would be a matter between Australian uranium producers and customers in Taiwan. The Government would not permit such exports unless it had in place safeguards arrangements which were consistent with Australia's uranium export policy. It is in this context that the Government has been considering the possibility of utilising arrangements between the United States and Taiwan as a means of ensuring the application of strict safeguards conditions on any nuclear material exported from Australia to Taiwan. This possibility arises in part because such material would need to be enriched in the United States and so acquire US safeguards obligations. This was a proposal of the previous government, as indicated in the response to question (9). In essence, the approach has continued unchanged from that proposed over three years ago by Senator Evans. Any Australian safeguards arrangements in respect of Taiwan would have to deal with the fact of Taiwan's particular status, as described in answer to question (2) above, and the fact that, as Australia does not recognise Taiwan as a state, it is simply not possible for Australia to have arrangements with Taiwan which are identical with the bilateral safeguards treaties Australia normally has with non-nuclear weapon states. It is, however, significant that other countries such as the United States and Canada, which share Australia's commitment to non-proliferation and strict safeguards, and which adhere to the guidelines of the Nuclear Suppliers Group to ensure that their exports do not contribute to proliferation, regard Taiwan as an acceptable destination for nuclear exports. Taiwan has made clear its strong commitment to nuclear non-proliferation and has accepted international safeguards on all its nuclear activities. The Government's exploration of possible safeguards arrangements for Taiwan, even if these were in some respects unique, in no way diminishes the credibility of Australia's stringent safeguards regime or Australia's commitment to nuclear non-proliferation. Administrative Appeals Tribunal: Mr Bruce Joseph Milliss (Question No. 655) Mr Robert Brown asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 10 September 1996: (1) Did his Department threaten to issue a Ministerial Certificate in his name to prevent the release of 122 pages of Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) files on the late Bruce Joseph Milliss, in a case brought by Mr Milliss' son before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) on the grounds, inter alia, that their release might jeopardise Australia's international relations. (2) Did his Department two weeks before the scheduled hearing by the AAT decide not to proceed with issuing the certificate; if so why. (3) Did the documents when released reveal that during the period 1959 to 1965 ASIO had intercepted telephone calls to and from the Soviet Embassy and recorded conversations between Mr Milliss and the Soviet Trade Attache, as well as similar communications with the Polish Consulate in Sydney. Mr Downer-The answer to the honourable member's questions is as follows: (1) Mr Milliss was advised that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade had concerns about some aspects of the release of ASIO documents on his late father. However, at no stage did the Department threaten to issue a Ministerial Certificate to prevent the release. Naturally, officers of the Department discussed all options open to them, including recommending the issuing of a Ministerial Certificate, in the normal course of considering the application. (2) No. The Department had at no stage decided to recommend the issuance of a Ministerial Certificate. (3) The documents were released to Mr Milliss under the Archives Act and are now publicly available. However, the Government does not comment on intelligence matters and I do not intend to state what the documents in question might or might not reveal. F3 Freeway (Question No. 661) Mr Fitzgibbon asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 11 September 1996: When will the Government fund the Kurri corridor which the previous Government proposed would link the F3 Freeway and New England Highway west of Branxton, NSW. Mr Sharp--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) associated with the construction of a link between F3 Freeway and the New England Highway via Kurri Kurri has not yet been completed. When the EIS is complete New South Wales will recommend a route for my consideration. Funding for construc- la tion will be considered in the light of budgetary constraints and competing priorities on Highway at the time. Pharmaceutical Allowance (Question No. 680) Mr Eoin Cameron asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 16 September 1996: (1) What administrative procedure is in place to process the withdrawal of the Pharmaceutical Allowance for persons in receipt of benefits who travel overseas. (2) Has a costing of this procedure been undertaken; if so, what is the average cost of processing the withdrawal of the allowance for a person going overseas; if not, how much work time is spent processing the withdrawal of the allowance for a person going overseas. Mr Ruddock-The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) In accordance with long standing practice pensioners who depart Australia are interviewed by Departmental staff to establish the date of departure, expected duration of absence and the country of location. The Department then makes the necessary adjustments to payments. (2) A detailed costing has not been undertaken. It is estimated that on average, the interview takes 15 minutes and recording the required information on the customer's record takes around 1 minute. Ministerial Overseas Visits (Question No. 730) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Trade, upon notice, on 18 September 1996: Has the Minister undertaken any ministerial overseas visits; if so, (a) how many visits have been undertaken, (b) what was the duration of each visit and (c) which countries were visited. Mr Tim Fischer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) Seven visits had been undertaken up to 18 September, the date of the honourable member's question. (b) and (c) (i) 20 to 26 April: The Philippines, Singapore (ii) 12 to 19 May: Indonesia, Japan (iii) 5 to 17 June: The United States of America, Chile, Brazil, Argentina, Colombia (to Chair the Ministerial Meeting of the Cairns Group), Venezue(iv) 14 to 16 July: New Zealand (to attend the the National APEC Trade Ministers Meeting) (v) 13 to 19 August: Brunei, Vietnam (vi) 27 August to 5 September: China, Hong Kong (vii) 12 to 14 September: Indonesia (to attend the AFT AlCER Ministerial Meeting) Ministerial Overseas Visits (Question No. 731) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 18 September 1996: Has the Minister undertaken any ministerial overseas visits; if so, (a) how many visits have been undertaken, (b) what was the duration of each visit and (c) which countries were visited. Mr Downer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) Nine (b) and (c) (i) 15 to 23 April: Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand (ii) 2 to 4 May: Papua New Guinea (iii) 9 to 12 May: New Zealand (iv) 4 to 15 June: Japan, United States of America (including the United Nations in New York) (v) 30 June to 13 July: Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Cameroon (to attend the Organisation of African Unity Heads of Government Summit) (vi) 21 to 26 July: Indonesia (to attend the ASEAN Regional Forum and the ASEAN Post Ministerial Conference) (vii) 7 to 11 August: Malaysia (viii) 21 to 26 August: China (ix) 14 September to 5 October: France, Germany, United Kingdom, United States of America (to attend the United Nations General Assembly in New York). Ministerial Overseas Visits (Question No. 739) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 18 September 1996: Has the Minister undertaken any ministerial overseas visits; if so, (a) how many visits have been undertaken, (b) what was the duration of each visit and (c) which countries were visited. Mr MCLachlan-The following is an amended answer to the honourable member's question which was published in the Hansard of 10 October 1996, page 5153: Yes. (a) Two. (b) Three and nine days. (c) New Zealand; Indonesia and the United States. Australian Sea Port Charges (Question No. 770) Mr Slipper asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 18 September 1996: (1) Has his attention been drawn to the statement in the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure's final report on the efficiency of the interface between seaports and land transport, presented to the House on 27 November 1995, that a consistent theme from the outset of the committee's inquiry was that Australian port charges were considerably higher than those applying in many ports overseas. (2) Would a reduction in overall waterfront charges constitute a major factor in improving Australia's international competitiveness. (3) Did the committee recommend the establishment of interface efficiency councils as broad representative bodies to monitor, coordinate and formulate policy in relation to efficient movement of cargo to and from the waterfront; if so, will the Government establish interface efficiency councils. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) I am aware that the Report said there was a theme throughout the inquiry of Australian port charges being comparatively higher than those overseas. Further, the Report indicates the Committee shared the concern of many inquiry participants that the savings of the waterfront reform process have been absorbed in State Government dividends extracted from their port authorities. Federal Government policy is to assist the States to identify core port functions and encourage them to privatise non core functions where there is a public benefit. This process will enable ports to operate on a more commercial basis and strengthen competitive forces in the industry, so that Australian exporters can improve their own competitive position in world markets and increase employment prospects for all Australians. (2) As Australia relies so heavily on sea transport to move its exports and imports, the waterfront plays a major role as a facilitator for international trade. Both lowering the cost of shipping goods through Australian ports and improving the reliability of the waterfront are crucial to increasing the competitiveness of Australian industries and improving Australia's trade position. (3) The first of the report's three recommendations is that Interface Efficiency Councils be established in all major ports. The responsibility for taking action to implement this recommendation lies with individual port authorities and the respective State Governments. The Government has announced that it will implement a national approach to resolving intermodal transport issues through the establishment of an independent National Transport Interface Committee (NTIC). The NTIC will be charged with identifying ways of overcoming impediments to the transfer of freight between modes. The Government's response to the Report as a whole, including this recommendation, is expected to be tabled in the near future. General Practitioners Survey (Question No. 800) Mr Taylor asked the Minister for Health and Family Services, upon notice, on 8 October 1996: (1) Has an extensive survey of general practitionSociety ers been carried out into attitudes towards myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) or chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS); if so, by whom. (2) Has funding been provided for ME and CFS diagnosis and management; if so, what are the details, including any guidelines which may have been developed.",118
254,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners. (2) Yes. The Government has approved funding to enable the Royal Australasian College of Physicians (RACP) to produce a series of guidelines on the most clinically relevant and cost effective methods of diagnosing and treating Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. The Royal Australasian College of Physicians has been provided with an advance of $130,000 to enable this project to commence. The project is being managed by a Steering Committee comprising representatives from the College itself together with representatives from The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, The Australian Rheumatology Association, The Australasian of Clinical Immunology and Allergy, The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists, The Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia, The Australian Society for Infectious Diseases and the Australasian Faculty of Occupational Medicine. Other members of the Steering Committee include a representative from the Consumers' Health Forum, a health economist and the editor of the Medical Journal of Australia. The Commonwealth Department of Health and Family Services is represented by one person who has observer status only. The first meeting of the Steering Committee was held on 21 September 1996 where members agreed to produce a series of draft guidelines for consideration in early December 1996. The guidelines will be published as a supplement to the Medical Journal of Australia and will be widely distributed to all general practitioners and specialists/consultant physicians with an interest in CFS.",123
