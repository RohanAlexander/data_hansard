One of the things which ATSIC needs to consider from Victoria and had the good fortune to work Aboriginal Health and Housing Cooperative, the delivery of an Aboriginal health service organisation; we had, I think, only 16 or ATSIC, whilst very good in the context of trying we sought to deliver services to, would have based in Gippsland, as opposed to an ATSIC the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission this would be practicable. I know that many of the Aboriginal people to be friends consider ATSIC still an organisation I think that placing an office there, of whatever considering the size of that Aboriginal community be a step in the right direction. It would give Cooperative, the Ramahyuck Aboriginal cooperative Aboriginal Cooperative in Bairnsdale, and the links into that very important organisation, number of programs to Aboriginal people.

NA Thursday,23 September 1999 In considering the bill and its provisions Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, to be made. The first is the very low rate Islander people in elections. We have such Islander people on the Australian Electoral their polling booths on election days-as I think booths in their constituencies-I would just they ever bump into as they are doing the rounds not many, even though many of us have significant This is something which we need to address very seriously. I noted with some alarm that there were Commission Indigenous Enrolment Program in bipartisan traditions of this place, to urgently to reinstate that program as a way of encouraging participation in general elections in this country. those people participate in the democratic process. I cannot tell you how much it pains constituency and talk to them about an election only to find that there is indifference in some election on and many people still are not tradition in Australia. We need to seek to extend in our community, and especially Aboriginal from the political process. A second point I want to make is that little to participate in the entirety of the democratic people still feel very locked out from that people to vote but also encouraging people to process. It was with some enthusiasm that my office in the land claim which is being pursued by an appointment to see me at my office in Aboriginal people in our community feel confident and, I hope, feel that they get some service from me. I am very pleased indeed to see that that usually marginalised from the political process-had courage to go and see a local member of parliament of parliament are seen as people who will not in their community. It is a shame that that has that that group of people has had the confidence-and see me to discuss the issue of their land claim. There tends to be a lot of talk about empowerment, to allow that talk to just be the shrill banter time. I notice, with some concern again, that about $67.2 million, has been cut. I think this MAIN COMMITTEE 10445 which relate to the democratic provisions of the there are a few important points which need of participation by Aboriginal and Torres Strait a small number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Commission rolls. When members here go through most people do; they visit the various polling ask them to consider how many Aboriginal people of their constituencies.

Often local members be supportive of the cause of Aboriginal people been the case for a long time. I am very pleased the confidence in me-to come and but I think we need to be careful not which politicians can go on with from time to the Community Training Program, which is worth has undermined the efforts of people on both NA 10446 sides of parliament who are committed to genuine to encourage more Aboriginal people I think it is worth reflecting on what In the ATSIC Annual Report 1996-97, To improve decision making and service provision aims to increase skill levels I think most people in this place would agree describing community training, the document lists · provides assistance to selected individuals to education courses. It continues: The component had three elements: community training funded · Inwork, funded through ATSIC · Full-time Professional Study Grants, funded So it is a shame that this Community Training Commonwealth funding and will now be unable it is worth noting as well that cuts to ATSIC, occurred and have undermined Whilst Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander place in October this year, we need to consider Aboriginal people to participate more fully in that existed previously to encourage more Aboriginal can remember that the Aboriginal organisation up around the place encouraging Aboriginal posters up all around the organisation, and say, 'Here we have an Aboriginal organisation'-these us encouragement to get involved in the political some Australian Electoral Commission enrolment encouraged to get involved and to have their election process at both state and federal levels.

This can only of Aboriginal people who have traditionally are not forgotten. I think it also encourages more understanding process oflocalland councils, for example, and are often charged with the responsibility of It is worth noting that in the past a organisations delivering services to Aboriginal lines.

In a few dot points, one of which is as follows: enable them to undertake specific accredited training or through ATSIC Regional Councils; State and Regional Offices; and through ATSIC Central Office as a national program.

As a result of that and of having forms around the place, people were certainly say in ATSIC elections and also in the general advantages of having more Aboriginal and Torres democratic process are huge.

We catmot just set up of it saying simply, 'We gave the funding Unfortunately they did not run it correctly blame.' That sort of approach is clearly unacceptable. We should use the opportunities we have through Islander Commission to try to encourage people within the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander of individuals in the Aboriginal community in and local Aboriginal land councils and in electing Strait Islander regional councils. I think we have a great responsibility. If at empowering some of those organisations encourage and support them in delivering they are a part. For example, in my own electorate done by the Koori unit at the Central Gippsland working people deliver programs in adult programs such as computer literacy and Aboriginal to access mainstream programs. We need to talk, through ATSIC, about Gippsland Institute of TAFE, or other organisations, training or community leadership training to for leadership in communities. Members of regularly that there is a need for community regions may seek the opportunities which realities of globalisation and how regions Australia but regions in other parts of the world. which will allow Aboriginal people in regional communities to take advantage of the opportunities practices for communities-not the type empowering practices. We need to look seriously services to Aboriginal people and encourage Gippsland Institute of T AFE to be a participant. An important point is that the govenunent inaction in this area.

Visas: Indonesian Visitors (Question No. 855) Ms Jann MCFarlane asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 23 August 1999: (1) How many applications for visitor's visas were received from Indonesian citizens in (a) 199798 and (b) 1998-99. (2) How many applications for visitor's visas have been received by Indonesian citizens in 19992000, as at 23 August 1999. (3) How many applications for visitor's visas by Indonesian citizens referred to in parts (1) and (2) were rejected in each year. (4) Are Indonesian citizens considered high risk for overstay of visitor's visas; if so, why. (5) Are other policies to limit visitor's visas to Indonesian citizens being implemented by his Department; if so, what are the policies. Mr Ruddock-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) There were: (a) 93,545 applications for visitor visas from Indonesians in 1997-98 (b) 70,262 applications for visitor visas from Indonesians in 1998-99 These figures include tourist, business and medical visitor visas. (2) There have been 7,698 applications for visitor visas from Indonesians from 1 July 1999 to 23 August 1999. (3) There were: Ratification/Acceptance/Accession/Succession (s) 2 Aug 1977 10 Mar 1975 21 Apr 1981 28 Apr 1988 2 Sep 1983 9 Aug 1977 15 Mar 1996 3 Oct 1972 23 Sep 1974 21 Jun 1985 for Czechoslovakia on 14 February 1997. the German Democratic Republic on 16 January 1974 (a) 12,847 applications for visitor visas by Indonesian citizens refused in 1997-98 (a rejection rate of 13.7%); (b) 12,172 applications for visitor visas by Indonesian citizens refused in 1998-99 (a rejection rate of 17.3%); and (c) 1,555 applications for visitor visas by Indonesian citizens refused between 1 July 1999 and 23 August 1999 (a rejection rate of 20.2%). (4) Indonesian citizens are currently considered high risk for overstay of visitor visas. Until recently, Indonesia had been a high volume, relatively low risk visitor source. However this has changed dramatically since the Asian economic downturn and the ongoing internal political crisis. Since the May 1998 crisis the Jakarta post has had no choice but to adopt a relatively strict approach to visitor visa applications. Visitor visa applications lodged by Indonesians are being subjected to closer scrutiny. This situation is not due to any change in policy or new criteria, but to the fact that a dramatically increased number of applications are not providing sufficient evidence that they intend a genuine visit. As at 30 June 1998, the non-return rate for Indonesian visitors arriving in Australia in 1996-97 was 2.51%. As at 30 June 1999, the non-return rate for Indonesian visitors arriving in 1997-98 had almost doubled to 4.53%, reflecting the change in the integrity of the Indonesian visitor market. The global average is 1.98%. There were over 1,800 Protection Visas lodged by Indonesian nationals during the 1998/99 program year, over double those from any other country-only 1 was granted. (5) There are no policies to limit visitor visas being implemented by my Department. Centenary of Federation Grants: Applications (Question No. 859) Mr Hollis asked the Minister for the Arts and the Centenary of Federation, upon notice, on 23 August 1999: (1) How many applications for Centenary of Federation grants were submitted from the electoral divisions of (a) Macarthur, (b) Gilmore, (c) Cunningham and (d) Throsby. Electoral Division FCHP Applications Macarthur 9 Gilmore 4 Cunningham 5 Throsby 3 Employment of Scientific and Technical Enemy Aliens Scheme (Question No. 867)  tion and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 24 August 1999 (1) Was the Chifley Government involved in bringing suspected war criminals and Nazi party members to Australia as part of the Employment of Scientific and Technical Enemy Aliens scheme (ESTEA) between 1946 and 1951. (2) Were the backgrounds of prospective scientists covered up and were the objections of the Commonwealth Investigation Service and normal security clearances ignored. (3) Did the former deputy head of the Attorney General's Department, Mr Andrew Menzies, give the ESTEA a clean bill of health in his 1986 government report; if so, is the Minister able to say whether Mr Menzies was misled and that his 1986 assertions that proper procedures were followed is incorrect. (4) Will the Government reopen the Special Investigations Unit and launch a full investigation into these allegations. Mr Ruddock-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Chifley Government facilitated the entry to Australia of many displaced persons to Australia, including from Germany, following World War II. Some of these people entered Australia as part of the Employment of Scientific and Technical Enemy Aliens scheme (ESTEA) between 1946 and 1951. (2) How many applications for Centenary of Federation Grants submitted from the electoral divisions of (a) Macarthur, (b) Gilmore, (c) Cunningham and (d) Throsby were successful. Mr MCGauran-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I provide the following information on applications made under the Federation Cultural and Heritage Projects Program (FCHP): Successful Applications 1 Wivenhoe Villa Conservation 1 Lady Denman Ferry Conserva tion o o (2) As indicated in the Menzies Review, ""these people were subjected to a preliminary screening in Germany and were engaged only where a favourable security report was given. Further, they were on probation for nine months after their arrival in Australia. After this time, provided that there was no security objection, approval could be given for the admission of their wives and families. All documents examined by the Review indicated that normal security clearances were obtained and that the scientists were rejected if they were considered unacceptable due to their association with the Nazi Party"". (3) Responsibility for the Menzies ""Review of material relating to the entry of suspected war criminals into Australia"" rests with the Attorney General's Department. (4) The Special Investigations Unit was set up by the Attorney-General's Department to investigate allegations of war crimes and questions related to the Special Investigations Unit are a matter for the Attorney General. Immigration (Non-Humanitarian) Program: Categories (Question No. 870) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 24 August 1999: (1) What classes of state-specific migration categories applied to the 1998-99 Immigration (Non-Humanitarian) Program. (2) In each category referred to in part (1), (a) how many persons went to each State and Territory and (b) was a quota available to States and Territories. Mr Ruddock-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The following State-specific migration mechanisms were available as part of the 1998-99 Migration (non-Humanitarian) Program: Regional Sponsored Migration Scheme (RSMS) which allows for employers in areas covered by gazetted certifying bodies to nominate skilled migrants for entry to fill positions which cannot be filled from the local labour market; StateiTerritory Nominated Independent (SIN!) category which allows State or Territory Governments to nominate for entry skilled migrants who have skills in demand in particular jurisdictions; Regional Linked category which makes it easier for persons residing in designated areas to sponsor their relatives for entry subject their meeting threshold requirements relating to skill, age and English language Skilled-Australian Linked (SAL) category a high volume points tested category which contained a provision (up until 30 June 1999) whereby applicants whose sponsors live in designated areas of Australia accrued 5 bonus points. On 1 July 1999 those bonus points were abolished (applicants who would have benefited from bonus points under the pre-July regime will be picked up under the new Regional Sponsored category); State sponsored Business Skills category in which there are four subclasses which allow for State and Territory sponsorship of business owners and ofsenior executives (two offshore and two onshore). Regional Established Business in Australia (REBA) category which applies to business people who have entered Australia on long term temporary business visas and have established viable business ventures in designated areas of Australia. The category, established in July 1997, provides an avenue for them to obtain permanent residence subject to State/Territory sponsorship and their meeting a range of threshold criteria-the criteria applied under REBA are set at a lower level than those which apply to applicants under the Established Business in Australia (EBA) category. As applicants in this category must have a business operating in Australia for a period of two years before they can apply, the volume of applications is still small and no applications have been finalised. Both the RSMS and STNI are supported by the Skills Matching Database (SMD). The SMD has been in place since November 1996 and contains occupational data regarding offshore Independent category migration applicants who have already had their skills and English language assessed. The to SMD can be used by State/Territory Governments or by employers to select and nominate applicants proficiency; with particular skills. (2) (a) The table below shows the State or Territory of intended residence for those applicants granted visas under the categories listed in (1) above. (b) No quotas were applied to these categories in 1998-99. Powers exist under the Migration Act 1958 and the Migration Regulations which allow for limits to be placed on the number of visa grants or nominations under specific visa subclasses in a given financial year. These powers were not exercised in 1998-99 in relation to the Statespecific migration categories and are unlikely to be used in 1999-2000 given the Government's commitment to promoting these mechanisms and to improving the dispersal of skilled migrants throughout Australia.

Mr MCGauran-The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: Telstra, in its role as the emergency call person (ECP) under the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999, already coordinates national emergency service organisations through its administration of the 000 emergency service. However, the honourable member's question could relate to either or both of two discrete matters: the Australian Secure Network (ASNET), or the arrangements pertaining to the 000 emergency service.

In relation to 000 arrangements, the Government considers that the provision of effective and reliable 000 call service is vitally important. This was recognised in the drafting of the Telecommunications Act 1997. Part 12 of the Telecommunications Act 1997 provided a comprehensive statutory framework for the provision of the 000 service. This is now been replicated in Part 8 of the new Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999 (the Act), Within this framework, the Australian Communications Authority (ACA) is responsible for ensuring that the 000 emergency service is effective and reliable. The ACA is required to designate a person to be the emergency call person (ECP) and determine arrangements for the provision of emergency call services. Amongst other matters, in determining emergency call arrangements the ACA must have regard to the objectives that - as far as practicable, a common system is used to transfer calls made to an emergency service number to an emergency service organisation; - from the perspective of an ordinary end-user of a standard telephone service, there appears to be a single national emergency call system; and - the objective that reasonable community expectations for the handling of calls to emergency service numbers are met. Telstra is the ECP and service requirements are in place under the Telecommunications (Emergency Call Services) Determination 1997. As the ECP, Telstra's role is essentially to answer and transfer calls to emergency services organisations as appropriate. Telstra works closely with emergency service organisations in performing this role. Once the call is transferred the emergency services organisation deals with the 000 caller directly. Emergency services and their communications systems are the responsibility of each State. I understand emergency services already have their own established communications systems.",159
