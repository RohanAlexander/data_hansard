3,Mr HAWKE,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"As a matter of courtesy, I inform the House that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Dawkins, will be absent from Question Time today. Questions which would normally be addressed to Mr Dawkins should be directed to the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services, Mr Baldwin. NA NA",9
4,Dr HEWSON,INTEREST RATES,My question is directed to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the Treasurer's statement this morning that the decision to lower interest rates was taken at the Reserve Bank's board meeting on 2 October. Will the Prime Minister inform the House and the Australian people why the Government waited until today to announce and implement that decision?,9
5,Mr HAWKE,INTEREST RATES,Because it was regarded by those resp'onsible as the appropriate time at which to make the decision. NA,9
6,Dr CHARLESWORTH,INTEREST RATES,I refer the Treasurer to the statement by the Governor of the Reserve Bank earlier today on monetary policy and the Treasurer's earlier comments about the level of bank interest rates. What impact will today's statement have on interest rates and what are the Government's intentions?,9
7,Mr KEATING,INTEREST RATES,"Today the Government and the Reserve Bank announced that the Reserve Bank would be operating in the market to reduce cash rates by one percentage point, bringing the decline in the official overnight and cash and call rates to five percentage points from the peak of 18 per cent in January of this year. This will leave cash rates broadly in the market at around 13 per cent, which in terms of the cash rate will establish a flat yield curve for the first time in a couple of years. I hope that that decline will be seen passed through to lending rates by banks rather speedily. Already the ANZ Banking Group Ltd has announced that it has reduced its reference rate from 17 per cent to 16 per cent effective from 22 October. I expect the other banks basically to follow suit. We had a similar expression of opinion from the National Australia Bank Ltd this morning. The Government has decided to see rates come down because the economy is slowing and there is no point in having interest rates higher than we need them to be. The only point there could be would be to slow the economy even further for longer. That is why the Government sought in the first place to lift rates-to slow down spending, which was running at twice the productive capacity of the economy in the year up to the end of 1989. That is, we had spending running at twice product growth and the balance of that spending was being settled in terms of goods by imports. Some honourable members will remember both the Prime Minister and I commenting in the last couple of days of the election campaign upon the fact that we had production and demand back in balance. We now have demand spending running below production in the economy. Hence, we are now producing net exports instead of net imports. This is the very essence and point of the policy. In seeing rates decline now, the Government is permitting that to happen, so there is not a scorched earth policy in place. I contrast that with the stated policy of the Opposition in the last election campaign to keep monetary conditions steady-'steady' meaning that they are not diminished as a slowing occurs; 'steady' meaning that one would keep rates up to bear down on inflation and activity. As I have said in this House on previous occasions, the Government has been seeking to reduce the current account deficit to see a change from a higher level of actiyity to a lower level of activity being accommodated as sympathetically as possible and not by a catastrophic shift either left of the markets or by the application of too savage a monetary policy. I note that the Leader of the Opposition is on record as saying yesterday that the only way we could see a reduction in interest rates is by a further big cut in fiscal policy. In other words, if he were standing in my position today, he would accommodate this extra one per cent by a further cut in payments to the poor, the disadvantaged and everyone else who lives off the transfers system of the Commonwealth. That is fine, if that is his policy; at least he is owning up to it. Everyone should understand what it is-a policy of belting the ordinary people and the weak people to be able to reduce interest rates. We do not think that is necessary. Fiscal policy is tight enough and the change we are getting in monetary policy is entirely appropriate in the circumstances which now present themselves. NA",9
8,Mr HOWARD,INTEREST RATES,"My question, which is addressed to the Prime Minister, plementary to that asked by the Leader of the Opposition. Am I right to assume that shortly after the Reserve Bank Board on 2 October, the Treasurer informed Prime Minister of its decision regarding interest rates? If so, will he explain to the House why he and the Treasurer deliberportunity-ately played political games on the interest rate issue by the totally confusing signals he transmitted on the subject last week? Or is it more important in his book to trick people than to come clean with the true position?",10
9,Mr HAWKE,INTEREST RATES,That one really has got proposed us trembling. It is the case that the Treas Mr urer and I exchange information and views rectly in 1985. on the course of the economy just about every day of the year. We did have discussions following the meeting of the Reserve Bank. It is certainly not my intention to convey to the honourable gentleman who asked thi- question the nature of the discussion I had with the Prime Minister.,10
10,Unknown,INTEREST RATES,Opposition members interjecting-,10
11,Mr HAWKE,INTEREST RATES,"My God, I left out the Deputy! In regard to discussions I had with the Deputy Prime Minister, all I can say is that on this occasion, as on all others, our concern was a single and united one, and that was to ensure that what was best for the economy should be done, and done at the most appropriate time. NA",10
12,Mr DUBOIS,CONSUMPTION TAX,I refer the Treasurer to claims in recent days that the Government and others in this place <:tre at one on the issue of introducing a broad-based c;onsumption tax. C-n the Treasurer clarify this matter and indicate the Government's intention in this regard?,10
13,Mr KEATING,CONSUMPTION TAX,"I did speak on this matter last week and in so doing put to the Leader of the Opposition a number of very important questions regarding the possible implementation of a goods and services tax. What we have had, however, is a re-release by the shadow Treasurer of a press statement suggesting hypocrisy on my part on the issue of compensation.",10
14,Mr HOWARD,CONSUMPTION TAX,You are absolutely a hypis supocrite on this matter.,10
15,Mr KEATING,CONSUMPTION TAX,The honourable member for Bennelong is absolutely wrong. met Even he should understand it; I expect the the other honourable gentleman not to.,10
16,Mr HOWARD,CONSUMPTION TAX,You have had every op,10
17,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,CONSUMPTION TAX,Order! The honourable member for Bennelong!,10
18,Mr KEATING,CONSUMPTION TAX,"This statement is headed, 'Keating hypocrisy on the GST'. It states: The fact is that the goods and services tax as by the coalition is virtually the same as Keating advocated so strongly and so corThis is a copy of a release he issued earlier which stated: Re-released on 11 October to be re-issued every time Mr Keating comes up with the same hypocritical claptrap. At the time of his making that statement on the last occasion, the Australian Financial Review said: Reith still struggling with the basics. It went on: He looked like the weak link in a stronger Opposition front bench team . . . his performance to date has done nothing to alter this assessment. To be blunt, he is showing all the signs of not being up to the job. Then it went on to say-and this is the part that really matters: Mr Reith fell for one of the oldest traps for young economists, confusing compensation for the impact on the stock of existing savings with compensation for effects on the flow of future He also failed to grasp the basic economics of why future savings must be compensated to avoid the perverse effect of the consumption tax actually reducing the level of savings in the economy. : . . Mr Reith then seriously compounded the error by stating categorically that income tax cuts - designed to offset the new tax should not compensate for the effect on savings. . .. . Mr Reith presented a political gift to the Government by advocating a compensation package which would allow real disposable incomes, the purchasing power of future savings and the real level of savings in the economy to fall. By issuing the same press statement, the honourable member for Flinders has done it again. The writer of that piece, Mr Burrell, says that the shadow Treasurer misread the White Paper. He did misread the White Paper. If the honourable member just listens for second I will explain it to him. On page 10 of the White Paper there is a table called 'Net gains-excess of income tax cuts over compensation in tax paid'. That refers to tax cuts which are paid for the maintenance of disposable income-in other words, not just tax cuts paid for that part of disposable income which is spent but tax cuts paid for that part of disposable income which is saved for future consumption. That is what the table refers to. Then on page 150 the White Paper says: A possible concern is that compensation . . . would not fully compensate those persons who consume more than their after-tax income over the period dating from the increase in consumption taxation, ie those individuals who propose financing consumption by running down their assets and/or increasing their debt levels. In other words, a possible concern is compensation for people who are using more of their existing income-that is, spending some of their savings. The White Paper goes on to say: Overall there may be a modest fall in the real value of private wealth holdings defined to include financial and real assets. In other words, we were not about compensating for past savings. If people spent more than their income they would be compensated for their income but not more than their income; in other words, they would not be compensated for runsavings. ning down their savings. But they would be compensated for future savings. That is what the table on page lOis about. Those opposite do not understand that simple point: the difference between the stock of savings in the tank and the stream of savings for the future. Mr Burrell said",10
19,Unknown,CONSUMPTION TAX,Opposition members interjecting-,11
20,Mr KEATING,CONSUMPTION TAX,"He caught you redhanded. Mr Burrell said: . . . confusing compensation for the impact on the stock of existing savings with compensation for effects on the flow . . . It is the tank versus the stream. Those opposite are talking about putting a consumption tax on the people of Australia. The architect of this proposal does not even understand the difference between past savings, the maintenance of disposable income in relation to spending and the maintenance of disposable income in relation to future spending from new savings. He does not even understand the conceptual point yet he is about to propose a radical alteration to the taxation policies of the Commonwealth. He is about to propose a massive change to the tax treatment of Australians. He has not answered any of the questions I put to him the other day and he does not even understand the basic point between compensation for past savings and compensation for future savings. What is worse, the honourable member's error is compounded by the honourable member for Bennelong. Normally when I raise a matter like this, I expect him to understand when the honourable member for Flinders has erred and to shut up. But his rabbiting away here earlier shows that he does not understand either, which comes as no basic surprise to me because this is just par for the course with his general track record as Treasurer. But the honourable member for Flinders is the guy who is. saying that we should have a consumption tax. For him to put out a statement like this after his error has been picked up and explained to him by a member of the press gallery and then to find he has put it out again not knowing the difference between what is on page 10 and what is on page 150 means he is wandering around like an accident going somewhere to happen, proposing a new tax base for the Commonwealth. Is it any wonder that he does not understand that the consumption tax would diminish the surplus? He has in his mind an inadequate compensation package. He does not intend to compensate people for income saved and spent in the future. That is why he is running around saying that he can make the numbers add up; he just does not understand the concept. The old professor here-the Leader of the Opposition-who claims to have such capital invested in the consumption tax, and the honourable member for Bennelong, who said, 'I have been advocating it for years', do not even under- ing? stand the difference between past and future savings. And if they do not understand the difference between past and future savings, how in the hell can anybody trust them with the place? So what they ought to do now in decency is answer the questions I put to them last week.",11
21,Dr HEWSON,CONSUMPTION TAX,You tried that last week.,12
22,Mr KEATING,CONSUMPTION TAX,"I am not trying to set the honourable member's policy. He is the one who has decided on one of these. He should tell us. He is the one who has decided on a consumption tax. He should tell us because let me tell him this: the honourable member can guffaw all he likes; he might think the difference between past savings, future savings and compensation is esoteric. But the honourable member need not worry. I will be belting him over the head with it every day it suits me until the next poll. NA",12
23,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,INTEREST RATES,I call the honourable member for Flinders.,12
24,Mr REITH,INTEREST RATES,No wonder Dr Tait described the Treasurer's argument as laughable.,12
25,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,INTEREST RATES,Order! The honourable member for Flinders will get to his question. .,12
26,Mr REITH,INTEREST RATES,"I ask the Prime Minister: does today's reduction in interest rates mean that the Leader of the Opposition in New South Wales, Bob Carr, was correct to say last week that the Australian economy is in recession?",12
27,Mr HAWKE,INTEREST RATES,"I thought that this question had been clearly and unequivocally answered last week in terms of simple statistics, comparing the present situation with that recession which the coalition inflicted on this country in 1982-83. But as honourable members seem not to have understood the simple statistics and, as my friend the Treasurer says, it is fairly difficult to get facts into their thick skulls, I will give them some more statistics so that they might just listen to the facts, listen to the statistics, stop their heehawing and try to comprehend the facts. Mr Downer-Is Peter Duncan listen",12
28,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,INTEREST RATES,Order! The honourable member for Mayo.,12
29,Mr HAWKE,INTEREST RATES,"Let me go back to 198283 to find the truth. The fact is that what these people were saying is just a load of nonsense. In 1982-83 gross domestic product fell by 2 per cent over four consecutive quarters. Today we have yet to see two consecutive negative quarters recorded. In the 1982-83 recession, employment fell by 2.6 per cent over five consecutive quarters. Today, quarterly employment growth remains positive. I wonder whether those opposite can just get that into their skulls. In the 198283 period employment fell over five consecutive quarters. Today employment growth is still positive. In 1982-83, private business investment fell by 20 per cent with the ending of the resources boom. Today, the fall in private investment is forecast to be much less. There are also these other important differences comparing today with 198283. The wages explosion in 1981-82 was a major cause of the 1982-83 recession. But as everybody knows, as compared with that massive explosion-some 17 per cent explosion in wages in that periodwe have a position today where wages growth is moderate, and controlled wages growth will continue to be delivered under the accord. Let us compare this fact: in 1982-83, the 90-day bank bill rate peaked at 22 per cent. This time the peak was a little over 18 per cent and rates, as we now know, have since eased by some five percentage points. In 1982-83, the public sector borrowing requirement was 5.7 per cent of gross domestic product; this time it is zero. So the public sector is making no call on private savings. Mr Acting Speaker, when you look at the facts-and they are not just produced out of the hip pocket of the Treasurer or the Prime Minister; these are the official statistics-by any relevant comparison that is made, we can see that the statement made by the Leader of the Opposition on this matter is as unbased in fact as the rather absurd observations that he makes in the area of international affairs. When we hear the Leader of the Opposition now making these unfounded statements contradicted by the facts, it is little wonder, as I said before, that his own political colleague properly described him back in 1982-83 as a meretricious player. He was a meretricious player on the economic stage in 1982; he is equally meretricious in 1990. NA",12
30,Mr SCIACCA,SPECIAL PREMIERS CONFERENCE,Will the Prime Minister inform the House of the prospects for the Special Premiers Conference to be held at the end of this month?,13
31,Mr HAWKE,SPECIAL PREMIERS CONFERENCE,"I thank the honourable member for his question, which goes to a matter of very high priority as far as the Government is concerned and particularly so far as I am concerned. The Special Premiers Conference, which will be held at the end of this month, will be the first major step in implementing the initiative which I announced on 19 July for reform of intergovernmental relations in our country. As I said then, my goal is to forge a closer partnership between the Commonwealth, States, Territories and local government to put this country into a better governance shape as it goes into the twenty-first century. Obviously we have to improve on the workings of this Federation, which is now nearly 100 years old, and we are determined to do precisely that. In the lead-up to the Special Premiers Conference, Cabinet is focusing intensively on issues concerned with Federal-State relations. A steering committee, comprising the head of my Department and the heads of Premiers and Chief Ministers departments, is coordinating arrangements for the conference. A large number of relevant papers are being produced covering a wide range of issues in Federal-State relations, and those papers will provide a very useful information base for the conferenceLast week I spoke by phone to each of the State Premiers and we exchanged views on the priority areas to be taken up in Brisbane. There was no doubt that there was a clear recognition amongst each of them of the need to improve the conduct of Federal-State relations, and I am very pleased to say that I detected a determination to approach that task in a cooperative and creative spirit. In that speech in july to which I have referred, I identified several areas for attention. They were: Commonwealth-State financial relations; secondly,improving the arrangements for the delivery of services in pursuit of social justice objectives; thirdly, micro-economic reform, including increasing harmonisation of regulation; fourthly, industrial relations; and, fifthly, protection of the environment. I expect that the agenda for the conference will permit a thorough and business like discussion of each of those subjects. It has to be recognised, of course, that all these involve complex and difficult issues, and it is not realistic to think in terms of revolutionising intergovernmental relations at one conference. That is why in July I spoke of the need for a commitment to an ongoing process. Nonetheless, let me say in conclusion that I do expect useful and tangible progress to be made at the Brisbane meeting at the· end of this month, and I do expect it to give impetus to the fundamental appeal which I made in July-namely, for new processes to be pursued between the various levels of government in this country and a new spirit of partnership which will be calculated, as I say, to put this country in the best possible shape as we prepare ourselves for the second 100 years of Federation. NA",13
32,Dr HEWSON,SOUTH AFRICA,"My question is again directed to the Prime Minister. In the light of his reference in an. earlier answer this afternoon to what he called my absurd statements on international affairs, I ask the Prime Minister whether he shares the view expressed by President Bush during President de Klerk's recent official visit to Washington that the process of reform in South Africa is irreversible. Does he agree that the recent European Community summit in Dublin revealed a view on the sanctions issue among a number of important European countries that is quite different from that of the Australian Government?",14
33,Mr HAWKE,SOUTH AFRICA,I welcome this intervention by - he Prime Minister in this area once agam. Dr Hewson interjecting,14
34,Mr HAWKE,SOUTH AFRICA,The Leader of the Opposition may - s well get excited because the only way he will get it is by a slip of my tongue. Mr MCGauran-Why are you so anxious to get rid of him? It's on your mind.,14
35,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,SOUTH AFRICA,Order! The honourable member for Gippsland!,14
36,Mr HAWKE,SOUTH AFRICA,"One would have thought that the Leader of the Opposition, after the facts had been paraded before him by me last week, would have dodged this issue like the plague. Let us take the United States first. The United States will not be lifting the sanctions prematurely. The Leader of the Opposition referred to President Bush. The fact is that the United States has in place sanctions in regard to South Africa and it will not be lifting them prematurely. So I do not know what the Leader of the Opposition is talking about in regard to the United States. In regard to Europe, I do not know what he is talking about there because the fact is that when this matter was recently before the United Nations, unanimously-and I presume the Opposition knows what that word means-the United Nations passed a resolution which indicated that sanctions would not be lifted prematurely. So there we have the position of the United States, the unanimous position of the United. Nations, and, as I said before, the position where Mr Mandela has publicly said that he owes his release and the current situation to the fact of sanctions. That is the attitude of Nelson Mandela. We have the fact that not only the President of South Africa but also the head of the Central Bank there have publicly acknowledged that it is the fact and pressure of sanctions which have brought South Africa to the bargaining table. That is the factual situation which has arisen from the fact that this Government was at the leading edge internationally of the imposition of that regime of sanctions around the world. We were at the leading edge of it and have so been acknowledged. At every point when we were taking the lead-within this country, within the Commonwealth, within the United Nations, in bilateral negotiations with the United States and with Europe-at every point where this Australian Government was at the leading edge of imposing sanctions, the Opposition and its ilk on every occasion said we were wrong. History has proved us right and history has proved the Opposition wrong. Those are the indisputable facts. As said, I have written to the President of South Africa congratulating him on the role he has taken. Because this Governfunds? ment has been at the forefront of this issue, we have a deep and abiding conlians cern. As has been said, we were not about trying to bring South Africa to its knees, ter? we were about trying to bring South Africa to the negotiating table. Those processes have started. It would indeed be churlish not to recognise the significance of the progress that has been made. Having been in the situation where have been assisted by the front line states and by those around Nelson Mandela in coming to the right consideration, assisted by them in coming to the right decision, assisted by them in coming to the right action, it is very unlikely that at this point we are going to be influenced· in our thinking not by Mandela and these people but by the Opposition. Opposition members have been wrong all the way through. Now, because they think it is time to reconsider sanctions, those who have ways been wrong say that they are the ones we should listen to rather than Manraised dela. I have news for the Opposition. It has been wrong all the way through and if it is saying now we should precipitately lift sanctions it is wrong again. But what I do say is that we within the Commonwealth and in our discussions with other nations will be moving to a position to cooperate with others, lift those sanctions as quickly as it is possible to do so, because recognise that it is going to be in the interests of a future, non-racial, democent cratic South Africa that it be returned the in.ternational community of nationspolitically, economically-as soon as that is possible. But I repeat: in our thinking as to when the appropriate time for that is, we will not be guided by the OpposiAs tion which has been consistently wrong but by those who, with us, have been consistently correct. INVESTMENTS. IN NA",14
37,Mrs CROSIO,SUPERANNUATION FUNDS,I direct my question to the Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer I of this country. Is he aware of any recent information regarding the level of investments held in Australian superannuation What implications does this information have for the income of Austraretiring in future years? What are the Government's intentions in this mat,15
38,Mr TUCKEY,SUPERANNUATION FUNDS,"Mr Acting Speaker, I raise a point of order. The section in the Standing Orders relating to questions without notice says that a question should not ask a Minister for an expression of opinion we to announce government policy. This is the third occasion today that the Government's intentions have been requested by a questioner from the Government side of the benches. I believe that is asking for policy and the question is out of order.",15
39,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,SUPERANNUATION FUNDS,"-,--There is no point of order . .The question is in order.",15
40,Mr KEATING,SUPERANNUATION FUNDS,"For the first time, the Australian Bureau of Statistics today released a new quarterly survey of the assets alof superannuation funds and approved deposit funds (ADF). This is a matter I with the industry about a year or so ago in a speech to the Life Insurance Federation of Australia and I have raised it since with the Statistician, obviously, and today is the first product of those discussions. What they show is that between the March quarter 1989 and the March quarter 1990 the assets of superannuation funds and approved deposit funds totalled $109.7 billion, a growth of we over $19 billion or 21 per cent on the figure of 12 months ago. That is a 21 per increase in superannuation fund as to sets in a year, or $19 billion. In fact, the annual growth which is referred to in this document is equal to the total stock of superannuation assets which existed when I became Treasurer in 1983. at March 1990 assets in ADFs which were created by this Government were $7 billion, indicating total rollover business of some $17 billion, a growth of 25 per cent on the figure of 12 months previously. In other words, that means that people are rolling their funds and though some people may choose to take out their funds at age 55, plenty are rolling them over, which is evident here. Superannuation assets of $26.6 billion are invested shares in Australian companies, a growth of nearly $ 5 billion or 22 per cent over the past 12 months, so there has. been a 22 per cent increase in the investment by the superannuation funds in Australian stocks over the past year, which, of course, is a remarkable achievement. All of this goes to show that superannuation is now going to be a substantial part of the savings and assets picture of the nation, which it was not back in 1983. In 1983, superannuation was simply a tax lurk for private company executives and some public servants. It was not available to the rest of the community generally. The coalition did nothing with it for decades and now we are seeing superannuation fund-growing playing its proper role in providing a retirement income for people, which we know will be important, particularly as the postwar so-called baby boom retires about the year 2010; we will see a huge change in the demographic profile of the country and a huge call upon the public purse. We will have in place by forethought and some careful planning a retirement incomes policy which will provide for those people in retirement to top up their basic pensions and in so doing provide a stock of savings for the nation which has arisen in part not just from the Government's tax changes and reform in tax treatment superannuation but because of occupational award superannuation negotiated with the trade unions under the accord. It is another reason why this Government has put in place policies which really matter in relation to savings. We have $19 billion a year going in there, equal to the stock of savings which existed at the time, compared with the puny savings point which arises from a consumption tax, and particularly one which does not compensate people for future savingsthe point that I was making to the shadow Treasurer a few minutes ago. This sits in stark contrast to the sort of tripe he traffics in. NA",15
41,Mr TIM FISCHER,FUEL STRIKE,"Following the Prime Minister's consultations with the in Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) over the weekend and the emergency industrial hearing, will the Prime Minister state the exact Federal Government position in relation to the fuel strike? Will he apply the same attitude to the fuel workers who have been ordered back to work as he did at certain stages last year to the pilots?",16
42,Mr HAWKE,FUEL STRIKE,"Is there no end to their irrelevance? This is a remarkable attempt to draw this matter out. It really is pathetic. First, I will deal with the oil industry dispute. The fact is, of course, we in the Government are particularly concerned about the disruption to Australia's oil industry. However, the fact is that the parties are negotiating and they are negotiating within the framework of the conciliation and arbitration system. Even the Leader of the National Party might understand that that immediately distinguishes this dispute from the dispute involving the pilots that he was talking about. Unless he has forgotten, he fell flat on his face on that one. I would have thought he would want to forget the pilots dispute. The fact is, of course, that the pilots said that they did not want to have anything to do· with the conciliation and arbitration system at all. The discussions that have been going on over the weekend have been within that framework. I believe that the oil industry workers should adhere to the Industrial Relations Commission's order to return to work. I have taken the opportunity over the last couple of days to stay in touch with the leadership of the ACTU and to urge itnot that it needed any urging-to do everything it could to get this matter properly and honourably resolved. On the basis of the conversation which I had as recently as last night with the Secretary of the ACTU, I have reason for confidence that there is a good chance that that will be achieved. We certainly hope so, because it is our view that we have evidence in this country that it is much better to try to operate cooperatively and. constructively in the field of industrial relations rather than by the process of confrontation. Of course, the record that has been achieved under this Government in the last 7lh years shows just how tremendously improved this situation has been because the parties, and particularly the trade union movement, have accepted that advice. I remind the House of a few comparisons. Under the Government which preceded us, in the 12 months to June 1982 there were 3.83 million working days lost. That compares with 1.17 million days lost in the last 12 months to June of this year or 1.28 million in the 12 months to the previous June. There you have it: 3.83 million in the 12 months to June 1982 compared with 1.17 million and 1.28 million. In the final three months in office the Government before us, there were 750,400 working days lost-which was 2If2 times greater than the 292,500 working days lost under this Government in the three months to June 1990. In terms of the monthly average working days lost per thousand employees, my Government's average of 19.5 days is over two times less than the previous Government's average of 48.6 days. We do not want these people from the other side getting up and lecturing us about industrial disputes. They were there; they made a monstrous mess of it. The situation under this Government has been a very significant improvement. The honourable member mentioned the pilots dispute. We had to take a tough line there because that group of people said to the country and to the arbitration system, 'We want a 30 per cent increase in wages and all the rest of you in the country can get nicked. The arbitration system can get nicked; our employers can get nicked and the Government can get nicked. We are going to have 30 per cent'. Basically, in the whole of that disreputable dispute the pilots had only one source of comfort in dispute, and that was the honourable member opposite. I would have thought that he would be so thoroughly ashamed of his miserable track record generally, and in that dispute in particular, that he would never want to mention it again. NA NA",16
43,Mr FREE,TRIBUNAL,"My question is to the Minister for Transport and Communications and I ask whether he is aware of press comments suggesting that the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal is to be abolished. If he is, can he explain to the House what the Government's position is on this matter?",17
44,Mr BEAZLEY,TRIBUNAL,"I thank the honourable gentleman for his question. As far back as July this year I indicated that there would continue to be an independent regulatory authority in the broadcasting system. Broadcasting regulation will continue to require an independent staof tutory body to carry out necessary regulatory functions. If the Government does restructure the regulatory authority, it would be sensible to base this on the established Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, modified to reflect any changed role and functions. While the departmental review team has examined the scope for increased self-regulation, there is no question of the Government's avoiding its responsibilities to safeguard the public interest in broadcasting. The Government has yet to consider whether to permit any self-regulation and in which areas it will retain mandatory standards. So there will continue to be an organisation effectively based on the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal no matter what decisions are ultimately arrived at by Government. We are now starting on a prpcess of extensive consultation with the industry, with all people concerned and interested in these matters. I do not anticipate that we will reach any legislative conclusion on this matter until the Budget session next year, so honourable members can see that, on a timetable like that, there will be plenty of opportunity for people to have a say on those issues that concern them. Of course, in the meantime we will back to the hilt the capacity of the Broadcasting Tribunal to do the job that it needs to do in terms of enforcing the legislation as it now exists and the principles of that legislation. We also reserve for ourselves the right to alter that legislation from time to time as appears to be necessary because of exigencies that arise. There are a number of Bills before the Parliament at this moment that do exactly that. Nobody can anticipate being able to evade the consequeJ?-ces of the law as it now stands by hopmg that at some point in time the Broa.dcasting Tribunal might disappear. We mtend to keep backing it to ensure that it does the job that statutorily it is required to do. NA",17
45,Mr ANDREW,HANSARD REPORT,"I refer the Prime Minister to his statement in the Parliament last Tuesday, 9 October, when he indicated that no Hansard 'greens' relating to the interdepartmental committee on the Olympic Games were received in his office prior to the printing of Hansard.

As I was about to say, anyone who understands anything a.bout politics. in this country and questIons concernmg me ought to know that just about the most unreliable source that one ever wants to go to concerning an attack upon me is one,Ramsey. So :-ve find on Saturday in the Sydney Mornzng Herald, there he is, at it again. Really, that particular journalist and his diatribes have become a source of amusement to his own peers.

Mr MCGauran-Why doesn'the like you?",18
49,Mr HAWKE,HANSARD REPORT,"There is one pretty well known reason for that, is there not? But let me say that the honourable member opposite is very unwise to rely upon that source. On the question he raised the advice to me from my office is clear: it is unequivocal, and it is this: the adviser in my office responsible for correcting the 'greens' did not receive them on Thursday, 13 September. Can I repeat that? The adviser in my office-the man who receives the 'greens'-advises me clearly and uneqUIvocally that he did not receive them on Thursday, 13 September. Let me say this in respect of who one relies onmy adviser or the person who has written that article on which the honourable member opposite now relies: the honourable member is very, very unwise to rely on that source because, yet again, it is wrong. I suggest to him that in future, if he has any question about this sort of thing, if he has any doubt, if he still wants to peddle this idea that I misled the Houseas honourable members opposite tried to do a week or so ago and they fell collectively flat on their face on that one-and no- the .honourable member opposite is tryI-g mIserably and desperately to do it agam on the basis of that pathetic article by Ramsey in the Sydney Morning Herald. The facts are as I have put them and that is directly and unequivocally from the adviser in my office.

COAL INDUSTRY: GREENHOUSE NA",18
50,Mr MARTIN,GAS EMISSIONS,Can the Minister for - rimary Industries and Energy explain the Impact of the Government's decision to adopt targets for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions on the Australian coal industry?,18
51,Mr KERIN,GAS EMISSIONS,"I have been enjoined to talk about sheep, Mr Acting Speaker. I thank the honourable gentleman for his question. Some people in the coal industry in Australia have expressed concern that the adoption of a target for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by the Commonwealth Government will have serious implications for the coal industry. However, the Australian Coal Association-and the industry generally-says: . . . places a very high priority on the reduction of greenhouse gases generated by coal production and combustion. It goes without saying, of course, that the coal industry has been working on this question for quite some time. The coal industry supports the Government's commitment to set an achievable national target to reduce emissions and, as I have said, it is already taking steps to reduce the level of emissions from that industry by promoting clean coal technology, by undertaking a survey of methane emissions from coal production, by increasing the capture of methane emissions from coal production for use as an additional fuel resource, by participating in the development of technologies to improve the efficiency of coal combustion, and by supporting greater emphasis on energy efficiency and conservation measures. My colleague the Minister for Resources and I negotiated an understanding with the United States, for example, to develop a research relationship looking at a better coal combustion. We have pretty high thermal efficiency in our coal-fired power-stations, but we believe we can achieve even greater efficiency. Similarly, the honourable member for Lalor will be interested to know that I saw an article in the New Scientist recently indicating that the British also believe that there is a big potential gain in this area. Our efforts to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions will clearly provide a major challenge for the coal industry and it is equally clear that coal will continue to be a fundamental source of energy in this country-something like 90 per cent in New South Wales and Queensland, 50 per cent in Western Australia and 40 per cent in South Australia where they are using a lot of gas. The necessity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions provides the Commonwealth, the States, industry and the public with considerable challenges. The Government's stimulus to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will also provide opportunities for business to use our resources more efficiently in refining existing technologies and developing new ones and to explore alternatives and exploit new markets. I believe that there is a lot we can do. As the world's foremost coal exporter, we will certainly be leading the charge and I believe the industry will be working with us. NA",19
52,Mr RIGGALL,SOCIAL SECURITY EXPENDITURE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Finance. I refer the Minister to the comment of the Minister for Social Security, Senator Richardson, on yesterday's Sunday program in which he said: There is no other way to take one dollar off the social security budget. Does the Minister agree with Senator Richardson that social security spending is quarantined from any future Budget cuts?",19
53,Mr WILLIS,SOCIAL SECURITY EXPENDITURE,"I have not seen the full text of Senator Richardson's comments. As far as I am concerned-and as far as the Government as a whole is concerned-no area of government expendi..: ture is sealed off from any future examination for expenditure reductions. Government budgetary policy is likely to remain tight. In that context it will be incumbent upon the Governmen,t to continue to keep a close check on expenditure in all departments. The Department of Social Security is not exempt from that. Having said that, may I also say that we have undertaken in recent years a very stringent approach to expenditures in that portfolio. A great deal has been done to ensure that there is no longer a capacity for fraud in respect of social security expenditures. There has been a general targeting of expenditures to a very substantial degree, gi ving us one of the most highly targeted social security systems of any country in the Western world. Obviously, having done all that, the capacity for further substantial cuts in that area has been greatly reduced. I would not go so far as to say that there is no room for any further reductions. That is a matter for consideration in the next round of Budget considerations. NA",19
54,Mr SCHOLES,CARPET WOOLS,Is the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy able to inform the House of any progress that has been made in correcting the problems I raised in a question earlier relating marketing of carpet wools and the damage that is being done to processors of carpet wools?,20
55,Mr KERIN,CARPET WOOLS,"The Australian Wool Corporation, in the preparation of its business plan, and the Government have been concerned for quite some time. The Corporation made recommendations to the Government with respect to a rebate system. Cabinet took the view that, given the concern that had been signalled, that was okay but it did not address one part of the problem, so we took the decision we did. I am pleased to tell the honourable gentleman, who does take a lot of interest in this issue, given that there are some carpet manufacturers in his electorate, that the Corporation and the Australian Carpet Wool Council today announced the administrative process for this decision. The decision is that wool sold at auction which tests at 32 microns or coarser will not receive reserve price support and will not be levied the reserve price support component of the levy. The background to this issue is that wool sold by private treaty to the three existing carpet wool cooperatives will not attract the reserve price support component of the levy on certification that it was purchased by a carpet yarn maker and used in carpet manufacture. Other private treaty transactions will attract tax at the full rate. Carpet wools make up only about 0.5 per cent of the Australian wool clip. We grow about four million kilograms of this sort of wool. We are not a major producer and therefore we are a price taker, not a price setter, in this area of the market. New Zealand is the price setter for carpet wools. Carpet wools are sold scoured and blended and not in the greasy form common to the rest of the Australian market. The Australian Wool Corporation is not set up to trade in this way, nor should it be for such a small percentage of the clip which is so different. The carpet industry in Australia uses about 19 million kilograms of wool per year. More than 80 per cent of this is imported, mainly from New to the Zealand and the United Kingdom. Australian wools being sold into the carpet industry in Australia must meet the New Zealand price. With the rise in the wool levy to 18 per cent and now to 25 per cent and with the New Zealand price set effectively at 25 per cent below the Australian Wool Corporation's floor price, Australian carpet wools would tend to flow to the stockpile-they have been in recent timesrather than the Australian industry as an important replacement in a value adding export industry. So, far from getting a free ride, the carpet wool growers now face the market directly. They must compete against New Zealand's wool on quality and price. This is the result carpet wool growers have sought. NA",20
56,Mr FIFE,SITTING PROGRAM,"Mr Acting Speaker, with your indulgence, I ask the Leader of the House for some information regarding the sittings of the House. I ask the Leader of the House whether he could give the House some indication as to what the Government has in mind for the remainder of the year. According to the published sitting pattern the House, after this week, will meet only for a further 10 days. Given that in the autumn session the House was asked to deal with 34 Bills in two days, will the Government be able to introduce its legislation in time so that the guillotine will not have to be used this session?",20
57,Mr BEAZLEY,SITTING PROGRAM,"From recollection, I think there is a block of two weeks of sittings after this week and then another week. It seems to be now the case, given the way in which the Senate is considering business, that there is a likelihood that we would probably be called back for a few days immediately adjacent to Christmas. That is what I anticipate will be the sitting time for the rest of this year. It is always subject to review, but I think that will probably be how it turns. out. The question of the guillotine, as always, depends on the expedition with which the House of Representatives considers business. It depends, too, on cutoff dates that the Senate from time to time puts in. The Government takes all those factors into account before it finally determines how it ought to implement closures, if any.",21
58,Mr FIFE,SITTING PROGRAM,"Mr Acting Speaker, with your indulgence, the Leader of the House missed the main point of my question. Will the legislation be introduced in time to enable proper debate? I notice that no Bills are being introduced today.",21

Details of the paper will be recorded in Hansard and the Votes and Proceedings.

ECONOMIC POLICY: INTEREST NA Discussion of Matter of Public Importance",21
61,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,RATES,"I have received a letter from the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The failure of the Government to provide clear signals on the state of our economy and to implement policies to provide sustainable reductions in interest rates. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their places",21
62,Dr HEWSON,RATES,"Today we wish to discuss a matter of public importance which is of considerable interest and importance to all average Australians. It is the failure of the Government to provide clear signals on the state of our economy and to implement policies to provide sustainable reductions in interest rates. As I begin, I draw the attention of the House to the fact that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) are not prepared to stay in this House and take part in this debate. This is indicative of their view of parliamentary standards and of their view of a reasonable degree of accountability to this Parliament as well as to the people of Australia.",21
63,Mr NA BROWN,RATES,Arrogance.,21
64,Dr HEWSON,RATES,"It is, as my colleague said, indicative of the unbounded arrogance with which they play around with the livelihoods of average Australiansthe way that they play around with interest rates, the way they play around with economic management, always designed to achieve what they think is important from the point of view of their short term Forpolitical objectives, always at the expense of what is in the best interests of the average Australian. It is appalling that when we raise a matter of public importance in this waydesigned to encourage the Government to come out and make a major statement, an honest statement, on where our economy is at present and where it is headed in the course of the next 12 to 18 months and designed to challenge the Government to put in place policies that are essential to ensure that any interest rate reductions are sustainable and that the livelihoods of average Australians can tually be improved rather than continrecession ually eroded as they have been in recent days-the Prime Minister and the Treasomy urer duck the issue, leave the Parliament and scurry off to their offices. That is good enough in our economic circumstanfrom ces which, I maintain and repeat, I bening lieve to be the most difficult circumstances in the postwar period. The Opposition welcomes genuine ductions in interest rates. We have said consistently that, as the economy slows down, nominal interest rate levels will fall. We are most concerned to ensure that a set of policies is put in place to guarantee that interest rates go much lower and stay much lower and to create the circumstaneconomy ces in which we in this country can have sustainable non-inflationary growth, tainable employment growth and imond provement in our balance of payments and where our debt can be brought under control. That will not happen under the proach of this Government. It never has happened and it never will happen as long as the Government persists with this sinrate gle policy strategy of basically relying interest rates. Since 1982-83 this Governrio ment has never been able to put in place a set of policies that have done the job. Rather, we, as an economy and as the people of Australia, have been subjected to a boom-bust scenario that is almost unequalled anywhere else in the world. we remember back to 1982-83, the Hawke Government came in promising growthgrowth, promising that it could deliver growth without inflation and actually run a ulatory fiscal policy, an accommodating monetary policy, and get our economy growing like it had never grown. On the back of a turn-around in the world econsort omy in mid-1983 and the ending of the April 1988: drought-which was beyond the GovernThey ment's control, although the Prime Minand ister took credit for it-the Government stimulated both fiscal and monetary polAt icy, and off the economy went. By early 1985 our economy had been blown out of the water. We had a major exchange rate crisis, a major collapse of economic activity in late 1985 and early ac1986 as the economy moved towards a and there was a massive increase in interest rates to pull the econback from that overheated state. But the Government learned nothing not from that experience. It repeated it again 1987 onwards. In early 1987, runup to the elections, for political reasons, the Government eased monetary policy; then, again on top of a major inreternational trend-a boost to our terms of trade from the December quarter of 1986-again the Government overheated the economy; again we went into the boom scenario; and again, as circumstances ran away from it, the Government resorted to high interest rates as a way of pulling the back. The Government has now plunged our economy into the deepest and susmost prolonged recession since the SecWorld War simply because throughout its period of office it has never been prepared to identify or put in place policies designed to deal with the major strucaptural problems in our economy. As long as the Government sticks with this simple-minded adherence to interest policies, this economy is destined to on stay on a boom-bust roller-coaster scenafor the rest of the time. the Australian Labor Party is in government. Yesterday the Prime Minister was trying to raise expectations, pointing to the fact that things are about to get better, that the end is here, the restraint is finished and the If Australian economy can look forward to rising employment opportunities, rising sustainably lower interest rates, lower inflation and all that sort of thing. stimAs I read and heard versions of those statements last night and this morning, I was reminded of a period back in early 1988 when he said pretty much the same of thing. For example, he said in have suffered a decline (in living standards) I salute them . . . The time has come when they have to be rewarded. the same time both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer made a host of other statements along similar lines. For example, the Prime Minister said in March: I think, generally speaking, Australians could to a maintenance at least of their real standards rather than a future decline. In late March of 1988 the Treasurer, his normal, modest style, said: We are winning in giant strides, but we are home. We are just about to move into the straight. In early April of that year he said: . . . The worse of that time is over. What happened beyond early 1988? The Government, quite contrary to all those statements and many others, went ahead and boosted interest rates to record levels and inflicted record hardship on average Australian families and businesses all this country, in total sharp contra-t to impression it had tried to create in March and April of that year, when presumably it was taking those decisions in order raise interest rates. It was still out there publicly presenting the image that of course tl:J.ings were under control, they were going to get better and we were about to move into those wonderful days of suscourse tained increases in growth, living standtiate ards, jobs, lower inflation and so on. The fact is that in the seven years have been in government, honourable youth members opposite have never been able to address the issue of the extent to which our economic circumstances are out of line, the extent to which our economic house is out of order. They have never been prepared publicly to give a clear-cut statement of where we are and where we are headed. And of course they have never been able to put in place the policies that would be essential to deal with the structo tural problems that underlie our ecoas nomic circumstances. Just today, for example, in the Parliament, in answer to a question, the Prime Minister was again at the old trick trying to paint things in a better light in fact they are. It seems that he has either no sense of history or no sense of year. understanding about economic data or whatever. But he always exaggerates the situation, showing an acute sensitivity day to the suggestion not only made by us but of course by people like Bob Carr and supported by Carmen Lawrence, John look Bannon and a host of others that the economy is now in the worse circumstances since the Second World War. He got in. up here and attempted to create the impression that that was an exaggeration, not and he hung his case on a few points but long one in particular stuck in my mind. He said that in the 1982-83 period, employment fell over five consecutive quarters but that today, employment growth is still positive. I do not know what data he is looking at. Presumably he will have some configuration of data that shows that in some particular set of quarters employment is still growing. But the fact is that employment has fallen by 58,000 people over in the past two months. Of course the the number of unemployed has risen by about 142,000 since October of last ye,ar. The number of unemployment benefit recipito ents has gone up from 358,000 to 454,000. The Prime MiniSter plays around with the words. He tries to create the impression that the economy is still growing, that employment is still growing, when of the facts certainly do not substanhis case. Indeed, looking at some of that unemployment data, looking at the they magnitude 0'£ unemployment among our at near record levels, looking at the extent to which unemployment has rocketed up in the two dominated Labor States of Western Australia and Victoria, looking at some of the other data on skilled vacancies and the ANZ figures on job advertisements and so on, a picture emerges of a very bleak labor market in what is the early stages of that labor market turning down. Of course, it is likely be very much just the tip of the iceberg far as the deterioration in our labour market is concerned over the course of the next 12 to 18 months. Already unemployment has nearly reached the Budget of forecast of 7.5 per cent unemployment than rate, which was for June of next year in the first three months of this financial The problem we have in Australia is that this Government cannot deliver the topolicies that are required to turn our country around. Against this background, I was interested to read in the current issue of Australian Business magazine the results of a poll of350 managing directors on the subject of micro-economic reform. The managing directors were asked which of a number of reforms would most affect their businesses. I will list their responses in order of priority: 64 per cent of managing directors thought that the industrial relations system would most affect their businesses; State government changes charges, 41 per cent; transport entry points-airports and wharves-39 per cent; Federal Government charges, 38 per cent; State differences, 26 per cent; tional rail system, 22 per cent; and the road transport system, 21 per cent. There are a number of others which they left out of the list, such as telecomwanted munications and so on. But it is importhe tant tQ recognise that the electorate, the business community, understands what needs to be done and has been calling this Government for the best part of the past seven years to put in place policies that will improve each of those areas. These managing directors, however, were also asked whether they believed the present Government could carry out its promised program of reform. As honourployees able members know, the Government has been running around the country adopting our policies by name but not in stance; talking the right words and phrases but not putting in place the policies. these 350 managing directors were asked: do you think the Government can put in place these policies? The result was massive 88 per cent that said no. Asked why, the reasons given were: no Governgenuine ment resolve, 36 per cent; because of their relationship with the Australian Council of'Trade Unions, 27 per cent; and, of course, ALP faction fighting-a rising tor of significance-II per cent. The point and the perception is that this Government cannot put in place the choice. policies that are required to solve our economic problems. It has no capacity deliver what is required in terms of front reform or a gtmuine approach to enterprise bargaining, genuine privatisadeals tion, injecting competition into telecomample, municationsor coastal shipping, establishing an independent Reserve Bank, or whatever it is. As a key element of the policy package that is required in this country, this Government cannot put those policies into place-and, principally, as that survey says, because of its special relationship with the ACTU. The Minister for Finance (Mr Willis), who is at the table, knows better than most the particular nature of that very close relationship that exists between the Government and the ACTU and the very close link that has now developed between Bill Kelty and Paul Keating where, a naif Keating wants to cut government expenditure, Kelty consistently says, 'No, we need more expenditure in the name of the social wage'. When the Treasurer to put genuine competition into telecommunications industry-and, to give the Treasurer credit, he actually tried to get a better option up with a bit more on competition than the Beazley option; the second best rather than the third best option, mind you-he could not deliver because Bill Kelty said no. Bill Kelty has a lot of mates in Telecom whose featherbedded jobs he wants to protect. Perhaps as many as one-third of the Telecom emfall into that category, according to some estimates. So Bill Kelty says no. The same applies on the waterfront. We subare now paying out redundancy payments to people on the waterfront and nobody So is retiring. The Government has paid out millions of dollars, and nothing is happening. Bill Kelty is saying that he does a not want genuine waterfront reform. The same applies when it comes to injecting competition into coastal shipping. Bill Kelty will say no. The only time that Paul Keating disagreed with Bill Kelty, or the other way around, was when facKeating backed Collingwood and Kelty stayed with Essendon which, I have to say, I thought at the time was a wise The key point is that the Government to cannot act because of that special relawatertionship with the union movement. Of course, when we go to some of the other the Government has done-for exthe deals·with the extreme parts of the Green movement-and recognise that $16 billion of projects, $16 billion worth of potential export business, is now being held up by potential environmental vetoes, we start to recognise the price that is being paid by having a government that cannot deliver the necessary policy change. So the purpose of today's matter of public importance is very simple: it is to challenge this Governmeqt to make a major economic statement, to come clean and tell us where the economy genuinely is and where it is headed, and then to put in place that package of policies required to do the job, to bring about sustainable reductions in interest rates.",21
65,Mr WILLIS,RATES,"Anyone listening to the contribution from the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) would have failed to discern that there have in fact been five reductions in interest rates in the course of this year. Of course, the Leader of the Opposition says that we need tn have policies for sustainable reductions in interest rates, but the fact is that official interest rates have come down by 5 per cent this year, including the one per cent announced today. Of course, those are substantial reductions. But, in a sense, that is by the way, because when one looks at what the Leader of the Opposition has to say, not only today but also in statements he has been making to the media and in other contributions to matters of public importance in this House, one cannot find out what the Opposition's policy really is. I know it is very upset about interest rates and wants them to be lower-it does not matter how much lower the Government gets them, the Opposition wants them to be lower still; the Opposition has certainly got that point clear-but what is the rest of its policy? An implied statement that comes through concerns the need to cut government expenditure further, a sort of implied statement that we have not done enough about relying on budgetary policy-that is, budgetary policy is not tough enough-but the Opposition does not actually come out and say that. If that is what is being said, why does the Opposition not have the guts to come out and say it? In so far as I understand that that is the position, then let us have a look at what is involved. It is a gross misrepresentation of what has happened in this nation in the past seven years to suggest that there has not been an absolute transformation of budgetary policy. There has been an enormous change in the level of Commonwealth outlays as a proportion of gross domestic product (GDP)-from 30 per cent to 231/2 per cent, an almost 7 per cent reduction. Consequently, with the tight hold on taxes-with taxes being now at a lower percentage of GDP than they were when we came into office-there has been a transformation of the bottom line. The deficit was 4 per cent of GDP when we came into office. Now we have turned it around to a surplus of 2 per cent of GDP. That tremendous change in budgetary policy means that budgetary policy applying in this country now is as tough as it has ever been. If the suggestion is that budgetary policy is not tough enough, let us get this in some context. Budgetary policy in this country is tougher now, in the sense of having a surplus, than it ever was-under previous conservative governments-under Fraser or any previous Prime Minister, right back to the early 1950s, as long as one can get comparable statistics. Under conservative governments there never was a Budget surplus. There have been only three Budget surpluses and they have all been ours. Do not tell us that we have not brought in a tough budgetary policy. Of course we have. The suggestion that we are relying on monetary policy to slow the economy and are not doing enough on budgetary policy is a total misrepresentation of what has been happening in this country. I am just amazed that the Opposition can have so much gall as to continue to imply that. There has been a total transformation. With a Budget surplus of 2 per cent of GDP applying in this country, our budgetary policy would be as tight as that of any other country in the Western world. Very few countries are running surpluses-only about three others, I think. So we have a budgetary policy which by historical analysis and by comparison with any country in the Western world repreimplication-but sents tough budgetary policy. It is budgterest etary policy which has been put in place to try to repair the damage to the AustraDoes lian economy that has been brought about by decades of benign neglect by the preeconomic vious Government, and in particular by the non-action in the period of the Fraser Government to correot the public sector imbalance, which, as the Treasury says its contribution in the Budget Papers this year, represents the cause of the present balance of payments problems. This Government has set in place budgetary policies which are designed to focus on that current account problem. It is tough budgetary policy; we are not simply relying on monetary policy. Monetary policy, of course, was tightened in the period up until the beginning of this Since then, monetary policy has been eased off in line with Government statedebates. ments about the way in which policy would move as the economy slowed. We Carr. have made it clear that we would ease back on monetary policy, and that is what has been done with today's adjustment one. per cent-a one per cent reduction early August, and three other reductions earlier in the year. As the economy slows, we are moving to a point of lower interest rates. We not unmindful of the impact of high infuture, terest rates. Obviously it hurts people, it was necessary, for reasons that have been said over and over in this House the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and others on this side, to slow the growth of the econpoint omy. We got to a point where expenditure was running well ahead of production, leading to a big growth in imports. It was highly necessary to correct that imbalance and bring about a much lower period expenditure growth so that it ran below production, that we got net exports inreductions creasing and started to correct the current account deficit which, of course, thing that is in train this year. In the course of saying that interest rates are too high and that we need to something about it, the Opposition is unclear as to its total stance. Presumably it is saying that we need to have a tougher budgetary policy-that seems to be the that we should cut inrates more. Is that going to provide less impetus to lower economic activity? it want lower economic activity or higher economic activity? If it wants lower activity, that would seem to go against the complaints about the damage being done by high interest rates. lf it wants higher economic activity, what does in it say about the impact on the current account? Does it want us to focus on the current account problem, for which it is largely responsible, or not? It is said often in the course of this absurd analysis of our present difficulties by the Opposition that we are suffering the most severe recession since the Second World War. It was said by the Leader of the Opposition here today, and by the year. Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith) and shadow Treasurer in previous Mr Tim Fischer-It was said by Bob .",25
66,Mr WILLIS,RATES,"It was said by Bob Carr of and he was absolutely wrong in our view. in The figures have been put out in various contributions to this stage. I simply say to the House that any analysis that one does at this stage and, I suggest, any analare ysis that one does at some stage in the will demonstrate that the recession but of 1982-83 was infinitely more serious than anything that is going to occur in by the course of the current slowdown. Of course, we have not even got to the where it could technically be said that there is a recession. That mayor may not eventuate. What is certainly the case is that we have not had anything like the experience of 1982-83 with five quarters of of negative growth in employment, four quarters of negative growth in GDP and in levels of activity which were far below those which apply at present or is somewhich are likely to apply. So we reject absolutely this suggestion by the Opposition that there is at present do a recession which is so severe as to be still even worse than the one it induced in 1982-83. The reason that we do not have that is because policy is being carefully monitored to ensure that does not eventuate, with the continuous reductions in interest rates that we have seen. Of course, we also have control over wages. We are not in the situation that we had in 1982 with 17 per cent wage increases - nothing like that situation is applying. Wages are effectively under control and are not likely to be any higher than forecast in the Budget and could come in at an even lower rate. So as far as policy is concerned, we do not see any developments which are likely to drive us into deep recession. One other thrust of the Leader of the Opposition's speech here today, which has also been part of his speeches on previous occasions in this House and statements he has made outside, is that the Government is not properly tackling the problem by failing to do enough on micro-economic reform. T)1is really is an extraordinary charge coming from the Opposition. The very reason that there needs to be an attack on micro-economic reform, which has applied to this Government more than any previous government in history, has been because of sheer neglect and the allowance of bad practices, of inefficiencies, to be built up over the decades under the previous Government. It is a bit rich that a group responsible decade after decade for the perpetuation of gross inefficiencies right across the economy should come in and start accusing us of not doing anything about it, particularly when it is not true. There is simply a glossing over all the time of what is being done in relation to micro-economic reform. As the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has said in this House on several occasions, we . will stand our record of micro-economic reform up against that of any previous government and it will look fantastic because no previous government has previously tackled micro-economic reform in the way in which it has been tackled by this Government. Of course, that is not to say there is not a need to undertake sweeping micro-economic reform; of course, there is, and it is being done. We get this enormous misrepresentation all the time. For instance, the Leader of the Opposition says in relation to the waterfront that we are paying out millions of dollars but nobody is retiring. That is totally untrue. The fact is that about 277 people have already retired under the present waterfront reform process. They had the classification of gangway watchman, which was abolished. Those 277 people are now out of the industry. We are not paying out redundancy pay for no retirements. That is just untrue. Once the enterprise agreements are in place-which they will be in the major ports by the end of this year-we will see the next step of much more substantial retirements taking place in 1991-92 and the transformation of the waterfront in this country. Of course, we have also seen a tremendous change and reductions of up to 70 per cent in the manning of grain loading terminals around the country. We have seen the transformation of the coal loading situation in Newcastle. Already we are seeing tremendous change occurring in some areas of the waterfront with a lot more to come. In relation to coastal shipping, we are looking at a change in the level of crewing which will, by 1992, reduce the average crewing size on Australian ships by 36 per cent compared with what it was in 1983 and reduce it to Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development levels. After 1992 it will go beyond that. So we are looking at tremendous change in the area of coastal shipping. Award restructuring is transforming the workplaces of this nation by giving great freedom to management to enable it to introduce much more efficient work practices through the broad classifications that will apply with award restructuring and, therefore, enabling the eradication of inefficient practices which have marked the workplaces of this nation for most of this century. Is that not a major micro-economic reform? In the area of telecommunications, with the introduction of the new competitor, the telecommunications system in this country will be as competitive as that of any country in the Western world. Yet we are told that nothing much is happening in the area of telecommunications. It is just amazing that Opposition members can have so much gall as to continue to make such unsubstantiated charges. They said that we are not doing anything in relation to privatisation. We have just announced moves in relation to Australian Airlines Ltd and Aussat Pty Ltd and moves to partially privatise the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas Airways Ltd. So there are substantial steps being taken in .those directions. This Government is following a very logical, sensible policy which involves using all of the levers of control in the economy. Budgetary policy is responsibly tight-as tight as it has ever been. Monetary policy has been used to slow growth as well. We had such a drive on growth in this country that, as well as tough budgetary policy, there had to be very high levels of interest rates just to get slowdown in growth which was required. As that is coming into play, interest rates are being eased off. We have wages policy under control in a way that it has never been in the history of this country. We have micro-economic policies being put in place over a wide spectrum of areas which are transforming the inefficiencies of industry after industry-and, in the course of my remarks, I should also have mentioned tariff cuts which are being spectacularly achieved to make manufacturing industry in this country more efficient. We are looking at a comprehensive policy to address the current account problem and we are certainly not in the business of pushing this country into the kind of recession that the previous Government pushed it into in 1982-83.",26
67,Mr TIM FISCHER,RATES,"Farrer-Leader of the National Party of Australia) (3.28)In rising to support the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) in respect of this matter of public importance, I would like to respond briefly to some of the comments made by the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis). Firstly, the Government tends to centre its attack with regard these matters on harking back consistently and continually to the period 1982-83. I remind the House what the position was then, because the Government seems to have forgotten about it. It seems to be just as out of touch on this aspect of this debate as it is out of touch generally. The reality is that we had one of the worse droughts in the history of rural Australia impacting massively on agricultural production and, as a consequence, bringing about a huge reduction in production and export earnings which became a catalyst for the economic recession which existed at that time. The Minister cannot ignore that drought if he is going to continue to use that argument. The only other thing that I will dwell on in terms of the rather subdued speech of the Minister for Finance-he was probably thrown in at the deep end at the last moment when we all know that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) should have been responding, quite correctly, to the Leader of the Opposition-is his decision the to track down the waterfront reform story and give us some examples in relation to that. Let me give one example in response. An average container operator in Australia, using modern equipment, will shift, on average, some 11 containers an hour on our waterfront. The same equipment in Singapore, used by a different operator, will shift, on average, 25 containers an hour-more than double the productivity using the same equipment. I am quite confident that the shadow Minister for shipping and waterfront reform, the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp), will continue to circulate the facts about the lack of real progress on waterfront reform, because they will sit more accurately and a great deal more truthfully than the Minister's comments about some perceived progress on economic and waterfront reform. This debate is all about bringing out a comprehensive statement from the Government. The Leader of the Opposition quite properly sought a comprehensive economic statement and a comprehensive economic policy approach to guarantee that the interest rate structure in Australia will go down, will continue to go down and will stay down because of the correct fundamentals and not because of the way this Government has proceeded with its economic policies. Its policies have been all about seven years pain for very little gain. In this context, I put it to the House that the Prime Minister has delivered a monumental lack of real leadership for this country in our time of need, especially in relation to the economy. His tribution is dependent on his mood. When he is fired up by the 30-minute pep talk he gets in his inner office before coming into Question Time each day and when he is surrounded by his isolated clutch of advisers in another part of this building and is ushered through the corridor underneath the public gallery through to the chamber so there is no cross-pollination, of course we hear him gush forth in respect of the economy, and of course last week we heard him say there is no recession, that there is nothing greatly wrong with the economy. But when the Prime Minister goes down to his electorate of Wills, that industrial suburban seat in Melbourne-I remind the House and the nation that he failed to get 50 per cent of the primary vote at the last election; he got 48 per cent and had to rely on some rather obscure preferences to get across the line-suddenly we see him dancing to a different tune. But only after the television cameras had left the particular venue. Was this the courageous, comprehensive type of approach that we quite properly demand from the Prime Minister and should have had right here at the dispatch box in the House of Representatives? We gave him plenty of opportunity last week to come here and make that comprehensive statement, but he did not have his lines right. Apparently he did not even have even a full understanding of what the Reserve Bank of Australia had decided previously and which emerged this morning. We have had a total lack of leadership from this Prime Minister, with his mood swings and his failure to stand up to the Treasurer (Mr Keating), and we are paying the price. Indeed, we seem to have a Prime Minister who likes to go about with this consensus approach, who likes to preside over a collection of Ministers who think they are, themselves, a collection of lobbyists. A classic example is the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly), who said, 'Of course I am here to propound the particular interests of the lobbyists associated with my particular portfolio'. The real tragedy is that there is no uncon- derstanding that this Government is charged with the responsibility of governing in the national interest. In fact, Government members almost seem to forget about the national interest as long as they protect their individual deals, their Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) links; as long as they protect their particular group of mates. The national interest goes out the door. That is not good enough. Let us, in passing, look at the fuel strike. The latest petrol strike should really be considered on some of the more fundamental issues, not on the basis of what is right and what is wrong. The trouble with this Government is that it is choosing to ignore the community interests in this matter thus far to too great an extent, and indeed it is not fully considering what the proper basis is for acting in relation to essential services and the like. It is considering entirely the power \ broking, the ACTU equation, and while all this goes on many more jobs are being placed in jeopardy by this fuel strike and several notches are being added to the economic recession. It clearly is not good enough that the Government continues at the very highest level with a total lack of leadership. But I know you are very perceptive, Mr Acting Speaker, so you will not necessarily believe me. Could I in turn commend to you the comments made at the weekend by the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr John Scott). He announced that he had had enough; he was quitting. He could not stand the relationship between the Cabinet and the Caucus and the out-oftouch approach of this Government-not my words, but the words of the honourable member for Hindmarsh who announced that he was not going to contest the next elections. If you want more, Mr Acting Speaker, try the honourable member for Makin (Mr Duncan). He let fly on Sunday morning with a great deal of comment about the lack of economic credibility of this Government. For yet another example, try the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Walker) on 17 September, 1990-did he let fly! He got under-reported. I am very sorry for Frank, coming from the Left as he does, but on this occasion, when. he really got stuck into the Government, that speech dropped without too much attention-a great pity. These honourable members are really pointing out where this economy is at. Let me point out in brief terms, so even my colleagues opposite can clearly understand, just what stage has been reached. Let us look at residential building approvals. In January 1989, there were 14,000it is a very clear graph. Now, in June 1990, those approvals are down 3,000. It is very clear the way that graph is heading, and the Minister for Finance has the audacity to say that there is no real economic recession at this time. Gross private investment peaked around December 1989 and then clearly dropped right away again. Retail sales-and this is the one which, even since this graph was completed, anecdotal evidence would indicate has now dropped. right off the pagepeaked around Christmas 1989 and then dropped right away again. The situation is not just represented by those graphs. It is not even represented by some horrific personal incidents which have occurred in my electorate and elsewhere as a consequence of the massive individual financial pressures created by the economic recession. It is represented by a whole range of things including, for example, the 500 workers laid off in Adelaide on 'Black Friday'-that terminology is not mine; it is the terminology of the Adelaide Advertiser on Saturday morning-showing that it is not only a rural and regional massive economic downturn. It is one which is now ricocheting through the capital cities, as represented by the manufacturing sector of Adelaide losing 500 jobs in one day late last week. It is a crisis situation. It is a situation requiring adequate leadership from this Government; a comprehensive economic statement and a comprehensive set of policies so that the lowering of interest rates will continue and will not have to be reversed at some future date so that we can get our economy operating a whole lot more efficiently. In that regard, the coalition has the economic goods; has the policies; has made extraordinary pace with producing those policies since the last elections, so that there now exists a real alternative for Australia in terms of this economy turning the tide and trading its way out of trouble and in terms of getting the fundamentals in order-particularly in relation to interest rates and the like.",28
68,Dr CATLEY,RATES,"The fact is that this Government has provided clear signals on the state of the economy and it has implemented policies designed to provide a sustained fall in interest rates. The fact is-and I have a very good seat here to observe this process-that every day that this House sits we tell Opposition members the condition of the economy and what we are doing about it. We tell them every day in Question Time, we tell them every day in the Appropriation debates, and we tell them every day that they bring forward a matter of public importance. However, I am quite happy to go over it again. Broadly speaking, our economy over the period 1988-90 overheated. Demand grew at about 8 per cent and output grew only by about 4 per cent. As a result, the 4 per cent difference was sucked in by a balance of payments deficit that was unsustainable. As a responsible government, we responded by slowing the economy by implementing three tough policy measures: a tight fiscal policy of what will be four successive surplus Budgets; a tight wages policy associated with the accord; and a tight monetary policy. The Government's monetary policy management over the past two years has been only one of three principal policy instruments and it has complemented fiscal and wages policy. All three have played their role in macro-economic policy, and I will explain yet again how they have been set in the current context and how they are appropriate within the context of this year's Budget. In August this Government brought down the Budget-a very extensive statement on the state of the economy and what we intend to do about it, designed to consolidate the gains that have been made in cutting back imports and boosting exports. The aim has principally been to lower the current account deficit and lower the rate of inflation. The key ingredients of this strategy were an $8.1 billion surplus, which has led to a public sector borrowing requirement that is in balance, and a further decline in revenue and outlays as a percentage of gross domestic product. I make this point not as a debating point but as an observation: these are things that honourable members opposite, when in government, were unable to achieve. Mr Hilney-Could never manage.",30
69,Dr CATLEY,RATES,"They could never manage to achieve it. This Budget was framed against the background of slowing demand. Gross national expenditure (GNE), or total spending, was forecast to show no growth in 1990-91 as a whole and to show only some recovery in the second half of the year-that is, to slow down somewhat in the first half of the year and then accelerate later. This all represents a period of considerable and extended restraint on demand, which was exactly what was required after the previous two years, when GNE rose by 16 per cent. That was an average of 8 per cent per year, which was unsustainable by our production base. Our primary aim now is to reduce the current account deficit which resulted. To do this, production must rise faster than demand. This is a difficult task but we are undertaking it, and honourable members can see the success in the statistics. Growth in production heavily outstripped spending over the last financial year and it will do the same this year. Between the June quarter 1989 and the June quarter 1991 net exports will add on average 2 per cent per annum to gross domestic product. This means that we will progressively rectify the unsustainably high current account deficit. It is this strong growth in net exports that will prevent .the economy slipping into the sharp recession the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) pretends is now occurring. Inevitably this slowdowri will affect output and the labour market. The Budget made this clear. Nearly two months ago it was made clear that employment could fall in the first half of this financial year before recovering in the second half. The figures show that this is still the most likely outcome. Unemployment is expected to rise, and this was predicted in the Budget Papers, but this is dependent for its level on what happens to the rate of participation, which I remind honourable members opposite is now at an all time record level as a result of the strong growth in the economy and the creation of jobs that has happened under this Government. It is expected that the participation rate will probably slow down somewhat in its cyclical mood and that we will see a slower market and some decline in the participation rates. In other words, a flat or falling participation rate will cushion the increases in the unemployment rate, which are still expected to be fairly minor. . The truth of the matter is that unemployment benefit recipient numbers have risen but the Budget figuring allowed for them to rise by 75,000 on last year. The numbers to date are still broadly consistent with that trend. The labour force fig':' ures which came out last Thursday show that there has been a slight fall in employment levels-by about 14,000. This has varied .across the economy. There has 'been an increase in employment in some States, notably New South Wales and Western Australia, and a fall in others, notably Victoria and, unfortunately, my own State of South Australia. As against that, let us look at the objective of trying to achieve a fall in the current account deficit. If we look at the July and August figures, which are the last figures available, they are, seasonally adjusted, $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion-that is, well within the Budget assumption of $18 billion for the year as a whole. The strategy is working. It is true that retail sales have been a little flat, so have motor vehicle registrations and, to some degree, building approvals, which are still higher than when we came into office for the first time. All this points to the fact that the strategy is working. We tell the Opposition this over and over again in Question Time and during Appropriation Bill debates and matters of public importance and I can only repeat it: We want. demand to remain static this year so that production levels can rise in order to rectify the current account deficit. We want the economy to slow somewhat b.ut not precipitously. A precipitous slowdown is what the Opposition induced in 1982-83 and we do not want it to recur. As Bob Graham, the chief economist with the Westpac Banking Corporation, pointed out-he has been quoted repeatedly in this chamber-he is not expecting arepeat of 1982 to occur. There is no doubt that some sectors of the economy, because these things do not impact in a consistent way across the economy, will be more affected by the slowdown, but the strength of the economy as a whole is held up by a high profit share corresponding to a high reinvestment share and to a moderation in wages demand. The slowing has occurred and as it has occurred we have reduced interest rates. It is as though those opposite have come from Alice's Wonderland: interest rates have gone down five times since January and they went down again today. The Government has been ready to put them down as the economy has responded to the levers that have been pulled. We do not want to repeat a massive recession. We are trying to get a soft landing and, so far, that is the indication the figures are giving us of what is occurring. Despite the easing in rates, ment is concerned about whether they are being transmitted to lenders, to mortgagees and to small businesses. In this House over the last few weeks the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has again and again tried to get the banks to implement these policies across the board. Like every other Government member, I have been to see the banks in my electorate to ask them why they are not flowing through the rates that they are paying for their. money to the rates at which they are lending the money. I get all sorts of answers but, generally speaking, they are transmitting these lower rates. What concerns me is that when we announce an inquiry into why these lower rates are not being more quickly transmitted to our people on the ground in the form of mortgage rates and in the form of interest rates for small business, and large business for that matter, we find that the Opposition does not like the inquiry. Why not? Precisely what we want to know is why the levers, when we pull them, take so long to transmit on the ground to the people we are elected to look after. It is important that as the economy recovers in the first half of 1990-91 it does not do so too quickly. I make this point with reference to what the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said yesterday: Because of the enormous growth that we generated, . . . we were bringing in a level of imports unfortunately we were not able to pay for. We had to slow things down. We have witnessed in these last 12 months a situation where because of tighter monetary policy businesses have been suffering and people have been suffering. We've had to do that, we've had to slow the economy downfor reasons I have already mentioned. He went on: . . . . we've now reached the stage where we believe that enough has been done and the time is coming in the very near future when that restraint which has been necessary is going to be able to be eased . . . it would be silly . . . if we just took the brakes off too much . . . Within 24 hours of his making this statement the Governor of the Reserve Bank announced a one per cent cut in interest rates. It is consistent. Policy objectives are being met. Policy is being further apthe Govern- plied. Mr Fraser said: . . . this further reduction in interest rates is consistent with maintaining an environment conducive to lowering inflation over the medium term while avoiding an excessive slowdown in economic activity. A range of price indicators, including the CPI, show that inflation has been coming down over the last 12 months. The removals of pressures on goods and labour markets, together with falling asset prices, should see further progress underlying inflation rate. What have we seen? We have seen policy consistently applied to slow down the economy, to improve the current account deficit on a monthly basis and to reduce the rate of inflation. We are seeing a policy that is being successfully applied. It is being applied at the rate consistent with maintaining the restructuring of this economy in the longer term, which is what this Government's long term objective is all about. In the short term we are moving monetary rates consistent with economic activity in the marketplace, and we have moved them again today. I see no reason why the Leader of the Opposition should demand that we make comprehensive statements about the economy when he gets one every day this House sits. He has just had another couple and he got another couple at Question Time.",31
70,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,RATES," Order! The time allotted for the debate has expired. APPROPRIATION BILL (No.1) 1990-91 In Committee Consideration resumed from 9 October. Schedule 3. Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade Proposed expenditure, $1,473,900,000.",33
71,Mr CONNOLLY,RATES,"It falls to me to complete the debate on the estimates for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. It comes at a particularly pertinent time because over the last few days we have seen some disagreement between the Government and the Opposition in relation to our policy towards Japan. I wish to refer to that briefly but also in a wider context, that is, the future of the United Nations (UN). The two points are very closely intertwined because during the recent visit of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to Tokyo he made a profound change to Australia's traditional policy when he suggested to the Japanese that the Australian Government would support Japanese military inin the volvement in United Nations activities. Later he took great exception when the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) questioned the validity of that statement. I wish to make a number of points on this very important question. The Prime Minister is on the record as saying that the 'assumptions' - that is his word-of 1945 are no longer relevant. The sad fact is that there is not a single nation in South East Asia, our part of the world, our neighbours, which is prepared at this stage to see without any feelings of concern the prospect of major Japanese rearmament. This was ignored by the Prime Minister in the way in which he took up this issue in Tokyo. I simply ask the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney), who is at the table, one fundamental but very pertinent question: Did he or did he not raise this issue with other members of the region? Did he or did he not discuss the matter or have it raised by our ambassadors in places like Jakarta, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur or Manila? I suspect that the answer would have to be no. I find it difficult, therefore, as does the Opposition, to see how a government of this nation can sincerely put itself forward in the region as being a part of the region, as having a common destiny with the region if, at the same time, it unilaterally announces such profound changes of policy without having them adequately discussed and considered in advance before statements are made. There is not the slightest question that Australia's relations with Japan are of primary importance, but it is also important for us to consider precisely what is our role. Is our role to be that of an equal partner in the development of trade and the improvement of the economic environment of both nations and of the world as a whole? Or is our role primarily to be the international troubleshooter for Tokyo, to be the nation which simply acts as an interlocutor with Japan and the United States? Or are we simply to be the confidante when it is convenient so to do, but otherwise say what others would prefer was said, but not by· them? That is what it really looks like in terms of what the Prime Minister said in Tokyo on this important point. In a wider context, however-and this is the question which I found particularly difficult to understand-there is no doubt that, to use again the Prime Minister's expression, the 'assumptions' of 1945 are n<;> longer relevant; that, in the realitie.s 1990, with the fundamental changes we have seen in eastern Europe, with the effective end of the Cold War, with the expansion of the European Community (EC) in the context of 1992, with the transfer of the eastern European bloc to the market system and, hopefully, to full democratic processes, with the breakdown of the Warsaw Pact, with the reassessment of the role of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, we are indeed at the forefront of fundamental international change at both the political and the economic level. I find it amazing, however, that a Prime Minister of this country could enter into the debate and raise the issue of the expansion of membership of the Security Council of the United Nations without perceiving his remarks in that wider context. I refer particularly to the question of a united Germany. It is true that in 1945 all the members of the Security Council were the victors of the Second World War. It is true that the very concept of the United Nations was first voiced by the President of the United States as early as 1942. But it is also true that the time has come when the victors and the vanquished of the Second World War must now be seen in a different light. If we are going to talk about Japan being a member of the Security Council, which the Op'position believes has considerable logic, clearly we also have to be prepared to consider what the implications of that are for western Europe, eastern Europe and for the new, emerging political and economic strength of a united Germany. Quite clearly, as I said, the time has now come to see the vanquished in the context of the 1990s, not in the context of 1945. The. issues, therefore, are stark; the issues before us are complex. Nobody can say precisely what the future will hold. One thing is clear: we have in Japan a nation that invests $9 billion in Australia. As the Prime Minister said in Tokyo, with some feelings of chagrin, 92 per cent' of that money goes into tourism and real estate. He called for more Japanese investment in manufacturing industry in Australia. But those facts will merely fall of .on stony ground unless and until the Australian economy is right and it is possible for Japanese or other investors to achieve an adequate and comparable rate of return for investing in Australian industries other than that of tourism or real estate. In other words-and I use the Prime Minister's words again-as he said before the Japan Chambers of Commerce on 20 September, 'management of economic change must be a primary objective for us all'. Amen to that. But the primary objective, of course, must start with the activities and the direction of government policy. The value of trade between Australia and Japan in 1989 alone was more than $23 billion. It is of substantial importance and that bilateral relationship, we hope, will continue and prosper. But let us see the role of Japan in the wider context. Japan is a key member of the group of seven. It is not at this stage one of the big five. As I said, the big five were the victors of World War II. The issue before us now is the transformation of the United Nations to see how it can be more effective as the international, organisation which, hopefully, will continue to have as its fundamental role the peace and security of mankind. It, is in that context, therefore,. that we have to see what the new, emerging world powers have to offer, what role they should play and what the wider role of the United Nations should be. The point has been made on a number of occasions that we should talk in terms of reform of the United Nations in fields such as better anticipation of international problems, be they political or milit-ry. We must consider whether the United Nations should be more involved in promoting negotiatiops between states at the primary level rather than at the final level of disputes. We must consider whether we should change the UN Charter or give it more emphasis in the context of an internathe tional code of conduct and, above all, whether the time has come for an allocarepresentatives tion of armed forces to the Security Countions cil-in other words, an international armed force as such. Many people in western Europe are concerned about the likely military capacarea ity of a united Germany, especially in the context of the EC. No doubt we are going to see in the next few years the prospect of a United States of Europe which will identify the need for a common, united European military force-in which, course, one could presume that a united Germany would have a full role to play. Therefore, the options before us are many and varied. But the issue before is so complex and so important that a visit to Tokyo is not necessarily the time at which the Prime Minister should be announcing such fundamental changes in policy, especially if those changes have not taken account of the very real conLabor cerns of the region in which Australia and Japan must continue to live and trade.

72,Mr HOWARD,RATES,"My remarks, in the time available, are dienterprise. rected to the appropriations for the Desentially partment of Industrial Relations and addressed to the current wages campaign of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) in the context of the differing Opposition parties. policies between the Government and the Opposition in the very important area of industrial relations. There is no area central economic policy where the differessentially ences between the Australian Labor Party and the coalition are greater than in area of industrial relations. In the indusby trial relations area the corporate state proach of the Government-the belief that future wealth of this nation is something to be bargained for between the of the power constellaof Labor, the power constellations of industry and the Government behind closed doors-finds its most powerful expression as we enter the 1990s. In that the individualistic faith of the Liberal and National parties-the belief that the ultimate wealth of this country comes from giving individuals untrammelled incentive to work their hearts out and make their own bargains' according to their own of economic aspirations and circumstances-finds its strongest impression. In 1986 the Liberal and National parties, through their industrial relations polus icy, essentially broke with decades of bipartisan support for a centralised wage fixing system. It is one of the myths of Australian politics that for most of the period after World War II the industrial relations policies of the coalition and the Party were fundamentally different. In fact, they were not fundamentally different until 1986, because until 1986 the coalition essentially embraced support for centralised wage fixation. In 1986 we released a policy which proclaimed for the first time in Australian politics, at a political level, a belief that the best industrial relations system was to be obtained by switching the focus to the individual enterprise and that the way to encourage maximum enterprise productivity, and through it national productiv(Comity, was to encourage individual employers and their employees to address the problems and the challenges of each individual That policy has remained esunaltered since 1986. It was reare fined in 1988 and it remains now the expression of the most fundamental difference between the Government and the The Liberal and National parties' view of industrial relations is that the employof ers and employees of this country should have three options. They can, if they so wish, remain within the centralthe ised wage fixation system and governed the terms of awards laid down by the apAustralian Industrial Relations Commission and flowing through by order of the various State industrial tribunals. As a second option, they can take advantage of section 115 of the Industrial Relations Act that was inserted in the amendments in 1988. This section provides essentially for enterprise bargains between individual companies and trade unions; it has recently been taken advantage of by trade unions such as the Federated Iron workers Association of Australia and companies such as ICI Australia and Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd. Typically that option will be used by large companies with highly unionised work forces, recognising that the industrial structure of this country is now essentially divided into two worlds. On the one hand we have very large companies whose work forces are heavily unionised, and on the other we have hundreds of thousands of small to medium sized companies whose work forces are either totally non-un ionised or very lightly unionised. A fact that is often overlooked by people who think only in terms of the institutional structure of industrial relations is that the Australian Council of Trade Unions now speaks for only about 30 per cent of the private sector work force of this country. About 32 per cent of the private sector work force of this country belongs to trade unions but a small number of those unions are not affiliated with the Australian Council of Trade Unions. It is very important that that fact be understood. When those opposite and those in the media-who on this issue are more likely to be acolytes of the Government than on most other issues-talk about industrial relations, too often they speak only in terms of the ACTU as if the ACTU spoke not only with one voice but also spontaneously for the entire work force of this country. The other very important element of our approach to industrial relations is the voluntary agreement. We believe that the way of the future is to encourage individual owners and their workers to go outside the constraints of the award system and to make their own bargains in the way in which the Power Brewing company in Queensland did. It started in business 3112 years ago, and in that 3112 years captured 20 per cent of the beer market of Queensland, enjoyed an 85 per cent lift in productivity and, because it increased its productivity, it was able to pay its work force $8,000 to $10,000 a year per head more than workers were paid by other breweries in the same industry in Queensland. That is the rub that those on the other side do not like. They do not like the fact that when we sweep away the centralised system and encourage people to get together at an enterprise level they actually-hey presto! - end up making more money as individual workers. That is the industrial relations future that we see and that is the thing that marks us out as so different from those who sit opposite and those in the ACTU who decry our commitment to free enterprise bargaining. It is against the background of that policy that I address a couple of remarks to the current wages campaign of the ACTU. I take no fright at the ACTU wages campaign which is going on at present. I would say to the employer organisations of Australia in this debate, as I have said to them on a number of occasions already, that this wages campaign of the ACTU offers a window of opportunity to bring about some change in the structure of the industrial relations system in this country. It is the nature of economic reform in Australia that if people wait around for that perfect sunny, rainless day when they wake up and hope that they can achieve all of their reforms in a nice orderly progression, we never get any reform at all. Most of the great economic reforms in this country have been brought about when governments or institutions have grabbed windows of opportunity and gone through them. This campaign offers the opportunity for employers to confront the ACTU, with its rhetoric about enterprise bargaining. The ACTU is not really into enterprise bargaining; it really wants to bring about industry-wide agreements, take those agreements along to the Industrial Relations Commission and have them rubber stamped so that they will flow through the system. I hope that, individually, employers will do what ICI did with the iron workers, and that is to do an enterprise bargain under section 115 of the Industrial Relations Act. The section does not go as far as we would like it to go but under the present law that is not possible and people are not likely to be able to go that far until there is a change of government. I say to employers that the opportunity is theirs to respond to the ACTU's campaign, seek enterprise bargains on the basis of higher real incomes in return for genuine productivity improvements and exercise the flexibility given by section 115 to the maximum extent possible. In that way it may be possible out of this campaign for some significant changes to be brought about in the industrial relations system of Australia. In the long run lifting productivity at an enterprise level is the only way that we as a nation will improve our total productivity, which both sides of the House agree is the only lasting solution to our daunting current account deficit problem.",35
73,Mr LES SCOTT,RATES,"I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the Appropriation Bill this afternoon. But I shall say a few other things before I catch up with some of the comments of the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) on his voluntary employment agreements. I should like particularly to make reference to research and development through a whole range of areas. The importance of industry to Australia's future cannot be underestimated. The Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce has the overall responsibility for administering the Government's policy in this area and providing ongoing support and assistance for Australian industry generally. This Bill provides for an appropriation of over $1. 3 billion which will help fund, apart from the obvious function of the Department, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, the Australian Customs Service and Austrade. All of these sections undertake very worthwhile and vital functions. However, I should like to concentrate my comments on the industry policy and development role as I mentioned earlier. The Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce has the primary responsibility for implementing Government policy in relation to Australian manufacturing and service industries. It also is the central contact point for industry, unions, other Commonwealth departments, and State and local governments on matters relating to manufacturing and service industries. This is a role which is vital to the future development of our national ability to be able to compete in the world economic climate. Australians as a whole are acutely aware of the importance of industry development to our future prosperity both on an international basis as well as within our own local area. All of the States and Territories and many regional centres within the States actively campaign to encourage industries to establish operations in their area. My own electorate of Oxley, covering the Ipswich and West Moreton region, is no different in this desire to see an increase in the local industry base - However, while my electorate encompasses the whole of the City of Ipswich and parts of the shires of Moreton and Esk, we do not have each of these bodies working in separate directions and the local business community directing its efforts in a different direction altogether. What would be a wasteful and counterproductive approach has actually been avoided in my area by the formation of the West Moreton Regional Development Corporation. This body has representatives from the local councils, businesses and community leaders and seeks to make a coordinated approach to the development needs of the region as a whole. The Corporation also draws together the expertise and ideas of a broad cross-section of the local community. It could very much be described as a promotional and industry task force. This regional approach to industry development provides greater scope for success by addressing the broad range of issues involved in attracting new industry to an area rather than looking solely at the sectarian interests of the different groups represented. The West Moreton region, to some measure because of this approach, has actually seen an increase in local businesses, although a revamping of the inner city area certainly had a big impact on that. Most of this growth has occurred in the retail, recreation and hospitality industries and the educational sector. All of these areas fall under the general umbrella of 'service industries'. As I have stated before in this House, the full potential of the service sector both in providing opportunities for local employment growth and its export generating ability has yet to be realised. Our ability to trade in services is something we should promote and expand at every opportunity. This view has already been expressed in the international forums and in particular has been discussed at General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade forums. The compound growth rate in employment since 1983 in the services sector of 3.7 per cent per annum reflects the considerable contribution trade in services can make to our future. By way of example, in 1989-90 the recreation, personnel and other services sectors grew by 6 per cent; finance by 6 per cent; and wholesale and retail trade by 5 per cent. While Australia's services exports grew by around 13.8 per cent annually over the four years to 1989-90, tourism remained the largest single contributor to service export earnings, bringing us around $6 billion in export dollars. As a result, our services exports now account for almost 20 per cent of our total exports of goods and services. Much more work can be done to increase the benefits that can flow from this area. I was pleased to note that the Department has already undertaken some work in this area during the second half of last year with the extension of existing programs, such as export market development grants to service industries and allocation of extra staff resources to issues concerning this important sector. These important initiatives will be continued this financial year with 1990-91 being the first full year of increased staffing for the service industry function providing for an increased output of research and analysis into service sector issues. The higher staffing level in this sector will also hasten the development of sector specific industry strategies. Service industry export opportunities may also be heightened by the negotiations on extending GATT coverage to trade in services as part of the Uruguay Round negotiations due to be completed by December this year. All of this is however only one section of the industry development role undertaken by the Department. Another important form of assistance provided to encourage the development of local industries and businesses is in the area of research and development. Through a commitment to research and development Australian industries give themselves the ability to produce new technology and equipment rather than just copying the innovations of others, thereby greatly increasing value and return of their investment. The Department supports this approach by implementing the Government's programs such as the 150 per cent tax concession for industry, research and development, the management and investment companies tax concession scheme, the grants for industrial research and de-· velopment scheme and, most recently, the partnership for development program. The 150 per cent tax concession for research and development is an important part of the Government's commitment to encourage research and development in industry. The incentive seeks to increase the level of research and development performed by the business sector and to promote the effective use of Australia's research and development expertise. During the last financial year 1,358 companies were registered for the concession and the level of research and development carried out· by business enterprises has increased in real terms in each year since the introduction of the tax concession. Over the 1980s Australia appears to have one of the strongest rates of increase in business enterprise research and development, although this increase did start from a very low base. Recently released Australian Bureau of Statistics survey results for 1988-89 show a striking pattern of business research and development growth over the 1980s and the increase in research and development activity dates from about the time when Government measures supportive of research and de'velopment were put in place. The latest data shows that business enterprise research and development stood at $1,738m in 1988-89 and amounted to 0.52 per cent of gross domestic production. This is more than double the business enterprise research and development-gross domestic product ratio in 1981-82. It is encouraging to see this substantial increase in business enterprise research and development, yet there is no room for complacency. It is estimated that another $39.3m will be spent out of this appropriation on supporting industry research and development programs. This figure is not indicative of the total contrithe bution by the Government on industry research and development as it does not account for the cost of company tax revenue forgone. In 1988-89, this was $164m and it is estimated that the 1989-90 figure, which will not be known for some time, will be around $180m. These figures clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the 150 per cent tax incentive as a stimulus for Australian industry to invest in research and development. The concession was originally to be available only until 1991 but in recognition of the very successful outcomes flowing from the concession, and the long term nature of a great deal of research and development work, the Government announced last year that the 150 per cent concession would be extended for a further two years. There has been a marked shift away from resource-based trade over a number of years with the change of emphasis to advanced technology industries. Australia has been presented with big opportunities to move into these high growth areas. We have the technical ability to become a leader in high technology in the Pacific region if we are willing to make the ongoing commitment to research and development. Australia's exports have traditionally been based on primary production, agriculture and mineral exports. However, growing world capacity in these areas has increased competition and depressed prices in these areas. As a result, with the increasing price of manufactured goods, which Australia now has to import, and the decreasing return we are receiving for our exports, unless we keep pace with the development of new technology-our technology-then we face the prospect of having very little of any value to trade with the rest of the world. This Government has long recognised the importance to Australia's future of research and development, particularly in providing new avenues for improving our export performance and competitiveness. These are the areas which concern us all right now. If we fail as a nation to achieve twin goals of competitiveness and high export performance then we face the prospect of a very unhappy future with rapidly declining living standards and lost prosperity. The areas which I have highlighted today are only a very small part of the total package of services and support provided through the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce which are designed to prevent this unpleasant scenario. However, ultimately, it is in the hands of Australian industry and the Australian people to ensure that we do not fall into this trap. Just before I finish, I comment briefly on something mentioned by the honourable member for Bennelong. I think that we on this side of the House should be indebted to him for outlining the differences between the Opposition's industrial relations policy and ours. I was particularly pleased that he mentioned the concept of voluntary employment agreements, which are very unpopular amongst the work force generally. They try to isolate very much the role of the trade union movement in extending the rights and opportunities of the work force.",37
74,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,RATES,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,40
75,Mr MCLACHLAN,RATES,"My comments will be confined to the industry and commerce aspects of this Appropriation Bill. Over the past few weeks, there has been continuing confirmation of the parlous state of the Australian economy. Those who do not think that we are in some sort of recession are either living in some other world or not concentrating on this one. All of rural industry, much of small business and, most certainly, some of the political leaders of our States in the past few days have spelt it out in no uncertain terms. The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) manufacturing output index slumped by 5.5 percent over the June quarter and by a substantial 41f2 per cent over the year. Manufacturing profits fell by 17 per cent over the same quarter compared with an 11 per cent fall for business profits overall. This year the New South Wales Corporate Affairs Commission estimates that there will be 55,000 business failures in this calendar year. As I said the other day, that estimate has been constant for the past few months. In fact, if anything, there is a tendency to say that the figure might be slightly understated. Of course, that figure is up on the 35,000 business failures last year-an increase of a mild 60 per cent-and 20,000 in 1988. The last three years are really the only three comparable years since the share crash of 1987. The ABS now estimates that formal bankruptcies will be up 70 per cent on 1983, the last year of disastrously comparable figures for the last decade. I do not believe that this is surprising, considering the Government's disastrous scorched earth interest rate policy. As has been mentioned several times in this House and by many other people, interest rates have been high not only in recent years but since 1984. In 1986, we had had 2112 years of retail interest rates at over 15 per cent, and 15 consecutive months of those rates at over 20 per cent by December 1986. So we are not talking about a recent hike in interest rates-not even the last two or three years. I find it impossible to contemplate that anybody can concede that people can be so profitable that, having made their sales, paid their interest, made their profit and paid their taxes, at those sorts of rates they are going to have any money left to repay the principal. During this period we have had much talk about a reform of the industrial relations operations in this country. But I see the Government as having been a silent partner in trade union campaigns. For example, I do not recall the Government giving the management of Robe River Iron Associates much support when it stood up to some blackmail several years ago or commending the company recently on a 300-odd per cent productivity increase since that time. I do not remember the National Farmers Federation getting much support over Mudginberri or Dollar Sweets Co. Pty Ltd getting much support from that quarter either. Those are the sorts of areas in which we have made and can make vast productivity increases. Also, as has been mentioned recently, one major company in this country has knocked out 300 bad work practices in the past several months without losing a day's work. I only cite those examples because they are examples of what is possible in Australia if we can get rid of the 'them and us' syndrome. As I said, interest rates have been so high for so long that it is nearly impossible to contemplate profitability at the end of that vast and lengthy experience. We are told that we desperately need more manufacturing exports. I could not agree more. We know only too well that we certainly need more industries that can compete effectively with imports. But given that the burden of servicing our net external debt, expressed as a percentage of exports, is now around 18 per cent and that we need to shift as much as 4 per cent of gross domestic product even to get the balance back, there is not much chance that we are going to stabilise our foreign debt unless we make some radical moves. We have been outlining those radical moves in coalition policy in the last few months. They need to be spelt out again because it is so important that we focus our minds and eyes upon the sorts of changes that are necessary. The coalition has given this Government unprecedented-and, I might say, unappreciated-support in its efforts to get protection down. For example, the Opposition supported the textile yarn bounty capitalisation scheme when that was introduced earlier this year and commended the Government on that move. It was a way of buying out protection, and we approved of it. I hope that the Government has some more schemes by which we can reduce protection and, in fact, put people out into the big wide world where they have to compete effectively and will no longer hold out their hands to government. But we do criticise the growing tendency to introduce obscure positive assistance as though governments can change what we all know to be true-that is, the old adage that governments cannot pick winners. We are now starting to say, 'Okay, we will get rid of regular and recognised industry protection as we have understood it, but we are going to make some new moves: we are going to go and pick some new winners'. I can understand the ostensible concern of the Australian Council of Trade Unions on this matter, because I am sure that the ACTU is not too keen on the Government's policy of general reductions in protection. But in fact, of course, it does not We must resist that push to go out picking winners, because there is no chance that governments have the right policies or the prescience to know the winning manufacturers of the future. The Government has reduced protection at one end of the spectrum, and we agree with that, but it is unfair simply to reduce protection without doing the other things that are necessary-removing the other impediments that are in the way of the international, national and local efficiencies that we need so desperately. While we stick to the centralised wages system and to our grossly inefficient sea, air and land transport systems, while we do not address the problems of the waterfront and leave ourselves so inefficient by comparison with other nations, while we stick to the impediments in the taxation system, while we have compliance costs in taxation that reef out profits and, therefore, employment opportunities from business, and while we have a monopolised telecommunications system, which we still have and will continue to have after these changes, we will not get those efficiencies. The Government has addressed the easy parts of structural reform: lower protection, financial market deregulation, and floating the currency. But what it has not done is address the hard part. It has brought down protection but, as I said before, we believe it is unfair to work only from one end of the spectrum and not to address the other inefficiencies which will stultify that business if they are not addressed in the near future. The coalition's protection cuts, when we make them, will be accompanied by synchronised and complementary_structural reforms. The Industry Commission has estimated that there is $12 billion a year in that alone, not even taking into account the industrial relations efficiencies, which must include tens of billions of dollars of pick-up to national income. We are offering the Australian industry the only chance it has of being in a position to succeed in an increasingly competitive world. No matter what scare tactics the Treasurer (Mr Keating) or others work. might employ, industry knows it.",40
76,Mrs CROSIO,RATES,"ln rising to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No.1) 1990-91, I am certainly different from the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan) because I rise to indicate the strong support and commitment that this Labor Government has for the funding and implementation of much needed structural reforms within our workplaces. Recent surveys of overseas investors point to negative perceptions about our industrial climate and infrastructure as being one of the major fears about continued investment in local manufacturing. I believe that Australian industry has four main tasks ahead if we are going to regain a pre-eminent place as a trading nation. The first of those tasks ahead for tralian business is to become competitive. In an economic sense this means the view and revalidation of many of our tariff and assistance policies. From an inoperate, dustrial perspective it means the efficient implementation of new technology and trial practices, all of which substantially affect our accepted industrial practices. The second of the tasks for Australian industry is to support the continued rethey structuring of our present wage systems and to provide a continuation of a tional basis for wage and salary increases. I believe that current negotiations centrpIcture. ing around accord mark 6 are a positive sign that there is no automatic expectathis tion of wage and salary hikes each year and that there is still some incentive employers and employee groups to sit down and negotiate. It may be a hard lesson to learn, but both groups must tinue to communicate and discuss the fundamental issues of wages and benefits and not automatically seek confrontation as the only path to their goal. Also, these continuing negotiations for wages and benefits should become more flexible their ambit, and at each stage there should be a fundamental reassessment of the ficiency of workplace practices. The third area of focus is on the review of both management and union performance. In the current round of wage negothe tiations many employer groups have been found wanting in their skills and ability to deal effectively with the opportunity presented to them of reassessing workGovernment place efficiency and negotiating industrial practices to become more efficient at workplace level. Employee representatives have also been founding wanting in ability to relate to the need to overhaul our existing practices. Many would accuse them of being overly protectionist of the status quo. Training and education on the both sides of the industrial fence are essary if the terms 'structural efficiency' and 'enterprise level bargaining' are going to become more than merely illusory. The final area of change is, I believe, in the inappropriateness of our existing bargaining and award patterns. For all the talk that has followed the attempts by Ausgovernment and the Industrial Relations reCommission to point parties towards reviewing the ground rules by which they .there has been little real change. Change In the rules governing our indusrelations practices is a pressing requirement that no industry can afford to delay. No longer should employers hide their inefficient practices or lack of management ability behind a system which say they cannot change. No longer is it acceptable that employee groups imrapose economic suicide upon their memb-rs in pursuit of what they call the bigger I now turn to one of many steps that Government has taken to bolster the moves towards industrial restructuring and for fostering moves towards increased workplace efficiency. In the 1990-91 Budget conover $11 m has been allocated to the workplace reform program, which is designed to assist and encourage our industries to improve their productivity and their effectiveness. The program does this by funding and providing resources to alin low employers and unions to adopt work and management practices more in tune efwith improved international competitiveness. As I have pointed out previously, without fundamental changes to the style and substance of practices within our workplaces, we have little hope of remaining competitive and improving the standard of living of every Australian. The long ago realised that the hub of Australian business-the small and the medium sized operators-would not necessarily have the in-house skills or finantheir cial resources to undertake the reassessment of their practices. To this end a national network of workplace resource centres was set up in 1989-90 with specific aim of assisting all enterprises necto adopt new technologies, review career structures, re-evaluate work organisation and, particularly, to develop strategic industrial planning. In the western suburbs of Sydney a workplace resource centre has been established in Parramatta. This centre is staffed by experts in the field and they have provided valuable advice to a number of medium and large companies in the Sydney metropolitan area. My only concern has been that until now very few of the smaller enterprises have taken advantage of its services. Although the returns from structural efficiency improvements may take some time to realise, they are nevertheless real and vital to our ongoing goal of trade improvement. One other aspect of the workplace resource centres that I believe is encouraging is the fact that after an initial capital injection it is intended that become selffunding. I believe that by establishing a degree of autonomy from government funding they can continue to provide the best advice available and develop a responsi ve approach to the needs of the wider business community. I understand that the workplace resource centre at Parramatta, for example, is well progressed towards self-funding and many other centres are in a similar position. The path towards a more efficient and productive workplace will not be easy for the companies that embark on the transformation of their businesses. Not only is it hoped that the maze of the Australian industrial award system could be simplified, but it is also an aim of the workplace reformer to provide increased levels of training to allow true multiskilling and improved career prospects. An excellent example of what can be achieved through consultation and communication is the similar work of structural efficiency undertaken by the Metal Trades Industry Association and the relevant employee representatives. This consultative process has produced, amongst other things, a well accepted method for all metal industry employers to assess and implement change. I would, however, point out that as small and medium sized employers are still reluctant to embark on the program at this stage, when any business decides to embark upon a program to improve its workplace efficiency there will probably be an initial financial burden, for example, to provide training and training resources, consultancy services, et cetera. The Government has realised that this financial burden may be a disincentive to structural change in many enterprises. To assist any company in implementing such training and development, over 50 structural change projects are supported financially by this Government's workplace change assistance scheme. Finally, I raise the issue of lack of awareness and expertise of many employers and employee representatives and how it has now been addressed by the workplace change training scheme. The scheme has provided and will continue to provide training programs for all parties involved in implementing workplace reform projects. Established initially in Victoria, we now have them in New South Wales and Western Australia, but it is hoped that later on they will be Australia-wide. It is understood that technical and further education colleges will also be offering courses for interested parties in many of our States. In conclusion, I believe this Government can be justifiably proud of the focus it has put in place to reform Australia's industrial structure. The ball is now, I believe, in the court of the Australian workers and Australian management to see that these initiatives are not only acted upon but also put in the workplace. I commend this section of the Budget Bill to the House.",41
77,Mr MACKELLAR,RATES,"Warringah) (4.41)On 11 September in the Budget debate on Appropriation Bill (No.1), I examined the Government's budgetary provisions for financial assistance to manufacturing industry and particularly its specific industry policies. At that stage my general conclusion was that the Government's financial assistance in support of specific industry policies had failed to achieve its stated objectives. To back up my claims, I cited Senator Button's statement of 10 July last year that he had got wrong the industry policies and did not know where to go-a very honest statement, like a number of Senator Button's statements. Mr Chaney-We tried to tell him where to go, but unfortunately he took no notice. . Mr MACKELLAR-Unfortunately, the Government took no notice. My speech gave particular attention to the steel industry. In this specific case study, I concluded that the Government's· steel industry plan had been only partially successful in putting the domestic industry onto an internationally competitive and viable footing. Four specific pieces of dence supported that conclusion. First, the steel plan had a productivity target of 350 tonnes per employee per annum, yet at December 1988 when the plan concluded the best that had been achieved was 294 tonnes per employee per annum, and that had been in 1985. At that time, a large number of overseas producers were achieving 370 to 390 tonnes. Second, there was considerable evidence to suggest that, while the capital investment program of Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd (BHP) had been substantially lifted through the 1980s it was barely sufficient to maintain its' existing capital stock. Third, the failure of the Government's steel industry plan to achieve industrial harmony was, to quote the Steel Industry Authority, because of a 'lack of union support to the plan's commitments'. Fourth, while much was being made of BHP's export performance, the evidence is that this is a recent phenomenon due almost entirely to surplus production coming available from a slump in domestic demand. On 13 September, after I made that speech, BHP's chief executive, John Prescott, issued a news release saying that I 'had mounted an ill-informed and unwarranted attack on the steel industry' and that he could not understand how I could get my facts so wrong. Since almost all the data that I quoted was taken from the Steel Industry Authority's annual reports and its 1988 report of the industry, I can  concern about the accuracy of the Steel Industry Authority's facts. To support his case that I am ill-informed, Mr - rescott cites not the Steel Industry Authority report, but an Economic Planning Advisory Council discussion paper titled BHP Steel in the 1990's. He suggested that I should read - t, so I got hold of it and-surprise, surpnse-I found that it was written by Mr John Prescott. This is a 19-page document of analysis and I have to say having read it, that it does not comp-re at all in thoroughness with the Steel Authority's 197-page review report. I think it is little more than an expression of what BHP hopes to achieve in the 1990s. But eviI do not want to make cheap points about  other responses in his news release.  'more viable now than it had been in early 1980', and I accept that, bu't. his comment does not address the real issue as to whether it has achieved interna!ional standards of viability. On capital  release that BHP had spent more than $2.5 billion on investments since 1983. !hat is .a l-t of money; it sounds a very ImpreSSIve Investment program until one considers that the Bureau of Industry Economics estimated in 1988 that BHP needed to spend. $400m per year just to maintain its capital stock. I do not know whether that is correct or not, but that is what the Bureau of Industry Economics estimated. If it is correct, BHP's minimum capital expenditure requirements between 1983 and mid-1990 were of the order of $3 billion just to keep up.  lease states that BHP is presently achieving 350 tonnesper employee per annum. That is what his press release states. However, he is quoted in the Australian newspaper of 8 October this year as saying that BHP's productivity had reached 380 tonnes. That statement was made within two weeks of his first statement. I would like to know which is correct but, more to the point, how does this compare with - he internatiC?nal productivity improvements? That IS the real gravamen of the issue: How do we compare internationally? Are we making real gains?  release makes much of BHP's export achievements, but he is unfortunately silent on my cl,\ims that those achievements are simply a response to recent production surpluses and that they have probably been achieved at prices that will seriously erode present profit levels. Rather than just saying that, let me offer some facts. The Australian Bureau of Statistics advises that exports of iron and steel in 1986-87 were $590.8m; in 198788, $506.8m; in 1988-89, $498m; and 1989-90, $710.6m. Those facts speak for themselves. When domestic demand was booming over the period 1986 to 1989 expOrts actually declined. With a domestic slump taking effect in 1989-90, surplus production was channelled into exports. I do not know whether one could really argue that that is the record of a committed long term exporter. On 20 September, the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean), who is at the table, answered a question without notice from the honourable member for Grey (Mr O'Neil) about the asserted poor performance of the steel industry. He got stuck into me in the House. I understand that. I think that much of what he said can be ignored for what it was. It was a placebo for the constituency of the honourable member for Grey. However, the Minister stated in that answer that productivity was at 400 tonnes per employee. What do we have? A week prior to that, the chief executive of BHP said that it was 350 tonnes; the Minister then  cott was again quoted as saying it was 380 tonnes. So we had three different versions of the position within four weeks. Somebody is wrong. Somebody is not giving us the correct position. I am not suggesting for a moment that the Minister would deliberately mislead the Parliament or that he does not have the facts at his fingertips, but I really wish he would sort out with his contact in BHP what is correct.  Minister is the matter of customer service. What really started me off on this was the 1988 Steel Industry Authority report. It contained 14 pages of evidence and comment which was critical of BHP. I quote from page 106 of the report which states: In addition to Palmer Tube Mills, Overall Forge, Hills Industries and ATM, Bunge Industrial Steels, Uncle Ben's of Australia, the MBPMA, FCAI and Tubemakers were critical of BHP's delivery performance. On the same page, just a little bit further down, it states: The problem facing Australian steel users does not only involve lengthy delivery schedules but often sudden and unplanned changes thereto. The Automotive Industry Authority for example said that 'BHP not only fails to deliver on schedule but it often does not even advise customers that it cannot deliver on schedule.' That is pretty damning stuff from the Steel Industry Authority. I wonder whether those «ustomers are now receiving satisfactory price, quality and supply servicing from BHP. I do not know what the up to-date position is because that is a 1988 report and nothing more recently publicly available would allow me to set aside some of the worries that I have in relation to BHP's performance. In the first speech, I wanted to show that outlays by successive Hawke governments on direct financial assistance to specific manufacturing industry sectors had failed to achieve operational standards sufficient to make them internationally competitive and viable. I have heard nothing from either the Chief Executive of BHP or the Miriister at the table to reassure me that this Government has yet faced up to that appalling statement by Senator Button-his admission on 10 July last year. I have no wish to take on BHP or criticise it unnecessarily. I hope that, with the resources that BHP has at its disposal, it will get in touch with me rather than issuing press releases saying that I am misinformed when what I am quoting is the Steel Industry Authority. I hope that we can sort this out, because it is important to Australia. Nothing that I have seen or been able to find or read leads me to move away from the position that the Minister  gether and that we should have a more up to date illustration of the actual performance of BHP and of the Government in supporting the manufacturing sector.",43
78,Mr LINDSAY,RATES,"The industry, technology and commerce portfolio is one of the most important departments of the Federal Government. It wide ranging in scope and it carries the great responsibility of developing and plementing efficient policies to enhance Australian industry. I, therefore, address some brief remarks to an issue which, although not a direct component of the portfolio, bears direct relevance to the success of the portfolio. That issue is award restructuring. It cannot be overdone emphasised that the Federal Government places tremendous importance on award restructuring and has embarked industry on the most far reaching restructuring program in Australia's history. Even my own electorate, one year ago this month more than 100 people attended seminar in Townsville on award restrucson) turing. It was the first such seminar held in north Queensland to explain award structuring processes-a major force in making Australian industry more competfacturers itive, capable of generating long term economic growth and expanding oppornors, tunities for individual workers. I notice that the shadow Minister for proposal the environment, the honourable for Pearce (Mr Chaney) is sitting at table. He has had some experience in area. The Liberal and National parties their Economic Action Plan attempted to paint the structural transformation taking place in Australia as a myth. They do out of sheer frustration because they would be incapable of attaining the results achieved by this Labor Government. Speaking at the seventeenth annual vention of the Industrial Relations SociwallT ety of Western Australia. I hope that the shadow Minister is listening to this-on 9 October 1987 the Chairman of MIM Holdings, Sir Bruce Watson, said: Enterprise Industrial Relations is achievable it is a long term goal. The course of change industrial relations must be one of controlled evolution, not revolution. Changes must directed towards recognisable goals and must low for the participants in industrial relations, from the company and union executives down to the workers on the shop floor, to learn new and to develop positive and cooperative attitudes Lachlan), and trust. The Liberal and National parties refuse to admit that this Labor Government has achieved much with award restructuring. is Industry policy now centres on building competitive strength in manufacturing acimtivities, encouraging new technology-based industries of world standard and increasing industry's export capability. The Liberal and National parties have learned little from the failings of the Fraser years. Their industry policy would lead to confrontation. In a world where everything is strictly by the textbook, they would apply economic prescriptions that have long been discredited. The Liberal and National parties would have us turn back the clock to the beginning of the 1980s in when the future of manufacturing industry was on shaky ground. Where would a the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewand the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) have indusretry in another 10 years? It would not be in a very happy position as far as manuare concerned. The economics writer for the Canberra Times, Tom Conreported on 12 July 1990: . .. manufacturers have rejected outright the that Australia phase out all tariff protecmember tion by the year 2000. the But the Opposition spokesman on industhis try and commerce, who is not in the in chamber, has promised that the Opposition would remove all tariff protection by ,the end of this century. When pressed by so Kerry O'Brien in his Lateline program on Australian Broadcasting Corporation television on 5 September 1990, in answer to the question, 'And you acknowledge conthat some businesses would go to the he said, 'I think some businesses will be in trouble'. Imagine the apprehension felt by small operators in the textile, clothing and footwear industries and all of their employees. Imagine the apprehenbut sion felt by businesses in north Queensin land and Townsville facing that sort of policy. What prospects will they have by be the end of the 1990s? Very few, if left to althe likes of the Leader of the Opposition, the Leader of the National Party, and the skills honurable member for Barker (Mr McThe motor car industry will be a major target of the Liberal and National Party policies. The Age newspaper of 12 June 1990 published a warning by Dr David Charles, head of the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce. Dr Charles, the article said, warned that local car prices would not fall substantially even if tariffs on imported cars were removed. Loss of tariff revenue of $440m a year raised from imported motor vehicles would need to be offset from other sources, possibly including higher sales tax on vehicles. Car impprts would rise substantially, putting pressure on the balance of payments and requiring devaluation of the dollar-which would all raise import prices. Taxpayers would have to bear the burden of increasing unemployment benefitsassociated with the loss of car industry jobs. I would like to hear the shadow Minister for the environment speak in this debate about the policy of the Liberal and National parties with regard to some of these very important issues. To add to the potential long term woes of Australian industry, the Liberal-National Party policy leaves a grave degree of doubt about how it regards specific industry and technology assistance programs. These schemes are essential to the encouragement of Australian exporters in their quest to develop international markets. The Liberal and National parties have given no guarantees of their commitment to the long term future of the export market development grants scheme (EMDGS) and similar schemes. The EMDGS supported over 3,000 Australian exporters with grants last year and they, in turn, contributed over $6 billion to Australia's earnings. Estimated expenditure on the export market development grants scheme this financial year, as reported in the explanatory notes, is about $131m. Uncertainty would also hang over the future of other proven Government incentive programs such as the innovative agricultural marketing scheme and the 150 per cent research and development tax incentive. What of the Liberal and National parties' desire to repeal the capital gains tax and replace it with a sliding scale speculative gains tax? I ask the shadow Minister at the table for his response in respect of these matters. I know what it would be. It would be a return to the bad old days of the tax rip-off and a complete retreat from the broadening of the income tax base achieved by this Labor Government in order to improve the fairness of the tax system. Investment in unproductive, speculative areas would be encouraged in preference to investment in productive businesses which employ income-producing workers. This portfolio has been described elsewhere as the power-house of the Australian economy. It has the primary aim of increasing productivity and capital growth, particularly through exports. Exports of manufactured goods grew strongly in the latter half of the 1980s and the share of manufactured goods, in total exports, has increased at a real average annual growth rate of 8 per cent over the five years since 1985. Manufactures is the growing sector of world trade and the Australian manufacturing sector must become increasingly export oriented. This Labor Government is encouraging direct investment abroad by Australians in support of exports. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, total exports of manufactured goods increased considerably last year: To the end of June 1989, manufacturing exports totalled $24 billion. By the year ended 1990, they had increased to $27 billion. Manufacturing in this instance includes food and beverages, textiles, clothing, footwear, basic metal and wood products and furniture, among other items-a vast array of items. The manufacturing sector is a large employer of labour and it must continue to prosper by creating greater export-related employment. This Labor Government's commitment to supportive policies and assistance programs will encourage specialisation and an internationally competitive manufacturing sector. The Liberal and National parties offer no such support. Rather, they offer doom and gloom and few prospects of survival for smaller manufacturers towards the year 2000 and beyond. Job opportunities, export growth and our balance of payments would face ever increasing obstacles, and so would the future prosperity of this nation.",45
79,Mr CHARLES,RATES,"I rise to address Budget allocations to the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce and the Department of Industrial Relations. It is interesting that the Budget allocations for Industrial Relations has increased by some 12 per cent on last year's actual expenditure but the budget for the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce, which I note includes the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), has increased only by an amount equal to expected inflation, so that by the time the financial year is over industry programs will no doubt experience real cuts in expenditure. Another interesting fact is that the total expenditure allocation for both activities equals some $1. 6 35 billion, but that receipts expected for customs and excise duty are in the order of $13.5 billion. So, expenditure on research, industry and industrial relations programs equals some 12 per cent of our income from customs and excise. The balance of customs and excise feeds Consolidated Revenue. All of us know, or we should know, that customs and excise receipts are inefficient taxation revenue items because they are ultimately paid for by individuals in higher prices which are used to support inefficient industry and inappropriate work practices. There is, of course, to protectionism in a free economy, except as a means of supporting domestic producers who are inefficient in world terms. That practice, which we could afford in times now gone when Australia had a positive balance of payments position, is no longer appropriate. We truly can no longer afford to support the internal production of goods and services which are not competitive on the world market. I challenge the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall) to take up tariff reduction in conjunction with real labour market reforms and challenge Australian industry to become more productive and more competitive. The Budget allocation for industry, technology and commerce includes cuts in expenditure for the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, the Australian Trade Commission, the Automotive Industry Authority and the National Standards Commission. The budget for CSIRO, our premier scientific research organisation, which is truly world class and which is critical to our development of advanced technology, has a static Budget outlay. It is interesting to note that the AntiDumping Authority has a total Budget allocation of $843,600. If we are going to reduce tariffs unilaterally, it is my belief that we will need major expenditure infusions in our anti-dumping facility to protect our productive industry against industries in other countries flooding our shores with their excess capacity at inappropriate prices. I am told that European cheeses can be bought more cheaply at an Australian delicatessen than in the street markets in the country of origin. It is also interesting to note that the CSIRO kraft mill pulp research project is allocated $1.4m in funding for 1990-91. I would hesitate to guess how many tens of millions of dollars the Wesley Vale pulp mill fiasco has cost the State of Tasmania, industry and this nation. It is absolutely ludicrous that there is still no policy in place which would encourage industry to build a new pulp mill, together with paper making facilities, and that our research expenditure in this most important area no real logic is truly insignificant. I also note with interest that the small business program has a budget allocation of $500,000. Considering the recommendations of the Beddall report on small business in Australia-and I note that the Minister has left the chamber-and the urgent need for small business to make us more productive, the amount truly seems· minuscule. As I indicated earlier, the budget for the Department of Industrial Relations is up some 12 per cent for this financial year. I am not sure why we have a Department of Industrial Relations, and it is my view that we should be moving heaven and earth to get industrial relations out of government business, except where it relates to government departments. We spend unbelievable time, effort and money in Australia regulating, controlling and discussing industrial relations issues at a national and State level. Surely we could leave it to individual workers and individual employers to sort out at a company or enterprise level. We have this giant, inflexible and centralised bureaucratic system which in theory is designed to see that neither employees nor employers are ripped off but in practice acts as the greatest deterrent to effective competition and effective competitive production as exists in our nation. Surely it must be a joke that we are going to spend. $ 72m this year to 'maintain smooth industrial relations in the coal mining and stevedoring industries by ensuring effective administration of the relevant legislation'. Honest to goodness, if that is not a joke I have never heard one. The second joke in this portion of the Budget is not really funny, it is sick: $9.5m is allocated to the Trade Union Training Authority to 'assist in the overall development of skills and knowledge within the trade union membership, enabling union position holders to effectively perform their functions, as well as handle significant changes in their union's environment and to fulfil their role in Australia's industrial system'. Why only $9.5m? Why not $95m, or $950m, or $9.5 billion? Surely it is not the amount that is at stake, but the issue. I have noted no similar Budget allocation in any of the papers to assist pigeon handlers to effectively perform their functions in making sure the pigeons are released on time and fed on their return. Perhaps we should also consider a similar program for left-handed shearers with three toes on their right foot. Perhaps it would be appropriate for the Minister to consider using this Budget allocation, which is for training, for the development of a starter program to train management, unions and perhaps even individual workers on how to go about negotiating terms and conditions such as wages and working hours. In Australia the bargaining unit for most terms and conditions of employment has shifted to the award and the national level to an extent that is almost unique in the world. I contend that if that uniqueness were positive, if it had helped make our industry competitive and profitable and had assured our people of jobs and careers and had produced an employee profit share that gave us a sustained and high standard of living, we would indeed have no reason to debate or discuss our centralised industrial relations mechanism. But the fact is that our unique system has not worked. We are no longer a wealthy nation; we are a major world debtor. We no longer enjoy a uniformly high s-andard of living, and job opportunities are falling like tenpins. I note that the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) asks what prospects we have in the 1990s. I say to the honourable gentleman that, under the continuation of this Government and its policies, we have no prospects. But thank goodness the coalition will form government in the early 1990s and lead us onward, because our unique system is uniquely sick and in urgent need of major surgery.",48
80,Mr CHANEY,RATES,"It was not my intention to take part in this particular part of the Appropriation Bill debate but, since I had interjected on the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) and he had invited me to enter it, I felt I should do so, in fairness to him. I was particularly interested in the comments made by the honourable member for Herbert because they seemed to me to typify what is wrong with debate in this place. It was a most interesting contribution on what a future coalition government might do and what impact it might have on industry, but there was not a word of acknowledgment in the speech about the absolutely perilous position of literally tens of thousands of Australians who are involved in industry and manufacturing in the current economic conditions that have been produced by the Government which he supports. I suppose it was something of a sign of despair that we heard nothing about the reasons why so many people in industry are currently going broke, closing down and losing-in many cases-the results of their life's work. The present Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) has enjoyed an extraordinary level of support, including from the Opposition, for much of the last seven to eight years-and for a good deal of that period I shadowed him as the Opposition spokesman on industry, technology and commerce. I believe that it is really quite pointless to have a series of industry policy initiatives of the sort which have been fostered by him which simply operate within a totally inappropriate economic framework. It is also pointless to suggest that Australian industry should be world competitive, when we have interest rate arrangements which are so far away from being world competitive as to be a joke; when we have tax regimes which are not world competitive; when we have an industrial relations system which is certainly not world competitive and which simply does not permit-whatever might have been said by the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio), who took part in the debate earlier today-a rate ·of change which makes us competitive with the rest of the world; and when we have a transport system which does not permit us to be competitive. Let me take a manufacturing example: a manufacturer of heavy equipment sold a piece of equipment from Sydney to Adelaide and his transport costs to Adelaide were twice the transport costs from Sweden. That manufacturer in Australia was very proud of the fact that he got the contract against his parent company in Sweden, but he had a cost impost of something like twice the transport costs. It cost twice as much to take the equipment from Sydney to Adelaide as from Sweden to Adelaide. We have a communications system which is lamentably uncompetitive; and we now have people dealing with bad debts and declining demand. When I hear the sort of speech that I heard from the honourable member for Herbert, I feel sorry that he devoted so much time attacking what damage might be done by a future coalition government and so little time attending to the fact that Australia has simply failed to live up to the challenges that the 1980s have presented to us. I thought that Professor Helen Hughes had said just about everything that needed to be said when she published an article a year or two ago entitled Too Little, Too Late. We in Australia are very good at saying how much better we are now than we were last year. We are absolutely hopeless at looking at the international competition and explaining why we are so inadequate.",49
81,Mr MCARTHUR,RATES," Mr Deputy Chairman, I would like to refer to the matters in the Budget Papers in relation to specific assistance to manufacturing, and I refer particularly to textiles, clothing and footwear, shipbuilding, paper and printing, printing machinery, industrial machinery, aerospace information, steel and heavy engineering, autos, and photographic and film equipment. In the Budget Papers, the amount allocated is $239m. This does not reflect the true picture of the tariff assistance that is given to those particular industries. The real picture and the real problem facing Australia, as clearly identified by the Industries Assistance Commission report 1988-89, is the assistance to the clothing and footwear industry of $1.7 billion and to the transport equipment area-which is basically motor cars-of $1. 5 billion, thus identifying this great level of assistance. In the Industries Assistance Commission report this assistance is identified as being: Consumer tax equivalent is the transfer from the final consumers paying higher prices due to assistance. This is a very reliable guide to that ongoing debate on tariff assistance to those particular industries and the massive hidden costs that have been passed on to consumers. I raise the particular issue because of the ongoing problems that are identified in the Geelong plant of the Ford Motor Company of Australia Ltd where 5,000 persons are employed. Ford is the major employer in the Geelong region and, of course, because of its involvement in the motor car industry, there are a number of associated industries in the Geelong area dependent upon the Ford manufacturing operation. The coalition, as all honourable members would be aware, is committed to a negligible tariff situation by the year 2000 but, unlike the Government, it is committed to a package of micro-economic reforms with particular emphasis on industrial relations. Earlier in the debate, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) gave a very good outline of our position and our determination to bring about change in the area of voluntary agreements, enterprise bargaining, introducing a more positive and productive attitude at the workplace, changing the attitudes as between management and the work force, and making sure that manufacturing industry can bring about changes in industrial relations so that it can become competitive on a world basis. Massive changes have taken place around the world and, in the early 1980s, the motor car industry realised that it too had to make some changes. We, in the coalition, will also introduce reforms on the waterfront. The honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney) referred to the particular example of the shipping costs that one manufacturer had to impose upon his final costing. In transport, telecommunications and tax, the coalition is totally committed to bringing about changes, along with its commitment to reduce the level of tariffs by the year 2000. The present situation under the current Button car plan, which ends in 1992, was outlined in an article in the Australian Financial Review. It said: . . . local car producers will still be protected by a 35 per cent tariff on imported passenger vehicles, more than three times the manufacturing average. Accounting for its special additional tection, the industry will enjoy an effective rate of assistance of 86 per cent-a big fall from the 250 per cent effective rate of assistance in 1985 but still more than six times the projected manufacturing average. The major problem facing our motor car industry is one of efficiency when compared with manufacturers in other industrialised countries. For instance, it takes 40 hours to build a car here in Australia, whereas in Japan it takes 17 hours and there is a possibility of this reducing to 11 hours per vehicle. The Australian motor car industry has about 14 per cent automation, whereas the figure is about 30 per cent around the world. This gives a clear indication of the difficulties we face in our automotive industry. In a capital-intensive industry, the five car assemblers here in Australia work on one-day shifts, whereas around the world the industry norm is for two shifts utilising that capital plant to its best advantage. I quote a comparison that I have come across, again in an article in the Australian Financial Review, which indicates where we sit on the world totem pole: . . . evidence of management efficiency comes from the International Motor Vehicle Program survey conducted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Among other things, this survey rated management practices in assembly plants on the grounds of factory practice (largely inventory control), work systems (the degree of worker involvement, multi-skilling and team work) and human relations management (recruitment remuneration and status). On the MIT's index of management performance, Australian car plants rated lastbehind (in order) European plants, American-owned plants in North America, newly industrialised country plants, Japanese-owned plants in North America and Japanese plants in Japan. We can see that on an independent survey our position in automobile manufacturing operations did not stand up too well compared with our competitors in other parts of the world who had addressed the problems of industrial relations and micro-economic reform over the last 15 years to get their industry into a world competitive situation. There is concern in my home area of Geelong because of the Industry Commispro- sion's recommendations. I have received representations from the Geelong Chamber of Commerce about the effects on employment in the Geelong region. It is concerned about the major recommendation of the Industry Commission. I put the effect as the Industry Commission put it forward: While it is impossible to be precise, projections using the ORANI model of the Australian economy suggest that, unless the industry boosts its productive performance, a contraction of between 20 and 40 per cent in its output is likely as a result of implementing the Industry Commission's recommendations. It is quite clear and l.1P-front about the problem facing the automobile industry, just as I have been in suggesting that efficiency and productivity must increase. However, the statement goes on to point out that there could be problems in the Geelong area because of our dependence on the Ford plant in providing up to 5,000 jobs. Again, it is said in relation to the Industry Commission's report: ""Only in Geelong does the automotive workforce account for a major proportion of the total employment' but that the I.e. 'considers that these figures suggest that no region would suffer unmanageable disruption from the implementation of its proposals' although 'there will obviously some lumpiness in the adjustment process. I suggest to the House that even at the Geelong plant there will need to be changes. Members of management and members of the work force will have to change their techniques and their approach so that the manufacturing operation can remain at Geelong, where there is a stable work force. There are some natural advantages in being located in Geelong and it is important for the local community that that operation remain there. There have been some quite dramatic changes in terms of the newer techniques and newer production approaches that have been implemented in that plant over the last five years. Hopefully, further investments of capital will make sure that that Geelong plant remains on a world competitive basis. It has on notice our position in the coalition that we will be reducing tariffs over the. next 10 years, as will the Government, although we will introduce other reforms which hopefully the Ford Motor Co. will take on board and implement at the shop floor level so that it can make sure that its performance is improved and the industry remains viable in the Geelong region. I will be putting these reasonable proposals to the local Chamber of Commerce and other interested bodies because there is very strong feeling in the Geelong area. They depend upon these employment opportunities, especially in view of the collapse of the Pyramid Building Society and of other industries, such as the wool industry, which are impacting on the Geelong region at this moment.",50
82,Mr CREAN,RATES,"I wish to address some of the issues that have been raised in the debate. They do overlap and that is why these two areas have been taken together. I think it is important to understand that the strategy the Government has been developing over the past 7 111 years and which it is continuing in this Budget is to try to ensure that this country increasingly becomes competitive. The one thing that we do agree about be in this House is that if Australia is to ' salvage its balance of payments difficulties it is necessary for us to become a more competitive nation. That is really what the debate should be about. It should not be, in the context of industry policy, as the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan) would have us believe, that it is a debate about picking winners and level playing fields. In the final analysis it is about the strategy that will make us a more competitive nation. If it means that we have to give particular assistance from time to time to certain industries, based upon ensuring that that competitiveness occurs, then that is something the Government will look at from time to time. . Let me argue the point about competitiveness. I think it is important to understand from two important dimensions what the Government has been trying to set in place to make us a more competitive nation. A lot of debate in this section of the Budget appropriation has dealt with the labour market, and in particular from the other side of the House as to what our policies are in terms of industrial. relations. I think it is important to understand where we come from in terms of labour market reforms. Over the past 71f2 years this Government has changed industrial relations from a reactive discipline in which the focus of attention was on how we solved messes, disputes, once they had happened, to a pro-active role in which we have tried to develop a positive approach by which labour market policies can be used to actually drive the economy in the direction of competitiveness. In the processes of succeeding in that we have witnessed the most dramatic and sustained drop in the level of industrial disputes that this country. has ever seen. I make the point that where we took a pro-active role rather than the traditio-al reactive one, as those on the other slde would have, we have succeeded far more than they ever did in getting down the level of industrial disputes. We have focused on getting labour market reform, ensuring that wages policy works in the overall interests of the fiscal and monetary policy settings of the Government, but at the same time driving reform at the micro-;or enterprise level of the economy. As for the macro settings, the record stands. The Budget forecast on every occasion in the past seven years-and I predict that it will be delivered again in this current setting-has been delivered. In other words, for the first time and in a period other than recession, where the discipline of the market has meant that wages outcomes have been kept down, we have been able to deliver non-inflationary wages growth on every occasion in the context of a very buoyant domestic economy. That was never capable of being achieved by those on the other side because they had a fundamentally different approach to industrial relations. That is the reason why one must still have that framework of a national, central perspective, not as the be-all and end-all of the totality of the industrial relations system in this country, but as a recognition that unless one controls wages policy. in a growth economy, one cannot control much else. This Government has delivered that control on wages consistently and will continue to do so because it has the right approach to its industrial relations p,Olicy. More than that, what we have seen over the last couple of years is the continued emphasis, the growing emphasis, on the micro dimension of the industrial relations agenda. We are the only government in a structured sense that has been able to produce a link between wages and productivity increases-actually driving efficiency in the workplace by ensuring that the wage increases and the entitlemems to wage increases carry, as a consequence of them, the addressing of issues of work organisation, skill formation, training, et cetera. It is important to understand the framework in the overall setting. It is true that the implementation has to be a micro or enterprise focus, because the people who do know best about how to get better output, how to get productivity up, how to rearrange work organisation, are the people on the floor, not governments or industrial relations commissions. It is that direction, that linkage to productivity, that encouragement to link wage entitlements, wage outcomes, to reform in the labour market, that has to be balanced against the national perspective. All I am saying is that this Government is the only one in the history of this country that has been able to get that balance between the national requirements-:the national· objectives, the national imperative-of managing wages in a growth economy, and the micro dimension. That is something that has to be encouraged. It was enterprise negotiations within a framework that ensured that we did not have the wages breakout one or two years ago that would have happened, having regard to the history of this country. As recently as 1981-82 the previous Government tried to manage it, failed and was turfed out of office as a consequence. Its only suggestion at the time was to freeze wages. At the time, probably, if we are honest about it, that had some popular support because of the dire straits into which the previous Government bad driven the economy. The previous Government failed, not because people did not support its wages freeze but because it had no solution to come out of the freeze. People had to turn to us to give them that solution. Because that solution was the correct one is the basic reason why we are still here 71f2 years later, and still will be after the next election. Our labour market reforms are about improving competitiveness and ensuring efficiency and increases in productivity. The other area of this overlap relates our concentration on innovation as a means of driving competitiveness. I think it is important to reflect on what this Budget does in that regard, because do see a basic necessity for this country to lift its game, not so much in discoverlished ing things but in better commercialising claims them. We do see the fundamental necesreport sity to continue to foster research in country because growth economies in the future, and countries that will succeed, are those that are going to be better able ings. to carve out new, innovative markets based on a competitive edge through innovation and research. That is why in this Budget, despite what is being said about the Budget allocations to the industry, technology and commerce portfolio, research and science funding received a 2.3 per cent real increase. I happy to show the figures to the honourbution. able member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) if he has any doubts because he glibly passed over the fact and said that all there was was some sort of maintenance of funding in this area. There is a 2.3 cent real increase against total Budget outlays of 0.6 per cent. Therefore, there is a significant recognition in this portfoyears. lio that research is a key and that we are going to continue to foster it. I think that is very important to understand. Another limb is the new emphasis that this Government has placed upon better commercialisation-upon getting better outcomes of that research. That is what the cooperative research centres program announced in this Budget is all about. The first allocation is only $4m but first 15 of the 50 cooperative research centres effectively will not be funded until the last quarter of this financial year. There is a strong commitment of $100m it of new funding in coming years, angoing nounced during the election campaign and confirmed in the Budget, to concentrate on commercialising our innovative capacture ity. That must be seen as an important strategic development in industry policy. The other area that I think is important for Opposition members to understandto and I answered a question about this last week-is the issue of the environment. As we try to develop resources in this country, of course, the issues of the environwe ment and sustainable development will arise. Again, this Government has estaba process by which the competing can be addressed. The sustainable development committees are required to to the Government by October next this year, with an interdepartmental committee process in the meantime to deal with any issues that arise prior to those findThe final area that I want to touch on is the question of the sectoral responses. There are a number of initiatives in the Budget Papers that continue to give support to certain sectors. I commence by referring to the bounty capitalisation exhas ercise because the honourable member for am Barker made reference to it in his contriHe welcomed it because he said that what it was doing was buying out protection. To some extent that is true; that is what the bounty capitalisation did. It saved the Government money by bringper ing forward the cost this year to what would have had to have been borne in certain circumstances over the next five But the reality is that it went much further than that. What it did, as part of the requirement to obtain the benefit of capitalising the bounty, was to get a commitment from Dupont to commit to significant investment in this country in leading edge technology and in further research and development, and to commit to investment in machinery and equipthe ment that would provide the basis for export growth. In other words, I think it is important to understand that it is not just a question of buying out protection; is a case of strategically trying to get us as a nation in areas in which we have basic strengths by getting growth out of net exports and by fostering expendion research and development by recognising that it is a key to industry development. It is not the only sector in which that strategy is applied. The partnerships for development program has the same strategic thinking behind it-a preparedness to waive offsets commitments that companies were required to undertake previously, whereby they had to produce a certain amount of their output in Australia, if the companies in the partnership are prepared to commit themselves to export growth and increased expenditure in research and development. The strategy is again there. It is not simply a strategy that says, 'Let us produce something in Australia' and which gets us into ridiculous circumstances like the leather covers for portable telephones being counted as part of the Australian contribution. It is not just about those fixes; it is about a strategic approach aimed at growth for net exports and getting a company-and a multinational company at that-to make sure it puts some more money into research and development in this country. That is important in the context of multinational companies that in the past have tended to put their research activities back into their home bases. In areas in which we have strengths as a nation-information technology, software development, software maintenance, telecommunicationswe are now starting to see a preparedness by multinationals to commit to research and development here not because they have to but because it is good business for them to do it because we have those strengths. It is important for honourable members on the other side of this chamber to understand that direction so far as our industry policy is concerned. The same applies in pharmaceuticals-for example, the factor (1) proposal-where companies can in certain circumstances recoup higher prices in circumstances in which they commit to production, research and development and export growth in this country. The final area that I want to touch on is opportune, Mr Deputy Chairman, because you raised this issue in the debate earlier. It relates to the steel industry. You took issue with some of the things that I said in response to a question last week and with the fact that there was some inconsistency with what Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd (BHP) was saying. Your argument basically boils down to the fact that the steel industry has not done as well as it should have done. Let me put that into perspective. The basic problem with your analysis is that the information you rely upon goes only as far as 1988. I think you conceded in your submission that your information was not updated from that. Let me just remind the Committee that when this Government came to power the future facing the steel industry was effective closure. Whyalla was about to be closed and either Newcastle or Port Kembla could have been closed. That was the circumstance facing the steel industry in 1983. The Government, when it came to power, developed a steel plan that was to run for five years and then go out of existence on the basis that at the end of that time the industry in its own right would be on a solid footing for growth without any need for continuing assistance. The plan finished in 1988 because it was so successful we did not need a subsequent plan. The strategy of that plan was to get the industry competitive, to get a continuing proportion of its growth off exports and to get it to diversify into different market opportunities. A number of relevant statistics are important in that regard. OVer the life of the steel industry plan BHP spent almost $2 billion in the five years from 1983 to 1988. It has since spent another half a billion dollars and I am reliably informed that it is in the process of committing up to another $1 billion. In any event, the relevance of those figures lies in their comparison with those for the re$t of the world, as the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney) has drawn to our attention from time to time. Against that test, the expenditure that has been undertaken to date-and I am reliably informed that there is more to comerepresented the largest capital expenditure program on a per tonne of installed capacity basis of any developed steel-making country. That is the investment side. In terms of achieving efficiency in the industry, Australia is now the third lowest cost producer in the world. The figure for productivity, on the basis of my Department's information, is 400 tonnes per employee per year. When BHP quoted 350 tonnes per employee per year, as you have indicated, Mr Deputy Chairman, it may have been referring to an earlier year associated with the end of the plan. I do not know. If honourable members are really interested, I am happy to try to work out what the difference is. Nevertheless the figure represents a doubling of productivity or better. But more important-and again this was contained in the press release from BHP-is what BHP is on track to achieve. The press release from BHP says that, apart from the fact that we might quibble at the moment about whether the figure is 350, 380 or 400 tonnes per employee per year, the company is on track to meet a target of 500 tonnes per employee per year by 1991 at Port Kembla and a year later at both of its other major steel producing operations, Whyalla and Newcastle. There has been a huge improvement in the productivity of the work force in the steel industry, and it is continuing. It not stalled; it is continuing. It will continue to ensure that Australia continues to become a much more efficient steel producer. Over the course of its operation the company has also invested over $40m in research and development. That is a basic reason why 14 new steel building products have been launched onto international markets by BHP. It comes back to a previous point about the integral part that research and development plays in getting competitiveness up. Industrial disputation has been brought down to one-eighth of its level when we took over from the previous Government. But what really sums it up-and where you should be looking to the real indicators of success in this area, Mr Deputy Chairman-is the extent to which growth is now significantly coming off net exports. The recent figures that have been produced show that the first quarter of this year saw a doubling in export quantity over last year-500,000 tonnes in the first quarter of this year compared with 800,000 tonnes in the whole of 1983-84. In proportionate terms, exports when the steel plan commenced equalled one-sixth of total production; they now are equivalent to one-third. That is a significant increase in the export potential of the industry, and that, after all, is the right direction for an industry to be going. Whatever people might say about what has happened to the domestic market because of the use of substitutes, with more plastics, aluminium and so on going into motor cars and other products, the fact is that if we continue to rely on domestic markets we are doomed. That applies not just to the steel industry but to any industry. . Our future is in exports growth. That is what our strategy must be directed to. The steel plan is a remarkable example of success in that area. It can still go further and, with the assistance of this Government, it will continue to go further. But it is also the strategy that underpins the totality of our approach to industry development. I hope that honourable members on the other side look beyond the has figures that they have been quoting and beyond the rhetoric, try at least to understand a little better the strategic thinking behind this Government, and get behind us. It is the right direction. I do not mind a debate if people are honestly prepared to say where we are going wrong, but nothing I have heard in this chamber this afternoon suggests we are going wrong and I have not heard any effective alternative from the other side.",52
83,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,RATES,"The question is that the proposed expenditures for the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce and the Department of Industrial Relations, as amended, be agreed to. Question resolved in the affirmative. Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories Proposed expenditure, $689,272,000.",56
84,Mr JULL,RATES,"My comments today will be confined to my shadow portfolio responsibilities and that is in the area of tourism. May I begin my remarks today by saying that the decisions that the Government has made in this particular Budget, and indeed the decisions that it will make in these coming months, are critical ones for the Australian tourist industry because we really have reached a stage where those decisions will determine whether or not this industry can reach its full maturity or whether or not we will flounder along with an industry that really has the potential to be maintained as our greatest export earner. The reason I say that is because the tourism and travel industry is closely related to national economic health. In times of expanding economy, the standards of living and the levels of disposable income generally rise, credit becomes more available and more affordable and the relative cost of holiday travel falls correspondingly. The opposite occurs when the economy enters a recessional cycle: living standards and disposable incomes fall, credit becomes more expensive, the employment outlook is less certain and plans for travel are sometimes postponed indefinitely. This relationship was illustrated dramatically by the Boeing aircraft company in its 1988 publication Tourism Forecasts to the Year 2000. A definite pattern in which airline revenue passenger kilometres followed world gross domestic product (GDP) growth was established. An analysis of this relationship on an Australian level confirms how good times influence the overall tourist and travel industry. A comparison of Australia's GDP growth with the annual change in the numbers of Australians travelling overseas each year reveals a similar pattern between our scenario and that of the world scenario as outlined by Boeing. This is important in forecasting growth in the tourist and travel industry. The world economy, and more particularly the economies of our major international tourist markets-the United States of America, Japan, the United Kingdom, Ireland and New Zealand-are now entering recessional phases, the severity of which may be compounded by the current crisis in the Persian Gulf. If the economies of these countries deteriorate, the forecast of growth in our inbound tourist markets will have to be reviewed. Similarly, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development forecast of GDP growth below one per cent in Australia this year will restrict the numbers of Australians travelling overseas and within Australia for holidays. Two conclusions can be drawn from the overall economic outlook: one is that those countries with sustained economic growth will become even more important markets for the Australian tourist industry. This clearly means the Asian countries such as Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Japan. The other conclusion is that there could be a significant collapse in the domestic and outbound travel markets if the Australian economy slips further into recession. On one hand, fewer numbers of Australians travelling overseas in fact assists our current account because outbound tourists are treated as an import. But conversely, any collapse in the major domestic tourist market will prove a major problem for the industry which derives some 80 per cent of its business from local travel. Another economic factor influencing the tourist and travel industry is the relevant level of our currency exchange rates. The continuing high level of the Australian dollar is an inducement for Australians to travel overseas as their buying power is greater when the dollar is high. Conversely, a high Australian dollar renders Australia a relatively more expensive destination for international visitors who may choose to travel elsewhere. A fall in the value of the Australian doilar from US80c to 72c, for example, is an immediate 10 per cent saving for international tourists. A high dollar is thus doubly bad for Australian tourism; it encourages more Australians to travel abroad and it discourages overseas visitors from arriving here. It is thus no coincidence that the tourism boom of 1984 to 1988 coincided with a period of high, worldwide economic growth, a low Australian dollar relative to the yen and the American greenback as well as a favoured nation status in tourism terms due to the Paul Hogan campaigns, movies such as Crocodile Dundee, the incredible acceptance of Australian television programs such as Neighbours and The Flying Doctors overseas, which have been great for tourism promotion, and of course the bicentennial celebrations and the quite brilliant World Expo 88 in Brisbane. But given the general economic outlook prevailing at the moment, future growth for the Australian tourism industry frankly may not come easily. That is why I was absolutely delighted to attend the Australian Tourism Industry Association annual conference in Melbourne, along with the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Simmons) last Friday, and we both made great and powerful speeches. As is usual with conferences such as this, there is a certain bipartisan approach between the Government and the Opposition in terms of the importance and the future of the Australian tourist industry. But the Minister in his speech made reference to some initiatives that he hopes to introduce during this coming session of the Parliament. He said in his speech that he believed there were some measures which needed to be seriously considered, and he listed those as the further relaxation of capacity constraints on international air routes into Australia; the extension of interlining rights in Australia to all international lines; the extension of the services protocol of closer economic relations to include aviation so that Australian and New Zealand carriers are free to operate on the trans-Tasman and domestic routes; and the abandonment of separation between domestic and international markets for Australian carriers. The Minister said that he intended to pursue these matters with his colleagues in relation to future aviation economic reform. Those words were like music to my ears because in March this year, the Federal coalition prior to the election issued the tourism action plan. Those five points that were raised by the Minister on Friday are taken directly from the Opposition's aviation and tourism action plan. I am absolutely delighted that the Government has taken the opportunity to pick up these particular points because to a very great extent what happens in aviation policy in Australia hangs all the law and the profits. Therefore, I should like to table the tourism action plan of the coalition for the edification of the Government because there are another couple of points there that could well be picked up by the Government. In all seriousness, they should be picked up by the Government because the truth is that if we are going to maintain the employment that is generated in the tourist industry, we have to make some major changes in terms of international aviation as it exists now.",56
85,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,RATES,Order! Is the honourable member seeking leave to table the document?,58
86,Mr JULL,RATES,"Yes, Mr Deputy Chairman. Leave granted.",58
87,Mr JULL,RATES,"I do not say that in any silly sense; I really do think there have to be some dramatic changes if we are going to maintain that growth. My prediction is that we will see very much a softening of the domestic tourist industry in these coming 12 months. It is true that tourism has been treated as the poor relation by governments of all political persuasions in the past decade or so. It is true that airthere has been very little input indeed from those involved in the tourist industry about which direction the Australian aviation policy should go. We do have a remarkable situation at the moment when we look at the growth markets that are available to Australiamarkets such as Taiwan and Korea-and see what is happening there. I am concerned that at the moment the negotiations for the air rights between Taipei and Australia are in a state of flux once again; that despite the fact that negotiations have been going on for 12 to 18 months, we now find that the negotiations are on the rocks and we are still no closer to opening up that particular air service. We have the situation out of Korea, which potentially has to be one of the greatest growth markets for tourism to Australia. We have one service a week on that route. Quite frankly, one could have daily services by both Qantas and Korean Airlines and I am sure that they would make a profit on that route. The transcript of Estimates Committee C in the other place makes some very interesting reading because some points are made there by Mr Tony Thirlwell, who heads the Australian Tourist Commission, and by Mr Blunt from the Department. They confirm exactly what I have been saying: in actual fact there has been no real input from the tourist industry or the Australian Tourist Commission into the whole area of aviation to get that right. There is a relationship between the air services coming into Australia and the prices that are available for international visitors to come here so that we can compete more successfully. That is particularly exemplified with the services from Japan because after the airline dispute of last year more capacity was put on that route and special fares were brought infares that provided a 25 per cent reduction for Japanese visitors coming to Australia. Immediately the lift was there. There is a direct relationship between the cost of air fares and the number of visitors who are coming here. Whether we like it or not, Australia still has the est international air fares of any country in the world. So I commend the Minister for his speech in Melbourne on Friday. The Opposition will back him 100 per cent when he takes a piece of four by two to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) and to Senator Collins and tells it like it is: now we must see an opening up of the air services and if they do not provide that opening up of the air services the future for the Australian tourist industry is not as good as it could be this year.",58
88,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,RATES,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,59
89,Mr JOHNS,RATES,"There are a number of new environment initiatives announced in the Budget, and I wish to canvass one in particular. The Government has decided to make available $735,000 for what we call biodiversity conservation. I will explain that term and then discuss it. The funding will ensure that Australia continues its role in the development through the United Nations environment program of an international convention on the issue. But, in addition to that, we will continue work on the preparation of a national strategy to conserve biodiversity. What do we mean by biodiversity? For most of this century, State governments in particular and, more recently, national governments have decided that we should conserve certain areas of the environment so that there are at least examples out there of the main species of plant and animal varieties. Now that notion has been pulled together, we have realisedthat, whilst we have built a considerable body of national parks, World Heritage areas and various conservation reserves, we are not quite sure what our stock of beasts and plants is. Until we know that, I guess that we will not have a more firm footing to this whole question about those things we absolutely need to preserve and conserve in the environment and those things which, frankly, are debatable. We need to high- do it pretty quickly, too, because obviously we are losing species of plants and animals year in and year out. I look at the example of Queensland, because the Queensland Government, being so new to the game, has really attempted to lift its performance and devote a great deal more money-a several hundred per cent increase-towards conserving biodiversity. In other words, it is going to see if it can purchase a great deal more land or encourage private landholders to preserve the sort of biological diversity that is represented in many different forms throughout Queensland. I remember just before the State election that Australian Labor Party people were talking about 5 per cent of the Queensland land area being tied up for biological conservation purposes. But we do not know whether that is sufficient, whether we need more and just where those land areas should be. So the question of how much land should be set aside for conservation reserves is difficult to answer. No uniform percentage .of the total area of the country can be set, although 5 per cent is often mentioned, as the biodiversity and extent of the different endemic plant associations, as a major indicator of biodiversity, determines to a considerable extent the desirable area. As many of these associations as possible should be protected in areas large enough to be self-perpetuating. The critical question is: What size area is sufficient to ensure self-perpetuation? I come back to the money that the Commonwealth is allocating to this sort of debate. We need to understand what size areas are sufficient in order to preserve certain plant and animal species, and not simply put these areas aside as museums, because those areas are meant not just to preserve but also to conserve for future generations those plant and animal species. In other words, we should be able to observe the future changes in those plant and animal species. That is the sort of area in which I do not think we yet have sufficient knowledge to understand the impact of certain sorts of uses of an area, whether it is tourism, mining, forestry or whatever. We do not yet sufficiently know the size of the areas that we need to lock away in order to ensure their proper future. At least in my State of Queensland the new Minister for the Environment and Heritage has been able to determine 13 different major biogeographic regions, as he calls them, and begin to assign the number of parks and reserves represented in each of those regions. We find-and this is attributed to previous State governments with the assistance of the Federal Government-that we have been able to tie up significant reserves in many of the 13 different biogeographic regions, but there is still a great deal to be done. Having spoken to the State Minister, I think that he is really looking to the Commonwealth to support his buy-up of significant areas of Queensland to preserve biodiversity. I think that we ought to signal immediately to the State Minister that the purchase of land is really his job. Where we can help, though, is to assist on the scientific side and say, 'Look, these are the significant areas, these are minimum areas to give you proper conservation, and these are the ways you might go about managing those areas'. In a sense, we have been through part of that debate on the south-east forests. I do not just mean the conflict between forestry and the need for preservation. As part of the joint scientific report into the south-east forests, we had a debate about the size of the areas that need to be hived off in order to truly protect and preserve the various species. A little later this year the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources will meet in Perth, and I am sure that this debate will be raised there. I know that t4e Queensland Government will be supporting the following resolution: Establish and support the principle of the protection of biological diversity as a primary basis for the establishment and expansion of systems of National Parks and Protected Areas. I say here, of course, that the Federal Government, by and large, does not control national parks. They are a misnomer in that sense. They are controlled, except in four cases, by State governments; but I am pleased that one State government has put the two issues of biological diversity and the need for reserves together. So, presumably, at some stage down the track-maybe in 10, 15 or 20 years-we ought to be able to say, at least for this continent, 'Here is a minimum set of reserves sufficient to conserve all the remaining biological species'. I think when we reach that point-and we ought to be able to reach it fairly quickly, at least in a theoretical and mapped sense-the whole debate about resources versus the environment will start to slow down. I think we will know what it is that we need to preserve, with what sort of safety and what it is, quite frankly, that will have to be sacrificed. This economy cannot be stopped tomorrow. We have to keep the economy going. We need to use non-renewable resources for the foreseeable future. So I am hoping that at some stage all the people who come to the table in this debate between resource use and conservation will bring their maps. 1 hope that the conservationists, on the one hand, will say, 'Here are the things that absolutely must be preserved in order to achieve this most important goal of biodiversity', and that the miners, foresters and those representing the various industries, on the other hand, will say, 'Here are the resources'-I think 'resource security' is the term now being used-'that we absolutely need'. 1 do not yet fully understand the concept of resource security; 1 think that has to be debated thoroughly. At this stage I think it is purely a stalking horse for the other side of the debate. Nevertheless, it is a concept that will soon be fleshed out. 1 congratulate the Government on its expenditure on biodiversity conservation. 1 think it will now generate an enormous amount of good information that will enable us to work through the debate between the things we must conserve in Australia and the things that we may not be able to preserve because of the absolute need from time to time for certain resource use.",59
90,Mr CHANEY,RATES,"1 too wish to address that part of Appropriation Bill (No.1) 1990-91 which relates to the environment responsibilities of the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. I am tempted to follow the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns) with his dissertation on biodiversity, but perhaps 1 should confine myself to the suggestion that the honourable member might like to read the Opposition's policy in this area, which set out long before the last election the desirability of having a system of priority national parks with a view to ensuring the proper protection of biological diversity in this country. The various statements put out by both former Senator Puplick and the honourable member for Kooyong  lines of what the honourable member for Petrie is advocating. I wish him luck with his Government in getting some of our policies implemented in that regard. What 1 want to address, though, is this question of sustainable development. We are speaking at the committee stage tonight on the eve of a decision by the environmental groups as to whether they will continue to participate in the Government's sustainable development process. 1 understand that they intend to announce their position tomorrow. 1 would like to make it clear on behalf of the Opposition that 1 certainly hope the groups will participate in the Government's process. They have a great deal to add to it, and 1 think the process will be less successful if they are not participants. Over the last 10 years they have had a great deal of success in affecting public opinion in ensuring that the environment is firmly on the political agenda. The time has come for them to become a more active part of the process of finding solutions to the very genuine problems which exist. 1 welcome the fact that the Australian Conservation Foundation has become involved with the Resource Assessment Commission and the Landcare Australia Ltd arrangements. It has confronted a most vexed and difficult issue and participated in a procedure that aimed to find a solution with respect to disposing of intractable wastes. These are quite courageous things for the Australian Conserva- . tion Foundation to be doing and 1 welcome it. The sustainable development process is supposed to do something to solve this conflict between environmental protection and development that has been so evident in Australia. We have been through an extremely bad period. It has been a period of deep suspicion and mistrust. 1 do not blame the environmental movement for that, I blame very squarely the present Government. There is no serious observer who does riot agree that the Government used the environment in a most cynical way, took decisions which were aimed at the Australian Labor Party rather than the national interest, destroyed the trust of many people on the economic side of the argument in the whole decision making process and, in the process of unwinding from that pre-election situation, did a lot to destroy the trust of the environmentalists in what the Government was doing. We have been through a bad period and I think it is very important that we try to get out of that and into achieving something more significant for the country. The worry I have about the sustainable development process the Government is putting forward is the very significant gaps that exist between the people the Government is inviting to participate. In the very brief time available I will refer to the Business Council of Australia, which put some views that I understand have government support, although the Government seems to be supporting almost all propositions in its paper. The Council talks about the need to ensure that economic growth continues, that we continue to develop our non-renewable resources and that we correctly manage our renewable resources as well as setting and applying appropriate environmental standards. In looking at what the Australian Conse-vation Foundation, Greenpeace, the WIlderness Society and the Worldwide Fund for Nature Australia put forward in their response to the Government's discussion paper on sustainable development, one gets the sense of a gulf which may be too great to bridge. The four main conservation groups have said things such as this: - move. aw-y from a .re-ource driven economy is 1mperatIve 1f Austraha 1S to avoid long-run economic and ecological decline. They also say: The emphasis on further processing of resources - ould, - f. impl-mented, lock Australia into 1CY pos1tIon w1th grave and environmental economic risks. Further: Increases in the qualitative dimension of human welfare and not quantitative growth in resource throughput is a key objective . . . the 'growth' versus 'no growth' debate is a red herring. And finally: Th- n-n-ev-lutionary loss of a species and genetic d1vers1ty needs to be halted. They us- the word 'halted': completely stopped IS the thrust of their submission. It is open to anybody in Australia including the environmental movement, to argue that we should move away from a materialistic lifestyle, that we should seek to enjoy a simpler, better life, and that we should cast aside the notion of economic growth. One is perfectly free to put that argument forward. Indeed, adherents to the Christian religion have been arguing that now for some couple of thousand years, with success from time to time. But the truth is, as the Government has said in its discussion paper, that the issue is not whether there should be economic growth but rather what kind of growth should be encouraged. The truth is that in Australia in the 1990s, unless we have economic growth, we will not solve our absolutely horrific debt problem and we will have a situation where the environment will suffer as it has suffered in those --untries which have failed economic polICIes. II?- those circumstances, the simple point I WIsh to put to the Committee this evening i- t-at it really is vital, if this process of arnvmg at an agreed position on sustainable development is to succeed, that the Government clearly lay down the parameters within which this discussion is to operate. In my view, that means that on the environmental front it is vital that the Government lay down its minimum requirement so that industry can see quite clearly that the Government is deadly earnest about environmental matters and environmentalists in turn can be r-laxed enough to come to grips with the economic issues. I suggest that at the minimum we need a pola soil conservation strategy that specifies the p--centage of lan- we are going to rehablhtate to productIve use in the defined period. We also need a target for the number of species of Australian plants and animals which have been safeguarded to the point where they can be removed from the endangered list. Further, we need a timetable for the achievement of national minimum standards of pollution control, particularly focusing on discharges into the atmosphere and waterways. We need-and this is one area where the Government has moved to the position that we adopted before the last election, and I welcome it-a specific target for greenhouse emissions and a target for the amount of energy consumption derived from alternative fuel sources. Finally, we need a commitment to a minimum energy use reduction of 20 per cent within the public sector as part of an overall plan for more efficient use of energy. In other words, the Government should set its environmental parameters very much more clearly than it has so that it can be seen that it will proceed in good faith and with purpose in these areas. It then needs to say that on the economic front this process is one which is aiming to ensure continued economic growth in this country, continued development of Australian resources and, indeed, the further development of value adding activities to those resources. I suggest that some of the more difficult propositions being put forward by the environmentalists are clearly outside the parameters envisaged by either the Government or the Opposition. We need a basis for decision making during this current decade. Debate about whether we will have a spiritual revolution and a movement away from seeking increased material standards is something that should be conducted but should not be at the heart of defining sustainable development as a working proposition for Australia in this immediate term. So after a period where the Govern-· ment has behaved shamefully in that it has subverted the national interest to narrow Labor Party interests, the time has come for the Government to take a very clear position on both environmental and economic issues which have to be dealt with or which provide the parameters for the sustainable development debate. If we do not do that, I fear that we will simply have a prolonged and sustainable dispute on what all this means.",61
91,Mr DOBIE,RATES,"With the hotchpotch of collective responsibilities being discussed under this expenditure item in the Budget of $782.9m, it should be borne in mind that only $123.614m relates to the environment budget for 1991. This represents an increase of 17 per cent, and the Government should be given credit for having such an increase over its 1989-90 Budget. In fact, looking through this Budget item, it would seem that the only items which have received a cut in funding have been the Office of the Supervising Scientist and the Alligator Rivers Region Research Institute, which was created to provide the rivers of the Northern Territory with protection from the effects of mining. It is not my intention in the very short 10 minutes allowed to honourable members in this debate to spend any time on that issue. However, I would like to say that the four Hawke governments since 1983 stand condemned for the lack of business-relating not only to the - environment and development, but to all matters-that they have brought to this chamber. We are now seeing a government which has cut back our sitting dates to an obscene level. It should be pointed out yet again that between November 1989 and August 1990 the House of Representatives sat for nine days. In anyone's language, this is a disgrace. When, on a recent overseas study tour, I told some of my overseas colleagues who are interested in the parliamentary process about this, they were disbelieving and asked why members of the House had not taken this matter to the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU). I think it might well be a good idea for members of the House who are delegates to the IPU to take up the issue of a non-meeting of a parliament for such a lengthy period. We condemn the parliaments of Third World countries for not meeting, and they come forward with as many frail reasons as the Hawke Government does. All major statements on the environment have been made-and I repeat this yet againaway from the Parliament. In the seven years since this Government came to power there have been only seven occasions in both Houses on which environmental issues have been brought forward for discussion. On 25 March 1985, Australia's participation in international environment organisations was discussed; on 18 April 1985, the Australian Heritage Commission's annual report; on 12 September 1985, the zoning plans for the Great Barrier Reef; and on 25 November of the same year the presentation of the reports on the state of the environment in Australia. We had nothing in 1986, but on 25 March 1987 the zoning plan for the centre section of the Great Barrier Reef was discussed. On those five occasions the coalition responded by leave. In each instance the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) responded by leave. There was no subsequent debate and the only time we had any debate at all was through two matters of public importance: one was on ecologically sustainable development and was raised on 12 November 1989 by the former member for Richmond, Mr Blunt; the other was on the failure of the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) to integrate environmental and economic decisions and was raised by the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney) on 12 September this year. The disgrace is that meaningful subjects had to be raised in matters of public importance and the urgency of them had to be proved to the Speaker with norepeat, no-assistance from the Government. We on this side of the House have grown tired of the decision of the Government to make all its announcements relating to the environment via the press or, to be kindly, on site. We still await news of the greenhouse effect decision of the Government. There has not been a word in the Parliament to date. This is the repeat story of this Government since it was first elected seven years ago-seven long, weary and economically disastrous years ago. In the Senate there were five occasions on which the coalition debated environmental matters. Mr Deputy Chairman, I know you are interested in history; that is why I bring this forward. On 22 October 1984, the Senate debated the protection of the environment from nuclear war; on 8 November 1985 it debated Tasmanian woodchip e](port licences; on 7 November 1988 it debated a matter of public importance on Tasmanian logging practices; on 10 May 1989 it debated the forests of south-eastern New South Wales, and on 6 December that year it debated environmental and economic management. A debate ensued on these five occasions and on the two occasions the coalition managed to get up matters of public importance in the House of Representatives. Those were the only occasions on which any sort of debate occurred and such debate was extremely limited by the nature of time restrictions for matters of public importance. The Government has really reported nothing to this Parliament in respect of any of its environmental decisions; this place has not even been privy to the Government's dreams of the future, such as the billion tree plantation plan, although the other day at Duntroon I was pleased to hear from the Australian Capital Territory director of Greening Australia that in the first year 80 million trees were planted. He told me that this is ahead of the plan. I say, 'Well done' to the Greening Australia organisation, but a billion trees is still a long way off and one has to wonder what it is all about. We have had no discussion or advice on this within the parliamentary chambers, either in this one or in the other place. We hear from this Government so many emotive and emotional statements on the matter of the environment that it is quite hilarious-if anything about this matter can be hilarious-to see it running for shelter as it realises that its form of misdirected and unplanned statements, none of which were made in the Parliament, have brought massive developments to a standstill, as my leader said in his matter of public importance today. In the environment debate, both sides of the argument have to be put in the Parliament where the issue can be seen, discussed and negotiated. I am sorry to say that, having held the portfolio for only six months, the present Minister has made no effort to put forward a plan on environmental matters and has so far limited herself to talking on an ad hoc basis to groups such as the Fabian Society. Nothing has been said in the Parliament, where we have had no meaningful debate on the environment. What a sham it is that we have been able to have only limited discussions on seven occasions on these socially important subjects. I add that the Minister has given weak answers to questions put to her and adopted a patronising air towards Opposition members when we debated the Great Barrier Reef legislation in recent times. Mr Deputy Chairman, you will recall how the Minister said she would give a welcome to every member of the Opposition who wished to visit the Great Barrier Reef. What cheek! What nonsense to come from a senior Cabinet Minister who has been given responsibility for the environment. All members of the Opposition have heard from her is an invitation to visit the Great Barrier Reef, as though it were her personal fiefdom. What an absolute nonsense that is! We have seen-and the proper time in the Budget debate to make this point, which is why I am making it at this time, is during consideration of the estimates for the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territoriesthat we should be able to have sustainable development. How can we say that sustainable development, the environment, and development are getting an airing in this Parliament? They are not. The only times these subjects have arisen is when the Opposition has put forward matters of public importance. Not only the new Minister, but the whole Government for the past seven years stands condemned. I do not say that applies to all Government members. It has been my privilege to sit with many of them on the Standing Committee on Environment, Rec,reation and the Arts and I was impressed with the sincerity expressed by several Australian Labor Party members when we discussed matters of real concern and the general nature of the environment. In October 1988 the Opposition put forward a total environmental policy. It was accused of being pale green. However, it was the only statement made on the environment by any political party about the crying need for a general program, for general guidelines, to be given to industry and to people like myself who are vitally concerned about environmental matters, as indeed is the member who spoke before me, the honourable member for Pearce. I hope that by saying these few words in the Budget debate we might inspire the Minister to come to this chamber to give us not an ad hoc reply or an ad hoc statement such as she gave to the Fabian Society, but-",63

94,Mr NEHL,RATES,"It gives me a lot of pleasure to be able to speak this evening on Appropriation Bill (No.1) 1990-91 because tourism is of vital importance to Australia. Of course, as you know so well, Mr Deputy Chairman, the electorate of Cowper is one of the premier tourist destinations in Australia. It is because I am so conscious of the importance and value of tourism that I was rather perturbed during Question Time today to hear the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) making the comments that he did in defence of his action during the pilots strike. The action of this Government with regard to the pilots strike last year was totally indefensible. It spent tens of millions of taxpayers' dollars to prop up the two airlines, to maintain what was virtually an artificial strike, which has had monumental adverse effects on the Australian tourism industry. We still have not recovered and, in fact, it will take years before the Australian tourism industry recovers from the damage done by that particular dispute. Of course, tourism is a major industry in Australia and in my electorate it is the biggest industry. In Cowper, just as around the rest of Australia, people who are operating in the tourism industry are suffering from the revolting impact of the present Government's high inflation and high interest rate policy. For the record, I would like to make a couple of comparisons on interest rates, because as at 30 June 1990, interest rates in Australia based on $100,000 overdrafts were 18.25 per cent. Compare that with the United States where the prime commercial rate was only 8.193 per cent. In Japan the bank lending rate was only 6 per cent-one third of the level of the interest rate in Australia. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) can carryon as much as he likes about everything being on track and he can attack the banks; but the reality is that the suffering of Australian business, small business and farmers, can be laid directly at the feet of the economic policies of this Treasurer and this Government. Bankruptcies are increasing rapidly. But there is a bit of light at the end of the tunnel. In New South Wales, under the beneficial Greiner-Murray Government, things are not so bad as they are elsewhere. People in Coffs Harbour who are now considering how they should vote in the State by-election should pay careful and special attention to what has been achieved, because in New South Wales bankruptcies are up 24 per cent. People will say that that is pretty bad and is not satisfactory. The figure is 24 per cent in New South Wales, created by the policies of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, but in Victoria, under total mismanagement by Labor, bankruptcies are up 44 per cent and, again, in Western Australia-another jewel in the crown of Labor's mismanagement----'-bankruptcies are up 56 per cent. It is fair to say that New South Wales, under a Liberal-National Party coalition government, is doing far better than Labor States. Of course, unemployment is lower in New South Wales as well. I am particularly concerned, too, about the provision of a third runway at Kingsford-Smith Airport. I think it is an absolute disgrace that this gaggle of five Labor members have been campaigning against the third runway. The recent draft environmental impact study (EIS) has come out and some of them have rejected it and, on their own admission, have not even seen a copy of it. They are saying, 'Don't confuse me with the facts, I have already made up my mind'. The facts are that Kingsford-Smith Airport is responsible for the employment of 22,500 people and it produces more than $3 billion a year in total income for Sydney and New South Wales. I really believe that the EIS, which was imposed a year or 18 months ago, was not really necessary. I think one has merely to look at Botany Bay. There is a runway which stretches into the bay, and any cursory examination of the environment around that can tell one exactly what will happen with a third runway going out into the bay. There is nothing new about it. The track record is there; the model is there. I believe that that environmental impact study was introduced as a sop to the five Labor members whose electorates are around the· airport and was commissioned to delay things until after the last Federal election on 24 March. It was a smokescreen designed to try to save the seats of those five Labor members. What disgraceful, disgusting politicking that was; that we should sacrifice the benefits which will accrue to the whole of Australia from the third runway to cheap political opportunism on the part of the Labor Party. It is interesting to note that in the environmental impact study there are no factors which militate against building the third runway. In fact, that study did not identify any factors to prevent the construction of the runway. So I believe quite firmly that that EIS was put in place as a smokescreen in order just to take the heat off the Labor Government until after the election. The third runway at Mascot must be built-not just for local tourism but for the benefit of Australia's overall tourist industry and also, of equal importance, for the people of rural New South Wales, who will be badly hurt by the current situation. Those of us who fly in and out . of Sydney know that it is almost imp ossible to get on a plane at, for example, Coffs Harbour or Taree and fly directly to Mascot. Mr Deputy Chairman, you and both know that, invariably, if one takes for it. off-perhaps on time, if one is luckyand one has an estimated time of arrival which one would hope to be able one will be in the air circling around and stooging because of the congestion at Sydney Airport. It is the same for those who travel from Canberra to Sydney. One's plane never takes off on time if is going home on Friday morning; it never lands on time; and all too often one finds that by the time one's next flight has come on, it is way down the track running later and later all the time. I would also like to mention the proAustralia. posed $200 landing fee. That will militate against smaller towns in New South Wales. A $200 fee spread around a 737 does not amount to very much, but if that $200 is spread around a nine-seater plane it makes it very expensive indeed. This is certainly discrimination against the people of the smaller communities in New South Wales. In terms of tourism, I welcome the creation by the New South Wales Governstudent ment of the new Solitary Island marine school reserve at Coffs Harbour. Everywhere that tourism is being examined there is inlian economic life. creasing desire for people to be involved with the environment, and what could be called eco-tourism is becoming more and more popular. National parks, rainforest walks and conservation areas are becomother ing more and more important to tourism. The potential of the Coffs Harbour tary Island marine reserve is absolutely marvellous, because it includes marine viewing, estuary tours, expanded diving and snorkelling packages, and recreational fishing and boating opportunities also ist. This again is another tribute to the South Wales Government for taking such a positive step to provide the resource and the protection through the National Parks and Wildlife Service in order to improve and expand tourism opportuniAustralian ties on the mid-north coast of New South Wales. I would like also to pay tribute the Deputy Premier of New South Wales on his move to reduce the blood alcohol reading that is permissible for profesin sional drivers. It is vitally important that I this be introduced, and I commend him",65

96,Mr BRADFORD,RATES,"MCPherson) (8.10)I wish also to speak on the tourism appropriations, and I preface my remarks by one reminding the chamber of the importance that the tourism industry has within the Australian economy. In fact, the tourism industry now ranks as Australia's largest earner of export income. In 1989 it generated $6 billion in foreign exchange. for The industry employs more than 500,000 Australians, and, with 5 per cent of the work force, it is the single largest private sector employer. Tourism is credited with producing $22.5 billion dollars in tourist expenditure around Australia in 1989, and 80 per cent of this is actually represented in domestic tourism. It is estimated that indirect taxes derived from the industry in 1988-89 totalled around $2.7 billion. One does not have to be a of economics, even at the high level, to realise the substantial role that tourism plays in the fabric of AustraBut, once again, I must say that the Budget presented to us by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) some weeks ago is yet anexample of Labor's short-sightedness and policy paralysis. My electorate Soliof MCPherson is situated on the Gold Coast, and I do not think anyone here life would disagree with me that the Gold Coast is the acknowledged tourist capital of Australia. There were an estimated 2.1 exmillion domestic visitors to the Gold Coast in the 12 months to June 1989 and New we had 377,000 international visitors. I want to concentrate for a short time on domestic tourism, for that really is the bread and butter of the tourism industry. I guess we are talking here about the great tradition of packing the kids and the dog in the back of the family car to and going away for a holiday. That sort of tourism is the backbone of the tourism industry. As we look at what is happening tourism on the Gold Coast at the moment, we see that the people of Australia are so burdened by high mortgage repayments, the increased cost of living and the expense of raising a family under this Labor Government, as well as a host of other difficulties that have been forced on them in recent years, we must wonder, if all of this continues, what will happen to domestic tourism. Australian families can scarcely afford to buy even the family car now, and even if they can afford to buy a car they have great difficulty in filling it up with petrol to go anywhere, let alone choosing to go to the Gold Coast or even Byron Bay f?r a holiday. The experts tell us that confidence has not yet returned to the domestic market after last year's airline dispute. There is no doubt about that. I notice that the Treasurer in his Budget Speech talks about, I think very quaintly, 'the adverse effects of pilots' resignations'. I would not have thought that that was a way to describe exactly what happened, because. as far as I am concerned the Government handled that dispute from start to finish-and I suppose in some respects it is not finished even now in terms of its effect-in an absolutely deplorable manner. I must say how much I resent the fact that our airlines around Australia are being flown by foreign pilots when Australians are out of work. That is most regrettable. I was interested to hear .earlier on this afternoon the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean) gloating in the House .abollt the Government's success in reducing strike activity in Australia and about how great it had been at handling union activity and so on. I could not help thinking in the context of the airlines dispute-that is .the way I would prefer to talk about it-how badly it was handled by the Government. I cannot help wondering whether, had we been facing a dispute involving, say, the Transport Workers Union, the Federated Store men and Packers Union or the Waterside Workers Federation, the strike would have been handled very differently indeed. ' There is no doubt that confidence has not returned to domestic tourism, and I believe that the figures reflect that. The fainily budget has been so c'ontinually eroded under the Hawke Labor Government that people cannot afford to go away on holidays any more. That is a very sad situation indeed. The business peoplethis is what I am really concerned aboutin tourist destinations such as the Gold Coast, as well as tourist destinations. right across and through the certtre, of the country, are the ones who are feeling the effect of it. ' Last month a group of small business people in north Queensland launched a 'fax flood: on the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer. The Managing Director of the Cairns based Coral Sea Fisheries, Mr John Cavanaugh, p'redicts that many small businesses"" in Cairns are going to cease to exist in three to six months unless Government policies are changed-and I mean changed radically, not the sorts of changes that we heard the Prime Minister and the Treasurer talking about in Parliament earlier today. The sorts of changes they are talking about are too late for many people in the tourism 'and small business sectors. Mr Cavanaugh insists that his protest movement is not politically motivated, but simply seeks to highlight the crippling difficulties currently facing small business and tourism operators. I suppose that is not too much different from what the farmers are also talking about doing. Bankruptcies in the tourism industry are increasing at an alarming rate, and I believe that unfortunately this is only the ,tip of the iceberg as we see many businesses close down. As I look at what is happening in my home town, I wonder whethet we will have a tourist industry much longer if things keep going the way they have been. I turn to overseas visitors. I pose the question: how long will it be before overseas visitors get sick of walking down the streets of Surfers Paradise and seeing shops with 'For Sale' signs on the windows? I ani not talking about 'On Sale' signs, because they have been trying that for about the past two years; I am talking about 'For Sale' signs. We also see in Surfers Paradise at the moment building sites that have been abandoned, leaving large holes in the ground. It is, I suppose, fondly or quaintly called the Beirut look, which has become fashionable on the Gold Coast of late. It is not only these small businesses and developers that are having a hard time. Let us look at the other larger businesses that have also fallen by the wayside in recent times-Deluxe Coachlines, the Wilson group, the Interwest hotel group, Hooker Developments, the Girvan group, Avcorp, the Greetings hotel group, the Clubb group of companies, and Thiess Watkins White. The list goes on and on. Company collapses, even in an industry such as tourism, continue because businesses cannot cope with the high cost of interest rates, creditors who do not have money to pay their bills and, of course, significantly reduced levels of consumer spending. Some of the effects of the downturn of the domestic market may be offset if there are huge increases in the international market. Australia's share of the world tourism market is pretty small. Overall, we get about 1 to 2 per cent of the world travel market. We have just 2 per cent of the North American market and a marginally better 4 per cent of the Japanese market. Industry experts, of course-notable amongst them was the former tourism Minister, John Brown-have stressed over and over again that we must expand these markets. But the Budget we are dealing with allocates less to tourism promotion than it did in 1987-88. The Australian Tourist Commission (ATC) put a figure of $1 OOm on what it would take for Australia to keep up with the pace of international tourism promotion, but what did it get? It got $39.2m, a dismal amount by world standards when we notice that Greece spent $150m last year; Spain spent $105m; and even Tunisia-I do not know whether many people in this chamber even know where it is-spent $47m. Recent figures supplied by the ATC showed that an additional $2.4 billion could be earned just by capturing 4 per cent of the North American market and 10 per cent of the Japanese market. Even if we were to spend $200m to achieve these results, the investment would return a staggering 1,266 per cent-and that is not a bad investment. The bottom lineas I think the shadow Minister for tourism, the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), mentioned earlier tonight-is that the tourism and travel industry is closely related to national economic health. For many Australians travel is in many ways a luxury and consequently, when finances are stretched, luxuries such as holidays are the first things to be cut from the family budget. This Budget has done nothing to alleviate the economic pressure on Australian families; it has done nothing at all for either domestic or international tourism.",67
97,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,RATES,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,69
98,Mr MACKELLAR,RATES,"Warringah) (8.20)Mr Deputy Chairman, as you would know, I am fortunate enough to represent one of the great electorates, not only of Australia but also of the world, particularly because of its beachside environment and the magnificent surfing beaches which are available there. Manly, which is well known both nationally and intern at ion.ally, is one of Sydney's and Australia's finest beaches and, therefore, it gives me no pleasure at all, when I look back over past press clippings, to see the number of occasions on which Manly beach has been mentioned, not for its beauty or its tourist appeal, but for its unattractiveness due to effluent pollution and the resulting health hazards. The construction of deep sea outlets to alleviate this problem was a decision of a previous State Labor Government and, in Sydney, we all held high hopes that its commissioning in 1990 would see a return to the clean and healthy beach environment that we all could remember and would like to see again. The controversy during its construction stage over the effectiveness of the deep sea outlets took away some of our anticipated pleasure at its completion, because the most disturbing aspect of that controversy was evi. dence of the hurried and inadequate feasibility studies preceding the letting of the contract to determine the flow and the break-up of effluent under varying tidal current temperature and wind conditio-s. In other words, the decision by the Wran Labor Government to go ahead with these major upgrading projects seems to have been based, in' part, on a hope that it would work, rather than any real indication that it would. My confidence in the effectiveness of the deep sea outfalls has been further eroded by a report in the Sydney Morning Herald of 1 October last in which a Metropolitan Water Sewerage and Drain-ge Board spokesman was quoted as saymg that the new deep sea system was not designed to replace entirely the old system of coastal discharge, and that the old system would continue to be used at times of peak flows. We only have to think about that to realise what an inadequate and unsatisfactory solution to Sydney's sewage problem that represents. After $355m and years of upgrading, we end up with a deep sea system which will not even take all of Sydney's present sewage. At times of peak flows, the coastal discharge will still be used. Does that mean every morning or evening when daily flows peak, or does it mean once a week or every time it rains? We are not really certain of those facts at this stage. Does that imply that, as Sydney's population grows, those so-called peak flows will become greater and more extended so that more and more sewage will have to be channelled through the coastal outlets? The only reasonable conclusion to be drawn from this is that the deep sea outfall system has been designed with insufficient capacity to meet all of Sydney's present needs and that, as each year passes more and more sewage will be pump-d through the coastal outlets and appear back on our beaches. We have heard, and we continue to hear, much talk in Australia of quality of life. Yet, in fact, cities and towns around this nation are facing serious environmental problems from inadequate sewage treatment facilities. I think it is time we properly addressed this degradation of our seas and rivers. To governments' credit, particularly the New South Wales Government, that is being done. The fundamental issues appear to be the pumping and dumping into the sea and rivers of untreated or primary treated sewage or sludge from those treatments. This, of course, really must be phased out as soon as possible. If we look at what ' happened in the United States, we find that, following the disturbing findings of the long term harmful effects of sludge dumping off the New York coast, such outfalling and dumping has been prohibited. The trend there is towards the installation of secondary and other advanced treatment processes. Similarly, I believe we must look to the phasing out of the dumping of highly toxic sludge into landfill sites. The potential harm to ground water and the removal of that land from any effective subsequent human use simply cannot be tolerated. There must be a progressive and urgent tightening of pollution control standards at source. In other words, industry must be made to accept responsibility for the removal and disposal of all toxic material from its effluent. I recognise that this will be an additional cost, but I think the long term effects are so serious that these must be faced up to as soon as possible. I believe that considerably greater attention needs to be given to the development and installation of secondary treatment processes. If we look at the Opposition's position, we find that it is committed to a policy of combined Commonwealth-State programs of improved coastal zone management, particularly the cleaning up - f our beaches. It is on record as wantmg a toughening of air and other pollution la-s and the provision of improved waste dISposal methods. By comparison, this Government has serialised its environmental policy into occasional and politically motivated policy decisions: a forest accord here, a .C.oronation Hill and Wesley Vale declSlon there-the list goes on and on. We have been treated over weeks and months to that Ministers grandstanding on both sides of the environmental question. It has been designated as a win for some and a loss for others and, really, the environmental matters being discussed and the decisions that have to be made are far too important to be designated by the media as a win for this person or a win for that group, or even a loss for that group. If this Government were serious about our environment, it would be working vigorously and urgently with the States to set pollution standards for our national heri'tage, the rivers and the coasts of Australia and, of course, the air that we breathe. I would like to see some real leadership from the Hawke Government with a target date of the year 2,000. I would like to see some targets for the control of toxic industrial waste at source, for the secondary treatment of all sewage, and for the safe disposal of all residues containing specified types and concentrations of toxins. These goals are not too ambitious; they are not unrealisable; in fact, they are being implemented in a number of overseas countries. I am also aware of important developmental work being done by the New South Wales Greiner Government. But Australia needs, and its people will respond to, targeted goals to achieve a better environment because overseas experience already suggests that no single processing method offers the ideal solution. A number of different processes may well be needed within a total system depending on load, geographic, sewage composition and residue disposal factors. Why not identify those needs, publicise them and encourage innovative Australians to develop the necessary technology and processes? To the credit of the New South Wales Government and the Metropolitan Water Sewerage and Drainage Board, they do not pretend for a moment that the ocean outfalls are the be-all and end-all of the problem. In fact, there are advertisements appearing on the television at present which say, 'Out of sight is not out of mjnd' - and they are quite right to adopt that very realistic approach to the situation that currently confronts us there. We must give urgent encouragement to developments which will rid our seas, our rivers and our land of dangerous and unsightly human and industrial waste. I am very pleased that there are some industries and companies around Australia which are looking very innovatively at these problems. There is one such company in my own electorate, Boyd T. Keogh Industries Pty Ltd, which has developed locally what appears to be a system which offers very real opportunities for successful cleansing of liquid industrial waste. I think that the company has progressed enormously well, given the amount of support it has been able to garner-not too much from the Government at all, but relying on its own innovative skills and capacity to interest other investors in the processes that have been developed. There is now a pilot plant in the United States of America and there is a system which has been made transportable arid is operating in South Australia at present, designed and put into effect by Boyd Keogh. That is just an example of what local companies can do when confronted with these problems. Essentially there must be a community concern and commitment to working increasingly towards a cleaner environment. That means, particularly, approaching the problem of sewage disposal and toxic waste disposal in a much more inn.ovative and committed fashion than has been the case up until now.",69
99,Mr JOHNS,RATES,"1 thought I would respond to some of the comments made by the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MACKellar), many of which I agree with, particularly on the question of sewage. The problem of sewage has basically been regarded as a transport problem-to take whatever it is from source to outfall. The honourable member was quite right to suggest that in a sense we need a technological fix to try to make the emissions at source, or close to it, acceptable by the time they are transported to the point of outfall, so that when they enter the water or landfill, as the case may be, they do not then create some further risk. I want to raise this matter in the context of the Government's initiative on establishing an environment protection agency (EPA). It appears that almost every State has established, or is about to establish, an EPA. The question arises as to what role the Commonwealth EPA should play and with what powers it could play a role. For all the talk around the place about how the Commonwealth apparently has not debated the environment sufficiently here, as the honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie) mentioned, or does not make sufficient statements in the House, we all need to realise that in the past seven years particularly the Commonwealth has bent over backwards to stretch the extent of its powers to use them to save the environment. Most often we do not have direct powers for conservation of environment areas. We have to use our ability to write international conventions. We have to rely on using the Foreign Investment Review Board to deny foreign investment. We have to deny export licences or use our direct controls over things such as Commonwealth land and Commonwealth expenditure. Time and time again we have been able to use the very indirect powers of the Commonwealth to do good conservation work. It is asking too much of a Commonwealth government with limited powers to run the entire conservation debate for the nation. The EPA is a good point in question. Only with the full cooperation of each of the State governments can we provide decent and tough environmental standards, particularly for emissions to land, water and air. Let us get it right: to this point in time the Commonwealth has stretched almost to the limit, with great flexibility and ingenuity, its powers in solving the country's environmental problems. But much still needs to be done at the State level and in conjunction with the States. The role of an EPA is one that we are in the process of debating within the Government. It might be worthwhile looking at the United States Environmental Protection Agency because it has been operating for a number of years similarly in a Federal system. It is beginning to ask the question: Do we concentrate on the endof-pipe debate, the emission, what happens once the sewage is spewed out into the sea; or, rather, do we ask questions about environmental risk as such? It is pretty easy for public debate to take over the questions. Near my electorate in Brisbane we have a toxic waste problem in the suburb of Kingston. In Ardeer in Melbourne the company ICI Australia Ltd is spewing out materials into rivers. In Sydney there are the problems of sewage at beaches. The EPAs around the country might spend their time looking at points of emission and the sorts of mainly chemical problems that occur at points of emission. But perhaps the Commonwealth EPA in addition, to help set national standards for emissions, might step back and say, 'What are the key environmental risks in this country today?' Perhaps they do not have a great deal to do with the amount of sewage or its treatment. Perhaps they do not have a great deal to do with the question of national standards of emissions. Rather, for instance, it is a question of what we regard as being environmental priorities-how serious or otherwise any particular situation is. I was talking to a Dutchman recently' who told me a story about how he regards Germans and Austrians. He mentioned that when Germans assess a particular situation they might regard something as serious but not hopeless. Austrians, on the other hand, would regard the same situation as hopeless but not serious. I suspect that that is the question for us. We need to rate questions for the degree of seriousness as well as the degree of hopelessness or otherwise. Maybe it is the role of a Commonwealth EPA, in conjunction with the States, to say, 'These are Australia's key conservation environmental questions. These are of highest risk'. The highest risk questions might well be those that concern greenhouse gases or biological diversity-things that we currently would not immediately place within the control of an EPA. EPAs around the States to this point have mainly been about controlling emissions and standards of emissions into the atmosphere. An EPA-Federal, State or otherwisemight set standards of emissions of carbon dioxide from cars. It might set standards for fuel efficiency. Over a 20-year period there is no doub- that we have improved the fuel effiCIency and the standards of emissions from cars. But over the same 20-year period we have doubled the number of cars. There are eight million cars in the country now, so at the end of the day the amount of fuel used and the level of total emissions are the same. A technological fix in the absence of any planning gave the same end result-too much carbon dioxide and an overreliance on oil and motor fuel. At some stage the Commonwealth needs to play a part not just in setting standards for emissions, not just in encouraging technological fixes, but in suggesting the context in which these should be done. We all know that it is almost impossible to get a' transfer of people from the private car to urban transit if city densities are too low. It is just impossible; people are not going to do it. I am not going to do it. It is not enough to appeal to people's better nature and ask them to step out of their cars and into a train or a bus. We need to make sure that our living densities, especially around the current train stations, major bus routes and so on, are sufficient to get people to use them. That is the only way we will make urban transit systems profitable. I think how easy it is in a sense for the Singaporeans. The honourable member for Lyne (Mr Cowan) and I have just been to Singapore. Their physical constraints are such that they can only build cities of high density. When they build an underground train system, of course it is profitable and of course people use it because it is the only way to move around sensibly. There is not much of an option; people really cannot afford to buy a car because there are only two freeways and they are full most of the time. In a sense there are not the constraints on the Australian population. We have too many choices. We continue to build our cities at low densities and therefore automatically make most of our urban transit systems unprofitable. We continue to build cities so that, by definition, cars are the only way to move around. We continue to locate most of our living and working spots so that we have to travel enormous distances to put the two together. I am suggesting that in the long run technological fixes and standards of emissions alone are not enough; we also need some plans to put the two together. Maybe a Commonwealth EPA can be involved in that sort of process.",71
100,Mr COWAN,RATES,"Both of the previous speakers, the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MACKellar) and the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns), made a worthwhile contribution to this debate. They spoke about the environment in a very sensible way. Our great responsibility as a Commonwealth has been to make Australia aware of the problems concerning the envitonment. I think that this is occurring today. The Commonwealth has certain powers, as have the States and local governments. Those three tiers of government have a responsibility to confer and they know pretty clearly in which direction they intend to go with regard to caring for the environment. However, I give a warning about keeping Australia's economy sound. If I were to illustrate my feeling on this matter, I would speak about the mining of uranium in the Northern Territory. We should not be prohibiting common sense mining or other works concerning our soil if it severely affects Australia's economy. It imposes a great strain, I am sure, not only upon the Commonwealth but upon the States. The honourable member for Warringah spoke about the New South Wales Government and its attitude towards sewage treatment and the cleansing of the water supply. Demands were made in those areas and the Government responded accordingly, but it is costing the taxpayer and the ratepayer a lot of money to meet those particular demands. In these inflationary days I think we have to be very careful in that respect. All that I am suggesting is that a common sense approach be taken by the three tiers of government and that industry and people generally take such an approach towards the environment. I want to talk mainly about the tourist industry because it is very important to Australia. I can recall Mr John Brown, the Chairman of the Australian Tourist Commission, writing to me-and, I suppose, to all members of the House-prior to the delivery of the Budget. He suggested that more money should be set aside for the overseas promotion of Australian tourism. I agree with that. The tourist industry must be promoted jointly by the various governments of Australia, the local authorities, and private enterprise. In saying that, I believe that private enterprise has a tremendous responsibility to promote the industry properly. Perhaps government is not doing all that it could, particularly with regard to the promotion of Australia overseas. We share only a very smaU percentage of the total overseas tourist dollar-I think the figure is only about 2 per cent-but 450,000 people are employed in the industry. Employment in the industry has doubled since 1984. Overall, there has been an increase of about 20,000 employees a year. As the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford) stated in the House this evening, it is certainly our biggest dollar earner. There are certain things that we have to look at. We should not tell ourselves that everything is going well in the tourist industry and that we will attract more people to Australia. One of the things we ought to do is to expand the teaching of foreign languages in schools. I think the areas from which we will gain more tourists are America, Asia and Japan. Those areas are in proximity to Australia. Therefore, Asian languages must be taught in Australia to enable us to cater adequately for the people who will visit in years to come. Also, we must improve Australia's image as a tourist shopping destination. Many Australians go to Asia-to Singapore, Hong Kong and, at the moment, particularly to Bangkok-because they feel they will get a bargain. When people arrive in Australia they want to purchase some Australian goods, even if it is just a toy kangaroo, but it is possible that such items will have been made in Japan. We must sell quality Australian made goods in our shops. We must also look at the hospitality side of what we have to offer in Australia. We must use technical and further education colleges, particularly, in the training of people in the hospitality industrypeople such as receptionists and those in the restaurant trade. It concerns me that sometimes the attitude of Australians towards tourists is not as good as it ought to be. I do not think that we in Australia accept tourists in the same way as those in other countries accept them. When I served in local government in my area, I recall the mayor of my home town, Alderman Eric Martin, when we were trying to promote the tourist industry, saying to us, 'Gentlemen, when I think of the tourist industry, I always remember a town by the reception that I receive'. If people who pull up at a garage for petrol are met by a lady or a man who comes . out to serve them, offers to clean their windscreen and wishes them a pleasant day, these are the things that they remember about a town, a country area, a city or all of Australia. This point is very important. I do not think that we as Australians are living up to this. I do not think we show a welcome attitude to people. Tourists will remember our attitude to them, so we have a great responsibility to change the attitude that we have. I think it would be to our advantage to do so. The popularity of the Paul Hogan commercials showed that one must promote a country. Paul Hogan has done a great deal for Australia. So many Americans came here as a result of those commercials. It might cost some money, but we have to have central offices throughout the world. We also have to use global electronic booking services so that bookings are efficiently made. We need more package tours into Australia. Of the 31 overseas airlines serving Australia, how many are promoting package tours to Australia? How many are cooperating with the commuter airlines, such as Eastern Australia Airlines, and the other smaller airlines within Australia which can offer a package to get people into the country areas of Australia? I know we are all proud of Australia. No other country can offer the tourist what Australia does. Look what we have to offer to tourists, both Australian and overseas visitors. We can always criticise, but look at what this country has to offer-national parks, forests, mountains, plains, seaside, the oyster and fishing dustries, our primary industries and the manufacturing side. There are so many things that we can talk about if we go out and sell them. What do Alice Springs and Ayers Rock mean to Australia? They are tremendous attractions. Are we promoting them on the European and Asian scene in the way in which they should be? I raise these aspects because I think they are very important. In the time available to me, let me say that penalty awards and what is occurring in the industrial relations area do not gur well for the future of the tourist dustry. I know that the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) spoke of this today during another debate. The fact is that we cannot afford the industrial awards that we have today and still have a growing tourist industry. Jobs in the tourist industry are seven-day-aweek jobs. We have a five-day week. Our costs are so high that there are people who will not come here simply because of the cost. Even though the dollar has been devalued to a certain degree and it is cheap for. people such as the Japanese to come here, these people know what the costs are. .When Mr John Brown was Minister for tourism he made it very clear in the media, and perhaps here in the House, that he felt that industrial relations must be looked over and that we must have a sensible approach to this growing industry for Australia because it has a great effect upon the economy.",73

102,Mr TAYLOR,RATES,"1 do not want to take up too much of the House's time at this late hour, but in this debate on the Appropriation Bill 1990-91 I want to make a few comments about the environment, perhaps from a slightly different perspective from that of earlier speakers. Clearly such a major issue is not the itical preserve of this Government, despite what it might think, as the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney) increasingly highlights in this place, in- as he did earlier this evening with his comments on sustainable development. Nor is it an issue confined to our national shores. It is an international issue of enormous magnitude, as was sheeted home hard and fast to me during the recent thirty-sixth conference of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association in Harare, .which I had the honour and pleasure to attend as a member of the Australian delegation, as, indeed, you did, Mr Deputy Chairman. To illustrate the views of other national auleaders in the Commonwealth, I would in- like to quote from what His Excellency President Mugabe of Zimbabwe had to say on that issue in his opening address to that conference. He said that faced with the deterioration of the environment through unplanned and careless use of the natural resources of the world, it is imperative that strategies be formulated and urgently implemented to combat the decline. He went on to say: The economic activities of the industrialised countries in the developing countries, for example, the exploitation of raw materials, the location of the manufacturing industries, the dumping of pesticides and other toxic substances, all have an adverse effect on the environment. In any endeavour to find solutions to environmental problems, the responsibility rests largely on the shoulders of the developed nations which should cultivate an entirely new attitude towards the predicament of the developing countries. While the onus for tackling environmental problems mostly lies on governments, parliamentarians have an important role to play by mobilising the people at large to preserve the environment. He also said: However, it must be pointed out that the commonwealth countries on their own cannot adequately tackle environment and natural resources problems without similar efforts and co-operation from other countries outside the association, although they can set an example and urge other countries to do likewise. I suggest that Australia in particular and the Commonwealth in general are setting an example. I cite the commitment of the 1989 Langkawi declaration on the envipol- ronment, issued by the Commonwealth heads of government after their Malaysian retreat last year, which said in part that the Commonwealth heads of government: . . . would strengthen and support the development of international funding mechanisms and the appropriate decision-making procedures to respond to environmental protection needs and to include assisting developing countries to obtain access to and transfer of the needed environmental technologies and which should take account of proposals for an international environment fund. The rhetoric now needs to be translated into substantive action. Nevertheless, the wider Commonwealth has taken a sensible approach to issues in not seeking to duplicate other multilateral arrangements and is cognisant of what both global and regional bodies such as the South Pacific Forum are doing, at the same time seeking opportunities to complement, reinforce and, if appropriate, re-orient them. Individual member countries such as Australia also continue to take domestic initiatives, although I share the general criticisms of this Government made earlier by the honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie). Clearly we can and must do much better as a sovereign state. I noted with interest the comments made in the Harare Herald on 19 September by the Chairman of the Zimbabwe National Conservation Trust, who suggested that the Zimbabwe Government could encourage conservation by making money spent on the issue tax-deductable. He made an important point of principle also when he said in part: There is no point in promising children sophisticated development, higher educational and lavish social facilities when their future cannot anteed in terms of provision of food, clean water, air and productive land. Although there is some evidence of initiatives to that end, and the international environmental debate is moving steadily towards the world environment conference in 1992, Australia now needs to focus politically not only domestically but on a much wider plane, firstly by recogwant nising the validity of the cynicism, and sometimes the antagonism, of many deimportant veloping countries about the attitudes developed countries to the combined problems 'of human survival, basic needs and the environment; secondly, by ensuring that cooperation and dialogue between developed and developing countries becomes an increasingly two-way process; thirdly, by finding sensible and constructive approaches, especially those related to food production; and, finally, by moving quickly towards the formal endorsement of the Langkawi declaration. All of us would be well advised to remember that the issues of food, shelter, energy and the environment are profoundly interwoven and involve issues which lend themselves particularly to the central character not only of Australia but of the wider Commonwealth and of other democratic sovereign states. Demonstrably the environmental challenges are there and we all need to exercise what I would loosely refer to as the three Cs for success. The first is communication-communication of the issues within countries such as ours and between ours and other sovereign states. The second is capacitycapacity or plain hard work to resolve those issues rather than any empty-headed simplistic rhetoric, for which I regret to say this Government has a marked propensity. The third is commitment-commitment to succeed. . As the honourable member for Pearce and the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MACKellar) said earlier, this Government seemingly has lost its way with environmental issues and needs to redefine its objectives before it is far too late. I have no doubt that there will be hurdles along the way but we should remain resolute. If we do not, our planet be guarcannot avoid an irreversible disaster. I suggest that Australia and the world cannot afford that luxury. Proposed expenditure agreed to.

103,Mr RUDDOCK,RATES,"1 to speak tonight in relation to the Appropriation Bill 1990-91 because some issues need to be addressed. I of ask first: Why is immigration in such disarray? The immigration program is important. It is a national interest program and there is significant failure in its administration which can only serve to undermine public confidence in the program. Public confidence in the program has now been seriously compromised by government administrative failure. It is not especially related to the current Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand), as he has been merely the sixth occupant of the office in seven years. There are two principal reasons for the failure. First, there has been the short sighted approach to budgetary issues, ignoring long term consequences; and, secondly, there has been a preoccupation with manner and form· rather than principal in migration selection. Firstly, as to administration, the immigration program has increased rapidly over time from a low point of something of the order of 70,000 successful applicants in 1983-84, to a high point of 145,000 in the year 1988-89. This outcome has increased the workload enormously, as the number of applicants has also grown. Citizenship has been promoted by the Government with a consequential increase in workload. Temporary resident visas doubled in two years prior to 1988-89 and visitor visas issued increased by 40 per cent from just under one million to 1.4 million in the same space of time. So despite what is obviously a very significant increase in workload, departmental staffing arrangements have shown little if any variation except between functions. One might ask where I obtained most of that information. It was obtained from the Department's own boastful advices as to the extent to which it was coping with these matters. Indicative in this is that total staff employed on the migration function of the Department rose from 2,307.3 in 1985-86 to 2,377 in 1988-89. The first significant increase in staff sources was in this year's Budget where there has been a rise to 2,553. So that is the first substantial increase that we have seen. The Department and the Government parade these statistics as indicating successful administration but the outcome has been a seriously flawed immigration program. The following are mere examples, of which there are many: refugee claims now exceed 5,000; existing processing arrangements will take 10 years to finalise without any further claimants; growth in illegal immigration has occurred; low estimates of the Government of 50,000 are now acknowledged to be more than 90,000. If one takes my estimate, 150,000 is closer to the mark, and that has not been challenged by either the Minister or his departmental advisers. Sham marriages-those arranged merely to obtain migrant entry-are endemic. Important national interest programs such as the business migration program are so flawed in administration as to put their very future at risk. There has been, finally, because of a lack of resources, an inability to check on reports required by English language intensive courses for overseas students (ELICOS) colleges as to which students fail to attend classes. The Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs has not been in a position to foliow up those reports. In relation to each of these issues,_ what can we say of the Government's response? In relation to the refugees, spurious claims will subsume the entitlement of genuine, full protection if the Government does not move quickly to contain the unreasonably lax interpretations of our courts as to who should or should not be a refugee. The question should seriously be asked when examining the sound performance of the determination of refugee status committee process over the years whether there is a judicial role in this policy area. The way in which the Government dealt with Chinese students in general has led to a breakdown in the procedures meant to assist those who have genuine and substantial claims for protection. Growth in illegal immigration occurred because of rethe lack of commitment to compliance activity. It is well known that a mere two compliance officers for each regional office of the Department were, on average, engaged in this endeavour. There is a kneejerk reaction to the explosion in illegal immigrants through breaches by ELICOS students that saw the number of compliance officers increase from 48 to 100 and now by this Minister to 150. However, determination to deal with this problem is lacking. Senate Estimates Committee examination shows that there were only 42 extra staff for compliance work appointed this year. Any other additional compliance staff are to be found by reshuffling present staff responsibilities from other areas which are in serious disarray. This can only lead to other shortcomings. For instance, will compliance officers come from the intelligence and investigations branch of the Department, which well placed advice to me indicates is a month behind in key malpractice inquiries. In fact, the most interesting statistic in the Estimates for this year is the proposal to increase the complement of in-house lawyers for drafting new laws by more than 12, and they will come from the branches of the Department charged with responsibility for rewriting the new Act and regulations, which were intended to provide fair and streamlined procedures. Could it be those staff development responsibilities? This could hardly be the case, given the need for training and tuition, as the law itself constantly changes week by week. What is the evidence for serious allegations by me in the growth of fraud? Statistics released this week indicate that while all other categories of entry fell, those entering Australia on spouse, de facto and fiance grounds increased by 6 per cent. If those in the pipeline for grant of resident status within Australia had been processed in a timely fashion, those entering and permitted to stay in Australia on spouse grounds would have exceeded 30,000 or 25 per cent of the program. Evidence of fraud was detailed by departmental officers who gave evidence to the Senate. They said that in one overseas post where 200 spouse applications were rejected only three were sufficiently confident in the bona fide nature of their relationship to appeal. Estimates of some departmental officers suggest that up to 50 per cent of spouse applicants could be arranged with immigration being the only principal objective. In one office of the Department where bona fide testing was undertaken the rejection rate rose from 5 per cent to 30 per cent. How has all this occurred? It has occurred because the Government so streamlined the process that no realistic inquiries were to be undertaken into the bona fides of marriage other than to establish whether or not there exists a marriage certificate. In the business migration area, belatedly, the Department is now targeting two principal source countries of applicants, namely, Hong Kong and Taiwan. But there has been little realistic scrutiny of the activities of authorised business migration agents. The involvement of overseas middlemen in pressing cases without bona fides or of a marginal character has been left largely unchecked. While there are many claims of fraud in this area-and many of those are exaggerated or without corroborated evidence-it is a case of where there is smoke there is fire. Finally, in the area of compliance relating to overseas students, in evidence to my Senate colleagues it was made very clear that, even though reports were being made of those students who were not attending classes, it was because of the total absence of resources that the Department was unable to follow up those matters. That is a continuing cause for concern. I simply note what Mr Bugden had to say at the Estimates Committee when he spoke about problems faced by the Department in handling the large numbers of illegal entrants. He said in relation to that matter: There has been a lot of emphasis put on introducing the Act on 19 December. Since then there have been a number of concessions announced to illegals and it was also partly as a function of the lack of resources in that particular area. I would add that the problem of a substantial increase in the numbers of illegal entrants arose. The other matter I mentioned was preoccupation with manner and form. The report of the Committee to Advise on Australia's Immigration Policies-the FitzGerald report-was the Government's landmark review on imniigration policy. The report, which sought to focus on policy for Australia's future and to give clear economic focus to the migration program has been subsumed by the recommendations to legislate for a new model migration Act. The FitzGerald designer model was jettisoned for the preferred model of the Department. That Act and its subsequent regulations have been rpundly condemned by its users, ethnic communities, the judiciary, the adjudicators and departmental staff-the administrators. The support of members of parliament has been alienated and Mr Justice Wilcox described the new law as 'Akin to feeling one's way through a labyrinth'. These are matters for which the Government has been found significantly wanting.",76
104,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,RATES,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,79
105,Dr THEOPHANOUS,RATES,":It is always a pleasure to follow the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), the shadow Minister for the immigration portfolio. I guess that the distinctive feature of his comments always is his grumbling about something or other. But the coherence of his position leaves a lot to be desired. I will get back to that in a moment. However, it seems to me that the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand), who has been dealing with immigration for some considerable time, deserves congratulations for the way in which he has taken on board and handled some very difficult issues, in a way which shows both care and consideration for what a variety of groups in the community feel about immigration. At the same time, the Minister has referred important issues to the Joint Select Committee on Migration Regulations for consideration. I was a bit surprised that the honourable member for Dundas referred to the issue of marriage and change of status. He is the Deputy Chairman of the Joint Select Committee, and the inquiry which the Joint Select Committee is undertaking at the present time is the question of marriage and what to do about change of status on marriage. It is quite a nonsense for the honourable member for Dundas to say that not enough has been done in this area when we are examining and trying to put together the criteria which will be used in determining this issue. This is not a simple question; it is a difficult question. It is very easy to think that we can use ethnocentric criteria in determining what is and what is not a valid marriage. In some societies, one gets married by arrangement; in other societies, a long courtship is needed. Given that we have different cultural groupings coming to Australia with different concepts of marriage, we ought to be very careful about simply saying, 'Let us fix up this problem quickly', when a parliamentary inquiry is looking into the matter. This evening the Minister has announced a program on the question of illegals, and he will be responding to the parliamentary Committee's report tomorrow, at which time. I will have some more comments to make. On the central question of immigration-that is, the question of the total number of immigrants coming to Australia and how we put together a program in relation to that-there is no doubt that the Opposition parties are hopelessly divided. There is no doubt that the Opposition parties do not know where they are at as regards the total number of immigrants coming to Australia or what should be done about determining the total figure. We have the extraordinary situation where the Liberal Party of Australia is about to call a national conference before which there is a key motion to slash immigration, to have a huge cut in immigration. That is the motion going up to the Liberal Party national conference. The shadow Minister, the key person responsible for the policy of the Opposition parties in this area, has often said that he supports immigration, but it is very interesting that he has made no comment at all on this conference. He said nothing about what this conference ought to determine. He said nothing about whether in fact he opposes a big slashing of immigration. The Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) has also made a statement saying that immigration must be cut dramatically. What is the shadow Minister saying? He is sitting on the fence; he is saying nothing. The Liberal Party went to the Australian people six months ago-and the honourable member for Dundas was the shadow Minister at the time-and said that our level of immigration was insufficient and its policy was to increase it to 170,000. What happened? The Liberal Party is now looking at a motion saying that immigration ought to be slashed to fewer than 100,000. Instead of the shadow Minister taking this issue on and saying, 'Look, this is going to create enormous distress in the ethnic communities and to the thousands and thousands of people waiting for their families to come to Australia', what does he do? He does nothing. He issues no statement and says nothing about it except that the Opposition will wait until the determination of the conference. Being a leader in this place involves leadership, and the shadow Minister has shown no leadership; he has said nothing about the issue. I challenge him tonight or at any other time to come forward and tell us the policy of the Liberal and National parties in relation to the total numbers of immigrants. Obviously he has not got a clue what his position is or what he intends to do about the increasing statements from reactionary forces that say, as soon as something goes wrong in the economy, 'Right, the first thing to do is to cut the numbers of immigrants'. It is very interesting that the Liberal and National parties do not talk about cutting the total number of immigrants coming in under the independent or skill category but they do talk about cutting almost to the bone the family reunion program, the humanitarian program, which is the most important program of all. That is the program which allows people to be reunited with their families. Every member of Parliament is aware of the importance of this program. All members of Parliament are aware of the people who come to their offices, often in tears, and say, 'I want reunion with my family'. What happens? The Opposition parties come in here and say, 'We are looking at a big cut in immigration and we are going to cut the family reunion program'. The honourable member for Deakin (Mr Aldred)-and he is a member of the Liberal Party-has recently made a statement that the Opposition wants a total cut in the family reunion program. That means that not a single person would be admitted under family reunion. That is to be the position of the Liberal Party if the honourable member for Deakin has his way. Who is the spokesperson for immigration in the Opposition parties? What is their position on the central question of the total numbers coming to Australia? Does the National Party want to slash immigration? Will those people attending the Liberal Party's national conference advocate a big cut in immigration? Is that the position of the honourable member for Deakin? Or is it the position of the shadow Minister-the man who goes around the ethnic communities in this country purporting to be their hero and saying that he supports them but who, at the same time, is not prepared to say a single word about the survival of the key humanitarian program, the family reunion program? The shadow Minister then comes into this House and castigates the Minister for the organisation of the immigration program. What an impertinence when the shadow Minister has nothing to say on the key question. The organisation of the transitional period of the regulations was difficult, but we are putting things into place. The Minister has acted on the recommendations of the previous Joint Select Committee. He referred to the present Committee a number of the key issues such as marriage and illegal immigrants. Reports will come out dealing with these complex and difficult issues, and the program has been put into place. The other thing that is happening is that within the Australian Labor Party there is a constant examination of the criteria, the implementation of the points system and the question of ensuring that people who migrate to Australia are encouraged to go to places other than the capital cities. All these important policy questions are being examined by the Caucus committee and the Government. On the other side, we have a situation where the shadow Minister comes into this House and purports to criticise the Minister on the good initiatives which have already been taken but himself offers nothing and on the key questions leaves everything up in the air. If immigration is to be a central question, which it is this country, we ought to have a better performance from the shadow Minister on these matters.",79
106,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,RATES,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,81
107,Mr MACKELLAR,RATES,"Warringah) (9.20)In speaking in the Estimates debate, there is very little doubt that the 1990-91 Budget, just six weeks after its presentation, is already the most dated and irrelevant set of documents seen in this House in the seven years of successive Labor governments. We all know that the economic projections are already in tatters and that a number of other portfolio areas are showing a sufficient divergence between estimate and reality to warrant a revised edition of the Budget. One such portfolio area is immigration. The Bureau of Immigration Research has just released statistics showing that the immigration target of 140,000 for 1989-90 has fallen short by 18,783 people. That is a 13 per cent shortfall. We all have our views as to whether that is a good or bad thing. What I am particularly concerned with is the Government's failure to present an accurate set of national accounts. When the Budget was being presented in August, the Government must have had a good idea of those numbers. The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) should have had a good idea of those numbers, yet the Budget statements report an intake of 140,000 in 1989-90 and provide an estimate of 125,000 for 1990-91. What we have instead is an actual figure of 121,227 for 1989-90 and a likely fall in 1990-91 to somewhere around 100,000 to 105,000. Just on the sheer evidence ()f the figures presented at Budget time and by the Bureau of Immigration Research, obviously the Government is seriously astray when it comes to informing the public accurately as to the situation in immigration. Equally puzzling is that, despite an 11 per cent decline in intake in 1989-90, the Budget provides for a 10 per cent increase in Budget outlays on immigration-from for $147.3m to $162m. What is happening is that the Australian economy is in decline and a less attractive destination is subsequently offered to prospective migrants. Since the whole of the Budget seems to be based on the disturbing premise of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) that Australia is not in recession, his documents give an unrealistic and almost irrelevant view of what he foresees for Australia over the coming year. This emu-style attitude of the Treasurer can be seen in his forward immigration estimates. Despite an economy that will almost certainly see the intake decline through 1990-91 and 199192 and very likely into 1992-93, the Budget provides for a net increase in immigration outlays over four years of 18.5 per cent. That 18.5 per cent increase is puzzling for another reason. Even without the present recessionary influences, it has been widely reported that the Government has agreed to back away from the very high intake figures of recent years. This is reflected in the Budget, with its cutback from 140,000 in 1989-90 to 125,000 in 1990-91. I would have expected this to translate into reduced expenditures in the present year, but instead we have a budgeted increase of 10 per cent in outlays. Frankly, it is not just the dollars and numbers that do not relate; everything this Government is doing with immigration is confusing. And people do not have to take my word for that. All they have to do is ask any member of this House about the response he ot she gets when people come seeking help in matters of immigration. It really is a totally confused area. Let us look at the handling of illegal migrants. It has been a dismal failure, with recent reports suggesting that as many as 90,000 illegals are now resident in Australia. The numbers are apparently still growing. The effectiveness of the business category of immigrants is, to put it kindly, seriously in doubt, and the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) alluded to that in his speech tonight. When we come to the daddy of them all, the handling by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) of the Chinese student problem, that was, again to put it at its kindest, confusing. The Prime Minister revealed that he simply did not understand the ramifications of making statements about immigration matters; basically he had no idea what he was talking about. It was confusing and very damaging to his personal credibility. The way he stumbled through a matter with such delicate international and national implications has done very little to improve his or his Government's foreign policy image. Uncertainty and confusion is being caused by an unstructured debate on immigration. We have heard from the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), whose contribution was noticeable more for the fire of his delivery than for its content.",81
108,Dr THEOPHANOUS,RATES,You always say that.,82
109,Mr MACKELLAR,RATES,"There is no leadership in this debate, and the honourable member for Calwell, interjecting from the front bench, alluded to that. There are no Government objectives around which the community, the media and academia can crystallise and direct their thinking. It is tremendously important that there is a structured debate on immigration. It is a very difficult area. It is an area which leads to a great deal of confusion 'in the minds of people throughout the community. It is an emotional area. A proper and rational debate on immigration is not served by the ad hoc way in which this Government is dealing with these situations. As I have said, the need for factual and rational input is vital in such a reactive area as immigration. Misinformation and disinformation are all too prevalent. For example, the three most common claims I hear in the community at present are that it is the heavy migrant intake that has caused the spiralling house prices in Australia, particularly in Sydney; that Australia's population will decline unless we have immigration; and that we can counter the ageing or greying of Australia by an immigration program that emphasises young people. On the first point-housing-the National Population Council recently completed a study on this subject and concluded that housing prices are largely the result of interest rate movements, not immigrants. It is a particular policy of this Government, and we all know that the Treasurer has a manic determination in that area. On the matter of our population and its growing problems, I have seen material from a demographer at the Australian National University which suggests that high immigration levels are not necessary either to counter a shrinking population or to solve our greying problem. This is a matter which needs more investigation and more rational debate, but it is not getting it at preSent. Mr Hand-,Oh, come on!",82
110,Mr MACKELLAR,RATES,"The Minister can interject. He has not been out in the real world if he does not understand that there is enormous confusion about the immigration area right across the board. I give these examples only to illustrate that the work now being undertaken by the Bureau of Immigration Research and others is urgently needed if we are to cut through the sheer nonsense that passes for sensible debate on immigration issues and also to provide a factual base for future decision making. Many people are unaware that Australia has the highest rate of population growth of any developed country, largely due to its high level of immigration. Australia's net intake of migrants per head of population is about two or three times the level for Canada and the United States, the only other two developed countries to maintain an active immigration program. Moreover, the immigration intake has fluctuated widely over the postwar years, averaging about 80,000 but trebling, for example, from 50,000 in 1983-84 to the target of 140,000 in 198990. The time has come for Australia to take the present debate beyond the matter of migrant numbers and their composition. There is a need to create the framework which will determine the shape and health of this nation into and beyond the year 2000. That, of course, necessitates a national population policy. Why not have a policy which sets a population target for the year 2010 or even beyond and work towards that in a systematic and orderly manner, with a stable and structured immigration intake year to year that tops up the natural increase and meets. specified language and skill requirements? In the democratic environment of which we are so rightly proud, a population policy would provide a framework within which the Australian people could discuss and decide important economic and social matters. It would be a first and an tant step towards being the clever country that the Government talks so much about. We need a well thought through national population policy. This Government has not even addressed the concept of one. It should do so so that we can put this whole immigration debate into a rational and factual framework.",82
111,Mrs CROSIO,RATES,"I rise to speak on that part of the Appropriation Bill (No.1) 1990-91 dealing with immigration, local government and ethnic affairs. I wish to speak on a matter that has touched off some of the most controversial discussions in this nation. Mr Deputy Chairman, I am not speaking, as you are well aware, on the economy or on our industrial relations practices, which spoke on earlier today, but rather on immigration and its implications for the ture of Australia. Before I touch on those matters, I would like to deal with a couple of points made tonight by the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MACKellar) in his contribution to the committee stage of this Bill. One of the most misleading statements I have heard since I became a member of this Parliament would have to be-in his words-that we do not have a structured debate, that we have a confusion in the minds of the electorate, and that we really have a Minister who is not in the real world. I would like to refute everyone of those statements before I go on with what I would like to say tonight. First, we have as the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand)-and I am very appreciative of the fact that the Minister is here tonight-one of the most hands-on Ministers in a portfolio that I have had the opportunity to know; he has been out in the real world and has, as a Minister of this Government, related to and consulted with every different ethnic group in existence. As Australians, we are proud of a structured immigrant group within Australia and, most particularly, we-have had since 1983"""""""":since the Hawke Labor Government came into power-the most structured debate on immigration that this Government or any previous Government impor- could ever say needed to be had. In this debate we have heard talk about leadership. We have had leadership from not only the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), but also from the previous Ministers for Immigration. Most particularly, we have had leadership from this Minister for Immigration. I repeat: he is a Minister who is prepared to go into the electorates and meet, talk to and consult with ethnic groups; most importantly he is a Minister who is prepared to sit down and listen to alternative points of view, whether of the Immigration Regulations Committee of this Parliament or of a community group in an electorate such as Prospect. I have had the opportunity to welcome the Minister for Immigration, Local GovI ernment and Ethnic Affairs to my electorate on more than one occasion. I have fu- had the opportunity to welcome a Minister who is prepared to. sit down and give hours of time to debate and consultation. How dare the Opposition state that we do not have leadership in the debate! How dare it say that we do not have leadership in the Minister! Even the shadow Minister for immigration, the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), who shares an area very close to my electorate, would understand and appreciate this, and would have to get up and publicly acknowledge in this Parliament that this Minister is second to none in what he is trying to achieve in this Government. In speaking to the Appropriation Bill before the chamber, I would like to say that we have substantially increased the budgetary allocation for the 1990-91 fiscal year in a number of key immigration areas. I also acknowledge that in light of the tight fiscal constraints, I applaud the Government's courage in placing priority on an area where Australia has so much invested for its future growth. In almost any electorate I am sure honourable members can relate the usual urban legends concerning the illegal immigrant and how he or she eventually and inexplicably became an Australian citizen. My experience is that this practice is indeed an urban legend and the facts do not reflect the true story of the many thousands of highly qualified and industrious immigrants who make up the vast majority of our immigration intake each year. However, I am sure that, to use another cliche, where there is smoke, there is fire, and I commend the Government's decision to spend $16.587m on the employment of extra staff and the provision of additional facilities to tighten controls upon the of people into and out of Australia. Once prospective immigrants have been duly approved for migration to Australia their difficulties do not stop. The National Population Council in its Population Report No.9, published in May 1990-1 note that the Opposition did not like to refer to that-examined the issue of migration from Australia and came up with some interesting facts. Most of the people who immigrate to Australia and then emigrate within a relatively short period of time have a skilled or semiskilled background, and over half of the former settlers who emigrate will probably do so within five years of settlement in Australia. By percentage terms the largest loss is within the first year of settlement in Australia, followed by a substantial peak in the third year. It is obvious that minimising these departures is important to this Government. Australia as a whole is responsible for considerable direct and indirect economic and social losses associated with each departure. Further, recent statistics published by the Bureau of Immigration Research under the heading, 'Settler Arrivals 198889', stated that in that period our immigration population comprised Asian, 39 per cent; European, 29 per cent; and, Oceanian, 19 per cent. The number of non-English speaking or non-native English speaking migrants is, needless to say, increasing. Rather than simply depositing these peoples on our shores and forcing them to cope as best they can, or if they cannot cope, to leave for another country, the Hawke Labor Government has increased the assistance they can receive through the migrant settlement program. In fact, the Budget documents presented in this chamber-I would like the Opposition to read them just once-show that a $17.322m a year increase has occurred in settlement projects. Equally as important, the Government has reaffirmed its commitment to having all migrants in a position to fully utilise their talents in our country as soon as possible. Again, the purveyors of the urban myth would have it that each new immigrant is provided with a car and a house by the flow Australian Government, but this is simply, as we all realise, not the case. What we as a country have done is to build upon the valuable lessons we have learnt from the postwar immigration boom where, for perhaps the first time, the bulk of migrants did not have a native English speaking background. The obvious lesson to be learnt is that for a new migrant to participate in the community and to become quickly a net contributor to Australia's development, assistance in the first months or years is crucial. The assistance could be in language skills, induction into Australian economic and social institutions, or simply pointing the way to prospective employment. In my electorate, one that is noticeable for its large proportion of non-Australian born citizens, I am constantly amazed and particularly heartened by the massive strides these people have made in their economic prosperity, not by Government hand-outs or by corporate plundering, but by sheer hard work and determination. This, I strongly believe, is the true measure of the success of our immigration program. Another issue which has also been addressed in this Budget will further improve the ability of new immigrants to prosper in this country-the improvement in the process of recognition of overseas qualifications. This vexing problem is not, as the popular media would have us believe, limited to migrating doctors, lawyers and accountants; it affects every migrant, from the tradesman to the university professor. This Government has established the National Office of Overseas Skills Recognition (NOOSR). This office forms part of the Department of Employment, Education and Training. The purpose of NOOSR is to assist in the validation of overseas trades and professional qualifications for use in Australia. Finally, I also welcome the establishment in May 1989and the continuation of its funding this year-of the independent professional research body, the Bureau of Immigration Research.",83
112,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,RATES,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,85
113,Mr TRUSS,RATES,"ln this debate on the estimates for the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs I want to refer to local government. The fact that local government is mixed in with the unrelated areas of immigration and ethnic affairs reflects the jumbled thinking and low priority accorded to local government by this Federal Government. The major item in the Federal Budget involving local government is the $699.3m allocation as assistance to local councils. This represents an increase of some 3.2 per cent on last year but, as the Budget Papers acknowledge, that is an effective decline of 2.9 per cent. What is more, the projections for the next three years indicate that increases will continue to be below the level of inflation. While the Federal Government has increased its own expenditure in the Budget, it expects local government to cut its costs. Again, this reflects Labor's attitude to local government. There is an unwillingness to recognise local authorities as partners in the business of government. There is a lack of consultation and local government is not offered the opportunity to participate in its own destiny. Local government assistance is tied to the level of general purpose payments to the States. The amount paid to local government is not dependent on its own performance, efficiency or achievements, but, rather, on how much the States are able to win during that annual comic opera, the Premiers Conference. It is something of a three-act farce-it begins with the opening bids, followed by the pre-scripted outrage, and then the eventual capitulation. The actual financial involvement of local government is dependent upon what is won by other people-the premiers of the States. So it is essential that somehow or other local government be given improved access to the decision making processes which involve its own expenditure of funds. The local government grants were introduced in 1973 as part of the Whitlam Government's grand plan to eliminate the States and establish regions. The Grants Commission Act 1973 established some 76 regions comprising of the then 885 local authorities. The, regions proved to be a disaster and, fortunately, the grants have been paid to individual councils ever since. The Fraser Government entrenched the principle of Federal assistance to local government with its Local Government (Personal Income Tax Sharing) Act 1976. This guaranteed a fixed share of personal income tax receipts to local government-a share that was originally set at 1.52 per cent but which rose to 2 per cent by 1980-81. The Hawke Government was elected with a promise to increase that share over the years to 5 per cent but, like most of the Hawke Government's promises, it was soon broken. The Government set up an inquiry into local government finance called the Self Report. This was used as an excuse to end hypothecation for local government and, subsequently, local government has suffered a steady decline in its funding. Local government is critically dependent for its survival on continuing participation in income tax sharing. The traditional source of local government funding-property rates-is an inequitable tax which has no bearing on the capacity to pay and which disadvantages landowners who pay for services that they frequently do not need or do not use. Now that we have universal suffrage, local government power rests in the hands of voters who do not have to pay the bill. So it is essential that the revenue base local government be broadened. Australia should rethink its overall attitude towards local government and recognise the capacity of local government to improve the delivery of government services to the nation. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) this afternoon spoke in Question Time of the forthcoming Premiers Conference and of his hope that that would place a new form of federalism on the agenda for the next century. The role of local government is, of course, vital in any new arrangement of powers between the various tiers of government. It is essential that local government also play some role in that process. I hope that the Prime Minister, in preparing his agenda for that particular gathering, will also take into account the needs and wishes of local government, because it will be vitally affected by those discussions. There is a tendency for State and Federal governments to offer pious platitudes about the role of local government, to pat the 900 councils and 10,000 aldermen and councillors on their heads and tell them how to do their job. We refer to them as the third tier of government, but that very implication-the use of the word 'tier'implies that other levels of government are on top of local government. Federal and State governments fail to recognise a real partnership in government with the local authorities of Australia. They are not mere creatures of the State and should not be treated as such. They should be regarded as equal partners in government with specific roles and responsibilities. There are many things that they do better than other tiers of government and we should be prepared to recognise that fact. It is often said that local government is closest to the people. Part of the reason for that is the way in which other tiers of government, State and Federal, have moved so far away from the people. Local government deals with the day to day issues in every community. It deals with the complaints about dogs, potholes, long grass and the like, and it responds to those complaints. It is not isolated with the rich and famous, flitting around like the Treasurer (Mr Keating) on VIP flights. for Local councillors drive on the roads. They live with the people and so they respond to their needs. They are directly involved with the day to day quality of life issues. So we ought to recognise their right to make decisions which are the best for their community. The States should not expect uniformity in local decisions. If they are different from one place to another, that reflects local views. If they favour local industries, that is not some kind of corruption, but, rather, it is a desire to encourage local business. Local councillors know their areas better than the local government Minister or some should academic bureaucrat. We need to remember as well that local government is subject to elections and the disciplines of the democratic process like every other. tier of government. The real strength of local government is, of course, its localism. If one takes the 'local' out of local government, all one is left with is government-big, uncaring, remote, insensitive government. So if we want to speak in terms of local government as a tier of government, instead of calling it the third tier of government it should, in fact, be regarded as the first tier. It was the first type of. government established and it was the one that local communities were keen to have developed in their areas. The pioneers sought to· have local government established in their communities because it recognised progress and guaranteed that somebody would be there fighting for their interests. State governments should not adopt a heavy-handed attitude and try to manipulate the electoral systems or make laws without consulting local government and then expect local gov-rnment to administer them. Labor has tended to use .local government as a tax collecting agency, and that also is deplorable, particularly when it takes away from the local community the right to have some involvement in the way in which those taxes are actually used. There is a tendency on the part of all tiers of government to give local government responsibility but no money. The Federal Government, in particular, has been very good at introducing social welfare programs, offering local government a little bait to get involved with a small grant, and then, as soon as the program is established, walking away from it and leaving local government with the community expectation that it will maintain that program. When a responsibility is given there is also a need to give with it the funds to carry it out, or, at least, an appropriate share in the taxing mechanisms of the country. These estimates include small hand-outs for some small projects-for social engineering and academic research-which I think may be better used by struggling local authorities to fund their essential programs. It is, therefore, a problem for local ernment that it is currently caught in a financial vice. Federal assistance reductions, cuts in road funding, abolition of the aerodrome local ownership plan, the loss of State subsidies, the imposition of taxes such as the fringe benefits tax and the training levy, the fuel pricing policy and fuel taxes, along with the increased responsibilities, are creating significant nancial difficulties. It is not the fault of local government that the Federal Government has made a mess of the economy, yet local government is being forced to exercise the restraint. It is high time that we recognised local government as a genuine partner in the administration of the nation, that we recognised its particular qualities and attributes, and that we involved it in its own destiny.",85
114,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,RATES,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,87
115,Mr ALDRED,RATES,"The Hawke Labor Government has in this financial year allocated the sum of $311,824,000 to the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (DILGEA) in Appropriation Bill (No.1). I will not argue with the size of this allocation. I believe it should allow for a significant increase in the number of staff in those sections dealing with the detention and deportation of the tens of thousands of illegal migrants who now plague this country. There was, of course, a time when DILGEA had the major departmental influence over our migration program. Unfortunately, this influence appears to have been weakened as a result of bureaucratic and political power plays and the meddling of a range of other Government departments and their Ministers in immigration matters. One of the departments responsible for most of this meddling has b'een the Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET). This Department has for several years been running what is in effect a de facto immigration schemethe education export industry. DEET and its Minister, the honourable member for gov- Fremantle (Mr Dawkins), were recently criticised by a researcher with the Federated Australian University Staff Association, Mr Michael Bartos, writing in the September issue of Australian Society. Bartos highlights a comedy of errors which began in 1988, when at a meeting of State and Federal Education Ministers the Minister outlined his grand vision for a selffiregulating export education industry. The grand vision had flaws,. one of which was that the self-regulated industry attracted an enormous number of illegal immigrants. In an effort to stem this flow, the Government hastily introduced the requirement for the prepayment of fees and living expenses. This attempt at control gave an industry containing many companies of a dubious nature access to a healthy cash flow. Moreover, it was a cash flow that they could use as they wanted. Experience has shown the funds were seldom used to benefit the student. DEET, in the heat of its frenetic expan. sion of the education export industry, actually spurred the industry on to additional absurdities and it was soon offering courses as di verse as martial arts and beauty therapy. In a further blunder, having allowed the schools to commence DEET made no effort to check or control the standard of education they offered. As Bartos points out, the Minister and his Department made yet another blunder. In their obsession with making a quick quid, they failed to heed the advice of DILGEA and I am sure every basic tenet of business principles. They mistook the product they were selling as being education when in fact it was visas and the chance to live in Australia. If they had realised this, of course they could have made an even greater financial killing. There are still sections of the education export industry, other than those who missed the large cash flow, who resent the re-emergence of DILGEA and its efforts to correct the excesses of past years. the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, adopting the rationale that the industry is an important source of export earnings, has, according to the Australian of 3 October this year, claimed that DILGEA's intrusion into the overseas students program threatened to 'spread confusion and jeopardise the success of the whole project'. The vice-chancellors are upset with DILGEA for increasing the student visa application fee from $20 to $100 and the pre-visa application fee from $30 to $230, and have branded the increases as 'a cynical exploitation'. Perhaps DILGEA hopes, as I do, that these increases will discourage at least some who eventually become illegal migrants from coming to Australia. They have also been critical of the fact that DILGEA and DEET are now asking the institutions to do all of the work associated with the renewal of visas and Medicare payments. The vice-chancellors argue that these tasks are clearly the responsibility of the Government. As I am aware that there have been instances where institutions have retained these Medicare funds for their own use, I would not disagree that the responsibility should be taken from the schools. I would argue, however, that the students should be responsible for submitting their own paperwork. I am delighted that we finally have firm evidence of DILGEA belatedly cleaning up this industry. The first deportations of English language students who had either overstayed or were working in contravention of their visas were carried out on 5 October last. It is important to mention that before the deportations took place, the students were visited by officials of the Chinese consulate who assured them that they would not be punished on their return to China. Since I last spoke in this chamber on the education export industry, I have received further information concerning the unwillingness of DEET to do its part in cleaning up the industry. One concerned gentleman who had been a teacher at several of the English language schools actually wrote to DEET, in utter frustration at the abuses he was aware of, requesting a meeting to outline his concerns. The Department appears at this stage to be unwilling to hold the meeting. If it ever does take place, this former teacher will be able to provide information on colleges and students clearly flaunting government regulations. Perhaps the teacher should have written to DILGEA which, given its new found attitude of responsibility towards the industry, would have taken action on his request. The consequences of DEET's blunders in respect of the education export industry are, I have been told, also of great concern to Australia's long established Chinese community. This normally peaceful community appears to be splitting on the issues of the decision of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to allow the approximately 20,000 Chinese students to remain in Australia, and the character and education of those who were granted a four-year visa. Large sections of the Chinese community firmly hold the view that only a mere handful of those students would have faced persecution had they returned to China. They believe a naive Australia, which will end up paying millions in welfare payments, has been cheated by these so-called students. It must be said that DILGEA's efforts to clean up the industry are slowly having an impact on DEET. DEET, in association with the Victorian State Training Board and DILGEA, has formed an investigation team to conduct another review of the private colleges in the industry. The information I have obtained from the industry would indicate that the investigation team is choosing those schools with a good track record to study. One must ask whether this investigation will be simply a whitewash of the industry. I would suggest that if these organisations are conducting a serious investigation of the industry, they should have a further look at the martial arts school, the World Wing Academy, based in Melbourne and run by kung-fu master William Cheung. In an earlier review of this college DEET banned the institution from accepting overseas students. In the words of the Assistant Secretary of the Overseas Students Programs Branch, Ms Jennifer Ledgar, in a letter to William Cheung on 16 January 1989, the ban was placed because there were 'substantial deficiencies in the administration of the Academy'. The letter states that these deficiencies included, amongst other things, inaccurate attendance records, widespread nonattendance at classes, the improper issue of certificates of satisfactory attendance, and inadequate class timetables. In the light of these extensive failings I cannot understand why the ban was removed so soon after imposition and the Academy was allowed to accept overseas students again. My belief is that problems with the Academy in fact continue, and I wait with anticipation to learn of the findings of the investigation team-that is, if it should ever choose to investigate the industry thoroughly. Australia's immigration policy has been hijacked in the last few years by all manner of government departments and the immigration club. The most notable of these interlopers has been the Department of Employment, Education and Training, which appears almost to have as its sole agenda item the goal of having the industry make a great deal of money very quickly. In pursuit of this obsession, DEET regrettably appears to have had little regard for the integrity of Australia's immigration program. I trust that the size of this year's Budget allocation will assist DILGEA in reasserting control over the immigration program, and thus modify DEET's erratic ambitions. In conclusion, I seek leave to table the letter written by Ms Jennifer Ledgar concerning the World Wing Academy. Leave granted.",87
116,Mrs CROSIO,RATES,"1 acknowledge that I have jumped to speak again in considering these appropriations, and thank the shadow spokesman on immigration and ethnic affairs, the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), for enabling me to do so. I rise because of statements that have been made tonight by the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss). I do not believe that this Parliament and the Hansard which becomes the history of this chamber can allow the statements that have come forward from the honourable member for Wide Bay to be recorded without anyone speaking against them and, as I would like to do, providing the facts of the matter. Never let it be said that local government, as I have stated, is about what the honourable member for Wide Bay has said. Local government is democracy within Australia. Local government in New South Wales-a State which I can speak very proudly of-was established as the first government of this country. In fact, I do not proudly say before this chamber that the first vote given to local government in New South Wales was given by the land owner. Fortunately we have changed the voting structure and we have changed for the good. We now have a local structure that is not only democratic but is a structure that is recorded, with its voting patterns, within the legislation of the State of New South Wales. We also have a democracy that is set up, as it has often been referred to, as 'a child of the State'. I would like to say local government over the years, being the first government in power in this country, has become more than a child of the State. It is a power that has truly come of age. Local government deals with more than just roads, rates and rubbish. Too often we have heard people stand up in all areas of government and say: 'What is local government? It only deals with the roads and the cost of their structure; it deals with the rates and their collection; and it deals with the rubbish and its collection'. Local government today has come of age. Local government deals with more than roads, rates and rubbish. Local government in its democracy deals with the community; it deals with the involvement of and advancement for the community's local areas, from the cities to the municipalities to the shires, and particularly the country areas to which the honourable member for Wide Bay referred. But, most importantly, local government in its democracy has forthcoming people who care; people who stand up in their community and say, 'I wish to participate in and be involved with the structure of my local community'. That is what local government is all about. Local government is about those volunteers who give of their time so generously, day in and day out, week in and week out, year in and year out-in the State of New South Wales for a four-year term. People have to acknowledge and accept the responsibility when they put themselves forward to become the elected representatives of their particular shire, municipality or city. Mr Deputy Chairman, 1 speak in a voice of local government. I did not expect this debate to come forward because 1 was down to speak on immigration, but as 1 speak tonight I am very fortunate to have the Mayor of my City of Fairfield in the gallery. 1 speak as a person who .came through local government, a person who can stand proudly in this House of the federal sphere and say that 1I have spent nine years in local government-four of those years as mayor of my city, one of those years as deputy mayor and, very proudly, two of those years as Minister of that Local Government. So anyone in this Parliament, and particularly in the Opposition, who gets up and denigrates local government is saying to those elected people out there, 'We do not acknowledge your responsibility; we do not acknowledge what you are all about; and we do not acknowledge what the Federal Government has done to achieve, accept, preserve and promote local government'. It was not until the Whitlam Government came into power in 1972 that local government of this country had an opportunity of sharing the tax revenue. It was not until that era that local government finally became recognised as part of the third sphere-never tier, but sphere-of government. That is an acknowledgment that it is part of the government structure of this country. It was the Whitlam Labor Government, followed by Fraser, I will admit, and then, most particularly, the Hawke Labor Government that promoted and projected the worthiness of local government and promoted it to the extent of not only appointing a Minister for Local Government in this Federal Parliament, but also of acknowledging that local government will become part of the debate at the Premiers' Conference that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has orchestrated and organised to make sure that we have an input from the premiers of all States and Territories and, most particularly, from representatives of the Australian Local Government Association. Local government has come of age because of the commitment of the Labor Party and the Labor Government. Local government has come of age because so many hundreds of people out there in the electorates at large have been giving, are giving and will continue to give of their time to be involved with and to be part of their community. Local government has come of age because of their commitment-both past, present and, 1 believe, future. That is what local government is all about. It is about concern; it is about commitment; but, most importantly, it is about acknowledgment-acknowledgment that the Hawke Labor Government and the Labor Party in particular has given throughout Australia to local government and local government as a third sphere of power within Australia. Mr Deputy Chairman, I thank you for the indulgence given to me once again to raise the issue in this section of the debate on the Appropriation Bill. I particularly acknowledge and appreciate that the shadow Minister for immigration, the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), has allowed me to take part in the debate. But, most importantly, I appreciate the fact that I have had the opportunity to have recorded in this House the fact of local government and local government people. People are commitment and commitment is progress in Australia.",89
117,Mr RUDDOCK,RATES," Mr Deputy Chairman, the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) invited me to conclude the remarks I was going to make about the preoccupation of the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs with manner and form. I was emphasising that the report of the Committee to Advise on Australia's Immigration Policies, headed by Dr Stephen FitzGerald, was the Government's landmark review on immigration policy-the report which sought to focus on Australia's future direction so far as immigration policy was concerned, and to give a clear economic signal on the way in which the program was structured. I had said that those efforts had been subsumed by the recommendat,ions to legislate for a new model migration Act. I went on to comment that the designer model, which FitzGerald had put together as a proposed Bill, was substituted for an Act which the Department designed, along with regulations, and it has been the subject of a great deal of comment as to its detail and complexity. I also indicated that the task was one in which the courts were now making some observations, and Mr Justice Wilcox commented: The task of ascertaining the position in relation to a particular applicant or a particular type of visa or entry permit is akin to feeling one's way through a labyrinth. I have to say that, when one looks at the large number of amendments that have been made and the regulations which are being made weekly along with booklets published about the form in which processing may be undertaken, one realises that it is a task of enormous difficulty and complexity even for the most experienced practitioners to be able to find their way through the new Act and regulations. We have this situation where there are programs for training staff, recruitment of departmental lawyers, appearances before the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations, and a whole lot of intellectual effort being put into matters of detail rather than substance-and that has become the norm. It is a preoccupation of manner and form over substance and principle, and I have to say that the abandonment of the old system of discretion and judgment has come at a very high price. All of this is compounded by the Minister and his Department's new d_efensive position and secrecy. There is already an unreasonable reliance on privacy laws designed to obscure the public interest, even where the law designates that there are public interest factors involved in determination of migration applications. The obvious example of that is the case of the Imam of the Lakemba Mosque in which the Minister has made a decision, it appears, behind a closed door, without explanation of the sort that was given to the Parliament by his predecessor when he made a decision merely to grant this man temporary entry. This is a brief catalogue, I believe, of the Government's lamentable failure in the administration of the migration program which has undoubtedly led to the most significant undermining of confidence in the Government that I have seen in my 17 years in Parliament. , I have to say that the remarks made by the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous)-who takes the view that immigration should not be the subject of debate or discussion unless views conform with his own-deserve some comment. He believes that there is a role for me in demanding of the Liberal Party's Federal Council that it should neither entertain nor discuss resolutions on immigration matters, unless I have given a lead in relation to what members should say or think. I must say that the view of my Party is that immigration is a matter that ought to be on the agenda, ought to be capable of being discussed, ought to be the subject of sound and sensible contributions. We believe that at our Federal Council there can be a debate of that character, and I am certainly not going to try to prevent that from occurring. As I said in the public comments that I offered in relation to the matter, the Council will make its own determinations; it will make its own judgments; it will carry its own resolutions. When such resolutions are dealt with by our Council, they are persuasive, but they are not mandatory; they are not binding on the parliamentary Party-unlike the situation that exists with the Government. They are expressions of view which we would certainly consider and take into account. The honourable member for Calwell also took up by way of comment the fact that the issue of sham marriages is one that the Minister has referred to the Joint Committee on Migration Regulations. I acknowledge that that is so. I acknowledge that there was an inquiry by the National Population Council in relation to this matter. The point I make is that the problem continues to exist. It may well be that the outcome of the Population Council's inquiry will ultimately have an impact. But at this very time the fact is that the statistics for migrant entry are affected by the large number of marriages that are entered into merely for the purpose of gaining entry to Australia. The point I made is still very sound in relation to that. Finally, the honourable member for Calwell made some comments about the views of my colleague the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Aldred). He tried to be disparaging of the fact that the honourable member for Deakin has some views on immigration questions. I would simply draw to the attention of the honourable member for Calwell some comments made by one of his own colleagues. I would like to hear what he has to say about those. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) is always quite interesting in the contributions he makes. I gather that he said that there ought to be a one-year ban on all immigration while we assess our needs; that there ought to be a phase-out of family reunion, a drastic reduction in overall migrant numbers, an end to public funding of all ethnic schools, an immediate ban on immigration from fundamentalist Islamic cultures, and what he calls a winding back of the power and influence of the ethnic industry. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie writes further that those who run the ethnic industry will cry racist; this is the old fascist strategy of attacking the person, not the argument. He says that by world standards ours is a very tolerant country but there are limits of toleration and it will be a sorry day if misguided altruism and other factors push us beyond tolerance; the argument is about culture, not race. I am not subscribing to those views; they are not mine. They are the views of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, a member from the other side of the House. But if the honourable member for Calwell is about challenging members not to have views on this issue, let him start with his own colleague before he starts casting around for those on this side who are encouraged to speak out on issues of public importance and are certainly entitled to put views before this Parliament and other places. If the Opposition comes to the view that its policy in relation to migration questions should be varied, at that time. I will make statements on behalf of the parliamentary parties-the National Party of Australia and the Liberal Partywhich set out the coalition's position.",91
118,Mr HAND,RATES,"Melbourne-Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs) (10.13)- Mr Deputy Chairman, I thank you for the opportunity to enter the debate. There have been a number of issues raised by honourable members on both sides. In particular, one dealt with another department, namely, the Department/of Employment, .Educati-n and Training (DEET), and I will certamly refer those comments to the appropriate Minister, with the name of the academy, and draw his attention to the letter the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Aldred) tabled. However, I should commence my remarks by referring to the shadow Minister for immigration and ethnic affairs, the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), who made a number of comments dealing with the portfolio. In a very short space of time-l 0 minutes-he tried to cover a fairly wide range of issues. I will try to respond by involving myself in all the points made by various speakers on both sides of the chamber. As someone said, immigration is a fairly controversial issue from time to time. Therefore, I think there are four words that we ought to pay attention to. These four words were brought to my attention at the recent Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils of Australia conference in Darwin: the program must be humane, compassionate, predictable and fair. The shadow Minister would know those four words as he has heard me address them before. When I came into this job I had the reputation of being a person who wrote a lot of letters to the Minister responsible for immigration because of my own electorate. I am having great difficulty answering all those letters I wrote. Mr Ruddock-Are they not answered yet?",92
119,Mr HAND,RATES,"Some of them are proving very tricky from this particular spot. I am doing my best. When I was on the back bench writing all those letters to the Minister I passionately believed in a fair system. Without a fair system we have no system. I come to the job from that point. We have to have a humane policy and program. Under this Government and the previous Government this country has been recognised around the world as having an attitude which is humane and second to none for its contribution towards people in need on different occasions and at different times, depending on who is in government. A compassionate policy is one which is able to adjust from time to time to take account of the particular needs of particular individuals as they arise. Under the new regulations that came into play last year there was a view on both sides of the House that perhaps we were not quite as compassionate as we ought to be. It is no good people on the Opposition side or our side being too critical. I get letters from everybody. I am getting those on this side of the chamber more o'r less trained now, but the letters are still flooding in from the other side. Let us not pretend that members of the Opposition are any better or any worse than we are on this side in writing letters about cases of great compassion that they come across in their electorates. We provided an ability for those cases to be looked at when we announced today our new proposals for illegals and for cases prior to 19 December last year. Then we come to predictability. When something is not predictable we get enormous confusion and concern and tensions develop because peopJe cannot read the play. Whether we are dealing with primary industry policies or whatever, people like to see the policy as being predictable. It could relate to local government matters, as was commented on earlier by the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss). People like to see things as predictable. In immigration we are dealing with people, and to have something that is predictable is very important. I am trying to get in place a regime which is predictable to the person in the street. We are going to release very shortly a guide to procedures document which is not the string of pamphlets that we see in the Department but a single document which gives a guide to members of parliament and interested persons on the forms that are required to address a particular situation, what people have to do, what type of visa is required, et cetera. All the relevant information will be on a card system within a folder, and that will become available very shortly. We have done this because of the large numbers of people who have sought extensive volumes of listed documents. That is no good because the material needs updating, and we run the risk as members of parliament of giving wrong information because of the failure of someone in our offices or ourselves update the material. This guide will very valuable for members of parliament. Predictable policy, predictable programs recommendations. in place, and rules and regulations are what people are looking for. Most importantly-if the shadow Mintee ister and the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Migration Regulations are interested-is that we have a system which is fair. The one thing we need in immiprogram gration is a system which is fair, and are striving here to get a fair system. What we did very early on was to reabout establish the Committee, which has repfindings. resentation from both Houses, to assist me in the development of a fair, predictchested able, compassionate and humane prothings gram. That is not done in all areas policy. I threw out a challenge to this House and to the Senate-God help me; it is a pretty generous gesture by me, given what I have had to put up with from that lot-to take part and try to help the Government and, what is more, the users of the program, to get a humane, compassionate, predictable and fair gime in place. The shadow Minister talked about the validity of marriages. Probably the trickiwhich est part of this job is to make judgments about whether somebody's marriage is ing okay. That is not easy. It is not a job I envied, but it is not a job for which anybody else has volunteered recentlymonths to give me advice about how to determine what is a valid marriage. The honourable member for Dundas has all the bright Victorians Mr ideas. It is no good coming in here and saying that we have not addressed the matter. He knows that the Committee has it on its books to look at the matter, assist us. I do not want to have a row with the honourable member, but it seems to me a little contradictory and unfair. met with him, as Deputy Chairman of Committee, and with the Chairman, and said, 'These are the key issues that examination'. They agreed, and I have those areas of policy. To start with, there was the illegals question. The Committee has reported on this matter. I have five reports in one-not a bad effort. I have tried to juggle all the balls and I to came down with a proposition today be which took on board some of the more significant ideas, but not necessarily the I also said that one of the key areas is the question of marriages. The Commitwill address that. I place on the record that I am quite relaxed about our trying to work together to get a possible humane, compassionate, predictable and fair in place. I have asked for the we Committee's help. I have challenged the Committee to find out what people think these things and report back on its Hopefully, next time around, Committee members will not be hairyand might agree on a few more and I will not have to put up with of five Committee reports in one. Illegals are a major problem for this country. We are experiencing a new phenomenon in immigration in this country. We are now a country of first asylum, which is quite new. In terms of what is happening in the rest of the world, the numbers are very small. In Germany last remonth, 24,000 illegals came through the borders in a month. There is talk of closing the borders to certain nationalities, is unheard of. If one goes to Europe one will see millions of people roamaround, trying to find a place. It is a that dreadful situation. These people are now described as displaced persons. Eighteen ago they may have been described as refugees, but not any more. Hawker-There might be a lot of in that situation very soon, given what is happening down there.",93
120,Mr HAND,RATES,"That is the sort of flipto pant, stupid remark that one gets used to hearing from the honourable member for Wannon. The poor old honourable memI ber, who is used to talking to sheep, does the not have much up top when it comes to people. I am trying to talk about a very need serious problem which this House must come to grips with, that is, the plight of people around the world. I hope that the Committee will address issues such as marriage and others, in terms of the humanitarian question, in the not too distant future. These are big issues, and big issues require a lot of hard work. I have no doubt that the Committee will do that. People have addressed remarks about the People's Republic of China nationals. I make no apology for the decision taken by the Government. People should cast their minds back to what happened in this place, in the Melbourne Town Hall and in the Sydney Town Hall-and I have said this beforewhere one had to fight the politicians to get on the stage because they all wanted to get into the act. I remember the Melbourne Town Hall meeting. I remember the distressed Chinese people in that auditorium. I remember the tears of those people. I remember the comments made by politicians from all political parties, plus the business sector and the trade union movement. There was .not a person in that hall who was under any illusion that those people were being invited to stay here. I make no apology at all. Somebody talked about division in the Chinese community. I have talked to a lot of Chinese people. Like everybody else, they were somewhat nervous about some of the more flamboyant, outrageous com- . ments made by some commentators. As the person who made the comments said, they are a very gentle community. They were frightened by and concerned about those comments. In fact, they raised those concerns with me. Is anybody seriously suggesting that those people should have been sent back to China in that situation? Of course not. For the sake of a few cheap shots, I remind people that it was not a good situation to be sending people back to. The post-20 June group is going to be considered case by case on the merits, along with other people. They will be given their rights, if they apply, depending on what they apply for, the same as everybody else. It was demonstrated in this building only a week ago when some 450 Chinese people from Melbourne and Sydney came here. Some of them who had earlier expressed some concern to me were present at that function with the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). Much has been made of the question of compliance. I make this comment: illegals are illegal, and illegals ought to go home. However, from time to time, as we all know, there are some people who fall between the stools in a compassionate sense and the annOl,mcement today addresses those situations. But queue jumpers are illegals and have a choice: they should regularise their position here or leave. We will apply our announcements in terms of the compliance proposals in a way not ever before applied. We are serious about it. I say that on the record so that people who are here illegally can take note of it. But there will always be situations, as honourable members know, of compassion that need addressing. Those compassionate cases are going to be addressed in the ways I described in the announcement today . Mention was made of migration agents. I am looking at that question. If the shadow Minister is inclined to discuss the matter with me, I welcome the opportunity to do so. In the· not too distant future I will seek him out to discuss that issue. Like him, I am concerned about the ripoffs that occur. I refer very briefly to Sheikh Al Hilaly. I will not make too much of the matter, but I have here some documents. I have yet to go out to the mosque but I know other people have been there. I know other people were in the mosque a week or so before the last election. I know what people told other people the week before the election. I know the hurt and disappointment of people in the community that their religious leader was referred to in this place in what they considered to be a very unfair way. It does the shadow Minister no good to talk in the way he did about the Treasurer (Mr Keating) at Question Time or his recent comments about the sheikh of a few moments ago or in his press release. Deep down he knows better. He is a better person than that and it did him no good at all. In the terms of the press release of 7 September 1989 by the then Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, the current Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray), the sheikh was given a 12 months temporary entry permit. Consideration interrupted.",94
121,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,RATES,"Order! It being 10.30 p.m., I shall report progress and ask leave for the Committee to sit again. Progress reported. NA",96
122,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Mr Staples-I propose that the queswrinkles tion be put forthwith without debate. Question resolved in the negative. APPROPRIATION BILL (No.1) 1990-91 In Committee Consideration resumed.,96
123,Mr HAND,ADJOURNMENT,"I will say no more on that matter. I could say a number of things but I think the point has been made in the debate. I have tried to address remarks to points that were made, such as those concerning the agents, the tions raised by the honourable member for Deakin regarding DEET, the question of compliance and the question of the illegals. I am trying to represent to the Parliament that I believe that we are working in a quite vigorous way to get very complex set of situations in place that we have an orderly and fair program which has integrity. It is very important that we strive together for that. I go back to the point about the mittee that we have established. It is important that that Committee work would closely with the Government and take the offer that we have made. probably become even a closer relationship as we work through other issues. The job does not stop at the end of this year when we finish with the marriage issue. asked the Committee to be a watchdog a set of ears to monitor how the regulawill tions and the legislation are affecting people out in the community. Lastly, let me say that there have been a couple of veiled criticisms of the Department. I do not accept those criticisms. I think the Department and myself accept the fact that we are, like most people on this planet, not always right. But we strive, like everybody else in this place, to get things right and to be as fair as we possibly can. The programs announced in the Budget include the continuation of programs that have been in place now for some time, some of which were commenced by the Opposition when it was in government. Through our continuing thrusts to iron out the wrinkles in the regulations, before long we will have any ironed out totally. People have asked why there are still a couple of problem areas. I could have just come in here and said, 'I have got all the answers'. Mr Smith-Never!",96
124,Mr HAND,ADJOURNMENT,"That is right-never. No one person has ever got all the answers. I have sought to get both sides of the chamber involved in addressing extremely difficult issues. I throw that challenge out. We on this side rest very easy. The my honourable member for Warringah, as a former Minister, said that we ought to get quesout and about. I am travelling more around Australia in this portfolio than in the last one, talking to community groups. I do not necessarily travel overseas, like some of those opposite or other people I could name who are never here. One cana not run departments by dealing with so people when one is sitting in an office in Canberra; one must get out and talk to people. If the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) wants to invite me Comto his electorate to talk to community very groups there, I would be happy to go. I be happy to visit the electorates of up people on both sides of the House-and That will have already done so. That is the way we can get this system working better. In the not too distant future, at Christmas, as usual, I will be in I Warrnambool in the electorate of the or honourable member for Wan non and I drop in on some of the community groups down there. The honourable member for Wannon will probably not be there; he always leaves town when I enter his electorate. But, if he wants me to, I will even go to the electorate of Wannon and talk to community groups there. The honourable member for Warringah touched on the question of the National Outlook Conference and the Bureau of Immigration Research. The work being done by the Bureau is outstanding and is of a very high quality. I look forward to the Outlook Conference in November because it will present to the people of Australia a foundation stone of knowledge on the questions associated with population and immigration, population versus the environment, infrastructure versus population, migration and movement of people. It will deal with all of these issues in a way never before addressed. Again Australia leads the world in terms of the preparation of material on this big issue. I challenge people to find any other country in the world that is leading Australia in this area. The material that is available here now, plus what is being produced, shows that we are leading the world in this area. If honourable members can get to that conference, they ought to go; they should get the papers and then we can commence to have an informed debate along the lines the honourable member for Warringah asked for. Mr Ruddock-It is in a sitting week.",96
125,Mr HAND,ADJOURNMENT,"You will be there, probably as the shadow spokesman, and maybe that is sufficient. Plenty of papers will be produced and they can be read by all of us. Then we will have an informed debate. There is no quick fix to this issue, no quick solution. It will take some time to address not only the migration and immigration issues that will come forward at that conference but also the question of population. Migration is not the total issue in a population debate; there are many other issues to be addressed. We ought not to confuse the issue of migration and see that as the whole issue regarding pc-pulation. It is not. It is a factor but it is the whole of the debate. That education point needs to be fully addressed right across the community as well. Again I have every confidence that we are mature enough in this place-and outside it, with the exception of a few hillbillies who will go off half-cocked-to have a mature discussion. It is the responsibility of this House and the other place to ensure that we have a responsible debate and a responsible discussion. It will be a lengthy discussion and, hopefully, it will be a thorough one that will arrive at proper decisions at the end of that period. I thank honourable members for their contributions to the debate and look forward. to working with people during the coming year.",97
126,Mr RUDDOCK,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Deputy Chairman, I claim to have been misrepresented. The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) in his remarks referred to someone having visited the Lakemba Mosque a week before the election. He knows he was referring to me and I know he was referring to me. He then referred to the fact that I had asked certain questions in the House and his deduction from that was that the questions I asked were at variance with the observations I had made at the Lakemba Mosque. I recall well being there and I recall well what I said. The principle issue that was discussed with me was my criticism of the decision that I thought might have been taken by the Minister's predecessor relating to Mrs Hilaly. On the question in relation to the sheikh, I indicated in my public statement that I thought temporary entry of one year was an appropriate decision for the former Minister to make. My view was that other matters relating to the pubic interest factors would be considered when a question of granting permanent entry was looked at. My concern that I have expressed outside this place and by way of a question I asked of the Minister related to why a decision was made in relation to the Imam case, where certain public interest factors not are involved, without further public announcement, without further public statement. That is still the question I have asked and I do not believe that puts me in any conflict with what I have said previously, either at the mosque or anywhere else.",97
127,Mr HAND,ADJOURNMENT,"Melbourne-Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs) (10.41)-1 will take my second opportunity to speak. The honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) has taken the matter further than I intended. However, let me say this: I was referring to the fact that the honourable member for Dundas named in his question a number of people whom he thought-I repeat, thought-had made representation on behalf of an individual. That mayor may not have been true. What I was pointing out was that I do not think that that sort of comment did anybody any good. It is most unusual for me, my sor or future Ministers to be confronted with the proposition that we should make public announcements about individual cases. I would have to be pretty naive if I thought for one minute that the decision about this particular individual was going to remain in club and not become known. I never hid the fact but I did not put a press release out, if that is what the honourable member for Dundas means. I did not put a press release out. What I thought I might do is this: just as I am required to table details in this place every time. I make a decision, I might start naming people who make approaches to me to let somebody stay every time that happens. That might not be a bad idea and then we will really have a program with integrity. Not only will my decisions be properly known but I ought to start thinking about whether I, alongside that decision, name the honourable members who in fact made representation. Then it would all be out in the open. Then there would be no secrets. All I said to the honourable member for Dundas was that I do not think it has done the honourable member any good or anybody else any good to raise that issue in that way. I cast no aspersions other than to say that I do not think that that is the proper way to address the issue. I know that members of other communities knew about it. There was no secret about it. It is just ludicrous to try to turn the fact that I did not put a press release out into some sort of mystery or to say that I was trying to deceive or to hide something about a well known identity when hundreds-perhaps thousands-of people would be told within hours that he had been allowed to stay. It is just ludicrous to pretend that somehow I tried to deceive or put something over everybody, and the honourable member knows better. That is the point I am making. Perhaps we ought to give serious consideration to putting all the cards on the table. When I have to come in here and say whom I have let in, I might start naming everybody who has made an approach to me. Then we would flush them out. There is a former Minister over predecesthere-the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MACKellar)-who is beginning to have a smirk on his face. It would be really interesting, would it not? We would read the Who's Who of the lobbyists then, by golly. We would know who is pushing what community, what community concentrates in particular electorates and all those things. We could really have a ball in here day after day saying, 'Ah, hal The honourable member for a particular electorate was named 25 times. He has written 25 times to the Minister about a particular community'. Think of the fun we could have with that. Just think of the fun we could have with that as we ripped each other apart with no concern towards the community at all but just to have a bit of fun across the chamber. That was the point I was making. I do not want to go into great detail about the individual but it is an example of how an issue can get out of hand.",98
128,Mr TRUSS,ADJOURNMENT,"1 want to respond briefly to some of the comments made by the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio). It does somewhat surprise and disappoint me that she suggested that I had in some way denigrated local government. I certainly do not question her credentials in that field. In fact, she uniquely has held a position in each level of government and so she should have some understanding about the way in which local government has in fact operated. But nor should she question my credentials. It was on the basis of my 14 years in local government that I was compelled tonight actually to make an appeal: in our consideration of the relationship between the various tiers of government we ought to recognise the special qualities that local government can offer our society. There are many things that local government is able to do better than other tiers of government and we should recognise that and be proud of that contribution to our society. I made the point that localism is something that we ought to recognise, regard as useful and encourage. We should therefore acknowledge the particular role that local government has in our community. As the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the premiers move towards developing some kind of new arrangement between the various tiers of government in the years ahead, they would do well to recognise that there are some things that local government can perhaps do better than other tiers and that it ought to be given that opportunity and be resourced appropriately to do it. I am pleased to see that the Minister for Local Government (Ms Fatin) is present in the chamber. It is to be hoped that she will also be able to take up the cudgels and fight as strongly as possible to ensure that local government is indeed adequately resourced. It is nonsense to suggest that somehow or another local government is undemocratic or is not structured in a way that is appropriate for the various needs of that particular community. With more than 10,000 elected representatives around Australia, in many ways it could be argued that it is the most democratic of all the tiers. It is certainly closest to the people and in that role it certainly deals with the issues that are important to the quality of life of people at the local level. The other point that I want to make some response to is the honourable member's suggestion that somehow or other local government has done well under the Hawke Government. That clearly is a statement that will not stand up. True, we now have an Office of Local Government which has a budget, most of which is used for administration. Very little is effective in actually doing anything to make local government operate better in the community. Since we have the Hawke Government in place, we need to look at some of its record. One of the first things it did was to get rid of the personal income tax sharing Bill. That was the real guarantee that entrenched appropriate funding for local government into the future. I am pleased that the Hawke Government has continued some form of funding but since the elimination of that guarantee the share of personal income tax that has gone to local government has declined from 2 per cent in spite of the fact that the Hawke Government was elected on a promise that it would be increased to 5 per cent. It never reached anything like 5 per cent and it has declined in real terms every year since the Hawke Government was elected. If that is not enough, the Hawke Government has also succeeded in cutting into other areas of local government influence by reducing funding. Of course, the obvious one is the question of road funding, an area critical to local government. As the honourable member for Prospect said, local government is not just about roads, rates and rubbish. But roads are an important aspect of its program. Certainly in the seven years that the Hawke Government froze road funding, local government was a major sufferer. We welcome in this current Budget a small increase. But the bad news is that there is a projection of a further funding freeze for another three years ahead of us. So in the time that the Hawke Government has been in power-the time that the honourable member for Prospect says has been a great period for local government-the actual buying power of the available road funding has halved. That is a really deplorable record rather than one that the Labor Government should be proud of. We can look at so many other areas well where local government funding has been adversely affected by this governcertainly ment: the introduction of the fringe benenormous efits tax; the fuel taxes that it has imposed and which local government has to pay; and the imposition of the training This Government has put in place an exlearning tensive regime of taxation on one level government by another level and yet local government is unable to reciprocate. The Federal Government does not pay rates. The Federal Government does not contribute towards those kinds of essenthe tial community services. Yet it turns around and taxes local government. That was a most unfortunate development in the relationship between the various tiers of government. We can then look into a wide range other areas where, starving local governprepared ment of funding and yet giving it addielections. tional responsibilities, the Government is being just as effective in cutting local ernment's capacity to do the tasks which have been assigned to it. As the Minister at the table shuffles papers, she might be interested to know that nearly all the local authorities in local area have had to retrench staff over recent weeks for the first time since the election of the Whitlam Government. That is a direct result of cutbacks in Federal funding and, in particular, cutbacks also by the State Government in Queensland. It is particularly deplorable that in the very first Budget after the Goss Governonly ment was elected there have been these cutbacks in road funding. Projects that have been put in place and guaranteed over a period of years have been frozen and stopped because the new Minister for Transport, Mr Hamill, is denying funding to these vital road projects. I think it high time that members opposite used government some of their influence with the toe-cutter tive step. in the Goss Government to get funding flowing again for local roads to guarantee nary some kind of continuing employment in Goss record local communities. I do not know whether the former Mingovernment ister for Local Government in New South Wales, now the honourable member for as Prospect, is embarrassed about her own performance as the Minister, where she demonstrated the Labor Party's capacity to bully the lower tier of government into doing what it considered it ought to do. But certainly the new levy. Labor Government in Queensland is from somebody. In the short time of that it has been there, it is looking at recasting totally the electoral system, to manipulate it in a way that would suit the Labor Government and the various Labor councils around the place. In fact, Labor Party is so embarrassed about it that in many local towns and cities it has actually decided not to field teams in the forthcoming local government elections. It recognises that the people have rejected and will reject the appalling performance of this Federal Government and of the Goss Government and will not be to support Labor teams in local I think that is a constructive developgovment and a good thing that the Labor Party should decide not to be involved in local elections. There are many good her people who have been denied the opportunity to serve on a council because they my have run on a Labor team. People do not want to have party politics at the local government level. I have yet to see a Labor Party pothole or a Liberal Party pothole. The fact is that most of these local issues are not party political and they ought to be recognised as such. In our small councils where there are six, eight or 10 members, there is not enough room to waste half of the members as some kind of de facto opposition. All need to work together in the constructive interests of the community. I think that if the Labor Party follows the example set in some provincial cities and is steps back from contesting the next local elections it will be a construcWe have certainly seen an extraordiin the short period of the Government. Despite the fact that the Labor shadow Minister at the local conference in Townsville last year said that Labor did not believe in one vote one value for local government, the Government is moving as quickly as it possibly can to do that and to deny representation in many instances to the people funding the particular councils. It is preparing a smokescreen about ruption. I was interested to read in the Sunday Mail last week a banner headline on an article by Ken Blanch about corruption in local government. No doubt he was fed information from the Labor Minister, but when I read the whole lengthy article there was not a single allegation of corruption in it. It is obviously just an endeavour to create some degree of public ill will to encourage people and to set in place the mechanisms and the background for the kinds of massive changes that the Government proposes to introduce-to try to justify the massive alterations to the local government system that has served the State of Queensland for many years. It is a system that was put in place in many instances by the previous Labor Government and has continued to be supported by people in the community. So I appeal to this Government and to other governments to recognise the vital role of local government, to recognise its capacity to contribute to our society and to ensure that any review of federalism that takes place recognises that important role.",98

130,Mr CAMPBELL,ADJOURNMENT,"Kalgoorlie) (10.55)It was not my intention to participate in this debate, but the diatribe that I have just heard must be responded to. The seat of Wide Bay has a great credence in this House. I think it was recognised that the previous member for Wide Bay, Mr Clarrie Millar, was a very distinguished gentleman who had the affection and admiration of both sides of this House, and I am sure that we would not have heard such a diatribe from him. I think the current member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) should realise that the record of Labor governments in respect of local government is, without doubt, far superior to that of the Opposition. If it were not for Labor governments, a recognition of the role of local government and the sharing of personal income tax would never have been instituted. That is the cor- foundation of local government. To listen to the honourable member for Wide Bay, one would have thought that local government was entirely without blemish. Of course, this is absurd nonsense. Local government, like everything else, is good, bad and indifferent, and many local councils are very wasteful of ratepayers' money and contemptuous of ratepayers, while others respond much more effectively. There is no doubt that road funding has been well catered for. In fact, the Labor Government increased the percentage of road funding going to local government at a time when it was decreased overall. It was decreased overall for the very good reason that the national road program was running down and coming to an end and there was no great expenditure in new roads. I happen to believe that there is a need for ongoing funding. It was a quite rational decision at the time. The fact is that a Labor government increased the funding going to local government. The Local Government Association of Western Australia (Inc) did recognise this. The honourable member for Wide Bay was in local government for 14 years-I think 14 years of local government is enough for anyone-and it has obviously taken its toll. I sound that as the reason for the honourable member's outburst.",101
131,Mr CHARLES,ADJOURNMENT,"1 also had not expected to participate in this debate tonight, but the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand), unfortunately, made a very wild statement just prior to exiting the chamber, and I am afraid that I have got to call him on it. He stood at the box and virtually threatened this side of the House with naming anyone and everyone who had the audacity to write a letter of representation to him in retribution for some sirt, supposed or otherwise, committed by the shadow Minister for immigration. I think it ought to be made clear to Minister that he has recently made a deciation cision that impacts on all of us in electorates, and that is that the procedural advice manuals-in short, PAM-of the Department of Immigration, Local ernment and Ethnic Affairs will not be made available to members for use in their electoral offices. Therefore, we without vital information that we need order to answer questions from constituseven ents when they have problems in dealing with the Department and in understandtions; ing the regulations. If the Minister wants to keep this sive bureaucratic system to himself, well he may, but he had best be willing to answer the correspondence that occurs as a result of keeping that information himself. To have the audacity to stand at the box and threaten those members on this side of the House with retribution because of the inadequacies of his Denificance partment and his administration lute arrant nonsense, and the Minister should come back and at least apologise to this House.",101
132,Ms FATIN,ADJOURNMENT,"1 should like to make some comments following the stateoccurred ments made by the honourable member be for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) and the honourand able member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) because, as Minister for Local Governof ment, I found some of the things said tonight rather astonishing. I understand that the honourable memend ber for Wide Bay was in local for many years. He obviously is not aware that local government, or any sphere government, talks of the tiers of govern the ment. We now talk of spheres, and I he might include that in his vocabulary because it indicates the regard in which we hold local government when we deal with it at the Commonwealth level. One thing the honourable member for, Wide Bay is not aware of is that this year we will see the second round of high level consultations between the Commoncreased wealth Government and local govern- $1.1 ment. In fact, they will take place Wednesday and Thursday of this week. the The Australian Local Government Assowill be represented, as will· the our local government unions-the Municipal Officers Association of Australia and the Federated Municipal and Council EmGovployees Union of Australia-and the professional associations. Those consultations will take place in Parliament House are between the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), in representatives of local government, and senior Ministers. They extend over two days. They are not brief consultathey are consultations that will be held in depth about issues that are of masmutual concern to both the Commonthen wealth Government and local government. I might add that it was the Prime Minister who initiated those consultato tions. As the honourable member for Prospect said, it was this Government that actually introduced a Ministry to deal with local government, in recognition of its sigwithin the whole parliamentary is absoprocess in this country. One other thing that I do not think the honourable member for Wide Bay is aware of is that local government will actually a participant, sitting at the table, at a special Premiers Conference. That has not before. The Commonwealth will represented, as will each of the States Territories and local government. That has again occurred at the initiative the Prime Minister and he has the agreement of all the States and Territories for that to occur. That will happen at the of this month, on 30 and 31 October. government It is indeed historic. I could go on at length to respond to of many of the claims and allegations that honourable member for Wide Bay has think made about the Government's commitment to local government. Because of the late hour, I will briefly respond to some of the claims he made about financial assistance. The underlying increase in Commonwealth assistance to the 914 local governing bodies throughout Australia has been conservatively estimated to have inby 7.1 per cent this year, from billion in 1989-90 to $1.2 billion in on 1990-91. This compares very favourably with a 7 per cent increase in total gross Adjournment Commonwealth payments to the States and the Northern Territory. There has been an increase of $21.6m, or 3.2 per cent, in the level of financial assistance grants available to local government. These grants now total $699m-odd. They are untied and are .used by councils to meet their individual expenditure priorities. The remainder of the funding component is used for roads. The increase this year was approximately $40m, or 14.3 per cent, to $317m in 1990-91. I suggest that in an economic climate in which all spheres of government are required to exercise expenditure restraint, local government continues to be fairly treated. I will not go into other detail about many of the programs we have where we fund local government research and development and assist, from the Federal level, in a number of ways such as provision of scholarships and other moneys. Our commitment to local government was placed on the record in 1983 when this Ministry was created. Our dialogue and discussions and dealings with local government have established that, to this day, we continue to hold it in high regard and to recognise its significance and importance in this nation. I suggest that that will continue and that we will see evidence of it this week at the high level consultations and further evidence with local government's inclusion at the special Premiers Conference later this month. Proposed expenditure agreed to. Remainder of Bill-by leave-taken as a whole, and agreed to. Bill reported with amendments; report adopted. Third Reading Bill (on motion by Ms Fatin)-by leave-read a third time. NA Motion (by Mr Staples) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. Importation of Bananas",102
133,Mr NEWELL,ADJOURNMENT,"Richmond) (11.08)Recent announcements in the press have sent a shudder through the ranks of 15 October 1990 REPRESENTATIVES 2903 banana growers on the north coast of New South Wales. Those announcements indicated that there was pressure to approve the importation of bananas into Australia-a banana-growing nation. That shudder turned into a cold sweat when it was alleged that Chiquita Brands International-formerly United Fruit, then United Brands, of which Chiquita was the banana brand-had purchased an equity share in HL Bananas, the dominant wholesaler in Adelaide. That news was followed by substantial but unconfirmed rumours of Chiquita's purchasing other wholesalers in capital cities. The rumours are hard to verify, but it seems clear, at least in the eyes of those who depend on the industry for their livelihood, that it is Chiquita's intent to dominate banana marketing in Australia. What is not so clear to anyone is whether Chiquita will grow large quantities of bananas, export some and glut the domestic market, thereby dominating both production and marketing, or import bananas. Right now, the latter seems a more likely scenario. There appear to be applications from Ecuador, from 'Bonita Bananas', on the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service desk, and also from Chiquita from its operations in the Philippines and elsewhere in South East Asia. Chiquita recently announced in a trade publication its intention to import bananas into Australia. It has been likened to carrying coals to Newcastle. Clearly, the importation of bananas from other countries could be expected to meet objections on quarantine grounds. The possible introduction of exotic diseases must always be to the forefront in any consideration of allowing imports where a local industry could be put at risk. There must be ironclad guarantees that the introduction of disease into the industry will not take place. However, disease aside, can any other grounds for denying imports be rationally advanced? To answer this question, at least in part, it may be useful to look in particular at Chiquita's record in world trade. As late as March 1989, the meat packing subsidiary of the United Brands Company was the subject of a complaint by the United States National Labor Relations Board Office, charging that the company had ,fraudulently concealed an 'unlawful scheme' to circumvent its agreement with the United Food and Commercial Workers Union. We will see later that the Chiquita company has always gone down a path which exploited its workers where it could get away with it. The attitudes of controlling management have been exploitative in the extreme. The company's attitude towards low paid workers has been dismissive. Negotiation on major issues has been non-existent. However, and not surprisingly, Chiquita grew fat and has prospered. In 1987, Chiquita, on revenues of $3.2 billion, chalked up profits of some $59.4m, virtually all because of the booming banana business. The Chiquita brand has reclaimed leadership in the United States banana market and holds a 40 per cent share of the $3.1 billion world banana market. Where does the company go from there? The New York Times explained: Now emboldened, the company is beginning to spread the Chiquita name to other fruits and packaged goods, and to push into new markets, particularly Eastern Europe. One of those markets appears to be Australia. The New York Times went on to explain: Riding the wave of popularity for bananas that brought it back from the brink of bankruptcy, Chiquita Brands International has started an ambitious expansion program that includes scouting for acquisitions. Chiquita does not have a very happy industrial relations record. The company regularly faces strikes by its central American pickers. The New York Times recently reported: Just last monthThat is, in June 1990. The article continuedthe Honduran military was sent into break a 40 day strike by Chiquita pickers seeking higher wages. President and chief operating officer of Chiquita, Keith Lindner, said that 'strikes simply a fact of life in the banana business'. In fact, in the present Honduran dispute, Chiquita's 10,000 union members, including banana cutters, railway workers and administrative personnel earning an average $US15 a day, struck for a 60 per cent salary increase. The walkout paralysed the fruit company's operations in Honduras, one of the world's biggest banana exporters. Chiquita refused to negotiate with the work force. Before the troops were sent into break up the strike, the Vice-President of Chiquita said, 'We aren't going to pay higher salaries to our workers'. Panama and the Honduras are Chiquita's two most important sources of bananas. Colombia, the Philippines, Ecuador, Costa Rica and Guatemala also grow bananas for Chiquita. About half the bananas Chiquita sells are grown by the company; the rest are purchased under contract from suppliers. Is it any wonder that banana growers on the north coast of New South Wales, many of whom operate small, family-owned farms, fear the approach of this giant with such a reputation?",103
134,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Importation of Bananas,104
135,Mr NEHL,ADJOURNMENT,"1 must say I was very pleased to hear the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Newell) speaking on behalf of the banana growers of his electorate. I am delighted to learn that he is aware of the problem. He isand I say this in a jocular fashion-just a trifle late. I spoke on this issue last week, but I would like to get right to the point and do away with the concern of the honourable member for Richmond about Chiquita. Chiquita, whether it is a poor payer, a strike breaker or whatever, is not the issue. It might be in touch with the ideological background of the honourable member for Richmond, but it is irrelevant to the banana industry of Australia. What we are concerned with is not whether the bananas come from Chiquita, Ecuador, the Philippines, Fiji or anywhere else. We are concerned with the preservation of the were Australian banana industry; we are concerned with those very same small farmers and family businesses about which the member spoke, and whether they will survive. The basis of that survival is keeping disease out of this country. The diseases moako and black sigatoka have the capacity to eradicate totally the Australian banana industry, not just in New South Wales but also in Queensland. That, with respect to my colleague the honourable member for Richmond, is the issue. The issue is not Chiquita but the salvation of the Australian banana industry, which is worth $150m a year and is the lifeblood of many small communities such as Mullumbimby and others. It is vastly important; the issue is to save the Australian banana industry by not allowing importation of foreign bananas with the attendant great risk of disease. Rainforest Timber",104
136,Mr CAMPBELL,ADJOURNMENT,"Kalgoorlie) (11.15)Tonight I am going to do something very unusual, just as a favour to the Governcided ment of which I am a member. I am going to help the Government make some balforts anced decisions about the environment. However, before the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) goes over the board expressing her gratitude to me, me give the House some background. It has been more than two years since radiing cal greenies started squawking about Australia should ban all imports of rainhas forest timbers from undeveloped counwant tries. The same people who want these imports banned also want to see all Ausbe tralia's forests left as pristine wilderhave nesses, so where we are supposed our timber from is anybody's guess. These people lobbied the Government so hard' that they succeeded in having rainforest timbers banned in the construction of this building. They also succeeded in having public money spent on an independent report by consultants Coopers and LyAssociation brand. I will deal briefly with the first point. Rainforest timber has many uses in Ausresponse, tralia, including the manufacture of doors. I can guarantee honourable members that practically every door in this building a skin of rainforest timber. It is a very stable material which does not have any commercially viable substitute. All the about rainforest timber not being used in this building is simply not true. The report the Government commissioned on this subject was given to the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories about six months ago. Its main conclusion is that there is no justification whatsoever for banning imports of rainforest timber. Further, it states that a ban would not halt tropical deforestation but could instead cause considerable economic damage to the poor countries involved and to Australia. Such a ban could also lead to a great deal of damage being done to important international relationships. Anyone would think that such a report would provide a rational basis for making decisions about such an important issue. Indeed, even before the report was completed, Australia's timber importers deto do their bit by importing timber only from countries which are making efto log their forests in a sustainable manner. So the timber importers have a policy. The Australian Council of Trade Unions environment committee looked at report four months ago and decided let that banning imports was not the way to go and that we should use less self-defeatways to help these countries improve how their forest management. So the ACTU a policy. As we all know, the greenies imports banned completely, so they have a policy. The Government seems to the only party involved which does not a policy, yet the Minister has had to get this report for six months. We now have a situation where the greenies have leaked this report to the media and, as usual, are trying to discredit its findings. We all know that the greenies try to discredit anything with which they do not agree. The National of Forest Industries called upon the Government to release the report some time ago. There has been no s'o I have decided to give the Government a hand. I have managed to get hold of a copy of the report, which I has will now table along with the ACTU policy on this issue. I believe that having this document in the public arena should entalk courage a more balanced debate on this issue and I hope it will give the lie to the claim that this report is out of date. The report is excellent; it is factually based and facts do not go out of date. Election Commitments",105
137,Mr REID,ADJOURNMENT,"It would be hard to top the effort by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) on this occasion, but tonight marks a bit of a milestone for me. It is just over six months since the poll was declared for the Federal seat of Bendigo and I would like to place on record a number of commitments which the Hawke Labor Government made to that electorate during the 1990 election campaign, the 1987 election campaign, the 1984 election cam,paign and the 1983 election campaign, I which have not been fulfilled. These included commitments that inflation would be halved, there would be ilower home interest rates and a reduction in the price of petrol. There would be the I creation of twice as many jobs and the dream of home ownership would come to life. Road construction would receive a massive boost and there would be new Commonwealth offices for Bendigo. Medicare payments would be reduced by ,$7.25 per week. The engineering faculty i at the Bendigo College of Advanced Education would be reinstated; the WimmeraMallee pipeline would be constructed at a cost of $64m; and there would be no job cuts at the Australian Defence Industries , Pty Ltd factory. The School of Agriculture would be relocated from the La Trobe University to Bendigo; $70m would be spent on redevelopment of the Calder Highway; and there would be World Heritage listing for the goldfields area of central Victoria. There would be an $8.6m tanning industry for the Shire of Strathfieldsaye; there would be money for technical and further education student accommodation; and there would be a waste recycling plant for central Victoria. I am pleased to see the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) at the table at this moment because I am sure he would prefer to forget the Government's commitment to keep open the Korong Bush Nursing Hospital. The Government also made a commitment to construct Australian Broadcasting Corporation studios at Bendigo. There was to be $200m of frigate work for Australian Defence Industries, which was then altered to $100m. I do not know what the figure is currently, but it is going down. There would also be tax incentives to encourage preservation and restoration of buildings. There are many more items, but those are the major ones. I wanted to place them on the record because none of those commitments to the Bendigo electorate have been fulfilled at this stage. I see that the Minister is taking note of that. I am delighted that he is at the table. I will be monitoring those commitments to the electorate of Bendigo and I know that the Minister is keen to make sure that those commitments are honoured. I will be looking for his support at the appropriate time.",106
138,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,I call the honourable member for Kalgoorlie to clear up a matter.,106

140,Mr STAPLES,ADJOURNMENT,"in reply-I should like to respond to the honourable member for north Bendigo (Mr Reid) and his claim that the problems at Wedderburn have not been dealt with. Despite the misrepresentations that were in the press in Bendigo at that time in relation to promises that were said to have been made and broken, he, at least, is well and, truly aware that that was not so. The Government will certainly honour .its commitment to Wedderburn in light of the arrangements that I made. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 11.22 p.m. NA The following papers were deemed to have been presented on 15 October 1990: Higher Education Funding Act-Determinations-1990-T16, T17, TI8 and T19Grants for building projects. Veterans' Entitlements Act-Instrument varying Treatment Principles, dated 4 October 1990. The following answers to questions were circulated: Port Authorities (Question No. 40) Mr Hollis asked the Minister representing the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, upon notice, on 10 May 1990: Since the answer to question No. 110 (Hansard, 24 November 1987, page 2633), have steps been taken to reduce the number of (a) five port authorities in Victoria, (b) in Queensland, (c) six port authorities in Western Australia and (d) nine marine boards and port authorities in Tasmania.",106
141,Mr BEAZLEY,PAPERS,"The Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question: (a) There are three port authorities in Victoria and there has been no change to that number since November 1987. (b) There has been no change to the number of port authorities in Queensland. The review of Queensland's port systems released by the Queensland Minister for Transport on 30 July 1990 recommended no change to the number of port authorities in Queensland at this time, but that the position of the Bundaberg and Rockhampton Port Authorities be further reviewed in three years. (c) The only change in the number of port authorities in Western Australia has been the establishment of the Port of Dampier Authority with effect from March 1989. (d) There are seven marine boards and port authorities in Tasmania and there has been no change in the number of such organisations since November 1987. Legislation to amalgamate a number of northern Tasmanian ports is currently before the Tasmanian Parliament. Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport (Question No. 156) Mr Mack asked the Minister representing the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, upon notice, on 22 August 1990: (1) With respect to the Government's decision announced in a joint statement by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Transport and Communications, dated 22 March 1989, to proceed with the development of a third runway at Sydney Kingsford-Smith Airport subject to an environmental impact statement and reference to NA an 'exhaustive analysis' which had led the Government to its decision, did that exhaustive analysis comprise the consideration of any report, study or written advice; if so, (a) by what agency of Government was the report, study or advice prepared and (b) what officials and other persons were involved. (2) Will he release the documents forming any part of the exhaustive analysis referred to in order that they can be appraised and discussed seven port authorities publicly.",108
142,Mr BEAZLEY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The Government's decision to proceed with the development of a third runway at Sydney Kingsford-Smith Airport, subject to the satisfactory completion of the environmental impact assessment process, was made after consideration of written advice and reports on a range of technical, economic and other relevant issues. (a) The information considered by Cabinet in making its decision was drawn from a number of Government and other sources, including the Department of Transport and Communications, the NSW Department of State Development, the Civil Aviation Authority and the Federal Airports Corporation. Among the documents considered by the Government were reports prepared by Bechtel Civil Inc, Aviation Services for the Federal Airports Corporation. These reports were conceptual estimates for the costs of the third runway proposal and a second Sydney airport at Badgerys Creek. (b) Officials and representatives from the following Departments, Authorities and agencies were involved in preparing the information - the Department of Transport and Communications - the Civil Aviation Authority - the Federal Airports Corporation - the NSW Department of State Development - Bechtel Civil Inc, Aviation Services - the Attorney-General's Department - the Department of Finance - the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. (2) A number of documents forming part of the exhaustive analysis have already been released in response to FOI requests. Other documents have been denied access on grounds that they formed part of the Cabinet deliberative process. Cultural Property (Question No. 158) Mr Hollis asked the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories, upon notice, on 22 August 1990: Did Australia on 30 October 1989 accept the 1970 Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property subject to a reservation: if so, (a) what are the terms of the reservation, (b) what Federal, State or Territory legislation is required to permit the withdrawal of the reservation and (c) what is the timetable for the introduction of such legislation. Mr Simmons-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes; the reservation refers to Article 10 of the Convention. (a) The reservation reads: The Government of Australia declares that Australia is not at present in a position to oblige antique dealers, subject to penal or administrative sanctions, to maintain a register recording the origin of each item of cultural property, names and addresses of the supplier, description and price of each item sold and to inform the purchaser of the cultural property of the export prohibition to which such property may be subject. Australia therefore accepts the convention subject to a reservation as to Article 10, to the extent that it is unable to comply with the obligations imposed by that Article.' (b) A decision has not yet been taken on the precise legislative means of giving effect to Article 10. The obligations in that Article are associated with the functions of antique dealers and such dealers have, in the past, been regulated under State and Territory legislation. Current State and Territory legislation cannot be relied upon to give effect to Article 10, although some States have indicated a willingness to alter their legislation in this respect. (c) No timetable has been set. Shipping: Port Planning Unit (Question No. 181) Mr Hollis asked the Minister representing the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, upon notice, on 22 August 1990. When did the Australian Government last give consideration to the recommendations of the Maritime Industry Commission of Inquiry, presented in February 1976, (a) that a port planning unit be formed, (b) that the head of the unit be appointed as a member of the harbour board or port management group in each major city and (c) that the other people on the head s staff could be appointed to the boards of other ports.",108
143,Mr BEAZLEY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question. The present Government has not given detailed consideration to the recommendations of the Maritime Industry Commission of Inquiry in relation to these matters. The report was presented to the Parliament on 25 February 1976 by the then Minister for Administrative Services, Senator the Hon RG Withers. There is no record of any' formal response by the then government to the Commission's recommendations in this area. Air Service Rights (Question No. 204) Mr Jull asked the Minister for Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 11 September 1990: (1) With which countries has Australia negotiated during the last five years with a view to obtaining entitlements for ""intermediate and beyond"" rights as part of an air services agreement.
