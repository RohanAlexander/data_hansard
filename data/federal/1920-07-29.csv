2,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown," It is with sincere and deep Tegret that I announce to honourable members that a telegram has been received from Mr Speaker, containing the sad news that his wife has died, and that she was buried this morning. I am certain that every honourable member, on hearing this announcement, will have the deepest and most heartfelt sympathy with Mr. Speaker. No sadder or worse calamity could befall a man than the death of hiswife. As Deputy Speaker, I tender to Sir Elliot my sincere regTets, and hope that he may have strength to bear up under the great blow that he has received.",20
3,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"On behalf of the Ministry and of honourable members generally, I offer to Mr Speaker the deepest sympathy in his sad bereavement. Words are a poor thing to offer on occasions like this as balm for the deep wound of such sorrow. We realise that the loss which Sir Elliot has suffered is irreparable, and ono for which no earthly consolation can be found, unless i the in the knowledge thab his friends and his fellow-memibers sincerely sympathize with him, and trust that time may blunt the edge of his sharp grief. We deeply regret his loss, though we are glad that he was at least able to be with his wife at the end.",20
4,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Eve n had I not risen to speak on hehalf of honourable members of the Labour party in support of what you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and the Prime Minister have said, it would have been realized that we feel the most sincere and deepest sympathy with Mr Speaker.. On behalf of those who sit on the left of the gangway I express sincere regret for the great sorrow that has befallen him. Only those who have gone through the experience can know how deep such sorrow as his is.",21
5,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"On hehalf of honourable members of the Country party, I express, too, the deepest sympathy with Mr Speaker. Those of us who for so long a stretch of time enjoyed the acquaintance of . Sir Elliot and Lady Johnson, and knew their attachment to each other, are aware how greatly the blow must be felt.

6,Mr WEST,Unknown,Is it the intention of Treasurer to accept war gratuity bonds for peace loan bonds of the same value?,21
7,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"No . would be an easy way of cancelling the bonds, but if we . adopted it we should have to raise a further loan, 'because adoption would mean that we should get providesless money from the loan about to be issued. PUBLIC 'SERVICE ADMINISTRATION. Ma. MCLACHLAN'S REPORT.",21
8,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Yesterday the Prime Minister laid on the table Mr MCLachlan's report upon the Public Service, and the paper was ordered to be printed. Will the right honourable gentleman kindly expedite the printing of it, so that honourable members may obtain copies as soon as possible.",21
9,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I am under the impression that the report has been printed, and if sufficient copies are not already available, I shall see that enough are supplied. NA EXCHANGES.",21
10,Mr BRUCE,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"I desire to ask the Minister for Trade and Customs-althoug h I have previously interrogated the Prime Minister on the subject- a question referring to the method adopted by the Customs Department in collecting exchanges in foreign countries. I wish to know whether, in view of the appalling losses that have been faced by French, Belgian, and Italian manufacturers under the existing rule, we may look for a decision by the Cabinet, such decision having been promised by the Prime Minister? ' Mr MASSYGREENE - Yes ; I hope.it will be possible before very long to announce the final decision in regard to the matter. THE GALLERIES. EXCLUSIO N OE THEPUBLIC .",21
11,Mr TUDOR,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"I desire, Mr Deputy. Speaker, to ask you a question, without notice, in reference ;to the procedure adopted last night in preventing the admission to the galleries of persons who i had received orders. Honourable members, perhaps, are aware-at any rate, metrothe politan members are-that applications from members of the public for admission to this House are sometimes sen! into honourable members a week ahead, and we That obtain them from the Clerk Assistant, or the Serjeant-at-Arms. These tickets are limited to two for each member for any its particular sitting. Standing order 64. Every member may each day, by written orders, admit three strangers to the gallery. That, of course, refers to the gallery upstairs, because standing order 63 providesThe Speaker only shall have the privilege of admitting strangers into the portion of the chamber below the Bar. Senators shall have the privilege of admission there without orders. I understand that the front seat, on one side of the lower gallery, is reserved for senators, and the front seat, on ithe other side, for members of the Victorian State Parliament. Each member has the right to issue two tickets, but the holders of such tickets, last night, were.refused admission. It was then impossible to raise the question to which I am now referring, though I have raised the point before, when you, sir, were in the chair in Committee, and Mr Speaker was brought in. I also"" ask whether it would not have been possible to inform honourable members of the procedure it was intended to adopt. Personally, I am opposed to any such procedure. In any case, the lower, or Speaker's gallery, is too small, and even when crowded will not hold more than fifty persons, so that if a disturbance did take place the offenders could be dealt with. On ithe only occasion when a disturbance happened, the whole of the top gallery was cleared, because of the conduct of two or three amongst the visitors. I should like to know why both of the galleries were kept clear last night, and why honourable members were not informed that it was intended to keep them clear. ""Why was this done, and on whose authority?",21
12,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN, Is the honourable member raising a question of privilege?,22
13,Mr TUDOR,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"No , sir; I am merely asking a question regarding a privilege of honourable members of the House.",22
14,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"The honourable member informed me of the question he intended to submit to me as Deputy Speaker, as to who was responsible for the public with members' orders being prevented from entering the galleries last night. The honourable member has referred to standing order 64, which provides that every member may each day, by written order, admit three strangers to the gallery. This is one of the Standing Orders which is very indefinite, and can be interpreted in many ways. It out that admission is by written order, but the practice of this, and every other Parliament with which I have been associated, has been that these orders are issued by Mr Speaker. Entrance to this House is entirely under the control of Mr Speaker, and that standing order refers to not only what is known as the Speaker's gallery, but also the gallery upstairs. I believe that, for some periods in the past, it was possible, for visitors to enter the upstairs gallery without any cards; but the practice of Mr Speaker and his predecessors has been to issue tickets. I find that in the House of Commons admission to the gallery is entirely under.the control of the Speaker's Secretary and the Serjeant-at-Arms-that is, in regard to the gallery which corresponds to our upper gallery-the lower gallery being reserved for the special control of Mr Speaker. Certain proceedings with which I have no desire to deal at any length made it im Speaker, who are the custodians of this building, and all within its precincts, to take extreme measures last night, in order to prevent the conduct of the business of this House being interfered with. I regret to say that on a previous occasion, which will be within the memory of some honourable members, people gathered outside this House, and, inflamed with certain feelings, forced their way, notwithstanding the few police who were here for our protection, through the vestibule into the Queen's Hall, and very nearly into the chamber itself. Certain indications and information given to the Government,  probability of a very large concourse of people outside the building last night; and, if the measures then taken had been neglected, it would have been quite possible for numbers of those people to force their way, possibly into the Chamber, and behave in an unseemly way, that would have been derogatory to the Parliament.  arranged that, in the interests of the members themselves, means of protection should be adopted. Had the friends of honourable members been admitted in the usual way, they might, in the .event of an influx of the crowd, have been maltreated, and it was therefore thought better that only ' honsets orable members themselves should be admitted. That course was followed, in view of what has taken place quite recently, and, as I say,- in the interests of honourable members themselves, in order to conserve the peace and dignity of the Parliament. The proper officer, the Sergeant-at-Arms, was instructed to see that the order given was carried out-to see that, while there was any probability of a disturbance outside, all strangers should be excluded. It was hoped that possibly about 9 o'clock the people might disperse, when the friends of honourable members could be admitted; but that did not prove to be the case. I take the responsibility - for acting in the absence of Mr Speaker, and it was painful for me to agree to the order given, but it was absolutely imperative.",22
15,Mr TUDOR,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"But why were not honourable members* informed that it was intended to issue the order? All we knew of it we heard from people outside, and I spoke to the Serjeant-at-Arms regarding the matter after hearing a rumour from another honourable member. You, sir, must have known before 6.30 last night that such an order was to be issued.",23
16,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"So far as I knew, honourable members would be so informed, because the usual practice is for them to apply to the S'erjeant-at-Arms for tickets.. Just very recently I remind the honourable member, Mr Speaker issued to every honourable member a circular dealing with this question,. and asking honourable members to be exceedingly careful in the future as to the persons they admit to the House. The only information that could be given last night in regard to the decision to exclude all visitors was made available through the Ordinary channel; that is to say, when an application was made to the Serjeantat-Arms for tickets to admit visitors, the applicant was informed of what had been done. In some cases honourable members came to me-. The honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Ryan) asked me if the instruction isstied was a general order. I informed him that it was. Even my own daughters were excluded. Some honourable members had arranged to bring a number of school children to the House. They also had to be excluded. Altogether it was a very painful piece of business, and I am sure honoi'able members, if they regard it in the right light, will see that what was done by me, acting in conjunction with Mr. President, had but one object, and that was to preserve that dignity and decorum of the Chamber to which we have been accustomed in the past, and which I hope will be continued in the future.",23
17,Mr CONSIDINE,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,Are we to underof stand that it lies within the discretion Mr Speaker or Mr Deputy Speaker to enforce the Standing Orders as they see fit ; or are they to be enforced impartially according to the manner in which the position is viewed by Mr Speaker or Mr Deputy Speaker?,23
18,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"Apar t from the right of any honourable member to call attention to the presence of strangers, it has been the practice in the past, and is so set forth in the Standing Orders, that Mr Speaker himself, when he deems it necessary, may have strangers removed. On his own initiative he may order the removal of any number of persons or all of them. He is responsible for the conduct of the House. What was done last night was done in accordance with precedent, and with only one object in view. In the absence of Mr Speaker, I ask every honourable member in his own interests, as well as in the interest of Parliament as a whole, to observe the new instructions recently issued by Mr Speaker for the officers of , the House to carry out. COAL SHORTAGE.",23
19,Mr BLUNDELL,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,I understand that representations have been made by the South Australian Government in regard to the serious shortage of coal which threatens to affect the industrial welfare of the State very materially. Can the Prime - Minister say whether anything can be done to relieve the position?,23
20,Mr HUGHES,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"At the Premiers' Conference the other day complaints were made by the Premiers of Victoria, South Australia, and other States, to the effect that there was a very great shortage of coal, which was attributed to three causes, the scarcity of shipping, the growth of the export trade, and the very frequent and serious stoppages of the men at different mines. I do not propose to apportion to each of these three causes its due and proper weight, but merely repeat what has been said. It is obvious that in discussing any shortage which may he due to industrial unrest, we are considering one particular phase of a general world-wide problem; and the shortage of shipping may also be said to be a phase a problem similar in extent, but in of reference to the export of coal overseas, we are dealing with a condition of affairs which has heen created by the war, a most extraordinary position which has enabled Australia to sell coal to European countries at a lower rate than that charged for British coal. where it can get the highest return. Obviously, that is the principle which guides men in all their actions, whether they be miners or mine-owners, and the only step the Commonwealth Government could take in this regard would be to prohibit the export of coal.",23
21,Mr CHARLTON,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,The Government cannot do that.,24
22,Mr HUGHES,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"That is true. cannot, do it unless we pass legislation to that effect. The existing law does hot, I understand, empower the Minister for Trade and Customs to prohibit the export of coal, and if it be the desire of the House that the Government should be. clothed with that power it must express an opinion to that effect, and legislation can be brought forward which honourable members may discuss and adopt or reject as they deem fit. This is a general question that does not affect any party. Coal consumers are not members of political parties. A man does not burn coal because he happens to be a farmer, or a. member of the Opposition, or a member sitting on the Government ^ide. burns it because he wants to do so.",24
23,Mr TUDOR,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,The trouble is that one cannot get much coal to burn.,24
24,Mr HUGHES,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"Quite so. I accept that correction. But if honourable members express a general desire that the export of coal should be interfered with, the Government will consider whether it is desirable to bring in the» necessary legislation, throwing upon the House the responsibility for it . If , on the other hand, we are not to interfere with the export trade-and I certainly do not think we should do so-the n I tell honourable members candidly that we cannot expect the coal mine-owners not ""to sell their coal in the market which pays them best. I think, in the best interests of Australia, it would he a very had step to k ill the foreign trade.",24
25,Mr CHARLTON,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"Hear , hear! If we did so it would k ill the mining ",24
26,Mr HUGHES,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"It would be a case of killing the goose that lays the golden egg. We must have an expanding, and not a, diminishing, coal trade. I have answered this question at some length, because it is a matter of importance. I think I have dealt with it fairly . I repeat that if there is a general desire to interfere with the export coal trade, Coal goes the House must express that desire, and if it does so, the Government wil l consider the matter of bringing in the necessary legislation. Otherwise it does - not propose to interfere with the trade.",24
27,Mr CHARLTON,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"Is the Prime Minister aware that at the present time efforts are being made to overtake the demand for coal by the opening up of several collieries that were idle during the We war, and that there is now about three quarters of a million tons of coal lying at grass at Newcastle, which can be shipped at any time?",24
28,Mr HUGHES,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"I was not aware that collieries are now opening up which were closed, but I am not surprised to hear it . It is a matter for congratulation that we are able, not only to hold our own in the matter of our pre-war coal trade, but also to look forward with some degree of hope to expanding it . I am aware that coal which is the property of this Government is lying at grass. If that is the coal to which the honourable member refers, all I have to say is that it is there for the purpose of enabling this GovernHe ment to have, if occasion demands, sufficient coal for its ships of war, for its mercantile marine, and for the industries of this country. We must have some reserve tofall back on if the miners carry out their threat to cease producing coal altogether. It would be mere midsummer-night's madness to allow that coal to go, in the face of existing circumstances. We are told in ' the press this morning that there is a serious probability of trouble. Honourable members know that lately I have been meeting the coal miners and owners very frequently in an endeavour to secure a settlement; but this morning's papers state that there is a probability of the miners ceasing work. I do not propose to allow our reserve of coal to be exported or distributed. It is there as a reserve; and if the miners, throwing aside all counsels of prudence and common sense, elect to resort to the. arbitrament of force, we shall have to use that coal.",24
29,Mr FENTON,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"Is it not true that the Commonwealth Government have power to prevent the export of wheat on account of the contemplated shortage of that article in Australia? If so, cannot the same rule be applied to the export of coal u n t i l Australian requirements are met?",24
30,Mr HUGHES,CUSTOMS DUTIES AND FOREIGN,"I - can only answer the honourable member to the best of my knowledge and belief. The Customs Act does not enable the Government to place such an embargoi upon the export of coal as would amount to a prohibition. NA PARLIAMENT. SALARIES, BONUSES, AND PROMOTIONS.",25
31,Dr MALONEY,O FEICEESANDEMPLOYEES OP,"Will the Prime Minister supply the following information to the House? 1. A return showing the salaries and wages drawn by all officers or employees engaged in and about the Federal Parliament for the years 1914 to 1920, inclusive, showing the amounts of money received annually by each person opposite each name. 2. The names of all permanent and temporary officers and employees engaged in and about the Federal Parliament to whom bonuses were promised, and the amount received by each person. 3. Information showing the promotions promised to any officer during the current financial year, showing the names and the amounts of increases to be received.",25
32,Mr HUGHES,O FEICEESANDEMPLOYEES OP,"This matter arose in a previous question put. to me by an honourable member. I , myself, asked a question of Mr Speaker, in my capacity as a private member, in regard to the same subject. I am not at all sure as to my authority here. These officers are officers of the Parliament, and it is for Mr . Speaker and the President to supply this information. But, as I said before, when referring to this matter. I think that this House, when it comes to discuss ithe ""Estimates, should have all the facts called for by the honourable member before it . I asked for that information. I shall support the honourable member's request for the furnishing of these particulars. Perhaps, Mr Deputy Speaker will take official notice of the fact that I do support the request, and that I ask for the information to be supplied.",25
33,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,O FEICEESANDEMPLOYEES OP," I may say that the inforstand, mation is available, and can be supplied at once. NA DEPARTMENT . COUNTRY MAIL CONTRACTORS.",25
34,Mr NICHOLLS,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"H as the Postmaster General completed his investigations into the position of country mail contractors, and into the matter of increasing their present contract rates, in view of drought and other unforeseen circumstances? If so, will he make an early announcement to the House upon the subject ?",25
35,Mr WISE,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,I will do so-probabl y next week. PASSPORTS. UNITED STATES AND AUSTRALIA.,25
36,Mr BOWDEN,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"H as the attention of the Government' been called to a published statement to the effect that a charge of about £3 6s. 8d. has been made by the United States authorities to vise the passports of Australian visitors to Honolulu? If that information is correct, will the Government take steps to make a reciprocal charge against Americans visiting Australia ?  been brought under my notice. I have had an appeal despatched to the Government of the United States of America in order to see whether something more reasonable cannot be done. The Government is still in communication with the United States authorities. In regard to the latter portion of the honourable member's ques-: tion, I do not know that two wrongs make a right. RUSSIAN NATIONALS.",25
37,Mr OONSIDINE,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"In reference to the question which I asked on the Sth July, regarding the position of Russians now resident i h the Commonwealth who wish to return to their own country, the Prime Minister informed me that he was in communication with the British Government. Has he received any in formation which he is prepared to f u r nish to the House?",25
38,Mr HUGHES,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I have not received information from the British Government, but I have noticed in the press the report of a statement made, I underby the British Prime Minister. So far as I apprehend the facts, Russians in Great Britain are quite free to return to their own country. offhand, and subject, of course, to correction, I know of no reason whatever why Russians who are free in this country should not be allowed to return to Russia.",25
39,Mr CONSIDINE,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,In the agreement the British Government undertook to provide transport.,26
40,Mr HUGHES,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"The British Government has nothing whatever to do with the position in Australia. Of course, this Government, whenever possible, acts in conformity with the policy of the I m perial Government in regard to such matters. It is most undesirable to have a policy in one portion of the Empire differing from that of other portions of the Empire. Apart from that, we have power to make what laws we please in the matter of permitting the entrance of persons to this country, or of providing for tneir exclusion, or of allowing them to depart. We can bring in , keen out, bind or let loose whom we will . However, I will look into the law upon this subject and give the honourable member a considered answer by Wednesday next. To repeat m y own personal opinion, I know of no reason why Russians resident in Australia should be prevented from departing to their native land.",26
41,Mr CONSIDINE,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I have in my hand a copy of the agreement entered into between the British Government and the Russian Soviet Government, which states that the British Government will repatriate all Russian civilians in the British Empire, or in any territory where the British Government exercises direct authority. .There is a further clause to the effect that the B r it i sh Government will also arrange for transport for those who desire to return home.",26
42,Mr HUGHES,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"The agreement referred to hy the honourable member was one it was proposed to r at if y between the Russian Soviet Government and the B r i tish Government. It was not consummated. On the eve of its consummation, was a disagreement between the parties. The point referred to there differs altotrict gether from that with which I was dealMinister, ing. The British Government proposed, membernot that Russians might return to Russia, but that the Imperial authorities would sideration assist them to do so. That is the of the Estimates. Speaking point; I had not raised it . I was directing my remarks to the matter of their freedom to go to their own country when and in what manner they pleased. But if the British Government have any agreement with the Soviet Government to repatriate Russians from any part of the British Empire, provided the Soviet Government act reciprocally, the Commonwealth Government, when officially notified to that effect, will do everything that it is called upon to do to assist the British Government in carrying out their policy. POST-OFPICE DIRECTORIES .",26

The honourable can be assured that all reports and recommendations have .been given full conin connection with the ' preparation . 3. The only officers-who will not receive an immediate increase of pay are junior lieuable tenants with less than five years' service.

82,Mr JOWETT,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,Surely we could provide for an amendment of the Constitution which would get over that difficulty.,31

An amendment of the Constitution is needed to do what I suggest, because otherwise a Government that thought that it would improve its position by fixing an election for the summer season would do so, and I wish to make that impossible. I shall not labour the question,' because the motion is one which I think the House will support, and, after full discussion, carry without a dissentient.",31
87,Mr STEW AET,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,"Wimmera) [3.35] The question involved in this motion is a very serious one to farmers. The holding of the last general election in the middle cf the harvest was a great inconvenience; and there was a deep-rooted feeling that the Government had fixed the time to suit themselves, and were not very particular whether it suited the farmers. An y Government claiming to be democratic should do all in its power to hold elections at a time most suitable to the general community , and the farmers are surely entitled to a little consideration. Eor these and other quite obvious reasons I second the motion.",31
88,Mr FENTON,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,"Maribyrnong) [3.37] I had some experience of election campaigning in the country during the month of December last, including the Grampians and a considerable portion of the Mallee; and I am quite in sympathy with the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) when he speaks of being quite unable to get his meetings together before 10 o'clock at night. Harvesting operations are in full swing in the month of December, and I know that most of the meetings I had the pleasure of addressing did not, as a rule, commence until between 9 and 10 o'clock. However punctual one might be in arriving at the meeting place at 8 - o'clock, with a view to leaving plenty of time for questions and so forth , I found that owing to the conditions it was very often after midnight before I could get to bed. In the city electorates, on the other hand, the months of November, December, and January are very much appreciated as a time for elections, for the simple reason that most of the speaking has to be done .in the open air in the evenings, and for this purpose the summer is much pleasanter than the winter. The Queensland electors have often very strongly pleaded that elections should not be held in that State when it is subject to the monsoonal rains. Mr . HIGGS - We have heavy rains in February and March, and sometimes in April.",31
89,Mr FENTON,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,"I know that a very strong point has been made of this fact in Queensland. However, I do not see that we should take such a drastic step as to bring about an amendment in the Constitution; in my opinion, an amendment of the Electoral A ct would prove sufficiently binding on anv Ministry of the day. We might amend that Act so as to provide that as far as practicable elections should be held at a time of year most suitable to the great bulk of the electors. It would be impossible to have a castiron rule as to the time of year. Sometimes the temper of Parliament is such that a crisis occurs, as has happened in the past, particularly on that occasion when the Prime Minister of the day announced to a startled House that he had recommended, and had been granted, a double dissolution. Under such circumstances as that it would not do to have a section of the Constitution that would prevent the people giving an early expression to their opinions.",31
90,Mr NICHOLLS,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,Y o u do not anticipate anything of the kind now ?,31
91,Mr FENTON,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,"We live in times when we may anticipate anything, whether in the electoral, the parliamentary, the social, the industrial, or the financial sphere. I do not feel inclined to vote for the motion in its present form, because I do not think it is fair to the Parliament to go so far.",31
92,Mr CONSIDINE,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,What would be the value of the motion if carried ?,31
93,Mr FENTON,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,"Of course, the Government could ignore it ; and I think that our Constitution and the Electoral Act should be equal to all occasions. What could be done to carry out a proposal of this kind if a political crisis occurred between the middle of November and the middle of March 1",31
94,Mr JOWETT,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,"What do we do now? We cannot have an election under a month, and at the worse the period in the motion is only four months.",32
95,Mr FENTON,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,"The electors could not wait that long; and this presents one of. the difficulties of the motion. We could amend the Electoral Act now, but to amend the Constitution we must wait until there is another general election. I recommend the - honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) to consult with his friends with a view to drafting a motion that will meet with the unanimous approval of the House. This is a motion I should vote against with reluctance, because I desire the electors to have every opportunity to express their opinion; but in its present form I cannot support it .  port the motion for the reasons that the mover has advanced. It certainly is difficult for farming people to find time for political affairs in their busiest time of the year. To do this they must cease work; and in a producing community like that of Australia, that is a very serious consideration, not only for the farmer, but for all. If no general election were held between the two dates suggested, much of the present difficulty would be got over. At other times of the year the farming community are not at their busiest, nor is the work so important as it was, for instance, when the general elections were held last year. December proved a most inopportune time, and, therefore, I hope the House will support the motion with a view to the Government finding some means to give it legislative sanction.",32
96,Mr BELL,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,"Darwin) [3.47] - I am sure the motion is submitted with the best intentions, and I have every sympathy with its object; but it must be remembered that there ara parts of the Commonwealth in which other periods of the year would prove most unsuitable for elections. ",32
97,Mr BELL,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,"There is my own elecI torate. I am afraid the proposed close season for elections is a little too long. If the period proposed had been from the 1st December to the end of February I might have been able to accord it my support; but, in my electorate, which it must be admitted is a country one, we have a long and heavy wet season. Some of the electors there have to travel fully twenty miles to record their votes, and I do not desire any proposal that would result in further restricting their opportunities of getting to the poll. As a matter of fact, in the winter season in Tasmania it is almost impossible to travel for voting purposes. It would certainly be unreasonable to ask the women electors to travel at such a time, and we wish to see the wdmen at the poll, because their votes are usually on the right side. It must be admitted that the climatic conditions vary very greatly from north to south in Australia. In my own electorate March is about the best possible month for an election, and 1 should uot like any part of that month excluded.",32
98,Mr JOWETT,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,Is the honourable member aware that a large number of people on the mainland take a delight in visiting Tasmania during the months mentioned in the motion ?,32
99,Mr BELL,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,"I am not saying that the months mentioned in the motion are not suitable, but if the House decides that they are unsuitable the tendency will be in fixing polling day to get as far away from those months as passible. The months of May, June, July, August, and September may cover the period when the people in some parts are the least busy, and when the climatic conditions are the best, but they would be the worstpossible months for the holding of an election in Tasmania. The honourable' member proposes to amend the Constitution, but I do not think it is necessary to go to that extent. His purpose could well be served by a simple amendment to the Electoral Act. I do not think the honourable member need fear that any Government would choose a month for an election when people are not likely to go to the polling booths. He may be quite right in claiming that the months of December, January, and February are unsuitable for the holding of an election in many parts of Australia, because the harvest operations are in full swing; hut represent the interests, of people who live in a very wet climate and who could not get to the poll if the close season which the honourable member seeks to fix were extended to the month of March.",32
100,Mr CONSIDINE,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,"Barrier ) [3.53] I shall vote against the motion, because it is quite futile even if carried. If the House agrees to it no attention will be paid to it by the present Government. They will simply regard it as a pious expression of opinion. According to the honourable member for Darwin (Mr Bell) a simple alteration of the Electoral Act would meet the position far better than would the more difficult process of amending the Constitution, but the fact remains that those who support a certain Government can amend the Electoral law as it suits them, just as was done with a view to influencing a by-election in the Corangamite division; a matter which was brought under our notice very forcibly during the last Parliament. It is all very well to talk about consulting the wishes of the public.",33
101,Mr HILL,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,I suppose they are the last that should be considered.,33
102,Mr CONSIDINE,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,They are the last that are considered by the various political parties who occupy the Treasury bench. No honourable member is so unsophisticated as not to know that the majority in possession of the Treasury bench will fix the election time to suit their own political purposes. They will choose the time which they deem .to be most favourable for securing their return with a majority.,33
103,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,The member does not suggest that his party would do such a thing ?,33
104,Mr CONSIDINE,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,"In this regard I do not discriminate between political parties who may happen to occupy the Treasury bench. Possibly the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook), as an old hand at the political game, may believe that every honourable member who rises to speak says only what he deems to be in the interests of his political party, but I am dealing with this motion on its merits, and I say that it will have no effect on the present Administration, or on any Administration. The majority w i ll naturally choose the most opportune time for consulting the electors.",33
105,Mr JOWETT,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,That is what I wish to prevent.,33
106,Mr CONSIDINE,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,Then - the honourable member might as well get outwith a broom and attempt to sweep back the sea.,33
107,Mr STEWART,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,Are not Governments apt to make blunders occasionally?,33
108,Mr CONSIDINE,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,"Certainly ; and I hope that when they meet the electors on the next occasion the present Government will make the biggest blunder of their lives. But the fact that Administrations make blunders does not do away with the f u t i l it y of the motion which the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) has already admitted is of no practical use. As it would involve an amendment of the Constitution, it will be necessary to submit it to a referendum, and secure a majority of the voters of the Commonwealth, and a majority of the various States. Here again the opportune time for submitting the question to the people will be decided by the Administration, who, if they are opposed to it , will choose the most inopportune time for securing a vote on the question.",33
109,Mr JOWETT,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,It is my desire to take the responsibility out of the hands of any unscrupulous Government.,33
110,Mr CONSIDINE,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,"The honourable member cannot achieve that object unless he puts out the present Government and takes their place, which he has not the slightest intention of doing. The motion is simply a piece of window dressing.. The mover, - knowing that nothing can be done, and - that the carrying of the motion will lead us nowhere, is simply helping the Governhonorable ment to monopolize the time of the House. He brings forward a complaint about the fanners- a very necessary portion of the community, but, nevertheless, not the only portion. The shearers, and others who follow a migratory calling, are also a very necessary portion of the community.",33
111,Mr JOWETT,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,Would they be placed at any disadvantage by the adoption of the motion ?,33
112,Mr CONSIDINE,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,"The men who leave the cities to go shearing in the country areas would be enrolled in city electorates, and they would certainly be inconvenienced by having to work in the shearing sheds during the period in which the honourable member wishes elections to be held.",33
113,Mr JOWETT,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,They could vote by post or as absentees.,33
114,Mr CONSIDINE,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,The postal vote does not appeal to me. It is capable manipulation by the party which happens to be in control of the election.,34
115,Mr JOWETT,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,Then let the honourable member bring forward a motion to abolish it.,34
116,Mr CONSIDINE,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,"The member knows very well that when it had the opportunity to do so, the Labour party polling day. voted solidly against the inclusion of the postal vote provisions in the Electoral Bill . I do not think that the honourable member, by comparing the votes polled in May, 1917, with those polled in ber, 1920, can show that any great inconvenience was occasioned to the particular section of the community whose opinions this motion. he claims to be voicing by the holding of the election in December. I do not think that statistics of the voting would prove the honourable member's case. There is a considerable apathy among the electors of Australia, but that is not due to the fact that people are engaged in farming or other occupations at election time.",34
117,Mr JOWETT,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,Does the honourable member deny that there is any inconvenience to the farmers by having in the middle of a harvest?,34
118,Mr CONSIDINE,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,"There would be no more inconvenience to a particular secland. tion of the community, such as the farmers, by holding an election in ber, than there would be to other sections if the date of the election was at any common sense. fixed period of the year. W it date, there would always be inconvenience to one section or another, but my opinion is that the people who want to vote will takes up land and works it . go to the polls at whatever inconvenience to themselves. The fixing of the would not make the citizens of Australia vote who have not hitherto voted.",34

I look forward to the day we when the working farmer and the man in the the workshop, in the mine, and in the factory will join hands and rule this at the country as it should be ruled.

If the Constitution- - were to be amended to provide for the holding of elections between the middle of November and the middle of the following March, it would prove too cramping upon the community and this Parliament. I draw the attention of the 'honorajble member for Grannpians (Mr . Jowett) to the existing situation. Some years ago the Constitution was amended, fqllowing upon a referendum, with respect to the election of senators. alteration was made specifically to meet the convenience of country electors.",34

132,Mr BURCHELL,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,"That is so. The Constitution was altered, following upon a referendum in which the people approved of the question as placed before them. This House is practically controlled, in the matter of the periods of its election, by the life of the Senate. W it h in the past few months we have witnessed the election of a number of senators, who, however, were not able to occupy their seats in the Senate for quite a long period after the day of their election. I agree with the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton), who expressed the view that an amendment of the Electoral Act governing this matter should be sufficient. I do not oppose the desire that this House shall keep in step, generally, with the Senatei n the matter of election ""dates. ' In fact, that would Ibe the proper course to follow.",35
133,Mr JOWETT,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,It was necessary to alter the Constitution to meet the convenience of the public in relation to Senate elections. Why can not a similar procedure be followed in. respect to the election of members of this House?,35
134,Mr BURCHELL,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,"To make the matter effective it would be necessary to seek, to amend the Constitution between the present moment and the next ordinary general election; and that would in volve the taking of a special referendum, which costs between £80,000 £100,000.",35

The election to AU vacant places shall be made within one year before the places are to become vacant. For the purposes of this section, the term of service of a senator shall be taken to begin on the first day of July following the day of his election. The Constitution originally read that the term should begin on the 1st day of January following the date of a senator's election. Naturally, it is desirable that the elections for the House of Representatives should coincide with those in connection with the Senate. I invite honourable members to assume that, from 1923 onwards, each ordinary general election, for both Houses of the Federal Legislature will be conducted on the same day. The Constitution now provides for that, so that there is no need to further and amend it .",35

It is quite conceivable that a crisis might Grampians represents. arise at the end of November; but, i this proposal were agreed to, it would not be lawful to appeal to the people until the middle of the following March. In those circumstances it would be unwise for the House to .agree to motion.

That means that they must be held at the most inopportune time of the year for such a purpose. In winter, people cannot get about the country conon account of the wet and cold weather. We must have regard to the interests of the' majority of the people, and there are poor labourers who, if this it proposal were agreed to, would be compelled to walk, perhaps, 5 miles to the poll in midwinter, or drive 15 or 20 miles in wet and cold.

The result I have quoted in the Corangamite electorate was repeated in other country constituencies. In the Grampians electorate, 78.20 per cent., and in Indi , 7S per cent, of the electors on the roll recorded their votes. Compare those figures with the percentages , in metropolitan electorates.

153,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY," A difficulty has arisen in the House in consequence of the much-to-be-regretted absence of Mr Speaker. Usually in the ' temporary ahsence of Mr Speaker the Chairman of Committees takes the chair; but no provision is made for any relief .to Mr Deputy Speaker when he is required to occupy the' chair for a long period, as at present.

Question resolved in the affirmative. :[126] DESTITUTE ALLOWANCE. Debate resumed from Sth J u ly (vide page 2621), on motion by Dr MALONEY1. That this House is of opinion that the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act should be amended, in order to provide for a destitute allowance to be made to all inhabitants who are destitute, so that any person making a statutory declaration (to a postmaster, Customs officer, or other appointed Commonwealth official, a schoolmaster, a union secretary, a magistrate, or other appointed individual) that he or she is insufficiently fed, clothed, Qr all sheltered, shall be paid as soon as possible the sura of 15s. per week, and for each child 7s. 6d. per week, until relieved. 2. That the passing of the foregoing resolution be an instruction to the Government of the Commonwealth to bring in the necessary amending Act.",37
154,Mr LAZZARINI,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,"Werriwa) [4.33] I have little to add to my previous remarks on this subject. When speaking on the Sth July I was referring to the fact that although the cost of livin g had increased to an extent that was very hard to estimate, the increase in the old-age pensions had been very small, whilst the invalid pensions had not been advanced at all. I argued that the old-age pension, to comply with what was in the mind of the Parliament which passed the original scheme, should be increased today to alIn most 30s. The In v a l i d Pensions Act provides that before a member of a f a m i ly can claim benefits under the Act, he must have a weekly income of less than £ 1 for each adult, and 10s. for each child. I advocated that those amounts should be increased by at least 50 per cent. The honourable member for Swan (Mr . SPEAKER. Prowse), in the course of his argument, referred to a drunkard whom he had warned that he would be lef t without any provision for his old age. To that the man had replied, "" There is the old-age pension."" The impression that was left by the honourable member's remarks was that, in his opinion, most of the indigent poor were brought to straitened circumstances by drink. ",37
155,Mr LAZZARINI,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,"The impression conveyed to my mind, at all events, was that the honourable member thinks that all those who receive old-age pensions have been drunkards, or at least, improvident, in their earlier life .  wrong.",37
156,Mr LAZZARINI,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,"The member's words convey, at least, the suggestion that the old-age pension system prompts persons to live in a haphazard fashion, secure in the knowledge that towards the end of their days they will be able to obtain pensions.  honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney) would allow able-bodied men ber of twenty to thirty years of age to sponge o;i the public.",38
157,Mr LAZZARINI,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,"As I understand pensions. it , it would not do so. I do not wish to repeat arguments that have been used i the debate, but it surprises me that one should hold the view that it is Treasurer drunkenness and improvidence that compensions pel people to accept old-age pensions It is the social system under which we cost of living? live that forces old people to take penshowing sions to keep body and soul together. Those who are giving their best in the various industries and employments of the country are not receiving sufficient remuneration to - enable them to lay for their olcl age, and the Legislature, realizing this, provided old-age pensions. cations have increased. We should now go further, and see the pensions are at least made adequate. I would supplement the old-age and valid pensions system with the pensions system proposed by this motion. should be sorry if it were thought that I and soul. like to see those who are earning money careless in the spending of it , and in such a way that they are bound to require support in their old age. It however, an undoubted fact .that who squander their money contribute more to the revenue than those who save it , because of the heavy duties on commodities which they consume so largely; and thus the old-age pension gives back to them only some part of what they have contributed to the revethe nue in Customs taxation. The Treasurer ried. has told us that the applications for pensions increase whenever the rates of pensions increase. But it should be patent to a'schoolboy that it is the increasing cost of living that makes it more and more difficult for sons and daughters to maintain their parents, and thus causes an increasing number of old persons to apply for pensions. - people do' not like their parents to accept the old-age pension, regarding this pauperization. That is not it. Nowadays, however, the cost of honourable livin g is so high, and is mounting so much higher almost every week, that they find it impossible to rear their families, and also to maintain their parents, and consequently the latter are compelled to apply for old-age pensions.",38
158,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,"The cost of living of the is constantly increasing, but there is not a similar constant increase in the numof old-age pensioners; it is only when the rates .of pensions are increased that there is a jump in the applications for",38

How does the know tfliat the applications for are not increasing in a manner - corresponding with the increase in the He has no statistics the weekly applications for pensions.

We can then full y safeguard the interests of the people, and protect the public funds. My concern now is to support the claims of those who deserve consideration. Let us give just consideration to the wants of those in the community who are in unfortunate circumstances. W it h in recent months I have come into contact, in my own district, with a very sad case indeed. The misfortune of sickness and other ills had fallen on the home to such a degree that the family were left penniless through no fault of - their own. The father had been in the hospital, and while there three littl e mites had been born into the home, although the word ""-home"" is scarcely a proper description, for it was merely a kind of shelter, and very inadequate at that. There was a family besides the three new arrivals, and all were absolutely without food and clothing beyond that which resulted from the benevolence of their fellow citizens. There ought to be some provision to meet such cases as that.  troduce a measure of the kind proposed 1",39
170,Mr MAKIN,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,"I am asking the honourable member to give his support to the principle, leaving it to the Government to frame legislation providing the necessary - safeguards against the possible imposition that has been suggested. Candidly, I would prefer a general scheme of national insurance in the case of life , [126]- 2 sickness, or unemployment, which would, I think, carry out the wishes of the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney).",39
171,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,"The honourable member is a young man, and I warn him to be careful in discussing national insurance. When we suggested such a thing we were denounced all over the country as being against old-age pensions.",39
172,Mr MAKIN,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,"I can allow the honourable member for Melbourne in his reply to refresh the memory of the Treasurer on that point. In every community there are people placed in unfortunate circumstances, because of sickness and unemployment; and I do not think that any man worthy of the name would desire to accept charity unless it was absolutely necessary for the support of his wife and dependants. My fellow citizens have, 1 think, a keen desire to give a quid pro quo for any assistance rendered to them: and, in my opinion, only a very small percentage of them would seek to impose on the public funds. However, the fact that there might be imposition does not justify opposition to a measure of the kin d suggested; at any rate, we should not neglect those who are deserving of consideration on any such ground. I have a knowledge of the poorer classes of the community in my own district and elsewhere, and I wish to do something to help those who cannot help themselves.",39
173,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,"Hav e you ever considered ways and means ? We are spending £5,300,000 on old-age and invalid pensions, and the present proposal, if carried out, would more than double that.",39
174,Mr MAKIN,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,"I suppose that arguments in regard ta inadequacy of financial resource were used against the proposal to institute old-age and invalid pensions, and also the maternity grant. In Australia, with our vast resources, we need have no very great fear about financial difficulties such as a number of honourable members have suggested. If but why in- we had sufficient acumen to manage the affairs of the country in the way they shbuld be managed, controlling more efficiently the wealth produced in Australia and providing employment for all who desired it , there would be returned to the Treasury more than sufficient to meet our obligations as a nation and the wants of our less fortunatecitizens. It is-not only-the men who have to contend with, difficulties of the kind , but the wives and children, perhaps, suffer even more acutely. The wives have to make the greater sacrifices, and it is with the idea of succouring them in times ofadversity that I support the motion.",39
175,Mr JACKSON,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,"Bass) [ 4 . 6 9 ] - I i , as the honourable, member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin) says, this is a young country with vast resources, there ought to be no such thing here as unemployment - Sir",40
176,Mr MAKIN,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,We cannot help unemployment in cases of sickness.,40
177,Mr JACKSON,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,"As to sickness, hundreds of thousands of people in Australia, by means of friendly societies, provide insurance for themselves, though, of course, destitution is a different matter, and is very often, caused by sickness. The danger I see in the motion is that it would bring about a sort of "" won'tw o r k "" section in Australia. If ever there was a time in. our history when every man should take off his coat and produce something, it is today. I refer honourable members to a statement which appeared in the Australian Mining Standard, of 17th July, made by Samuel Gompers, the Labour leader in America, who says that the cost of living is not going to come down until everybody puts his shoulder to the wheel to produce more. That gentleman does not wish people to become wagetlaves, but points out that it is the application of science to industry that will bring about the cheapening of production and a reduction in the cost of living.",40
178,Mr CONSIDINE,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,Does he mention what is the cause of the high cost of living?,40
179,Mr JACKSON,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,"Yes , he says it is lack of production, and I commend Mr . Gompers' statement to the honourable member.",40
180,Mr MAKIN,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,That hardly applies to the question before us.,40
181,Mr JACKSON,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,"It applies to my argument that we should produce more, and that there ought to be no necessity for unemployment. I can point to scores of factories, within a very short distance 15s. per week. of this House, which are crying out for labour and cannot get it ; and yet we asked to adopt a proposal that would make unemployment more general than before. Owing",40
182,Mr MAKIN,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,"Y o u utter a libel on working community when y.ou say that. Mr JACKS p N - I do not. Australia is no different from any other country, is and we have people here who will not work if they can help it ; and, further, say this proposal is of a kind to increase that tendency. The honourable member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney) did not give the House any idea how his proposal was to be financed, or how much he anticipated it would cost. Before he went so deeply into the question from the destitution point of view, he should, I think, have been able to give us some idea of the financial aspect. JOSEPH COOK - Especiall y as honourable members opposite, in nearly every speech, howl for rigid economy.",40
183,Mr JACKSON,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,"Yes , and at the same time propose the expenditure of millions on a scheme like that before us. The Australian people at the - present time are better off than the people of any nation in the world. L i v in g is cheaper here than elsewhere, and during the years of the war we suffered no hardship whatever in the matter of food, though every other countr y did. Until the honourable member, for Melbourne informs us how he proposes his scheme can be financed, I cannot alter my opinion that, if carried into effect, it would prove a bad one for Australia.",40
184,Mr RILEY,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,South Sydney) [ 5 . 5 ] I support the motion. I cannot understand the contention of the honourable member for Bass (Mr Jackson) that the granting of a destitute allowance would bring about more unemployment. We cannot imagine any healthy man choosing to remain unemployed with a view to securing a destitute allowanoe of 15s. per week.,40
185,Dr MALONEY,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,And committing perjury to do so.,40
186,Mr RILEY,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,"I have met numerous cases of men too old to be employed, and not old enough to receive the old-age pension, who are in need of relief.",40
187,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,"Honourable members opposite are inconsistent. All the while they are contending that 15s. per week is a starvation wage for the old-age pensioner, and yet they come forward with another proposition to ration a man at",40

We claim that the old age pensioner is not receiving enough. to the increase in the cost of l i v the ing the pension of 12s. 6d., which was a fair payment some time ago, is a starvation rate today. The present proposition merely a g if t to meet cases of distress. The Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) raises I the question of finance. We had to find the money for carrying on a great war, and if it had continued we would still have to find it , and honourable members opposing the Government would help them to do so; and if another war should break out we would find monev for it . but wheD it becomes a matter of assisting the pioneers who have helped to develop this country, we are told that there is a shortage of money. We ought to face the matter fairly, and determine to find the necessary, fund's. During the war nearly every firm engaged in industry has piled up huge reserves. Every morning we see in the newspapers that wealthy corporations have gone into liquidation in order to subdivide their shares. Having accumulated so much money, they can afford to give their shareholders three shares for every one at present held, and when they claim that they are not paying more than 6 per cent, in the shape of dividends, in reality they are distributing 24 per cent, on the original shares. They are covering their operations in this way. The vessels owned by the Sydney Perries Limited being now three times more valuable than they were during the war, the company has been reconstructed in order to bring its capital to a higher figure, and on) this higher figure the dividends will be paid in future. The object of these companies in going into liquidation is to evade taxation.",40
189,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,"The honourable member and his friends are responsible for all that sort of thing. They go to the A r b i tration. Court and secure an award, and up goes the price. It is a case of a dog living on its own tail, and it has been going on for years.",41
190,Mr RILEY,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,"The Treasurer has raised the question of finance. I have glanced through the Supply Bill presented to us today, and find that there is a great deal of waste in the Navy, which the right honourable gentleman so recently controlled. For example, for the maintenance of our fleet. £178,000 is required, excluding the provision for wages.",41
191,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,That money is all spent on wages.,41
192,Mr RILEY,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,"Yes , on waste labour. Instead of spending money on cleaning buttons and the wearing of white caps, and on ' teaching men to salute, for t h , it ought to be spent in some direction in which it can be made to produce wealth.",41

194,Mr RILEY,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,"If we are in a tigh t position financially we ouo-ht to cut down our expenditure on the A r m y and Navy, on which, according to the last Budget figures, we are spending £1,500,000 per week. That expenditure ought to come down.",41
195,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,It is coming down.,41
196,Mr RILEY,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,"I am pleased to hear it . I hope that it will come down with a thud. There is no need to retain at the Barracks so many of the officers who have eome back from the Front. We turn out the private and tell hi m to find employment, but do not seem to be able to get a large number of the officers off the paysheet. One way in which the Treasurer could find the money for the destitute allowance would be by cutting down the expenditure on the Fleet. Instead of having vessels moving up and down the coast wasting oil they ought to be taken up Sydney harbour and laid up for a while.",41
197,Mr FLEMING,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,What is the use of creating wealth unless we can defend it?,41

199,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,The only economy which the honourable member can suggest is to destroy the Army and Navy.,41
200,Mr RILEY,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,"I do not say that we should destroy it . I suggest that in themeantime it can be maintained on a peace footing. Let me remind the Treasurer that, when he returned from the Peace Conference, he painted a glowing picture of the peace and harmony and good-will that would prevail among men, and told us of how it would be possible to cut down the great economic waste brought about by war. Apparently he has now gone back on what he then said. If the community is to derive any good from the war it ought to be in the direction of reduced expenditure on naval and military establishments. . It is useless for the Treasurer to utter a hope unless he tries to act up to it .",41
201,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,It is useless for us to try to act up to it unless some of and so ' our neighbours do the same.,41

205,Mr JACKSON,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,If the Treasurer can find it .,42
206,Mr RILEY,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,I have pointed out that the Treasurer can get the money from the institutions which have been accumuunder lating wealth during the war. These pare firms made no sacrifices during the war while building up huge fortunes.

I invite him to comthe figures for 1913 with those of 1918. In the latter year labour received ! only 17s. for each £100 of wealth which it created, whereas in 1913 it received £ 1 0s. 6d. That suggests that there cannot be much "" going s l o w "" about the [5.15] - working man in these days. An objection has been taken to the motion, that there is no money to proapplivide what the honourable member for through Melbourne (Dr Maloney) seeks. There memwould have been ample money available secretaries if the finances of this country had been a properly handled throughout the war.

The delay on another the part of the Government in grappling to with such important problems as those of The principle finance and the necessity for increased finds support taxation is only injuring the country. I did not hesitate to call the ex-Treasurer Bass (Mr Mr W at t ) a muddler.",42
210,Mr FENTON,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,"Has not the present Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) indicated that a sumamounting to nearly £600,000,000 today escapes taxation in Australia 1",42
211,Mr WEST,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,"That is so; and what a fine opportunity it offers the Treasurer upon assuming office! I wish that I had such a chance. I would soon get my brains to work, and it would not be long before the country would benefit. should never have been necessary to in augurate the latest loan. Unhappily, however, our finances have been conducted on a system of muddle. Before long, we shall have to stop borrowing. The rate of interest for redemption! of loans is continually rising. When the ex-Treasurer (Mr Watt ) left for England I was convinced that he had been sent on a fool's errand; and, after reading a press cablegram to the effect that the Bank of England would not lend money at a lower rate of interest than 8 per cent., to prevent undue borrowing, I tabled a motion directing the Government to inform the Treasurer that he should undertake no loans and enter into no contracts. I am heartily glad that British monev-lenders are so chary about lending either to the Commonwealth or to the States at the present time. The purpose of the honourable member for Melbourne - (Dr Maloney) is most laudable, and I strongly support it . There is nothing like sufficient provision in Australia today to meet hard cases. New South Wales the State Government pays 5s. a week in a case where a child has lost its breadwinner; and in several of the other States I understand there is a somewhat similar provision. However, this should be a Commonwealth matter. Some reference has been made to the position in which union secretaries would find themselves if thrown back upon their old avenues of employment. There are quite a lot of people, apart from union secretaries, who might have to face hardships if they were compelled to return to their former work. I can look back to the time when I used to see the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) standing t h in and miserable at the pit's mouth. not know whether he would like to go back to his old job with unknown possibilities. The honourable member for Bass (Mr Jackson) referred to friendly societies and the assistance they aTe able t<5 give in time of sickness. I joined a friendly society when I was sixteen years of age, and I have never missed paying my contributions. I have had no help from the society, but I continue to pay. my contributions, because hy so doing I help others and because otherwise I might be accused of meanness, although I am entitled to exemption by the subvention scheme of the New South Wales It Government. I think that good will be the outcome of this motion. We must not believe all the harsh things we hear about people. We do not always know the causes of individual poverty.. A man often becomes destitute through no f a u l t of his own; but even if the man is at fault my sympathies are still with him . I prefer to take account of what is good in him, and make such provision for him that he need not go about Australia hungry.",43
212,Mr FLEMING,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,"Robertson) [ 6 . 3 7 ] - I have listened with a good deal of attention to the truly characteristic speech delivered by the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr West). But I take exception to the manner in which the honourable member, as well as the mover of the motion (Dr Maloney), proposed, as it were, to sacrifice the whole of Australia to what might be termed "" h a r d oases."" There is a well-known saying that hard cases make bad laws, and whilst I have as much sympathy with In those who suffer as has either of those honourable members, I cannot wholeheartedly support such a sweeping proposition as this. We cannot allow ourselves to be carried away by our sympathy with those who suffer to such an extent as to endanger the whole future of this magnificent country. Y e t that is about the position at which we are arriving. I draw the attention of the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney) to the fact that this sort of philanthropy can bp carried too far. I shall try to approach the matter from two distinct stand-points. To-day the commercial and financial struggle throughout the world is extremely keen, I do and the reconstruction that is taking place after the tremendous devastation caused during the last four years of war must depend on the relative productivity of the people more than on anything else. No nation can carry such a load as some honourable members are inclined to impose upon Australia, and succeed in the struggle for existence. Because the struggle for existence of individuals and nations alike depends on striking a fair balance, and if we go to the extreme in either direction we are bound to suffer loss, and in some cases destruction. Consider what has happened in civilization during the last hundred years. We are living in an industrial civilization based upon coal and iron, and, naturally, by the aggregation of peoples which must necessarily follow on our industrialism, there is a good deal of suffering and want which could be avoided .if things were properly managed. If we follow the trend of affairs, we shall find that this industrial civilization, aggregating as it does the misery of the world in certain portions, has centred the minds of all thoughtful men on the problem of how best to relieve the sufferings and poverty that naturally congregate about big cities. In the first place we established hospitals. No person with any humanity in him would condemn or say a word a?ainst those institutions. They have relieved a great deal of suffering which could not have been otherwise dealt with. They have preserved many very valuable lives; they have been a boon and a blessing to the whole of our social system. But there is this fact which must be weighed in the balance against them, namely, that they are constantly patching up those who are unfit, and sending them out into the world again to propagate their species. One law of nature which can never he controverted is that the lower the species the greater is its reproductivity. That happens in human nature along the same lines as in the vegetable and animal kingdoms. And if we continue developing the sentimental side of the human race, or of that particular section of the race to which we belong, we shall overload ourselves to such an extent that we shall not be able to prevail in the struggle for existence against those races which adopt a system which, while none the less humane, is more logical and intellectual. That fact is evident to any man who studies the sociology of our present civilization. There is a tendency amongst us to overload our community, our Empire, and our Western civilization in such a way that unless we are careful we shall degenerate and come under the control Mr Fleming. of those people who do not allow' themselves to be earned away to a dangerous extent-in our opinion, they do not go far - enough - by an over-sympathetic mind and heart. That seems to me to be a real and grave danger. Prom the hospitals we proceeded to the establishment of old-age pensions. They, too, are a very good thing, because no one can but admit that our old people who have served their country well are deserving of help from the country in their old age. And the old-age pensioners are not a real burden on the community further than by their consumption of products, because they do not reproduce and increase the number of unfit that the community has to carry. But if we carry this sort of assistance to the extent suggested by the honourable member for Melbourne-wh o makes these proposals from the kindness of his heart, but with too much sentimentalism-and allow every person who is prepared to make a statutory declaration that he is in need to be not only protected and preserved, but actually housed and fed by the community, how long shall we be able to maintain our virility?. What made the Australians so famous in the Old World during recent years? It was the vigour, independence, force . of character, and physical and moral strength of our boys. How are those characteristics derived? They are due to the fact that we have not yet degenerated into the lines which it is so evident we shall fall into if we adopt the proposal made by the honourable member for Melbourne - Even the honourable member, with his big heart, must realise and admit that there are in the community persons who would live upon s.uch assistance and never attempt to do any work. Everybody knows-and what is the use of shutting our eyes to the fact and being afraid to state it-that there are in the community people who are prepared at any time to live at the expense of their neighbours.",43
213,Mr MAKIN,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,We could make provision to exclude them.,44
214,Mr FLEMING,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,"How can we exclude them under this scheme, which provides that any person who makes a statutory declaration that he is in want shall be housed and fed by the community? If legislative effect were given to the scheme the Bill would require to he in accordance with the terms of this motion. No man wants less than I do to see suffering. I cannot understand how any man can stand by and see his fellowbeings, or even any being in the animal world, suffer without wishing to offer relief. But there is a point beyond which i i is extremely dangerous - to go.",44
215,Mr RYAN,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,Can the honourable member give an illustration of his argument from any legislation in any other part of the world?,45
216,Mr FLEMING,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,"Histor y provides many illustrations. We can refer back to the history of the civilization of the Punjaub and the civilization of the Incas and various other peoples. History shows that in many cases nations have fallen victims to excessive sentimentalism. The balance must be struck, and we shall be doing a cruel thing, which more than anything else will bring destruction to this grand young virile race of ours, if we overload it in the manner that is proposed. Mr Gabb and other honourable members interjecting,",45
217,Mr FLEMING,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,I wish the honourable member for Germany would give me an opportunity to speak.,45
218,Mr MAKING,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,I think that remark regarding the honourable member for Angas (Mr Gabb) was most unfair and should be withdrawn.,45
219,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY," Before calling upon the honourable member for Robertson (Mr. Fleming) to withdraw the offensive remark, I again ask honourable members to assist the Chair in preserving order. There were so many intersections at once that it was impossible for me to hear what was said. It is unfair that, following a chorus of interjections, the Chair should be called upon to decide a question of order. If the honourable member made that statement, it was offensive, and I ask him to withdraw it.",45
220,Mr FLEMING,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,"I made that reply to the interjection of the honourable member. I did not wish public notice to be taken of it, and I withdraw it, as requested. We cannot afford to allow ourselves to be swept off our feet by a rush of sentimentality. To do so would be to damage the community as a whole.",45
221,Mr RILEY,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,That was said when the old-age pensions were first proposed.,45
222,Mr FLEMING,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,"I have never objected to the old-age pensions, because I hold that the old people have earned them; but this motion leads us by the slippery path of sentimentalism to destruction.",45
223,Mr CONSIDINE,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,That is right. Starve them out!,45
224,Mr FLEMING,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,"We are a civilized people, and no member of. this community would wish any one to starve; but if we have the real welfare of Australia at heart we shall not overload our citizens for the support of those who are able to do for themselves. Competition is the law of life. Every individual, from the highest-placed man to the humblest insect, has to struggle and fight in order to live. If the need for effort were entirely removed, the strength of the individual and the strength of the nation would depart. It is because I see in the proposal of the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney) the cloven hoof of sentimentalism that I object to ' . it.",45
225,Mr MAHONY,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,Has not the honourable member heard of mutual aid?,45
226,Mr FLEMING,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,"We all believe in mutual aid; it is taught to us by Christianity, and our civilization is built on it. But we have to strike the balance between the struggle for existence which is imposed by a law of nature and the mutual aid theory to which the honourable member refers. The strength and purification of nations depends upon the struggle that they make to live. Sloth leads only to disease and to individual and national decay.",45
227,Mr RILEY,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,Then what is the good of social legislation?,45
228,Mr FLEMING,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,"I raise no objection to legislation for the improvement of the conditions of the community, but I am against extreme measures.",45

M - No one doubts for a moment the bona fides of the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney), or the largeness of heart which he invariably brings to bear on motions of this kind. I certainly think, however, that before we carry a bald motion, couched in these terms, without any .adequate safeguard SO' far as the total amount of expenditure is concerned, it would be well to consider the amendment moved by the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Fleming). PAIBSMr RYAN - What does the honourable member say would be the effect of carrying the motion?",46

The number who would come within those terms would be was decided great, particularly in the cities, and it would be exceedingly dangerous to accept the first part of the motion, and' then say, in the second part, that the whole should form an instruction to the Government to introduce a measure to carry out the object of the honourable member for Melbourne. It was for that reason, when I first read the motion, that I drafted an amenld'ment to omit the last words of the first paragraph, "" until relieved,"" with a view to providing thaithose concerned should receive the amount mentioned., to be reduced by 2s. 6d. a week for each adult, and Is. 3d. a week for each child, until the amount allotted became exhausted. say in all sincerity that there are, unshould fortunately, some people who, if they get au) opportunity- I was going to say, would' "" sponge,"" for lack of a better word; at any rate, there are those who, given a chance to secure even the small amount mentioned per week, would do so.",46

240,Mr BURCHELL,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,"There is much in that idea, but probably the honourable member for Angas (Mr Gabb), like other honourable members and myself, is constantly receiving applications for assistance by people in unfortunate circumstances; and I can say that, so far as I am concerned, no deserving case has been turned away. I am not bragging in saying that, but simply describing the typica experience of honourable members generally.",47

I have heard the complaint made that the passing of a motion by a private member carries us no further towards the object desired. That may be so; and one of the reasons probably is that honourable members are apt to accept ill-considered propositions. If honourable members would put forward workable and sound proposals, undoubtedly said was the Government would be prepared to give effect to them. P r i o r to the last election I was asked to deal with the matter of providing pensions for widows and orphans, and on his return to Australia.

I need hardly remind honourable members do that the industrial problem, which has been a very considerable one during these many years, has been intensified as a result of the great world war. The problem acis world-wide. It manifests itself in paraevery country. In essence it is the same everywhere, though in different countries it is manifested in different ways. In this Commonwealth Labour has, owing to organization, political and industrial, been able to exercise considerable influence, it has been a problem which has engaged the attention of the Commonwealth and State Legislatures for very many years. B y general consent at the present time it is recognised as a problem 1 which imperatively demands the attention of all citizens, and, if possible, some solution. There was a time when, with others, I thought that industrial unrest could be, I will not say swept away, but rendered comparatively innocuous by recourse to those remedies which this and other Legislatures have tried. have been chastened by experience, and have come to see that industrial unrest is at once the price that the world is paying for progress, and the punishment from which the world is suffering as the fruits of a system which in the past failed utterly to recognise the basic factors of production. I am not going to trouble the House with many more generalities, but I have always held that production was not a matter which concerns the individual only. It is primarily a collective function. Society is vitally concerned in production, both in its capacity as a producer and a consumer, and it is not proper that individuals-whethe r they be employers or employees is immaterial-shoul d carry on production without regard to the welfare of the community as a whole. Honourable members are well aware that we have had on the statute-book of the Commonwealth for many years an Act for the settlement of industrial disputes by means of a Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. They know very well what our constitutional power is in regard to industrial matters. In the early days of this Commonwealth' members of this Parliament were under the impression that our powers were much wider than the High Court has since decided them to be. It is now quite clear that the powers of the Commonwealth in relation to industrial matters are covered entirely ""by the words of paragraph xxxv. of section 51 of the Constitution, which reads as follows: _ Conciliation and arbitration for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State. where I need not remind honourable members that this power is a very restricted and unsatisfactory one. Very many attempts have been made to widen it , but unsuccessfully. Even at the present time the High Court, in considering a case, has delivered important dicta which seem likely to . materially affect our powers under this section. These dicta, as far as I have been able to gather, widen our power.",48
262,Mr RYAN,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,Ver y much.,49
263,Mr HUGHES,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,"They widen our power so far as it has relation to State instrumentalities. We need not consider this phase of the matter further at this juncture, .but it is proper, I think, that But we passing reference should be made to it in order that honourable members may clearly understand both the foundation on which our power rests and its limitations. Under the power given to the Com- "" monwealth by paragraph xxxv. of section 51 of the Constitution, we have created an Arbitration Court with a President and a Deputy. This Court has done excellent work; but the present position of the Court is one of great congestion. The methods of the Court are now, and always have been, cumbrous in the extreme. Normally the procedure is, first of all, for the organization concerned to file a plaint. This, in some cases, means that hundreds of employers have to be served throughout the Commonwealth. The Builders' Labourers case is a glaring example of how far this can go. A f t e r the plaint has been filed, and the other party or parties notified, the case is then set down for hearing. The case may ' not come before, the Court for many months. The present position of the Court is that there are forty-two cases on the list, and that despite the fact that two Judges have been sitting almost continuously. As honourable members are aware, unions have had to wait for very many months before securing a hearing of their case. In some cases from the time the plaint is filed u n t i l the case is decided a year and more may elapse. The hearing of cases is often very protracted. There are many reasons for this. One - is that the Judge is necessarily unfamiliar with the trade or industry - whose conditions he is called upon to settle. All this delay, it is very obvious, makes for industrial unrest. There are two ways of settling industrial disputes. One is direct action-that is the strike; the other, recourse to some form of peaceful adjustment by agreement between the parties, or by arbitration. In the Commonwealth we have hitherto had recourse to the machinery provided by the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, with which honourable members are familiar. should be doing the Arbitration Court a grievous wrong to say that it has not done great service to this country; but no one will deny that experience has shown that for many reasons it is not the ideal instrument for the settlement of disputes. Now, - if honourable members contrast this cumbrous procedure of the Court, its ineffective and expensive methods of settling disputes, with the expeditious methods of such a body as the shipbuilding tribunal, they must admit - if they bring an impartial mind to bear on the matter-that Parliament would be wrong if it did not indicate in the plainest manner possible that it was of the opinion that industrial unrest was more likely to be allayed and disputes settled by such tribunals than by the Court. The tribunal in question has been in existence for about two and a half years, and has given about 286 decisions. That is to say, it has settled 286 disputes. And it has not only settled all disputes arising in the industry, but has maintained unbroken industrial peace in the industry. It has done this in the face of certain conditions to which a great number of unionists were very much opposed. The basic conditions of the . shipbuilding agreement were continuity of employment, piece-work, and dilution of labour. Honourable members know how strongly organized labour opposed the introduction of piece-work and the dilution of labour. Yet looking back over the two and a half years that have gone, we see that industrial peace has been - maintained. Eor all practical purposes, there has been no break in the continuity of employment. And having had two and a half years' experience of the tribunal the unions, now that the period is approaching when this agreement will expire, have requested that it shall be renewed. Sufficient has been said, then, Mr Hughes. to show that the tribunal has done most excellent work. Its record speaks for itself. But not only does the Arbitration Court suffer by comparison with the tribunal 'by its failure to deal with cases expeditiously and economically, but also for the reason that it has been unable to settle some disputes at all. We We have to face the fact that, despite every effort .that may be made to preserve industrial peace, strikes may occur. It is true that, these may not he strikes within the meaning of the Act. The public, however, are not concerned with names, but with things; not with shadows, but with realities. The Arbitration 'Court has failed to settle some very serious strikes which have paralyzed this community. This was particularly shown in the seamen's dispute. The men made certain demands, and, as they were not conceded, they went on strike. A compulsory conference was called by the President of the Court. No agreement was arrived at. The President has laid it down that unions cannot have strikes and arbitration, and that he will not deal with a dispute until the men involved have returned to work. I am not going to criticise .that attitude; it is very logical and very proper. But it leaves the community in a most unfortunate position, because when the President of the Arbitration Court says, "" I shall not hear you until you get back to work,"" and the men say, "" We will not go back to wprk until you hear us ""-for that is, in effect, what they do say-the strike goes on and the community suffers. As I have said, and as honourable members well know, the Arbitration Court failed to settle this dispute. A conference was called by the Government, and an agreement was arrived at after a stoppage covering some five months. Then, in the coal miners' case, the machinery of the Arbitration Court failed to bring about industrial peace, and another tribunal had to be provided. This was, in . one of its aspects, at any rate, under the War Precautions Act; and the coal-miners today are working under an agreement arrived at as the result of a round-table conference. That agreement is enforced by a regulation under the War Precautions Act which precludes the employers from increashave ing the price of coal without the consent of the Commonwealth Governsaid, ment. D u r in g the past three or fou weeks I have had no fewer than three conferences with the coal-miners and the mine-owners. The miners desire an alteraacts tion of existing conditions. The ment itself expires, I think, in October or November this year. But the condibe ultra vires. tions of some of the lower paid day wage aside. men are such that, with the high cost of living, it is, they contend, imposstitutionality sible for them to live on the wage now receive under the existing agreeposition ment. They demand redress. referred to the Arbitration Court they decline to go. I express no opinion about their attitude. I deal with facts. They want a tribunal, and are willin g to attorn to a tribunal subject certain conditions, and to submit all their grievances thereto, including which relates to the lower paid wage men. This Bill will enable us point a tribunal clothed with all the powers possessed by the Commonwealth. Another instance may be cited wherein the Arbitration Court failed to settle a de facto strike; I refer to the dispute between the marine engineers and their employers. The men would not go to the Arbitratio n Court. There was no machinery, other than that provided.by the War Precautions Act by which at r i bunal could be created. Honourable members know that for six or eight weeks the shipping of this country was dislocated, and many industries were most seriously affected, because there were no legal means by which the parties could be brought together. No decision binding on the parties could be given by any tribunal appointed under the powers of the Commonwealth under the Constitution. That dispute was settled as the outcome of conferences and by the action of the Government. During the war the Government was able to exercise powers given to it under the War Precautions Act to deal with many disputes and with many matters which, ordinarily, it could not touch. This War Precautions Act, about the genesis and exodus pf which",49
264,Mr TUDOR,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,There has been no exodus.,51
265,Mr HUGHES,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,"There will be an they exodus: This Act, concerning the genesis and exodus of which diverse opinions been expressed in this Chamber, will ultimately disappear. Many times I have and I say it again, that, in my r opinion, any regulations relating to matters which are not clearly the aftermath of war and necessary to give effect to done during the war, but which agreecould not be completed while the war continued, would be held by the Courts to However, I put that We are desirous of creating machinery about the legality and conof which there shall be they no dispute. We are faced now with a which demands action. ' It is When useless denouncing direct action and urging men to seek legal redress for their industrial grievances unless the means of the redress are ready to hand speedily and economically. In .the case of the coalto mining industry a tribunal has been promised to the men. Whether the men will that accept the kind of tribunal that the powers of this Commonwealth, will give to apthem is another matter; but certainly they will not attorn to the jurisdiction of the Court. Then the agreement with the unions engaged in shipbuilding is about to come to an end. The Commonwealth is faced with the position that unless it has power to create a tribunal which will exercise the functions of the present tribunal, the shipbuilding industry cannot proceed. The men will not work unless that tribunal, or one similar to it , is continued. That is one of the vital conditions which the unionists demand. In these circumstances, if there were no other reasons for introducing the Bill at the present juncture than the position which obtains in the coal-mining and shipbuilding industries, the Government would be amply justified in bringing it forward. But, in my opinion, our experience of the shipbuilding tribunal warrants an extension of this principle to other industries. I believe that tribunals of this kind, flexible, convenient, expeditious, and economical,.are much more likely to promote industrial peace,' and prevent in dustrial turmoil, than is the. Arbitration Court as it exists today. I shall return to these tribunals presently; but when I ask honourable members to consider the general position of the industrial world will recognise that something more is required than the power to appoint industrial tribunals to deal with industrial disputes if we are to bring about indust r i a l peace. It has been said that what is really necessary is that the parties to in dustrial disputes should get together. I think that that is a very wise saying. At present the machinery for bringing them together is The parties naturally view each other with suspicion, and they have a perfect right to do so. The employers sometimes think that the causes of industrial unrest lie with the men. Nothing can be farther from the truth . The causes of industrial unrest are inherent in_ society. The honourable member for Barrier (Mr . Considine) mentioned that fact the other, evening. If I may say so the causes of industrial unfresb are inherent - in something even more permanent than society - the y are inherent in human nature.",51
266,Mr CONSIDINE,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,And human nature is the product of society.,52
267,Mr HUGHES,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,"H u m a n nature is a very curious and wonderful thing. The inability of men to recognise that aniy cause but their own is founded upon justice has been a distinguishing t r a it of mankind from the beginning. It may be said, therefore, with safety that one of the best methods of allaying suspicion, and of promoting harmony, is to bring the opposing parties together. Por all sensible men must recognise the fact that without the hearty co-operation of labour it is impossible to secure industrial peace. Further, we must realise that labour, not only in Australia, but in other countries, has now reached a point where it will demand that recognition. But as things stand now, suitable machinery for bringing the parties together and for recognising the status of labour as a full partner in production does not exist. This Bill creates this machinery. Provision is made for the establishment of a central and of district councils, composed of an equal number of representatives of employers and employees. The functions of these councils will be of an advisory character. Their purview will cover the whole industrial sphere. They will consider the causes of industrial unrest, they will suggest remedies, and they will endeavour, either by joint or several action, to promote the peaceful settlement of existing disputes. Let me take a case which will serve to illustrate the usefulness of councils such as those of which I speak. There is connected with the Melbourne Trades H all a body which has been in existence for some time, and which is called the Industrial Disputes Committee. That committee has done very good, inldeed excellent, work. It is composed of men who, for the most part, inadequate. are not directly concerned in the disputes which they attempt to settle. Their function is to endeavour to bring the parties to any dispute together. They do mot preach industrial turmoil , but strive to bring about peaceful settlements. But they have no legal status. The law does not recognise them, and they are unable to approach the Legislature direct with tlieir advice. Under this Bill it is proT posed to make use of such a body as that, and by adding to it a similar number of employers' representatives, to create a counoil-by whose influence and aids the warring parties shall be brought together, their differences adjusted, and the wheels of industry kept moving, or, if arrested, put in motion again. This measure, then, provides for two things quite distinct in their nature. The first is the establishment of Councils of In dustry, whose business is to survey the whole industrial sphere, to consider what are the basic causes of industrial unrest, and to suggest remedies to the appropriate body. Where a tribunal is necessary to settle a dispute, this Council may suggest one. Where a round-table conference is desirable, the Council may recommend one, and the Governor General will thereupon call it together. There will be one Grand Council for the Commonwealth and one District Council' for each State, composed in each instance of an equal number of the representatives of organized labour and of organized capital or of employers. They will be given legal status. They will receive fees. Their business will be to advise the Government and the parties as to what ought to be dome. That is the first objective which the Bill seeks to attain. Its second aim is to create machinery by which special tribunals may be appointed to settle de facto disputes, to prevent disputes occurring, and to call compulsory or round-table conferences between the parties concerned. These special tribunals will have a chairman mutually agreed upon, or, if the parties fail to agree upon his selection, appointed by the Government. At the present moment the Broken Hill dispute is, I hope, in a fair way to be settled by a tribunal which, in essence does not differ from those proposed in this Bill, The tribunal to which I have referred is composed of an equal number of representatives of both parties, and of a chairman selected by the Premier of New South Wales and myself. The machinery provided in the Bill for the establishment of these tribunals is-very' elastic, and is adaptable to all the circumstances of industrial troubles. Take an industry in which, perhaps, there are more possibilities of unrest than are to be found in any other- I refer to the coal-mining industry. It is obvious that it is vital to the community that there shall be industrial peace in the coal-mining in dustry. It is abundantly clear that industrial peace cannot be assured in this industry by the Arbitration Court alone. A tribunal which is composed of an equal number of representatives of both parties, with an impartial chairman, is much more likely to bring about an agreement which will be mutually acceptable than is the Arbitration Court. Honourable members, I am sure, appreciate the advantages of a tribunal upon which the parties who are charged .with the' discussion of a dispute understand matters first hand. Such a tribunal attached to the coal-mining industry will be a step in the right direction. But, obviously, one tribunal will not be sufficient to deal with the whole industry. In this Bill , therefore, provision is made for the appointment of local tribunals, whose function it will be to attach themselves to districts, or even to mines, for the purpose of dealing with local disputes as they arise. It frequently happens that disputes occur consequent upon the action of wheelers or.of boys in a mine, with the result that the whole of the employees in it become idle, and there is no tribunal on the spot to deal with the trouble. In the .shipbuilding industry, in which there are endless possibilities of disputes owing to demarcation troubles, the tribunal is at hand and deals with the trouble right away. I commend this measure to honourable members because it is one which by reason of its ""elasticity, the expeditious way in which it will permit disputes to be dealt with , the personnel of the t r i bunals which are to be established, and of all the attendant circumstances, is much more likely to promote industrial peace than is our present arbitration system. No doubt these tribunals will , to a certain [127] extent, overlap the Arbitration Court, but their jurisdiction is limited by the proviso to clause 15Provided that no dispute as to which a plaint is pending in the Court, and the hearing has commenced, shall be referred to a special tribunal. All other disputesare referable to special tribunals. But clause .17 providesNotwithstanding anything in this Act, if a special tribunal is satisfied that abnormal circumstances have arisen which affect the fundamental justice of any terms of an award made by the Court, the tribunal .may set aside or vary any terms so affected.",52
268,Mr TUDOR,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,Giv e the Arbitration Court that power to vary awards and we shall get along a little faster.,53
269,Mr HUGHES,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,"We propose to give the Court that power. Honourable members may please themselves as to what they do with the Bill . I put it forward because I believe it offers an incomparably better means of settling industrial disputes than does the Arbitration Court. If honourable members choose to reject it they may do so. I have given notice of a measure to amend the Arbitration Act where the President has asked for amendment. But, in my opinion, the Arbitration Court, even when these amendments are made in the Act, will not provide effective machinery for the preservation of industrial peace and the settlement of disputes. These tribunals and councils are necessary. They will give organized labour a recognised status and influence in this country, and the advice of such councils will be most useful to the Legislature, ' and most necessary, because on the face of things the parties themselves must be expected to understand their industry at least as well as we understand it , to say nothing of the Court. The object of the creation of these special tribunals, however, is not to supersede, but merely to supplement, the Arbitration Court. The Court will remain. Mr CowsroiNB - Will the amending Arbitration Bill make any provision for the contingency of an employer refusing to carry on his business if an award goes against him?",53
270,Mr HUGHES,PENSION FOE TEMPOEAEY,"I refer the' honourable member to the Bill . An award may be perfectly just when it is made, but changed circumstances may make a variation of it necessary. The appointment of these councils and. tribunals is a recognition of the principle of the round-table conference, which, I think, honourable members who have had experience of industrial disputes agree is the best known method of arriving at a settlement. I have had considerable experience of industrial disputes, and I say unhesitatingly that the decision of a round-table conference is more likely to .promote harmony and peace in industry than is the award of any Court. a conference is certainly more likely to give a decision speedily, for its members understand intimately the industry with which they are dealing, and so do not waste time in trying to understand dotails with which they are quite familiar. Honourable members will remember that in England the Whitley councils have been most serviceable. They, however, are not as flexible as will be. the machinery proposed in this measure. There is no limitation to the power of these councils so far as the settlement of disputes is concerned, excepting those which are i m posed hy the Constitution. W<= cannot settle a. dispute over which the Commonwealth has no jurisdiction, but as honourable members know very well, a very large number-in fact, I think, an overwhelming number - of disputes are brought under Federal jurisdiction. When this measure becomes law the powers of the Commonwealth will , of course, lack much of that complete control over industria l matters which it ought to have, out to the extent that it has . power, these tribunals will exercise it . The award or decision of a tribunal will IK binding at law and have exactly the same effect as an award of the Arbitration Court.. When it has given its award the tribunal may appoint a standing tribunal to interpret the award and give effect to it . I shall not trespass upon the patience of honourable members any further, because this is a measure which can only be dealt with effectively in Committee, when we are able to consider details. I do not pretend that this scheme is a panacea for industrial unrest - I «So not buoy myself upw i th the hope that when this measure is passed indust r i a l imrest will be in arjticulo mortis, Mr Hughes - ; . i _ j , ! :'j but I do say that the Bill is a distinct advance on existing legislation, and I believe that it m i l prove of infinite service. I invito the House to consider it most carefully and to adopt the principle it embodies. I shall be ready to listen to any suggestions made by honourable members on both sides of the House. It is true that the Bill is introduced by the Government, and is part of the policy to which the Government is committed by its election pledges, but it cannot be said to be a party measure, and I trust that Such honourable members will not treat, it as such, but rather will look at it as I doas an honest attempt to deal with the most vital problem of the present day.. I can quite understand that the Bill is open to criticism, as is every measure in troduced in this House; I myself could criticise it . It falls, for example, far short of those admirable methods of settling industrial strife, that commend themselves to the honourable member for Barrier (Mr Considine). It makes no pretence of following those principles of which Lenin and Trotsky are the chief banner-bearers. It does not provide for compulsory labour. It is merely an effort to provide machinery for making articulate labour and capital, to bsing them together, to effect a settlement of their differences, to protect society, as well as the worker and employer. It is not to ba understood as a reflection in any way on the Arbitration Court. But we are not here to bolster up institutions of any kind. AVe are here to do justice and to serve our country to the best of our ability. In my opinion the Bill represents a distinct advance. I hope it will commend itself to the House, and I earnestly hope that honourable members will be in a position to discuss and. dispose of it with as little delay as possible. Debate (on motion by Mr TUDOR) adjourned. NA INDUSTRY BILL. THIRD READING. Motion (by Mr MASSYGREENE) proposed - That this Bill be now read a third time.",53
271,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"Yarra.) [9.0] -- Although this measure has been before Parliament for nearly five years, this is the first time that it has reached the third-reading stage in this House. A Bill with the same title has been passed by the Senate on several occasions, but the Minister tells me that this is a different Bill, and will, therefore, have to be passed by the Senate after it leaves this Chamber. The fundamental principles of this meaisure .are different. For one thing, it provides for one Director instead, of three, and even the new clause, as proposed by the Minister, on the subject of Advisory Committees, is different from the original provision. In the first Bill, the Government proposed a definite State Advisory Committee. I have never heard it mentioned during the debate on this measure that there is in existence now, in the Trade and Customs Department, a Bureau of Commerce and Industry, of wMch Mr Stirling Taylor is the head. Under what authority is that body acting?",54
272,Mr BOWDEN,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,Will not this new stitute wipe that out?,55
273,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"No . We are merely building up all the time more bureaux, more institutes, and more spending departments.. I pointed out yesterday that certain Departments of the Commonwealth were taxgatherers, the two principal being the Taxation Department and the Trade and Customs Department ; while, in my opinion, the other Departments thought that they could prove the necessity foT their existence only by keeping on spending money. I eliminated the Postal Department from that classification, because it is both a gatherer and distributor of revenue, and serves a public purpose. Departments such as those of Defence and Navy are only in existence for the purpose of spending money, and apparently think that the more they spend the more completely they prove the necessity for theiT existence. I ,am very much afraid that that will be our experience under this Bill. Under paragraph c of clause 11 it is provided that the powers and functions of the Director shall, subject to the regulations and to the directions of the Minister, be "" the making of grants in aid of pure scientific research."" That gives power 'to pay out practically unlimited sums of money. The organization, in order to prove that it is doing good work, may be tempted to distribute more and more money, and to encourage scientific research into many things when more important matters could well be carried out first.",55
274,Mr MAHONY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,They may spend the money chasing blowflies.,55
275,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"I do not know whether they will spend it in that way or in trying to eradicate the prickly pear. L was opposed to many of the provisions of the Bill, and believed that there should have been a conference before it was passed. I notice that efforts are being made, by agreement with the States, to introduce a uniform system of taxation-and I Delieve ours will, at least, compare favourably with that of the States-bu t I am afraid that, as we have passed this Bill, the States will not favour that cooperation and co-ordination of effort which some honourable members so fondly expect. At the first conference which, was called in connection with the proIn- posal to establish a 'Commonwealth In stitute of Science and Industry, the Prime Minister said he was not particular as to the amount of money spent on the scheme up to £500,000. He did not' say whether he meant that that money was to be spent in one year or ten years. I believe there is necessary work to be done by the Institute, but the utmost care must be exercised in the appointment of a Director. He must be a practical man, and not a theorist, to extend, as far as possible, the work now being carried on by the Commonwealth laboratory under the Trade and Customs Department. It would have been a thousand times better to extend that branch than to set up an entirely new In stitute, which may think that, in order to prove the need foT its existence, it must spend money all the time.",55
276,Mr BOWDEN,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,The expenditure will be under the direction of the Minister.,55
277,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"Yes ; and under the direction of the House. Honourable members who have been here for some time know what that means. In some future Parliament a Bill may be brought down to authorize expenditure on the same lines as the. measure which has just been handed to me, covering Supply over three fortnightly payments, and which the Treasurer has informed me must be passed at a very early date. I do not know whether money is allocated under it for the Institute of Science and Industry, but I bave no doubt that the Government will keep on paying the salaries and wages of those engaged there. I shall be glad to'hear from the Minister, if he replies, what work is being carried out by the existing Bureau of Commerce and Industry, and why that body cannot be brought under this scheme. When the Director of the new Institute is appointed, will it be necessary to have a separate bureau of commerce and industry doing a great deal of the same work?",55
278,Mr MASSYGREENE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,They are not doing the same work.,56

281,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"Thre e representatives of labour were invited to, and were present at, the first meeting. were at least as good as the representatives that we expect to get under the Bill which the Prime Minister has introduced to-night. I believe that the three of them were all ex-presidents of the Melbourne Trades Hall Council, so that there was no doubt about their repute and of their representative capacity, and especially their ability to represent organized labour. They said they found eighteen on one side and only themselves on the other. It was a six to one proposition, and, according to their story, they were made to feel that their presence was not wanted. It is a mistake to have in existence two bodies carrying out a great deal of the same work.",56
282,Mr MASSYGREENE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,They are not doing so.,56
283,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"That fact has never been stated in this debate. I thought I would not let this Bill go through without expressing my views on that question. I hope that the expectations of the Minister and of the Ministry generally will be realized, and that the Institute will porate ? prove of groat advantage to Australia, but I am very much afraid that a great amount of money will be spent on this undertaking which could be much better spent in other directions.",56

Later on, when the Leader of the Opposition interjected that it was only fair to. say that provision for advisory councils had heen included in previous Bills, the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene) replied"".Yes, but the previous Bills did not propose to make the State advisory councils part of the Institute."" The Minister added that in that respect my proposal was entirely novel. I do not think the honourable member for Kooyong when he made his interjection was fully informed regarding what he was taking about, and I am satisfied that when the Minister made his interjection he did not know what was in the previous Bills brought in by this Government.

In Committee of Supply: Sir JOSEPH COOK Treasurer) [9.30] - I move That there be granted to His Majesty for and towards defraying the services of the year 1920-21, a sum not exceeding £2,367,820. This is a Supply Bill for one month, but the amount is a l it t l e larger than was asked for on the last occasion, when £1,83S,S47 was required, because it covers three instead of two fortnightly""payments. It provides for the payment of salaries on the 3rd September. That has been done to avoid the introduction of another Supply Bill before the end of August. There are no new items; the Bill simply grants Supply for the ordinary services for one month, in anticipation of the Estimates. The amount asked for is made up.of the following items: - Ordinar y expenditure, £1,400,301; W a r Services-repatriatio n and other things-payabl e from revenue, £367,525; Refunds of Revenue, £100,000; Advance to Treasurer, £500,000.",57
301,Mr JOWETT,RETURNED SOLDIERS AND PROMOTION,Is there nothing for Canberra ?,58
302,Sir JOSEPH COOK,RETURNED SOLDIERS AND PROMOTION,"Not in the sense that the honourable member means. The proper time to discuss Canberra will be on the Budget; I hope honourable members will not deal with it now. I am making every effort possible to bring forward the Budget before the end of August. It is not so easy to frame and shape a Commonwealth Budget as it is to frame a State Budget, because accounts have to be got in from every part of a wide continent, which makes the work more difficult, and proportionately bigger.",58
303,Mr RICHABDFOSTER,RETURNED SOLDIERS AND PROMOTION,I hope t h at you will let us see the second report of the Economies Commission before the Budget is discussed.,58
304,Sir JOSEPH COOK,RETURNED SOLDIERS AND PROMOTION,"I shall be glad to let the honourable member see any of the Commission's reports, and shall welcome help to obtain greater economy in the Public Service. I hope to discuss the EEDEEAL matter when dealing with the Budget, when I shall endeavour to show exactly what is being done to economize, and shall INCOME TAX explain how the public funds of the Com: monwealth are being spent. When the facts have been presented, honourable members will have nothing to feel ashamed of regarding the economy exercised in the Public Service. This is the first occasion for many years on which a Treasurer at the beginning of a. financial year has asked for so modest a sum as I now ask for. It (Parramatta- is, I believe, the first time for many years that a Supply Bill for one month has been brought in , it having been the custom of late to ask for Supply for two, and sometimes for three, months. I hope that the Committee will grant this modest request, so that the services may be kept going until our expenditure can be reviewed in connection with t i e Budget.",58
305,Mr TUDOR,RETURNED SOLDIERS AND PROMOTION,"Y a r r a ) [ 9 . 3 8 ] - I am glad that the Budget is to be brought down early, and I hope that honourable members will have an opportunity of discussing it early, too. Budgets have been brought down in August and September, and no opportunity has been given to discuss them before practically all the money required for the year has been voted in Supply Bills. It must nob be forgotten that we have the Tariff to consider, and that on some lines persons are laying out thousands of pounds without knowing what Parliament intends to do. We shall have to decide whether the Tariff is to be Protective, or merely revenue-producing. Mr RICHA BD FOSTER - It is producing good revenue just now.",58
306,Sir JOSEPH COOK,RETURNED SOLDIERS AND PROMOTION,And we need the money.,58
307,Mr TUDOR,RETURNED SOLDIERS AND PROMOTION,"The Treasurer seems to have forgotten 'the views which he expressed in 1901, when the Kingston Tariff was under discussion.",58
308,Sir JOSEPH COOK,RETURNED SOLDIERS AND PROMOTION,That is hardly fair. Mr LAI RD SMITH - The honourable member cannot say that it is not a protective Tariff.,58
309,Mr TUDOR,RETURNED SOLDIERS AND PROMOTION,"It may be in certain directions, but as regards .commodities that are not produced here, it is merely a revenue-producing Tariff. Men in business in this aud other States are anxious to know what this House intends doing, particularly in connection with certain lines. I know that after the Tariff has been passed by this Chamber it has to go to another place, and, although it - may be amended there, it docs not become effective until finally dealt with by this House. As we are discussing the first Supply Bill introduced by the new Treasurer, I - would like to take the opportunity of congratulating him on his appointment.",59
310,Sir JOSEPH COO,RETURNED SOLDIERS AND PROMOTION,K - I shall need the honourable member's sympathy.,59
311,Mr TUDOR,RETURNED SOLDIERS AND PROMOTION,"I think the Treasurer will need not only my sympathy, but that of every honourable member in this House. I understand that the Treasurer has stated that at the present time an enormous amount of wealth is escaping taxation.",59
312,Mr WEST,RETURNED SOLDIERS AND PROMOTION,"Yes ; about £600,000,000.",59
313,Mr TUDOR,RETURNED SOLDIERS AND PROMOTION,Is that' statement cor- it. rect?,59
314,Sir JOSEPH COOK,RETURNED SOLDIERS AND PROMOTION,"Not that amount. - Mr TUDOR - I can remember a gentleman who was respected on both sides of the 'House often saying, ""What is a million?"" Apparently the Government of the day are not concerned with single millions, as the' policy at present seems, to be one of raising many millions. The Treasurer has asked for Supply for only one month; but he must remember that he has already had one month, as Supply was granted in May before the arrival of the Prince of Wales. amount for which he is now asking will take the Government up to the middle of Septeinber. I notice that there is a Treasurer's Advance of £500,000, and no doubt the Minister will give us some information as to the manner in which: that sum is to be expended.",59
315,Mr BOWDEN,RETURNED SOLDIERS AND PROMOTION,Perhaps that is for Canberra.,59
316,Mr TUDOR,RETURNED SOLDIERS AND PROMOTION,"No , I understand that no provision has been made in the Supply Bill for any expenditure at the Federal Capital site; and I hope .that when that matter is brought forward it will be in such a way that honourable members will have the opportunity of directly voting for or against the expenditure. I would like .the Treasurer to say definitely when he expects the Supply Bill to be passed by the Senate:",59
317,Sir JOSEPH COOK,RETURNED SOLDIERS AND PROMOTION,B y next Wednes- . day.,59

319,Mr CHARLTON,RETURNED SOLDIERS AND PROMOTION,"Hunter) [9.45] It is' refreshing to hear the statement of the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook), in presenting his first financial statement since his recent appointment, that he intends bringing forward the Budget by the end of August. If the Minister is able to keep his promise, he will deserve the congratulations of every honourable member. We have, however, had similar promises in the past, and, as they have not been fulfilled, one is somewhat dubious in accepting them.",59
320,Sir JOSEPH COOK,RETURNED SOLDIERS AND PROMOTION,I think we can do,59
321,Mr CHARLTON,RETURNED SOLDIERS AND PROMOTION,"I am glad to have the Treasurer's assurance to that effect. It is the duty of the Treasurer, if he possibly can, to. bring down the Budget at the earliest possible moment to enable honourable members to discuss the Estimates in a proper way. In the past it has been the policy of the Government to go on spending the' money and passing Supply Bills, and when the Estimates were being dealt with we found that the financial year had practically expired. It is unreasonable to. The ask a deliberative assembly such as this to adopt such a practice, and, as conditions are becoming normal, there is no justification for the Government to act in that way. I desire to take this opportunity of placing before the Treasurer the necessity of the Government making some declaration concerning our Income Tax Act, as the time has surely arrived when it should be amended. Since the Act was passed the cost of living has' increased by approximately 70 per cent., and it is' time some relief was given to; the poorer people of the community. ' If at the commeneement of the war in 1914 we fixed the exemption at £156 when the cost of living was 7.0 per cent, less than it is today, there is every reason why Parliament should amend the Act to relieve the heavy imposition which is placed on those in the community who can ill afford to pay. In many cases men aTe finding great difficulty in providing for their families, and we are still continuing to collect income tax - from these people, notwithstanding the fact that it has heen declared that the basic wage shall be £3 17s. 2d. per week, which amounts, Toughly, to £190 per annum. If it takes £190 per annum to enable a man to live, surely it is not fair to say that for every £3 he receives in excess of £156 '.the exemption shall be reduced by £1. >We have also to consider the position of single men who, under the Act of 1916, have an exemption of £100, which is reduced by £1 for every £4 received over that amount. When the Bill was before this Chamber in 1915 I suggested that the exemption should not be less than £200, and it should not have been. At present the exemption should not be less than £250, in view of the'changed conditions - Already income tax forms have been circulated, and in the course of a few months the taxation officials will be making the necessary assessments. Unless the Government decide on an amendment this taxation will again be collected from people who, as I have said,are hardly able to pay it ; and that is not a fair position in which to put them. We are told that there is £550,000,000 or £560,000,000 representing income which is not taxable at all; and this means that there are very many rich people who escape. Of course, much of this is due to legislation we have passed here exempting the interest on some of the loans, but I contend that it is not fair to exempt people who are wealthy, and at the same time tax those who are really in destitute circumstances.",59
322,Sir JOSEPH COOK,RETURNED SOLDIERS AND PROMOTION,We can only alter the position in regard to loan interest by altering the Constitution.,60
323,Mr CHARLTON,RETURNED SOLDIERS AND PROMOTION,I know we have given our word in that regard. SIB JOSEPH COOK - I mean that constitutionally we cannot tax State securities.,60
324,Mr CHARLTON,RETURNED SOLDIERS AND PROMOTION,"Is the whole of this £550,000,000 represented by State securities ?",60
325,Sir JOSEPH COOK,RETURNED SOLDIERS AND PROMOTION,"Stat e securities represent £400,000,000 and our own securities £150,000,000.",60
326,Mr CHARLTON,RETURNED SOLDIERS AND PROMOTION,I think that if the matter were closely investigated we should find that some of it is not represented by exempt income from loanthat possibly a good deal belongs to people in affluent circumstances who escape taxation.,60
327,Sir JOSEPH COOK,RETURNED SOLDIERS AND PROMOTION,I have no doubt that there is a good deal of income which never pays any taxation.,60
328,Mr CHARLTON,RETURNED SOLDIERS AND PROMOTION,"That does not detract from my argument that' the poorer people should have some relief. In my opinon the cost of the war should be met by means of a sinking fund created out of income taxation. I believe it was estimated that the raising of the exemption from £156 to £200 would affect the revenue by aboiit 5 per cent.; and if the extension of the exemption to £250 were taken to represent a difference of 10 per cent., the amount necessary to make up the deficiency should be collected on incomes over that amount on a graduated scale; in other words, I would collect the money required for the purpose of paying the interest on the money - borrowed to carry on the war, from those best able to pay it. When we were at war we all desired to do our utmost to further the interests of the Commonwealth and of the Allied cause, and we borrowed this money; and it is only fair that those who made money during the war should do the most towards liquidating the debt. It cannot be doubted that there are some people who made more money in consequence of the war than they ever made in their lives before. . Those who follow the share market reports in the newspapers must see that there are many companies throughout Australia which during the last four or five years have placed large sums to reserve, with the result that today they are reconstructing. These companies paid good dividends while the war was on, and now, with the money placed to reserve, they are giving further shares to their shareholders. This plainly indicates that these companies have made more money than they were entitled to make because of the war, and the Treasury ought to be able to lay its hands on some of it ; otherwise we may look for disaster in the near future, or, at any rate, some trouble. fictitious capital being created in almost every business concern; and one result will be that, when the employees come to discuss the question of wages, it will be pointed out that on the capital shown only so much interest is being earned, though, perhaps, not a fourth of that capital is genuine, and the men on this plea will be denied a proper return for their labour. The people who are making all this money ought to be called upon to pay more than they do in taxation, u n t i l we reduce our war debt. It is not fair that the boys who fought for us while we remained in perfect security at home should be called upon to pay income tax, with the small exemption I have mentioned, when they return to civil life. In my opinion the returned soldier ought to be altogether exempt, and I have a letter here from the Newcastle Branch of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League, putting their views on the pointAt a general meeting of this league the following resolution was carried unanimously, and I was requested to forward same to you with the request that you do your best to assist us in this matter:"" That we, the returned, men of the Newcastle district, emphasize our strong protest against the levy of income tax being directed against returned men; and that we, as a body, consider that we should be exempt from the claims of income tax from any amount realized by personal exertion up to' £250; and that we request that further consideration be given to this matter, the result of such consideration to be immediately forwarded to this district."" Thanking you for your past endeavours to assist us, and trusting you will take this matter up at your earliest convenience. Evidently the members of the League think they ought not to be taxed for the debt incurred during the war, but they are prepared to pay on a basis of a £ 2 5 0 exemption; and I regard that as a fair suggestion. Time is fleeting, and unless the Government take some action these men will have to pay on the present basis next year. There are many people who receive assessment notices for £ 2 or £3, and are unable to find the money without allowing their other bills to go [128] unpaid. That was never intended; it was always thought that the tax would be collected on incomes over a livin g 1 wage; and I mention the matter to enWe see able the Treasurer to give some consideration to it before this session closes. In the Postal Service there are many men who saw service during the war, and I have had complaints' from them to the effect that they are unable to get higher classification. A little time ago the Postmaster-^General (Mr Wise) informed me, in reply to a question, that modified examinations had been arranged for the purpose of allowing these men to improve their positions; but I have a letter from one of them, who points out that he and others find it absolutely impossible to pass this test. .The effects of the war on them are such that they are no longer able to devote themselves to the necessary study, although they can do the practical work with every satisfaction to the authorities. The letter is as follows:-< I desire to draw attention to what I consider to be the very unfair treatment I have received as an employee of the Postal Department. I enlisted in 1915 having then completed about six years of satisfactory service in the Postal Department. I was with the A.I.F. for about four years, and then resumed duty at the Newcastle Post-office, in October, 1919. I am now a married man, and receive an annual salary of £150 and £12 war bonus. It had been (promised that a modified examination to enable soldier employees to enter the Clerical Branch of the Service would be held on our return from the war, but, up to the present, I understand only one has been held, and that one some years ago. I have certainly suffered because of my loyalty to my country. Pour years of service have not improved my chances of promotion. I am receiving considerably less than theliving wage. Had I stayed at home, I would have had many opportunities of securing promotion within and without the Service. I have wondered if you would be good enough to draw attention in the House to these facts. Perhaps you would compare our position, and the treatment we have received, with that of the State school teachers of New South Wales. In the case of - the teachers they have received, and justly so, a rise in classification, which will save them years of study, and, in most cases, give an important rise in salary. In the case, of the Postal employee-eve n when his services, both in the .Postal Department and in the A.I.F. have been satisfactoryhe finds there is no promotion and no prospects. I will be pleased to provide you, either by letter or at a personal interview, with any other details. I do not wish to occupy your time with matters of no importance; but, believing that you are a true friend of "" The Diggers,"" I am appealing to you, .and I am sure that you will do what you can to see that justice is done to those who have loyally served their country. I think that, when one's Postal service has been satisfactory, he should be promoted to the Clerical Division upon his return from the war without further examination, as in the case of the soldier teachers. There is a good deal to be said for these young fellows who enlisted at about nineteen years of age, when, their minds were such that they could sit down and study for the purpose of passing examinations, but who, on their return, after three or four years on the battlefield, subject to all the disabilities of war, find it impossible, generally speaking, to settle down to studies. The result is that they cannot pass their examinations. If they can do .the practical work required of them, we ought to be able to make some provision for them. Otherwise they will be obliged to remain in their present positions without any chance of rising. I do not claim that they should receive preference, and be put over others - who are equally capable, but we should not impose upon them the necessity to pass the examination we would expect them to pass if they had - not gone to the war. We ought to let these returned men know that we are desirous of doing all we can for them. They are beginning to believe that we have forgotten them. But that is a mistaken idea on their part. We have not forgotten them. Their difficulty is that their sufferings do not come prominently before us. I ask Ministers to take their cases into consideration, and endeavour to deal fairly with them. I trust that the Budget will be brought down in reasonable time, and that honourable members will have an opportunity of dealing with the Estimates, so that once more we may be a responsible Parliament, which we have not been for the last five or six years. We have been ""Qverned by Departments and Executive acts. A ret u r n to responsible government can only be brought about by allowing no expenditure before it is approved by the House.",60
329,Mr MARR,RETURNED SOLDIERS AND PROMOTION,"Parkes) ' [10.51 - For some time past I have been, complaining that, in the opinion of the public the nay of men permanently employed m the Defence Department in New South Wales is . not commensurate with the duties performed by them. I was pleased to receive a reply from a Minister to the effect that the scale had been altered as from the 1st May. Whether it will meet with the wishes of the men I cannot say, but cases have come under my notice in which a fair living wage has not been paid. A watchman in charge of ordnance stores worth hundreds of thousands of pounds, a permanent man with seventeen years' service, is paid £ 3 2s. per week, whereas seven or eight men temporarily employed are receiving, the New South Wales standard wage of £ 3 17s. per week. Saddlers employed by the Defence Department are not receiving the wages they ought to be. paid. In fact, instead of being the best paid in Australia, the Commonwealth Service is the worse paid. In New South Wales during the last two years there have been sixty-four resignations per month in the Commonwealth Service, and they are the best men, and not the worse, who are leaving. In Australia we are not paving to wireless telegraphy the attention it should receive. Recently there has been a good deal of talk in the House about the apolicatiom of science to industry; but although no science has advanced more rapidly than, has the development of wireless telegraphy and wireless telephony during the last few years, we in Australia are not making use of it to the extent to which it is employed in other parts of the world. The results achieved during the war in, handling this science and the - advances made were astounding. In Australia we are years behind the times, but we cannot anticipate any progress in this direction until this branch of work is controlled' by a separate Department. I am opposed, generally speaking, to the establishment of new Government Departments; but I make an exception! in regard to wireless telegraphy. It should be the work of a distinct Department. For economy's sake the accountancy work of such a Department might easily be done by the Post and Telegraph Department, the Navy Department, or any other already established branch of the service. At present the Defence Department, the Navy Department, and the Navigation Department deal with wireless telegraphy. The regulations under the Navigation Act, controlling the use of wireless telegraphy on ships, are rotten, and frequently conflict with the provisions of the Wireless Telegraphy Act. - Vessels can go to sea and flout the Department, simply because the regulations do not make .provision for everything that ought to be covered. On some of the biggest liners leaving our ports the aerials spread between the masts and the feeder wires foul the funnel. There is often, a piece of rope to keep them away from the funnel, but in some cases this rope is tied to a lifeboat. If the ship should get into difficulty this rope has to be cut in order to release the lifeboat, immediately causing the feeder wires to get foul of the funnel, and thus straight way the wireless is out of action. However, I shall' deal with this matter when speaking on the Navigation Bill . There is another matter to which' I wish to refer, which I am sure is very dear to the hearts of many members of this House, and that is the building of the Federal Capital. When we come to consider the Estimates for the Department that has control of work at the Federal Capital, it is my intention to move that the vote for that Department be reduced by the sum of £ 1 as a protest against the omission from this Surv^v Bill of a vote sufficient to begin the erection of the necessary buildings to enable the Seat of - Government to be transferred to Canberra. I have noticed that there is a vote set down in connection with the Works and Railways Department for the erection of a. note-printing establishment in Melbourne. I shall oppose in every way that I can the expenditure of any more money upon the erection of Commonwealth buildings in Melbourne. If wo are to house our departmental officers in permanent build-ings, these buildings should be erected at the Federal Capital.",62
330,Mr RYAN,RETURNED SOLDIERS AND PROMOTION,"The honourable member's announcement is tantamount to a vote of . want of confidence in the Government. , Mr MARR - We often hear that the electors are above Parliament. Honourable members admit that at least one day in every three years, but I should like to say that I made definite pledges to my constituents in connection with these 'matters, and I intend to adhere to those pledges. The erection of the Federal Capital is not a matter by which New South Wales is going to benefit. It , is Australia that will benefit by the building of the Capital. The great war through which we have passed was brought about because one nation refused to honor a treaty it had made, and treated it as a scrap of paper. If the Commonwealth Parliament is going to treat the agreement made with the people of Australia, and not merely with the people of New South Wales, to establish the Federal Capital as a scrap of paper, my voice will be raised against it . I do not say that Canberra is the best place for the Federal Capital, but that is a matter that has already been decided by the Australian Parliament.",63
331,Mr BRENNAN,RETURNED SOLDIERS AND PROMOTION,Will the building of the Capital reduce the cost of living ?,63
332,Mr MARR,RETURNED SOLDIERS AND PROMOTION,"It will reduce the cost of government to the people of Australia. We are now paying £80,000 a year in in terest on money that has already been expended at Canberra.",63
333,Mr BRENNAN,RETURNED SOLDIERS AND PROMOTION,How long will it take the Federal Capital to become self-supporting?,63
334,Mr MARR,RETURNED SOLDIERS AND PROMOTION,"It will become self-supporting almost immediately. We are at the present time paying in the shape of rent for buildings in Melbourne to hou=e Commonwealth officials approximately £30,000 a year.",63
335,Mr JOWETT,RETURNED SOLDIERS AND PROMOTION,Does the honourable member imagine that that amount would be saved by transferring the Seat of Government to Canberra 1,63
336,Mr MARR,RETURNED SOLDIERS AND PROMOTION,"No , but that amount would represent interest on a capital expenditure sufficient for the erection of buildings in the Federal Territory where, it should not be forgotten the Commonwealth owns 900 square miles of country. A most important feature of this question is that we can never expect to inculcate an Australian sentiment in the minds of our people unless the Federal Parliament is removed from the influence of the parochialism of any city. I should like honourable members to have been associated for a number of years with the men of the Australian Imperial Force. No matter from what State they came they were always Australians, and not Victorian, New South Welshmen or men of any other State. It was most galling for members of the Australian Imperial Force upon their return from the Avar to find, when they got to Melbourne, that the people of this city, were jealous of Sydney, and to find, when they got to Sydney, that the people of that city were jealous of Melbourne. I do not hold a brief for Sydney any more than for Melbourne, and I should not personally give a vote to transfer the Seat of Government to Sydney. The same influences that are at work in Melbourne today would be at work in Sydney if the Seat of Government were transferred to that city. I repeat that when we come to consider the Estimates of the Department concerned I shall move that they be reduced by £ 1 as a protest against the omission fro m this Supply Bill of a vote sufficient to make a start with the buildings necessary at the Federal Capital. If we are to start building the Federal Capital we must have workmen to carry out the work, and it would never do to send workmen there at the present time and expect them to put up with hovels or to be accommodated in a concentration camp. We should make provision for decently housing the necessary workmen and their families at Canberra. If we gave them an assurance of, say, five years' work I have no doubt that many would be prepared to settle down there comfortably, and land could be leased to them. The capital value of land in the Territory would, as a consequence, go up immediately. Although we have 900 square miles of country in the Federal Territory, the income derived fro m that area at the present time is a very insignificant amount.",63

I have some observations to make, but I do not propose to make them at this moment. I wish to indicate to' the Treasurer that, if it depended upon me, instead of getting Supply for a month he would not get Supply for twenty-four hours. I shall take the opportunity of stating my reasons at a later stage. I think that the manner in which the government of the country is being carried on in the hands.of the present Ministers would entirely justify me in! voting against giving them Supply to the extent of £ 1 . I wish them to know, at once that if it depended on my vote they would not get Is. for Supply. I should like to ascertain from the Treasurer, amongst other things, whether there is in this Bill any authority proposed for the payment of money in connection with the purchase of Nauru Island.",64
338,Sir JOSEPH COOK,RETURNED SOLDIERS AND PROMOTION,No !,64
339,Mr RYAN,RETURNED SOLDIERS AND PROMOTION,"Then , under what authority was the payment mentioned in the press, and referred to in this House, made?",64
340,Sir JOSEPH COOK,RETURNED SOLDIERS AND PROMOTION,Unde r the authority of the Bill .,64
341,Mr RYAN,RETURNED SOLDIERS AND PROMOTION,"There is no authority in the Bill ; there is no appropriation; there is no authority to pay the moneys which have been paid over. I would like to know, further, if there is any authority contained in this Bill for the payment of moneys under a War Precautions regulation gazetted on the 7th July. That regulation gives authority to charge losses made in connection with the requisitioning of ships by the Com-: man-wealth Government to Consolidated Revenue-to moneys appropriated by Parliament. In respec'; to this matter, I desire definite information. It has been stated that during the period in which the ships were held up on account of the dispute with the seamen, the losses occasioned by the holding up of the vessels were: borne by the .taxpayers of Australia, while, at the same time, the shipowners were receiving profits equal, or almost equal, to those which ""they would have received had the ships been running. Is there any foundation for that statement 1",64

RETURNED SAILORS AND SOLDIERS IM rsajAL LEAGUE : CONTROL OF DISTRI BUTION OF SOLDIERS' TWEED. Motion (by Sir JOSEPH COOS) pro- posedTbat the House do now adjourn. - Mr Charlton (Hunter) [10.26] I asked a question on 8th July regarding the position of soldiers who were not members of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League, and who wished to participate in the distribution of ANZAC tweed. I was informed, in effect, that there was no foundation for the allegation that returned men who are nob members of the League are precluded from securing cloth. I have nothing whatever against the League, but merely wish to see even-handed justice meted out to every man, irrespective of whether he is a member of the League or not. If the Government is providing cloth, every man who served abroad should have an equal and perfect right to secure a suitlength if he so desires. Since receiving the official answer to .my question, a returned soldier, who was a lieutenant, and who is not a member of the League, sent me a letter pointing out that what I had suggested was absolutely correct. He saysI saw the party in charge, and I put to him a plain, straightforward questioD, namely, "" Is this cloth issued for the benefit of returned soldiers in general, or is it sent up for the use of those who belong to the Returned Soldiers League only 7"" He replied, "" It was sent up for the League members only,"" and also that the League had placed £1,000 down for the monopoly, and, furthermore, he was acting under instructions from the League, and only members of the League could be first served, at the same time politely intimating that when the League members were served there was nothing left over. Or, in other words, you had to become a member of the League or go without. I have also received word from an exsergeant who made application at the same place, namely, at the Newcastle office of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League, and who received the same answer. I now ask that further inquiries be made in.order to ascertain whether all our returned men are getting a fair deal. I bring the matter forward solely to clear it up, and honourable members will understand' that I bave no feeling in tha position at all. I may say that in my district there is a league of returned men which is not connected with the Returned. Sailors, and Soldiers I m ' [129] perial League, and that it is its members who have complained to me.",64
