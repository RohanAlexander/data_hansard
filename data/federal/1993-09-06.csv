1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. Stephen Martin) took the chair at 3 p.m., and read prayers. NA Budget 1993-94 MI"" DOWNER-I see that the Prime Minister is extending the privilege again to the parliament.",11
2,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for Mayo will ask his question or resume his seat. Get to the question.,11
3,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. Does the Treasurer accept the Prime Minister's claim made on television yesterday that it was the Treasurer, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Finance amongst others who were responsible for the first failed draft of the budget? Or does the Treasurer believe that the Prime Minister, as head of the government, must take a big part of the responsibility for the failed first draft of the budget?",11
4,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is a question that comes from an opposition which is totally bereft of policy, political morality, and fiscal responsibility. This is a party which lectured us for three years about the wickedness of deficits and about the need to bring those deficits down. Now honourable members opposite stand here blatantly, irresponsibly, and dishonestly saying what they would do through their actions is to increase the deficit in each year of the next four years. In every year of the next four years, the opposition would increase the deficit, therefore harming Australia's reputation internationally. Mr Thckey- Mr Speaker, I rise to speak on a point of order. I raise the question understanding order 145 of relevance. The Treasurer was asked quite distinctly as to who gets the blame on these issues, and he came in here with a prepared answer. He has not mentioned his side once; it is just the opposition. I believe that is notÂ· relevant in the circumstances of a very serious question.",11
5,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Treasurer will answer the question in respect of matters under his portfolio.,11
6,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member for O'Connor has about three prepared points of order which he uses in any particular circumstance. It has nothing to do with what is going on. He just approaches the dispatch box in order to interrupt the proceedings in a way which he thinks might be helpful to him. What the Prime Minister was saying yesterday, which should have been clear even to the honourable member for Mayo, was that the central objective of the government's budget strategy is the reduction over four years in the Commonwealth budget deficit. That strategy is the integral part of the budget, and it remains the integral part of the budget. In the end that is the issue which the opposition has to confront. . If honourable members opposite look at what commentators, who have no political axe to grind in this matter, have been saying about the government's budget strategyalmost to a man and a woman-they will see that they are saying our strategy is correct; it is supported by those who make judgments about Australia here and overseas. They need look no fUIther than the observations of Mr Beers from Standard and Poor's about what the government is attempting to do and what the government proposes to do in the context of the reduction in the deficit. He believes that is the appropriate way for us to ,handle the fiscal position in Australia, and he says that that approach is supported by financial markets here and overseas. Those are the same finanCial markets that this country requires in terms Of funding our current account deficit whilst we improve our performance economically and improve our capacity to pay our way. It is only the vandals of the Liberal Party and National Party who stand in the way of the correct economic policy which this country should be pursuing and which ,this government will never give up on. Economy",11
7,Mr ROBERT BROWN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I direct my question to the Prime Minister. In view of what appear to be many misrepresentations at the present time concerning developments in the Australian economy, will he take this opportunity to advise the House about some of the more important current developments in the economy and the implications of those developments for employment growth?",11
8,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I believe there are increasing signs in economic terms that better times are ahead and we have good reasons to be cautiously optimistic. There are important factors which put a brake on that confidence, and one is the world economy, which is still weak, with growth this year forecast to be only just over one per cent. We have seen the result of this in our commodity prices, which have fallen again over the past 12 months and which are now almost 30 per cent below their peak of June 1989. A 30 per cent shift in commodity prices from June 1989 is a very large drop. In fact, commodity prices are lower than they were on average when they collapsed in 1986-87. From memory, they were last that low in the Depression. So commodity prices are at very low levels, coming off low levels of world international activity. But balanced against that are positive forces which are also dominating or starting to reap their reward in terms of confidence in the business climate of Australia. These are, amongst others, inflation last year at one per cent, with core inflation likely to remain low at between two and three per cent this year, notwithstanding the direct effects of our lower dollar; that it is 20 years since interest rates were last this low; our international competitiveness has improved by 20 per cent over the past three years, which is continuing to help our exporters expand; and profits have risen by 12 per cent over the last year. So profits are up 12 per cent, international competitiveness has improved by 20 per cent, interest rates are at 20 year lows and inflation is at the lowest any of us in this parliament have ever lived with, that is, around two to three per cent. Th.ese are all reasons for some confidence and they are certainly having confidence effects in the business community. Today, the ANZ Bank released its job vacancy series, which shows that job as are providing further encouragement, with job as up 1.2 per cent for August following rises of 3.9 per cent for July and 4.9 per cent to June. The ANZ job vacancy series is now 19.1 per cent above its level of a year ago. The series is up nearly 20 per cent, which I think means there is some prospect for acceleration in job growth for the rest of the year. What we need most is improvement in employment and lower levels of unemployment. We should not put all this at risk-and that is what the opposition has been trying to do in the last few weeks. We have a budget strategy which is right for the economy-all the conditions are coming together; that is, low inflation, low interest rates, a 20 per cent lift in competitiveness, profits up 12 per cent over the last year and the job index series up nearly 20 per cent-to kick the economy along. It was observed on the AM program this morning: Everyone else, apart from the opposition-that is the Democrats, Standard and Poor's, the Reserve Bank and even the markets-think the budget strategy is al\ right. Following the budget the stock market has risen by four per cent and lO-year bonds have continued to rally and are now at 6.6 per cent-down from 6.8 per cent at budget time and from nine per cent at the start of the year. So, if we want any guide to confidencewhere the Reserve Bank's daily market arrangements are not having any influence on the rates-long term bond rates are down from nine per cent yield at the start of the year; at the beginning of the budget they were 6.8 per cent and are now at 6.6 per cent. The strategy is right and the markets have been saying it is right. In recent days we have seen the impact on the currency of the Leader of the Opposition's high jinks. As the Governor of the Reserve Bank said today: The budget was accepted by the markets. The exchange rate was not affected by the budget at al\. It was only when people started to talk about not passing the budget that the market started to get worried about it. The market agrees and a representative of Standard and Poor's on the radio this morning said exactly the same thing. Yet the Leader of the Opposition persists with this strategy. He talked about what he called the amazing growth forecast in the budget. Is 2.7 per cent amazing, when we have had 3.1 per cent already for the past year? He thinks that 2.7 per cent for the coming year is amazing, or 33/4 per cent for next year or four per cent for the year thereafter. Supposedly that is amazing. This comes from the Leader of the Opposition, who is doing his best to upset the confidence levels which are growing in the economy. He says that he will not agree to the passage of budget legislation, which the markets, the central bank, the Democrats and most commentators say in economic terms is right for the economy. I will quote from the Leader of the Opposition's remarks about what he thought would be his own legislation. Last year he said: My own view is that we will put all our policies into parliament as a package-industrial relations legislation, the tax bills, the new Reserve Bank and other changes to other pieces of legislation. They will have to knock out the benefits to get at what they see as the advantages. A couple of truths were to be found in today's newspapers. In the Australian, under the heading 'The ghost of Fightback spooks the dollar', Mr Garran says: The Government is having a great deal of trouble controlling the Senate. . But what has been forgotten in all the blarney over the Budget is Labor has not had control of the Senate for any of its 10 years in office. That is dead true. He continued: What has changed this time around is not the advent of a new Democrat Leader, Senator Kernot, or even of two new Green senators, but the decision of the Opposition in the Senate to oppose key Budget tax increases. He went on to say: But the Democrats and Greens can only exercise their ""balance of power"" because of the Opposition's decision on the Budget's tax rises. That is absolutely dead right. The Governor of the Reserve BankMr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Question time has now been proceeding for 15 minutes. In that time we have had just two questions and one and a half answers. Sir, on previous occasions in exercising your role as custodian of the rights and privileges of all members in this House, you have asked ministers to wind up their answers. I realise the difficulty with standing orders, but I urge that you exercise that role on this occasion.",12
9,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the National Party has rightly pointed to the difficulties that all Speakers have in respect of the standing orders. The Prime Minister is talking on subjects which I think are near and dear to the hearts of all members in this placeemployment, unemployment and economic strategy.",13
10,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This budget deficit for this year does kick the economy along with a stimulus which it continues to need, and it takes the budget deficit down to one per cent, or thereabouts, of GDP by 1996-97, fulfilling the requirements of economic policy in the short and medium term, meeting the budget's Act election commitment to come to one per cent of GDP or thereabouts by 1996-97, meeting its commitment on tax cuts and meeting its commitment for revenue not to be above the average of the last couple of years, which is somewhere around, from memory, 23.6 to 24.2 per cent of GDP. Mr Costello interjecting",13
11,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the honourable member for Higgins.,13
12,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is no basis whatsoever for the opposition vandalism in the Senate on this issue-none whatsoever. At a time when interest rates are down, when bond yields are down, when the markets are telling us that the exchange rate and the government's policy and budgetary directions are right, when Standard and Poor's is saying that the budget is right for the economy and that it has changed its rating as a result of the budget, what we are seeing in the Senate now is spite and wilful vandalism on the part of the Leader of the Opposition-because he lost the election-who says, 'r have lost it so I wi\l gum up the works by holding up the government's legitimate legislation' - the legitimate budget-'the government which beat me fair and square by a country mile in the election, the government which won fair and square and beat me. I wi1\ hold up its legislation in the Senate. I will hold the country's economic fortunes to the kind of instability which comes from the behaviour which I will now undertake'. It is this behaviour by the Leader of the Opposition, his deputy in the Senate, Senator Hill, and opposition senators-including members of the National Party-which now means that the instability in the exchange markets, which is coming in part from the budget, is coming as a consequence of the needless policy response of the Leader of the Opposition to the government's budget legislation. I repeat the point: Standard and Poor's, Reserve Bank, the markets, the bond yields, the interest rates generally, and all of those issues mean that the budget is right for Australia and is right for the economy. It is nothing but wrecking vandalism on the part of the Leader of the Opposition to try to stall it in the Senate. Budget 1993-94",13
13,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Might I suggest that the Prime Minister go and talk to the people of Australia. They do not like his tax increases.,14
14,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the Opposition will ask his question.,14
15,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I direct my question to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to his boasts about the credibility of his deficit reduction strategy. In the One Nation statement he pledged that the budget would be in surplus by 1995-96. Prior to the election campaign he revised that; he pledged that there would be a budget deficit of between one half and one per cent of GDP by 1995-96. Then, during the election campaign, he again extended the deficit reduction target to one per cent of GDP by 1996-97. Three weeks ago in the budget he extended it again to 1.1 per cent of GDP by 1996-97. Then, last Monday night, when he was comprehensively rolled by the caucus, he extended it again to 1.2 per cent of GDP by 1996-97. Given that these deficit targets have now blown out four times in the last 18 months, what evidence is there that he can meet any of these targets in the next four years? Opposition members-None!",14
16,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That could have been my answer. I have been making precisely those points, but I have been making an additional one as well. This economic iconoclast and his shadow Treasurer now say that it does not matter if we add another $3 billion to the deficit in 1996-97, and it does not matter if we add another $1'12 billion to the deficit this year. These are the people who are the authors of a proposal which would expand the deficit this year by $1'12 billion and expand the deficit four years from now by over $3 billion. What a cheek they have to come in the here and question a strategy which has more integrity than any proposal by any Western government in terms of a deficit reduction strategy",14
17,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,14
18,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The House will come to order.,14
19,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"a strategy which has been applauded by a variety of people within the financial markets. For instance, given our German theme for the day, a Mr Heinz Fesser from the Deutsche Bank said: The economic fundamentals are better in Australia than in the US. That is largely because we have a superior approach to fiscal policy than they do in the United States. For once in their lives, members of the opposition ought to be putting the nation before themselves, applauding this policy and getting on with supporting it, rather than trying to drag the country down. Industrial Relations",14
20,Mr BEVIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Could the minister inform the House of the progress of the government's package of industrial relations reforms, particularly its desire to spread enterprise agreements into the currently nonun ionised sector?",14
21,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Brisbane for this question. I had hoped to get a question from [1: honourable 0 member for Bennelong, because I have waited for six months for a question from him. We have heard him on Mabo; we have heard him on the monarchy; we have heard him on the republic; we have heard him on everything except industrial relations. I welcome this opportunity to reaffirm the government's commitment to spreading enterprise agreements throughout the 70 per cent of the private sector work force that is not currently unionised. I welcome the opportunity to reaffirm the government's view that enterprise flexibility is absolutely vitally important if we are to enhance Australia's productivity and to guarantee our international competitiveness. It represents the best chance for Australian workers to obtain benefits by way of a share of enhanced profitability. At last week's ACTU congress I made the point pretty clearly when I said: Our only concern is the objective of spreading enterprise agreements, we remain open to discussion on how best to do that. It is the objective the means for achieving which remains our principal concern. .",14
22,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,15
23,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Those on my left will come to order.,15
24,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Twelve days ago I proposed the establishment of a joint government-ACTU working party to examine the proposals of the ACTU. When I did so, I made it absolutely and abundantly clear that the proposition has some mlirit provided it does not in a practical sense constitute an impediment to the spread of enterprise bargaining in the non-union sector. As the Prime Minister said only yesterday, the real question on enterprise unions is the threshold, that is: ... the threshold for the membership has to be quite low because you're talking about often small firms and the processes of their development has to be such that they can actually be quickly put together to do a task and that is negotiate an enterprise agreement. Mr Sharp-What does that mean?",15
25,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member will see what it means. It now falls to the working party to develop the ACTU alternative to ensure that it meets the government's policy objective-a policy objective speJt out by the Prime Minister on 21 April this year. n is worth reminding the House that we are not the only ones talking about enterprise unions; some of Australia's largest employers groups have been talking about them as well. In their August 1993 submission to the government the Business Council of Australia said that 'the registration of new enterprise unions should be permitted under the act, regardless of size'. In its submission of May this year the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said that the act should recognise enterprise branches of unions. Bill Kelty is now advocating enterprise unions. Even the opposition welcomes them. This morning I listened to AM and I heard the honourable member for Bennelong saying that the Kelty proposition could hardly be regarded as a step in the right direction, as it would actually increase the levels of union influence. He said that only this morning. I know the honourable member has been on the western not front, and we applaud the job that he did representing the opposition there. But, lest we forget what the opposition was saying only last year, I refer honourable members to Jobsback!, the opposition's own election manifesto. What did the honourable member for Bennelong say? On page 18 he solemnly pronounced: Accordingly, the Coalition for the first time will allow the formation of enterprise unions. The Coalition will encourage the emergence of enterprise unions where that is the desire of the majority of employees in individual workplaces. Any similarity between the opposition's approach and ours finishes right about there, because, whilst the opposition would emasculate the award system, we will re-enforce it. Whilst the opposition would return it to a master and servant relationship, we will preserve the award system intact; indeed, we will enforce it as a safety net. Under no circumstances wiIJ we allow the sort of situation inherent in the - pposition's approach, which was 'take the contract or take the sack'. I know that there are some in the trade union movement who oppose Mr Kelty's option, but I am confident that both he and his fellow officers of the ACTU will continue to work with us to ensure that the government's stated objective is achieved. Enterprise Bargaining",15
26,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. I preface my question by saying: Laurie, 1I have not asked you any questions because up to now you have not been taking any of the decisions.",16
27,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,16
28,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Bennelong might now get to his question.,16
29,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is as follows: can the minister explain to the House how the proposal now before the government to make union membership a precondition of extended access to enterprise bargaining does not discriminate against those workers who exercise the fundamental right not to join a trade union?,16
30,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I did not have long to wait once 1 had made the point, did I? 1 welcome the question. 1 thought the honourable member for Bennelong was on strike. That is what I thought was the case.",16
31,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is right, waiting to strike him.",16
32,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As the Prime Minister has said, we know who he is really trying to strike. We know what he has been about.",16
33,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,16
34,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,16
35,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Will you all calm down for a second. The question the honourable member has asked relates to the spread of enterprise bargains. The question is: who do you agree with? Do you agree with an individual or do you agree with the majority of employees in a workplace? 1I have said right from the start that we reject, and we reject absolutely, the opposition's approach of individual contracts which are a case of taking the contract or taking the sack. The point has been made, and made properly, that in the absence of an entity to represent workers there is a bit of problem in getting a collective bargain. It is one of the big weaknesses. Quite frankly, it is one of the weaknesses that the establishment of an enterprise union will actually allow us to overcome because, in simple essence, it means there will be someone to agree with, rather than individual contracts. My view is, and 1 state it clearly, that if the threshold is low enough",16
36,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker, understanding order 145. The question specifically related to the issue of union membership being a precondition of access to enterprise bargaining. The question was not about the threshold of enterprise unions; it was specifically about making it a precondition of union membership. Thus far the minister has simply not addressed the question, so 1 invite you, understanding order 145, to require the minister to become relevant to the question.",16
37,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Oh, sit down. Sit down.",16
38,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You keep quiet.,16
39,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister is addressing the issue of industrial relations. He will come to the question.,16
40,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have made it clear that we will not have a bar of individual contracts as a basis for enterprise agreements. Enterprise agreements will be pursued through the union sector where a union exists under section 134 of the existing act. In the non-union sector they are being pursued in the development of this proposal by way of enterprise unions and, if those enterprise unions provide a ready means of spreading enterprise agreements to the 70 per cent of people who are not covered by unions at the moment, I say that is the way to go, provided the threshold is low enough and provided it gives an effective means of spreading enterprise agreements. It is not, after all, anything other than the ends we are seeking; and the ends are a more flexible, productive Australian workplace where employers and employees work together to achieve flexibility and to vary the a conditions in the workplace as IS required in agreement, but at the same time to make sure that the award system remains intact as an effective means of guaranteeing essential safeguards. Electricity Supply Industry",16
41,Mr HARRY WOODS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Can the Minister for Resources inform the House of progress in the reform of Australia's electricity supply industry? Could he also tell us of any stumbling blocks that may lay in the way of that progress?,17
42,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government's objective in seeking to reform the electricity supply industry is to seek to gain benefits for consumers, and also for industry, through lower and more competitive electricity prices. The way we will do this is to seek to encourage more competition and institutional reform in this industry. The reform of this industry has been estimated to expand national 'output by more than $2 billion annually, so it has great prospects for generating more investment and more jobs and for lifting Australia's export performance by reducing costs. In the same way that it was \eft to this Labor government to introduce reform in telecommunications, in aviation and on the waterfront, it has been left to this Labor government to ensure that we will reform the electricity supply industry. We believe that Australian manufacturers should get the benefits, the competitive edge, of our cheap natural energy resources and the way we will do that is to encourage a competitive electricity supply industry. Unlike aviation and telecommunications, it is actually the state governments that own the utilities and it is the state governments that will make the key decisions that will determine the framework in which electricity reform will take place. It will 'be the state governments which will determine how quickly reform will take place in electricity. But, just as in aviation and in telecommunications, the existing monopolies will do all they can to protect their vested interests by arguing that the introduction of competition will in some way reduce R&D or restrict the ability of the utilities to market themselves overseas. These are the very same arguments that we got when we sought to introduce competition in telecommunications. It is the federal government's view that, by introducing competition in electricity supply, we can ensure that the advantages which telephone customers and aviation users are recelvmg today will also flow to electricity consumers through cheaper electricity. Mr Beale-Start with the Snowy.",17
43,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We will be looking at the Snowy. I can tell the honourable member that we could do with a bit of help from the New South Wales and Victorian Liberal ministers .on reforming the Snowy. While improvements in efficiency have already led to some reduction in electricity prices, my view is that it is state treasuries which have captured a significant proportion of the past savings in reform of this industry. But it is important we acknowledge that at the June heads of government meeting in Melbourne there was increased pressure on the states to ensure that these benefits begin to flow to the industrial and domestic consumers. The effect of the reforms agreed to at COAG is to give consumers greater choice. For the first time, customers and distributors will be able to deal directly with generators, which is an important part of introducing competition in this industry. Heads of government 'agreed to the introduction of a fully competitive market by 1 July 19,95. A major test of the states' commitment to reform will be the way they conduct paper trials which are due to commence on 1 November this year. But of immediate concern to me are three issues which have the potential to delay the COAG reform program. First, while Victoria has recently announced that it intends to restructure the SECV into three separate business units, I understand that, currently, Victoria is planning to prevent Victorian customers from dealing directly with generators in other states. Second, I have argued very strongly to the New South Wales Minister for Minerals and Energy that Pacific Power's plans to have a single, portfolio manager for all New South Wales electricity will eliminate intrastate competition. Third, for the benefit of my friend from Victoria, there is a need to obtain, the agreement of New South Wales and Victoria in progressing the reforin,'of the Snowy scheme so that it can be an independent, competitive generator in the new markets. I hope to be working closely with my colleagues from New South Wales and Victoria-perhaps the Leader of the National Party, who is trying to interject, can ring and encourage them to help-because it is with their support that we will be able to ensure that we can have the successful introduction of the trials in November by overcoming these three hurdles. I have written to my state colleagues to try to ensure that we can meet at an early opportunity to try to progress these reforms. The opposition loves lecturing this government about the need for micro-economic reform. Here is one issue where reform in electricity can let us make clear whether the Liberals' actions can match their rhetoric on micro-economic reform, because people on this side of the House have a right to ask what the opposition's view is on the reform of the electricity supply industry. The shadow minister, the honourable member for Gippsland, had the perfect opportunity to tell us what the opposition's view was when he gave a speech recently at a conference organised by the Electricity Supply Association of Australia. But the speech was a classic bob each way approach. We had the honourable member for Gippsland telling us that we have to have cautious policy reform in this essential area of micro-economic reform. Listen to what he said: . . . the electricity supply sector still faces the prospect of further restructuring. this is the honourable member for Gippslandit is vital the nation proceeds carefully in this process. Mr Thckey-What is wrong with that?",17
44,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member for O'Connor interjects, 'What is wrong with that?'. We did not hear the honourable member for Hume telling us when we were looking at reforming the waterfront that it was vital for the nation to proceed carefully; we did not have the former member for Bass, Warwick Smith,telling us that we had to proceed carefully in telecommunications reform; yet here we have the honourable member for Gippsland paying lip-service to the need for faster reform and virtually giving us an apologia for the electricity utilities. This is going to be an acid test of how the Liberals can carry out micro-economic reform. I am ready to sit down with the state Liberal ministers for energy and try to progress this reform as soon as possible because it is worth $2 billion a year to Australia's manufacturing industries and it is worth a lot of investment and jobs. Industrial Relations",18
45,Mr CHARLES,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations, just so he does not feel too lonely. Does the minister support the Prime Minister's statement that Labor's election win is an opportunity for the trade union movement to organically extend the tentacles of trade unionism and, if so, what is the minister's understanding of the words 'organically extend the tentacles of trade unionism'?",18
46,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would think that it is an opportunity for the trade union movement to reinvent itself and to obtain a whole fresh relevance for the future. Clearly, that relevance should be a role in enterprise bargaining, and that is what I have been encouraging them to do. I have been encouraging them to look to the future, to move away from the free fall of union membership, which is now down to 29 per cent of the private sector, and to take a leading role in spreading enterprise Needless to sayagreements. Those unions who have embraced the role of leadership in enterprise bargaining have done a marvellous job. Already, 1,100 agreements have been brought into being and, I must say, the overwhelming majority of them have come about as a result of initiatives taken, not by the employers, but by the trade union movement. I want the rest of the trade union movement-those who are not embracing it at the moment-to develop a similar enthusiasm for enterprise bargaining. Very importantly, I want enterprise bargaining t- be spread throughout the present non-un ionised sector so that everyone in Australia will get out of bed in the morning and say, 'How can I make my workplace more productive? How can I make my business that much better? How can I share in that productivity?'. Quite frankly, where enterprise bargains are appropriate and where a majority of the workers are in favour of them, they are a very clever way of developing the opportunity for the movement to reinvent itself. . Unemployment",18
47,Mr LES SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Can the Prime Minister infoon the House whether the government intends to continue to place the highest priority on solving the problem of long-teon unemployment?,19
48,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, let me answer that question in the affionative. As know, apart from some of the programs which I will come to in a minute, growth above all else is the primary generator of employment. That is why it is important that the economy maintains its momentum towards growth and is not stalled in any way by changes in sentiment brought about by whatever reas@ns, including the shenanigans of our friends opposite. Unemployment continues to be a grave problem in Australia and throughout the OECD. Indeed, in many OECD countries the problem is worsening dramatically. Unemployment in France is now at 11.6 per cent, up from 10.6 per cent a year ago. Unemployment in Italy is 10.8 per cent, up from 10.2 per cent a year ago. Sweden has 9.6 per cent unemployment, up from 5.3 per cent a year ago. The United Kingdom is at 10.4 per cent unemployment, up from 9.8 per cent a year ago. Canada has 11.6 per cent unemployment, the same as a year ago. Indeed, the OECD is forecasting that unemployment throughout Europe could rise to 12 per cent next year. The most worrying element of that, of course, is the long-teon unemployed. Mr Evans-Tell us about Asia.",19
49,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Cowan.,19
50,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There are 370,000 Australians who have been unemployed for one or more years, and 180,000 have been unemployed for more than two years. Long-teon ,unemployment is our greatest contemporary social problem; it is the problem of the era. The government recognised this when it embraced a strategy for growth in One Nation and Investing in the Nation, and dramatically expand.ed our labour market programs so that since the beginning of last year funding for labour market programs has more than doubled. With this year's budget it has increased by a further $1.3 billion. A total of 644,000 people will benefit from a labour market program in 1993-94; 154,000 of these places are in the jobstart program which gives wage subsidies of up to $230 per week for private sector employers. The effectiveness of these programs has increased. Eighty per cent of the long-teon unemployed who get a full-time job we have participated in a labour market program. So there is no doubt that the labour market programs are having their impact on the capacity of the long-teon unemployed to find themselves employment in the labour market and to keep it. A great deal has been done. No country, I venture to say, has done more. That said, in announcing the employment opportunities committee, Australians have to ask themselves, as I said at the time, whether they are really committed to full-time employment. If we are committed, we shall not shy away from measures to achieve it. That is why I met last week with the Minister for Employment, Education and Training and asked him for a progress report on the government's programs and also an insight into what is occurring within the task force. I will be attending a meeting of the coIJ1mittee on employment opportunities-the task force:.. - and asking for a report on progress and measures so far proposed. I will also be talking to the regional development task force which l.am told is having a successful round of discussions. That task force is headed by Mr Kelty. I will also be talking with the caucus committee on employment, which has received about 100 submissions on ways to addreSs the problem. It will be meeting during September with. major associations such as ACOSS and the ACTU. The government will see in which ways novel things can be done in the labour market by the adoption of measureS recommended by its task force. As we are seeing a world problem emerging, with unemployment nearing 12 per cent in Europe, we need to see whether we can do new and innovative things in Australia-as we have done so often in social policy-with regard to employment and unemployment. Of course, that will mean, particularly, that the growth in the economy continues and that we can take the benefit of the change in sentiment which is occurring in business, in the investment community and in markets to see that the growth forecasts we have this year are met and we go on to see the economy accelerate with growth next year, so that the primary generation of employment growth will pick up. Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs",19
51,Mr SLIPPER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, it is indeed nice to be able. to ask a question, even if it a question of you. I draw your attention to my excellent adjournment speech on Thursday which was, in effect, mostly a series of quotes from the findings of a senior Northern Territory judge, Mr Justice Angel, concerning the activities and infamous conduct of one Phillip Toyne. I also draw your attention to the comments made by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs in the adjournment debate when he claimed that I had made what he considered to be 'a very serious and, indeed, vicious attack on Phillip Toyne, who is currently employed by the government'. As the criticisms of Mr Toyne in my speech were in fact mainly quotes",20
52,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. This is scarcely a question. The honourable member is canvassing the issues of a debate he obviously had here on the adjournment the other day and providing a great deal of information while he is doing it.",20
53,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"As honourable members are aware, only as sufficient information as is necessary to provide an insight into the question can be provided as preamble and I ask the honourable member for Fisher to get to the question.",20
54,Mr SLIPPER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I thank you, Mr Speaker, and agree totally with your ruling. As the criticisms of Mr Toyne in my speech were in fact mainly quotes from the decision of Mr Justice Angel, the minister's remarks in seeking to attack me reflect seriously on the learned judge and, as such, are highly disorderly. As standing order 75",20
55,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,And your question?,20
56,Mr SLIPPER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"My question is: As standing order 75 includes among its provisions that no member may use offensive words against any member of the judiciary, will you ask the minister to withdraw his disorderly remarks which reflected seriously on Mr Justice Angel?",20
57,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"With reference to the question directed to me, I will look into it and get back to the honourable member shortly. Seating in the Chamber for Senators and Visitors",20
58,Mr SINCLAIR,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I have a question for you, is Mr Speaker, that is in relation to a perfectly plain matter. You may have noticed in the other place that a row of seats has been placed at the back for members of this place to sit. I put it to you that there are occasions when distinguished visitors come into this parliament and it might well be appropriate that a similar facility be introduced into this chamber. Would you look into it and consider whether or not, for senators and others whom you might wish to sit on the floor, we might introduce a similar facility, either behind this side of the House or somewhere adjacent in the chamber.",20
59,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Yes, I will look into the issue and again report back. NA",20
60,Mr CLEARY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS," Mr Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation.",20
61,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?,20
62,Mr CLEARY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Yes, I do.",20
63,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Please proceed.,20
64,Mr CLEARY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"During Question Time last Thursday, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) made a number of assertions concerning me which are totally untrue. The Prime Minister said: He made a fink of himself by opposing themthat is, the true believersin the last election and the by-election before The Prime Minister went on to say: There are remedies. He can always apply to come back, but it is a big question whether we would ever have him. Firstly, I wish to make it clear that, contrary to the Prime Minister's implication, I have never been a member of the Labor Party and therefore, by definition, I could not apply to come back. Secondly, the Prime Minister's accusation that I am a fink needs to be corrected. To describe me as a fink as in a contemptible or undesirable person is a matter of opinion to which the Prime Minister is entitled. To describe me as a fink as in a strike-breaker or blackleg is an assertion of fact which is totalIy unfounded. I wish to go on record that, as a teacher unionist, I never once blacklegged on my comrades.",20

Debate (on motion by Mr Howard) adnot journed. ' NA Suspension of Standing and Sessional Orders",21
66,Mr BEAZLEY,URGENT LEGISLATION,"by leave-I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the House making one declaration of urgency and moving one motion for the allotment of time in respect of the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993, the Customs Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993 and the Excise Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993. It becomes necessary for the government to move this motion in this place at this time as a direct response to the difficulties that this House in now experiencing with the Senate across the board, but quite specifically because of the notified intention by at least opposition members in the Senate to vote against these measures. In those circumstances, it is desirable that these measures should be before the Senate as quickly as possible. They cannot get before PAPERS the Senate as quickly as possible llotil, of course, they are out of this place. This parmotion provides the opportunity for legislation to exit this place by the end of the day and then go to the Senate for deliberation at least by tomorrow so that it can have a preliminary look over the legislation before the couple of weeks break for the various that this chamber will be utilised for and Trainingin that period. That we are obliged to do this at all is directly as a result of the unprecedented-it unprecedented since 1975-threat by the to oppose a major proportion of the budget. By doing so, it creates in our constitution and constitutional arrangements a whole new world of difficulty for any papers: government of the day, from whatever side Act-Nationthe government is drawn. Mr Tim Fischer-You sought to do it 151 times.",21
67,Mr BEAZLEY,URGENT LEGISLATION,"I intend to deal with that point very' quickly. The honourable member an answer on that so that he understands the full extent of his vandalism. I do expect the realisation of that to come naturally to him. For the 10 years we have been in office we have not had a Senate majority. That has meant that from time to time bits and pieces of the budget have been picked over. There is no question about that. We have complained about that when it has occurred. We complained when we were attempting to sell the Pipeline Authority, which was a major component of savings measures in the budget, that we were being prevented from doing so by the opposition at the time. The impact of that did not go to the heart of the budget; it went to the issues to one side. The changes to the budget were made or announced the other day by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins). The intentions of this government can be regarded as being part of that same process. At the end of the day we are frequently obliged to make some small adjustments around the edges of a budget. Those adjustments were made having taking account of the views put forward in consultation with colleagues. Again, those adjustments, on the initiative sometimes of the Senate and from sections of the party room, have been made over the past 10 years. Any government which does not enjoy a majority in the Senate will not find itself in any different position. What is different here is that a very central proportion of the revenue raising of the budget is under attack. That is a difference. Mr Tim Fischer-Less than 1.5 per cent.",21
68,Mr BEAZLEY,URGENT LEGISLATION,"No, three per cent in a full year, which I will later refer to. It substantial proportion which materially affects the flexibility of the government and the public regard of the budget to the point where it creates difficulties such as we are now experiencing on the money markets. There is a clear-cut difference between the situation this government confronts in 1993 and that which the government confronted in 1975, the last occasion on which such a large-scale measure was undertaken. In that instance it was different in that was a rejection of supply which, to this point, we understand is not among the propositions being put forward by the opposition. Whilst it is not of that magnitude, it is nevertheless greater than that which has been experienced before. We have already seen a very substantial impact through the responses of the money markets and elsewhere to the notion that the budget, favourably received by them, is perhaps being interfered with in an unacceptable way. The difference between now and that which existed in 1975, or for that matter in 1981-82, is that we now have a floating dollar and a substantially deregulated financial sector. If that is placed under threat, that is a very substantial problem for the conduct of decent government in this country. The argument is made that the government, when it was in opposition, did the same sort of thing in the previous era. In the 1981 budget put forward by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) it was suggested that we would make what he saw as unacceptable changes to the wholesale ,sales tax. What was proposed then was an increase in all rates of 2112 per cent, the correction of some anomalies and inconsistencies-they were the euphemisms-and a broadening of the wholesale sales tax base to impose tax on certain goods previously exempt. All three measures added up to 1.4 per cent of the total 1981-82 revenue, 0.3 per cent of the total revenue in the particular measure that was considered. The first and second of those measures passed the Senate. The third did not. The third was budgeted to raise $132 million or 0.3 per cent of total revenue in 1981-82. That is what the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), among others, describes as exactly is a the same as effectively ripping three per cent-lO times as much-out of this budget. That removal of $132 million is basically the equivalent of the sorts of minor adjustments from time to time that we have been making over the years under pressure from the Senate-sometimes from the opposition and sometimes from minor parties-since we have been in office. What we have never imposed when we were in the position to do so, and what we it specifically eschewed during the last election campaign, was the notion that we would rip the heart out of a budget-ever! in handling legislation that we did not like and that we fundamentally opposed during the election campaign with regard to some $3 112 million. It is an act of absolute irresponsibility by the opposition that it has put the budget under this level of threat. It is an act of extraordithat nary stupidity by a party that considers itself potentially a governing party of this nation. There must be a view or aspiration that, at some point in time, the opposition will secure power after one of these elections. No opposition loses every single election. To elevate Senate-where the likelihood of the government of the day ever having a majority is negligible-to that level of significance by virtue of the opposition's own actions is an act of the most crass stupidity. This ploy by the opposition will never be forgotten by us, in the same way as we did not forget the 1975 episode. One of the reasons why we never attempted to use a position in the Senate to refuse supply or to make major shifts in the budget and one of the reasons why the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) made the statements that he did during the last election-not all the reasons why, but one of them-was that we have said since 1975 that we would not use the hurt and pain of those circumstances to make government in this country impossible. But this party on the other side, which has absolutely no reason to complain in any way about how it has been treated historically by our recognition of the conventions of this country, has decided to take temporary advantage to attempt to wreck a budget. This party has so little regard for what it has done that today the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), having boasted during his reply to the budget speech that he would rip the heart out of the budget-that was the only original part of the speech-had the hide to ask the Treasurer what he intended to do about the deficit, saying how terrible it was. What that reflects is the Leader of the Opposition's comprehension that somewhere down the line he has been doing something severely wrong that has been having an impact on the money markets and the business community-somehow he had to shift the argument to some notion that the government, which does not have a majority in the Senate, has put up a proposition to deal with precisely the problems he was talking about and is having that proposition rejected by the Leader of the Opposition's party. The fact he was prepared to do that shows the hide of the man and the brazenness reflected in that original decision. So the opposition has decided to set a precedent of the utmost seriousness-and one we will not forget. There may come a time the when we on this side of the HouseÂ· are in opposition. In the last couple of weeks, those opposite have set the standards for the conduct of the Senate forever. They have done it without thought or consideration-maybe in the pain of having lost a fair and democratic election they have been led to these actions. But the fact is that they have set a precedent of the utmost danger to decent, stabl- government in this country. The one thing that we have had over the Americans in this regard is that the government of the day has been able to get its budget through without extraordinary pickings over by the legislature. This means that at least we can use budgetary measures to maintain stability in our currency and the possibility of decent growth rates in the community. It is that which those opposite w.ish to j e t t is o n In a country such as the United States it does not matter. For a long time it has been able to operate on the basis that, even though things are changing, it still happens to be the case that the world does owe it a living. The United States would argue, of course, that the world does not owe it a living, but it can effectively operate as though it does; it is that powerful in the international economy. Compared with the Americans, who sail through the international economy like a battleship under way, we are a cork, given our size, that pops around on whatever wave and in whatever direction the tide is going. We cannot help that. It is the position we are in, being an economy the size of about one-half of one of the major American states. So we cannot afford that. We require stability in our institu'tions. We require common sense by all those-on both sides of the chamber-who would be a government of this nation. We require that common sense as a people. As far as that is concerned, those opposite have breached those conventions upon which the stability of this nation relies. Whenever they get the opportunity, they do it. At the end of the day, the Liberal Party will always find an opportunity to walk back from the fact that it likes to sell itself as the party which supports constitutional principle; it will always, at the end of the day, find a set of excuses that will enable it to vandalise the constitution. If we go back through the history of this country, the people who have been the vandalisers of the constitution have not been those on this side of the House, who from time to time get UP' and criticise aspects of the constitution-who criticise the fact that the Senate is regarded as a states house; who criticise the fact that there are unequal electorprocess. al boundaries; and who suggest that the constitution allows too much power to the Governor General. We on this side of the House constantly have made arguments from time to time along those lines, and we are always accused by those opposite of wishing to vandalise the constitution. But when we get into office we operate' all the time with constitutional propriety. But give the Liberal Party one shotbecause at the end of the day it always believes it has the right to rule-and, by virtue of spleen or opportunism or whatever, it will vandalise that principle. It vandalised it in 1975, as from time to time the opposition spokesman who will speak after me, the honourable member for Bennelong has acknowledged. He said that one of the major problems of the Fraser government was that it had its legitimacy destroyed by the acts of 1975. It is a point he has made publicly; I am just quoting him. He may not agree that it should have been, but that, nevertheless, was his point of analysis. This vandalism is not to the same marked degree as that which existed in 1975. I do agree that rejection of supply is ,an order more serious than rejection of revenue measures in the budget, but not much more serious, becaus- the rejection of those revenue measures gets at the very heart of the government's capacity to ensure the sort of economic stability that allows growth and employment to take place. We expect better of those opposite. We do not expect all that much from the minor parties; they never expect to form a government. They, at the end of the day, will snipe around the edges as they see fit. Those opposite have provided themselves as cannon fodder for the minor parties, so at the same time as they set precedents which will never be forgotten in this place they also render themselves cannon fodder for the minor parties in whatever particular direction the minor parties wish to take them on these issues. That in itself is an act of extraordinary silliness and one for which those opposite ought to have had a bit of serious pause for thought before they decided to engage in that As time goes by, the opposition will rue the day it took the course of action that it has chosen to take over the last two or three weeks. The opposition is adrift on principle; it is adrift in leadership as it confronts the horrors that it experiences having lost the last election. I watched the performance of the Leader of the Opposition during the last Liberal Party Federal Council. He, we know on this side of the House, is well to the left socially of the bulk of his party and has at least a somewhat modern attitude to the constitutional alTangements which ought to exist in this state, and some degree of sympathy for the proposition, for example, on native title, that there ought to .be some decent treatment of the Aboriginal population of this country. We know all that. Sadly, given the resonance of these historical events these days, the opposition leader reminded me of those old Bolsheviks who were hauled up in the Stalinist, show trials of the 19308 when they stood up and said, 'Not only do I accept my conviction, but I praise the people who are doing this to me. Not only do I welcome the fact that I have been so comprehensively rolled on every one of the positions that I adopted' - in the case of the opposition leader that would be on the republic, on Mabo or whatever-'and have given them the flexibility they wanted; I think the party was right to do it to me. The party is right to put me on a spit. The party is right to twist me over the fire slowly, cooking me up to be the conservative that I am not. The party is right to do that to me. I not only confess; I welcome the execution on a principle that I possess'. It is a pretty good analogy. This is just part of the process that the opposition leader experiences. He has been wandering around like the gosling of a grey goose ever since he lost the last election. He follows the first adult he sees, who will lead him into whatever particular trench that adult takes him. In this particular regard, the ment by the Senate of the House of Representatives is merely one additional example. The Leader of the Opposition does not have a clue about how parliament operates. He does not have a clue about the significance of the relationship between the chambers. He does not have a clue about the impact of the chambers on the capacity of a government to operate. Some idiot told him somewhere along the line that the parliament ultimately was the tool of the executive arm of government and that the executive could come in and do anything it likes. Of course it is not, and never has been. Somebody told him that this was it and so he removed from his conscio\lsness the sensible, tactical position that any decent leader of the opposition could be expected to adopt. He elevated the capacity of the Senate to determine effectively the timetable of the House of Representatives and got that through. The second set of propositions that he has put forward is to elevate the right of the Senate effectively to destroyÂ· or rip the heart out of a budget. As I said, that is aÂ· right which we in opposition never took upon ourselves, despite the deep bitterness that people on this side of the House felt about the events of 1975. Opposition members have never experienced what we did in 1975; they did it. Now they are attempting to do it again. If is contemptible. Part of the consequences of that contemptible action is the fact that We have to move motions such as the motion I am moving here today.",22
69,Mr HOWARD,URGENT LEGISLATION,"The speech I have just listened to from the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) is one of the more interesting that I have heard him deHverfor a long time on these sorts of motions. It was interesting in two very important respects: firstly, he laid out very clearly what the government's sermon of. the week is, 'You over there in the opposition ranks are constitutional vandals and constitutional wreckers'. In the course of my remarks I am going to deal with the validity of that proposition. Secondly, he sought to establish in the course of his speech what the opposition had done in treat- response to the second Dawkins budget, which undoubtedly is the most derided and unpopular budget that this country has seen since the end of World War II. I say to the Leader of the House, 'Do not try to draw any comfort in comparisons between the mood of the community in relation to the Senate's actions in 1975 and the mood of the community now'. The Leader of the House says that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) does not have any idea of how parliament operates. That is completely untrue. I say to him, 'You do not have any idea of the mood of the Australian people if you believe that in some way the Australian people objecL to the attitude taken by the opposition in relation to these budget measures'. In announcing ahead of the Australian Democrats, ahead of anybody else, that we were going to oppose certain measures in the budget, the opposition has articulated the simple anger of Australians who know that they have been misled. That is why we have done it. If the Leader of the House thinks that the punters in the hotels and clubs of Australia are going around saying, 'Gee, aren't the Liberals being constitutional vandals in voting against the sales tax increases', he is completely out of touch with what the Australian people are thinking at present. In the 10 years that the present government has been in office, I have not seen a level of anger, disillusionment and hostility verging on hatred towards the present governmentparticularly the Prime Minister (Mr Keating)-such as has existed over the last couple of weeks. That is a direct consequence of a budget that represented a root and branch repudiation of the basis upon which ,the Australian people. had voted for the government. There is no constitutional crisis in Australia. The only crisis in Australia at the moment the internal political crisis of the Australian Labor Party. Do not be deceived into imagingovernment ing that the parliament is locked into some kind of constitutionally fatal or mortal conflict between the government and the opposition and between the Senate and the House of Representatives. Not even the most narrowand minded true believer of the Labor in his",25
70,Mr SLIPPER,URGENT LEGISLATION,Are there ariy left?,26
71,Mr HOWARD,URGENT LEGISLATION,"One or two of those may be left, and not even they could seriously take to heart the remarks of the Leader of the House that in some way this country is on brink of constitution ill chaos and constitutionmarks al crisis. Last week the Prime Minister was quite literally out of control. I was not country last week but, by gee, on the weekopposition end I saw some film of the Prime Minister's actions and I have never seen a more ballistic parliamentary performance. He really went right over the top,and the Leader of the House had to physically restrain him. The only crisis is an internal political crisis program inside the Labor Party, and from the very beginning the puny attempt of the Leader the House to whip this up into some kind constitutional outrage has lacked any kind substance. It is even more insubstantial because .the Leader of the House has compain pletely overlooked two things. The first thing he has overlooked is that all the opposition doing is following a precedent that opposinumbers tions on both sides of the parliament have followed for a very long time. We have exercised our undoubted right-that the Labor Party exercised in 198 I-to vote against certain elements of a budget. Yet, in his tone of phoney indignation, his confected outrage, the Le!!.der of the House tries to suggest that in some way we are on the brink of a constiman tutional crisis and the country is falling apart. In 1981 the Labor Party voted against the had this to say: three taxation measures that the Leader of the House has just enumerated. He went that only one of them was defeated by the The Senate. He should have been candid enough rule to say that the Labor Party voted against all three of them, and the reason why only one of them was defeated was that the Labor is Party did not have the numbers without the support of a couple of defectors from the of the time to defeat the extension of the sales tax measures. But if those defectors had been available, the Labor Party would have voted out the other two measures in the budget just as easily, just as happily just as gaily as it voted out the extension Party can, of the sales tax measure. Do not come in here and try to draw some kind of phoney distinction between what happened in 1981 and what is happening on this occasion. Perhaps the worse mistake the Leader of the House made in the speech just the now was to completely overlook some rethat were made-not by some mere underling in the Labor Party ih 1982-by the in the present Prime Minister when he was the spokesman on minerals and energy and also state president of the Labor Party in New South Wales. He was in a fairly fulsome mood because it was the day after the Lowe by-election which the Labor Party had won. On that particular occasion on the Sunday the Prime Minister had a number of very interesting things to say about what of parties holding the numbers in the Senate of ought to do. Honourable members should of remember that just a few minutes ago the Leader of the House said, 'No matter what and hurt we endured in 1975, we have always steadfastly adhered to the principle is that under no circumstances will we use our in the Senate to vote down budget bills or to wreck the budgets of governments that happen to be in power'. He paraded himself and his party as the paragons of political and constitutional restraint. Yet it was not like that on 14 March 1982, when the honourable member for Blaxland, the current Prime Minister of this country, the who, according to the Leader of the House, is a constitutional puritan, very clearly ' I believe in playing on the current gameson to say that sounds very Keatingesquecurrent political rules and the current political established by the Liberal Party is that they took a party to invoke-to use the Senate as a party house. For my view I don't believe the Senate ought to have these powers, but I think the only way we will remove the Senate's power of blocking supply is that we operate under the same in other words, that we throw out the government's budget. This is from the man who is now the Prime Minister of this country, the leader of the party that is asking us to believe that in some way we are on the brink of constitutional crisis. Eleven years ago that same man wanted the Labor Party to use its numbers in the Senate to throw out the entirety of the government's legislation. Eleven years ago he was advocating that the Labor Party should block supply. Yet we are being invited by his lieutenant in the House to believe that that sort of thought has never crossed the minds of government members.",26
72,Mr BEAZLEY,URGENT LEGISLATION,"No, I wasn't saying that.",27
73,Mr HOWARD,URGENT LEGISLATION,"No. The Leader of the House says it has never crossed their minds. In 1982 I was interviewed on the same program, and I remember the incident extremely well. The honourable member for Blaxland made it perfectly clear that if he had his way and if he could persuade the caucus room he would in fact induce, encourage and persuade the Labor Party to vote down the government's legislation to bring on an early election. In other words, the Prime Minister of this country, the man who accuses the Leader of the Opposition of being a political and constitutional vandal, is revealed as a total and comprehensive hypocrite on that whole issue. The whole mantra and sermon of the week that we have had from the government that in some way we are the vandals is revealed for the hypocrisy that it really is. The opposition is only doing what the present party in government did in 1981. The Leader of the House will be familiar with the words of the late Lionel Murphy way back in the 1970s, when he was the leader of the Labor Party in the Senate. He said: OUf objective is to vote against the budget Senate and our objective is to destroy this budget because we believe it to be a bad budget. That was 25 years ago. In 1981 the Labor Party combined with the Democrats to vote against three sales tax measures in the Fraser government's budget of 1981. We will be voting against a number of measures in the rules, Dawkins budget of 1993., We are following the Murphy-Keating-Whitlam precedent, if you like, root and branch. There is nothing new; there is nothing revolutionary; there is nothing sinister. When the Leader of the House fulminates about the fact that governments never have control of senates 'these days, perhaps he ought to pause to reflect upon who initiated an increase in the size of the Senate in 1984 which brought about the circumstance where it is much more difficult these days, because of the even number of senators retiring every three years, for governments to secure a majority in both houses of the parliament. So the reasoning behind this motion is revealed to be utter humbug. The Leader of the House was nowhere more unconvincing than. when he said, 'We will never forget what you are doing'. That was not very intimidating. I can say to the Leader of the House that I do not think anybody on this side of the House-I say it with the greatest of goodwill-was the least bit frightened when he said, 'None of us are ever going to forget what you are doing today'. That was a very pathetic attempt to try to breathe some life into this idea that in some way the opposition is creating a constitutional crisis. There is no constitutional crisis in Australia. In fact, Australia has enormous constitutional tranquillity, which is a very relevant argument in another debate that I will not dwell on at the moment. The only crisis in Australia at the present time is the internal political crisis of the Australiail Labor Party. Oh, what a crisis that really is! It is a crisis of confidence in the leader-and well may the Leader of the House be smiling at present because already they are touting his name around the corridors of this building. Already it is filtering into the in the airwaves that 'Beazley is the man'. Having gone to the brink-he is looking satisfied; he should not smile too much-the Leader of the House has come back from what he thought was electoral death's door at the last election and he has played a very quiet waiting game. The Prime Minister is in diabolical trouble, the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) is utterly discredited and the court favourite from Botany, the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton), is an absolutely irrelevant political commodity. If ever a bloke has really been shown to be utterly irrelevant on the front bench of this government, it is that great fixer from Darling Harbour, the Minister for Industrial Relations-the man whose great contribution to Australian Labor Party history was to write all over the Prime Minister's ballot box 25 years ago after the infamous Blaxland preselection in case they got hold of it and really counted the votes that were in it. This motion is a phoney motion. This motion is built upon the totally invalid proposition that in some way the opposition is behaving unethically, it is behaving destructively and it is behaving vandalistic ally. The opposition is doing no such things. The opposition is exercising its constitutional right to vote against measures it does not like and does not believe to be in the interests of the Australian people. Therefore, we reject utterly the reasons advanced, and we will oppose the motion to declare this measure subject to a guillotine.",27
74,Mr LEO MCLEAY,URGENT LEGISLATION,"Watson) (4.28 p.m.)An apocryphal story is told that, some years ago, Bill Wentworth was making a speech in this place and the member for Parkes at the time, Les Haylen, was supposed to have stood behind him wearing a waiter's jacket-the iriference being that he was going to take him away in the green cart. Having heard the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), I could nearly see the ghost of Les Haylen standing behind him there today. If we have heard humbug, which is how the honourable member for Bennelong described this motion, then 99 per cent of the hum bug has come from the honourable member for Bennelong and the other one per cent will come from the next speaker. The point is that opposition members here are giving up to the Senate any authority they have as members of this House.. In his speech a few minutes ago, the honourable member for Bennelong said the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) canvassed this idea in 1981; so, to use the words of the honourable member, that makes a bit of humbug out of what government members are saying here today. Of course, the honourable member for Bennelong did not say-and on a number of occasions he was invited to by the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley)-whether we did it; and we did not. As the Leader of the House said, this government and members of the Australian Labor Party have canvassed a number of institutional and constitutional changes. The Prime Minister and members of the government have canvassed the idea of a republic. Of course, the honourable member for Bennelong is opposed to that. While there are many things wrong with the institutions of this country, our view is that any changes should be made in the proper way. We will not do it by attacking the system from inside, and we will not do it by abrogating the authority of this House to the Senate. That is what this motion is about, and that is what the things that the opposition has been doing in recent times have been about. I am surprised by the behaviour of the honourable member for Bennelong. I would not mind so much if this little stunt were being run by the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) because he does not care too much about anything. However, the honourable member for Bennelong is a long standing member of this House who has been a Treasurer and has had some sensible things to say on issues from time to time. To have him stand up and say that the members of this House should see its sovereignty and supremacy abrogated to the Senate diminishes the honourable member for Bennelong anq diminishes all honourable members on his side of the House. I would have thought that the honourable member for Bennelong, who takes a significant interest in English constitutional history, would have been very much aware of the arguments between the House of Commons and the House of Lords, and of the difficulty that governments in Britain have had in achieving the mandates they were given because of the absolute hypocrisy and bloodymindedness of the aristocracy. What we seem to be getting in Australia from their fellow travellers, such as the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), is the same sort of thing. Those fights were fought and won by the House of Commons. However, what we are seeing in Australia, every time the Liberal Party is not in power, is a return to the old ways. The Liberal Party believes in the reintroduction of the right to rule, with the Senate frustrating the will of the people. We have seen that happen on two occasions in this place. Those who say that we are not going down the slippery road of 1975 should reconsider, because the opposition is in the same position it was in in 1974 and 1975. At that time a number of people were lined up to do over the then Leader of the Opposition. It had a weak leader in Bill Snedden, just as it has a weak leader, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hew-on), nowadays. It had people sitting behind Bill Snedden day. by day, plotting his demise. It has similar sitting behind the honourable member for Wentworth nowadays, plotting his demise. How did it manage to do this? What was one of the vehicles it used? It attempted to have the Senate take over the running of the show. What happened in 1974 and what the Liberal Party is trying to do now are one and the same thing: a mechanism by which to put the Leader of the Opposition under pressure, just as in 1974 it was a mechanism by which to put Bill Snedden under pressure. We have a ridiculous situation where all people in the Liberal Party are privately saying that they cannot stand the Senate; they cannot stand the senators. We have Senator Bishop running her very expensive campaign to be the Leader of the Opposition; running around the' countryside spending $100,000 so that she can be everywhere allÂ· the time saying that she should be the Leader of the Opposition. Perhaps she should stay where she is-in the Senate-because that is where the opposition is trying to put the leader's positipn. ' As far as the opposition is concerned, the Senate will' be calling the tune. For the eral Party, that means that those in the party room-the people who do not caucus with the rest of the Senate-are the people who will decide what they want to do. Perhaps Senator Bishop should rethink her ambitions, do over Senator Hill and take over the leadership of the Senate, because that is where the opposition is putting its leadership. I would have thought that if the honourable member for Mayo, who sometimes thinks a little deeply about things, and particularly the honourable member for Bennelong, want to be members of the government of Australia, it is crazy for them to abrogate the responsibility of this House to the Senate. We heard some discussion in here earlier today about the position of the US Senate. Obviously, some members of the opposition seem to think that that might be a useful model for Australia to adopt. Of course, if we did that, once again, the house of the people, the House of Representatives, would see, its power and authority in this country swing away. Opposition members ought to think about this, because we have two senators people from Western Australia-well meaning as they are-deciding the fate of this country. And why is that? Only because the opposition has decided that that is the way it ought to goThe Leader of the House is right in what he said. The government did not want to have to bring in this guillotine motion today. It would prefer that all members had their right to stand up and talk on this legislation because it is important legislation that people have an interest in. But members of the House of the Representatives are going to be denied their right to speak on some important pieces of legislation because of a time limit imposed in another place and supported by the opposition. Opposition backbenchers, as well as government backbenchers, will not get a chance to speak in the debate because ,of that decision. I think that that, once again, is giving up the rights of this House to another house. Mr Downer-Well, don't give them up.",28
75,Mr LEO MCLEAY,URGENT LEGISLATION,"The honourable member for Mayo says, 'Well, don't give Lib- them up'. Of course, the honourable member Senate for Mayo probably has not even read the papers lately. I must have just missed it; I try to keep abreast of things, but I had this funny idea that it was the opposition which joined with the Greens and the Democrats to impose this time limit. No-one from the government voted for the time limit; it was supported by Senator Hill. The honourable member for Mayo might remember that Senator Hill is a leading member of his party. The honourable member for Mayo might not like it, but he is. The point is that the honourable member for Mayo might go along to the opposition tactics committee meeting because it has obviously slipped his mind that it is in favour of this time limit. Maybe the honourable member for O'Connor will take him by the hand to the nextÂ· one and see that the shadow Treasurer gets to have his say, because I am startled to think that maybe he is a little bit more sensible than I gave him credit for, although that would be very difficult. The bottom line is that this House should maintain its supremacy. This is the House that is directly elected by the people. This is the House where the government of Australia is fonned. For members of the opposition-for any member of this parliament-to, in the end, go out and kill it, really does great damage to the democratic process in this country. What the opposition is seeing is the same as what it did to its leader in 1974. John Hewson and Bill Snedden have a lot in common. What they have in common is the people sitting behind them who are using the Senate to achieve the same end now that they did then. I would ask the opposition to rethink its strategy and to assert the supremacy of this House. I would ask all members to support the proposition of the Leader of the House.",29
76,Mr TUCKEY,URGENT LEGISLATION,"O'Connor) (4.39 p.m.)The three bills included in the declaration of urgency today-the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993, the Customs Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993 and the Excise Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993-contain all of the measures that the coalition has indicated it will oppose. The coalition made that very clear. 0,Â£ course, two days after the introduction of the budget, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), in his response, made that commitment very clear. All of a sudden we are told that these bills have to be guillotined through. on 6 September. In fact, the rules applicable in the Senate as to the introduction of bills in this House do not apply until 1 October. One might ask: why the rush? It is, of course, for other reasons. When these particular bills are declared urgent, as they will be simply because of the substantial majority of the Labor Party in this place, it will bring the total number of bills declared urgent by this government in its lO-year history to 566.",30
77,Mr SLIPPER,URGENT LEGISLATION,How many?,30
78,Mr TUCKEY,URGENT LEGISLATION,"A total of 566 bills. Between 1918 and the commencement of this government in office, the total number of bills guillotined was approximately 240. The honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay) shed crocodile tears about this House being the dominant House. His words were that we were trying to frustrate the will of the people. This House has been dragged into total irrelevance by this process of the guillotine but, worse, guillotines at the end of a parliamentary session when there was no opportunity for the coalition or the Independents in the Senate to take the information, the bills and the proposals to the people to get some idea of their reaction. The need for this motion is considerably in doubt. Quite clearly, we have three weeks of sittings to go. If the Leader of the House, the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley), wants to say, 'There are hardly any sitting days', we have already made government members an offer on that arrangement. We are quite happy to accommodate them and sit every day between now and 1 October if they like. We will come here. When we see the performance of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), his Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and today his Minister for Industrial Relations (Me Brereton), we can see why they do not want any more sitting days than necessary. They are terrified. We have asked three or four questions a day. The Prime Minister has been jumping up and down ready to grab the microphone at a quarter to three, or a quarter to four as it was today, to a-t.. that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. Then he scuttles, out of this place. That is what he is doing. He has suddenly been caught out. It is in that regard that I thought we should look at some of the remarks made by the Leader of the House and the honourable member for Watson. The Leader of the House said that it was wrong to 'elevate the Senate to that level'. As I said, the honourable member for Watson talked about frustrating the will of the people. What is the Senate doing? It is simply suggesting-because the coalition parties have taken the lead anp given a lead to the Independents-that it will keep the government to its election promises. It is not an election that occurred two or three years ago; it is an election that occurred some months ago. I have to remind honourable members of the images of that election produced by Labor Party's very excellent advertising company. I can still see the advertisementsErnest they are burnt on my brain. I can see a series . of election advertisements all referring to what the coalition's policies were, with clear inference that if people voted Labor none of these dreadful things would happen. Remember the advertisement about tutu-the little ballet dress? Ding, up went the cash register. There were all the other references, and the cash register kept ringing. It is ringing now. Sales tax is being rung up at an extra one per cent. According to the road transport forum, the increase on diesel fuel excise is putting an extra $3 on a basket of groceries. Then there was that other advertisement which depicted various job opportunities in the tourist industry, with young people dressed up as chefs, being blown away. What do we see now in this legislation? see measures which the tourist industry will devastate the job opportunities of young Australians. The blowing away factor is there, for example, in job opportunities industry. What are we opposing in these measures? We are opposing the sales tax measures, the fuel tax measures, and the tax measures. Everybody says that the industry'S employment creation ability and ability to repay this massive foreign debt that has been accumulated by this government will be destroyed. We are also .trying to get a fair deal people who, working within the laws of confuse the issue. Australia, chose, often through the pressure of work, to accumulate their long service leave and some of their annual leave entitlements. They expected those to be taxed as they always had been for decades. We go further, because the Leader of the House has been at some pains on a couple of occasions to argue how successful he was in convincing the racing industry in part of his electorate to vote for him and return him. The point is at that point in time, as I have already pointed out to a number of people, that the audience to which the minister refers was only 10 per cent of his own constituency. The others were people from other places. His view of the outcome of that meeting conflicts the with mine. Let me remind the Leader of the House of what the Treasurer's uncle, Sir Lee-Steere, his mother's brother, said. I hope it was while the Leader of the House was still there, because he said that he stayed the around. Sir Ernest made a very powerful case for the introduction of a GST. He said very clearly that he disagreed with the Leader of the kid's the House at that time. Mr Downer-A very rich man ",30
79,Mr TUCKEY,URGENT LEGISLATION,"A blue blood;,that is the point. We are talking about, and every speaker from the government benches has talked about, the Senate and what it is doing. I am arguing that the Senate is trying to keep the government to its election promises. Mr MCLeay inferjectingMr Downer inferjecting",31
80,Mr SPEAKER,URGENT LEGISLATION,"Would those honourable We members at the table who are holding a says discussion resume their correct seats, not interject, and allow the honourable member for O'Connor to make the point that he wants in the wine to make in silence.",31
81,Mr TUCKEY,URGENT LEGISLATION,"Thank you for your protection, Mr Speaker. We have already pointed wine out how misleading these advertisements were. Let us go to some of the correspondits ence that the honourable member for Swan chose to write about the GST to people ,in the racing industry. I think this has to be a classic from a person who knows he is telling a fib for but, in the process of doing it, is trying to",31
82,Mr BEAZLEY,URGENT LEGISLATION,"Mr Speaker, I rise to speak on a point of order. I object to the word fib.",32
83,Mr TUCKEY,URGENT LEGISLATION,"I withdraw the word fib. The point is that in a letter addressed to my son, a racehorse trainer, under his own letterhead and with his photograph, the honourable member for Swan was talking about prize money in the racing industry. This was a very significant factor in the outcome of the election. He said: Prize money would be taxed. That is tme. I continue: Under Fightback prize money would be treated as a sale by the horse owners and would be subject to GST in their hands. That is a pretty confusing statement, but it 'informed people that they would lose part of their stake money. The reality, as anybody in any VAT or GST country would tell people in the racing industry, is that the tax is added to the stake money. The Assistant Treasurer, the honourable member for Canning (Mr Gear), did not mess around with niceties at that stage. Mr Leo MCLeay- Mr Speaker, I rise to speak on a point of order. I pemsed the motion moved by the Leader of the House. As much as I am interested in the affairs of the racing fraternity in Western Australia, I have to bring back to the honourable member for O'Connor his own words. Maybe he should consult standing order 145 which deals with relevance.",32
84,Mr SPEAKER,URGENT LEGISLATION,The debate on this motion has been rather wide. I take the comment by the honourable member for Watson as reflecting a genuine desire for this debate to be relevant. I would invite the honourable member for O'Connor to continue.,32
85,Mr TUCKEY,URGENT LEGISLATION,"As you would know, Mr Speaker, and as the previous Speaker of this House should know, standing order 145 deals with question time; this, of course, is a debate. I accept the argument of relevance. I believe' that the point I have been making throughout this speech is that-notwithstanding the complaints of the Leader of the House and the honourable member for Watson about the activities of the Senate and the Independents in the Senate and about the very principled position of the coalition, which they are criticising at length in their debatewe are doing no more than demanding that the government stick to its election promises and maintain faith with the Australian people. I have been giving examples of how the Australian people were led to a belief that, if they voted Labor, there would be no taxation. I was giving some examples within the racing industry. The honourable m-mber for Canning said straight out in a letter addressed to another trainer: There would, under GST, be a 15 per cent cut in prize money for owners. In fact, the opposite would have applied. I could add to those points the fact that I saw a letter in the office of the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Ms Gallus), when she was contesting the election, which was brought in by a very agitated, elderly Greek gentleman. Somebody, who was not directly associated with the government, had sent him a letter in Greek saying that if the Liberals got elected all persons who did not have citizenship would be returned to their home of origin. That is the most outrageous type of politicking. There were others in South Australia who, as occupants of public housing, received letters from fellow travellers indicating that people in public housing were all going to be turfed out. Many years ago we had the then Senator Murphy table something like 147 examples of evidence that the Labor Party over time had taken similar action. We have to look at this whole performance and look at where we are going because, in terms of relevance, we need some consistency in this debate. The Leader of the House in his comments today mentioned that W(f are becoming cannon fodder; that we, the coalition, are to be cannon fodder of the minor parties. I wish the government would get this straight. I would like it to he consistent. I give as an example the circumstances of the last two weeks. Last week the government started off with this cannon fodder argument, with the Prime Minister and the Treasurer telling us that the coalition parties had become irrelevant, that we did not matter, that the Australian Democrats and the Greens were setting the agenda and that we had been left behind-notwithstanding that our position was so clearly stated by the Leader of the Opposition, the most secure leader in this place today, particularly in comparison with the Prime Minister. But that did not work; it did not get a really good run. The Prime Minister then tried a new tack and suggested that we were trying to take personal tax cuts off the people. The shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), came to the parliament and pointed out that if the people lost those personal tax cuts, as contained in the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill now under debate for the guillotine-if the government in its pique let the bill collapse because certain aspects of the bill were amended in the Senate-the people of Australia would still have I-a-w, that legislation which said they would get tax cuts starting in JulyMr Downer-July next year. Mi"" TUCKEY --July next year; and, by the time they were all implemented, giving them about three times the tax savings. So where is the problem? That did not work. Now the coalition parties have become relevant again. The Prime Minister today is in fact making us so relevant that he reckons we have caused the devaluation of the currency, notwithstanding that cUlTency dealers have said that it has been caused by the commodity price fall around Australia. They have made that clear in all forums. Then the Minister for Industrial Relations was today making some fuss about where we are. There are 273,000 businesses in Australia that employ fewer than 10 people. (TIme expired) Motion (by Mr Beazley) put: That the question be now put. The House divided. (Mr SPEAKER - Hon.

Given all that we have heard from opposition members and, in particular, the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), we could be forgiven for forgetting what the last election was fought and won on. In this House we have heard all the concerns of opposition members about the impact of this budget on the poor. I seem to recall that in the last election the opposition was proposing' a goods and services tax, which was going to raise some $27 billion in revenue. In addition, it was proposing some $10 billion in expenditure cuts to the budget. It defies belief that such a proposal would not impact adversely on the poor and those least able to bear it. At one stage under its proposals, the opposition was going to tax the bread and meat that people ate. All the goods and services that people currently pay no tax on were going to be subject to the imposition of a 15 per cent tax. I find it amazing that the opposition, having lost the election and having lectured the Australian people that it had the right policy and that they were wrong not to vote for it, comes into this place and argues about the government's budget proposals. Worse than that is the fact that the opposition is opposing the budget measures. I think it is a responsible position for major parties to avoid cheap politics and, at all times, act responsibly. I believe that any government, whether it be a coalition government or a Labor government, deserves to have its budget proposals voted on and passed by the Senate. It is a shame that the opposition has learned nothing from the traumatic events of 1975. It is to the credit of the Australian people that we were able to survive that constitutional crisis with our social fabric basically intact. It should always be the people that vote in or vote out governments, not the Senate. As a member of the House of Representatives, I object very much to the blanket opposition which the opposition is indicating it has to these measures. Australians are often accused of being very insular. We forget from time to time that there is a big world out there and that Australia can be affected by overseas economies. This budget proposes a growth in the economy of some 2.75 per cent. One of the things I find most pleasing about this budget, including the budget proposals, is the fact that the figures are quite conservative. We ought to contrast the growth that is occurring in the Australian economy-which we would all like to see much stronger-with that of o,ther OECD countries. I will run through some figures for the benefit of the House. Austria is not growing but is contracting by 0.6 per cent; Belgium is not growing but is contracting by 0.7 per cent; Iceland is not growing but is contracting by 1.8 per cent; the Netherlands is not growing but is contracting by 0.03 per cent; Spain, with a booming economy, is not growing but is contracting by 0.06 per cent; Sweden is not growing but is contracting by 0.2 per cent; Switzerland is not growing but is contracting by 0.5 per cent. All European OECD countries are not growing but contracting by 0.1 per cent. The OECD suggests that in 1993 Australia is going to grow-not contract-by 2.9 per cent. Lest honourable members feel that I have left out some of the major economies in Europe, I point out that Germany is not growing but is contracting by 1.9 per cent; France is not growing but is contracting by 0.7 per cent; Italy is not growing but contracting by 0.2 per cent; and the UK is growing by 1.8 per cent-nearly half of the Australian growth rate. I think it is very important that, notwithstanding the difficulties we are having with the economy, all Australians appreciate the fact that by OECD standards we are growing quite dramatically; in fact, we would all like to see Australia grow even further. We, in Australia, tend to lose sight of what is happening overseas. Petrol increases have caused a certain amount of angst. For the benefit of the House, I will demonstrate what is happening with petrol prices and petrol taxes in other countries. In Norway, petrol is $1.72 per litre, and the government take is 67 per cent; in Portugal, the price is $1.49 per litre, and the government take is 75 per cent; in France, the price is $1.41 per litre, and the government take is 77.4 per cent; in Germany, the price is $1.37, and the government take is 73.3 per cent; and in the UK the price is $1.15, and the government take is 68.7 per cent. Honourable members will see from the figures that I have quoted that Australian petrol prices compare more than favourably with prices in those OECD countries. We tend to get the argument that, because Australia is an island continent with such large distances to travel, very cheap petrol prices should be government policy. I have some sympathy with that point of view. It is fair enough to say that any increase in the price of petrol is reflected in general price increases. Having said that, I think it is also important that we remember that we are not selfsufficient in petrol. Unlike other countries, such as Brazil, we have not been able to convert to gasohol or ethanol to make our reserves go even further. and I think that is more the pity. There is a very strong economic argument, incidentally, that we should not underprice such a limited resource. We then have all the environmental arguments as to why we should make sure that other complementary and competitive forms of transport are able to compete on a fair and equal basis without trying to subsidise, effectively by low prices, the cost of road transport, whether it be passenger car, coach, truck or semitrailer. So there are some very strong environmental as well as economic arguments. I think that we should always maintain and review our current petrol pricing and make sure that we do not squander a limited resource. There are a few other things that I want to mention in the context of these bills. Firstly, I am very pleased that the government has now lowered the differential on leaded fuel from 5c in the dollar to 2c in the dollar.",34
87,Mr SLIPPER,PAIRS,"Were you part of the original decision?  ber for his interjection. I would love to say that I was in constant contact with the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and giving advice about the budget. I think it would stretch the credibility of members in this House, particularly the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms MCHugh), who is at the table, if I made such an assertion. Had I been in such contact, I would have been delighted to have given them the benefit of my views. I think that it is a very healthy process that we have been able to change that decision. I welcome it, and I believe that it is particularly welcomed by the electorate at large. Before that interruption, I wanted to men,. tion a few other things that I think are significant in relation to these bills. Firstly, there is a strategy of trying to get our deficit down to about.0.1 per cent of GDP. I think it is very important that people understand that the more we can reduce that deficit, the less demand the government will place on the private sector. One of the keystones and characteristics of this government is that we have, wherever possible, tried to fuel the economy by getting growth and jobs into the private sector. Given the fact that we are in a recession, and given our high levels of unemployment, it is entirely appropriate that much of the growth that are seeing in the economy is coming through government spending. I am particularly pleased, representing an electorate like ley, to be able to see that there is a$2 fiscal stimulus in the budget. It is also true to say that we do not want to programs be like the Americans and cherry pick all the measures that members of the House-or the Senate for that matter-might like and agree with and reject all the bad points. We have have a balanced package of measures. I think it has been a feature of our Australian democmeet racy, notwithstanding the fact that we have borrowed heavily from the Americans into framing it, that we contiTiue with this balwe anced approach. I am very pleased about that particular aspect as well as the of trying to get our deficit down to around one per cent of GOP. Having mentioned the Americans, I think it is appropriate to remind the House of the remarks of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister pointed out that notwithstanding the fact that the new President of the United States has embarked on a deficit reduction program-it survived by only one vote-the best the program will be able to do is get deficit down to three per cent. These bills will help to fund the tax foreshadowed in the budget. I am delighted that people earning between $20,000 and $38,000 will only be paying 34c in the dollar on each marginal dollar of income compared with 38c in the dollar. I knbw that measures are bitterly resented by those opposite, and the Senate has in fact pledged to vote against them, but there will be many in, my electorate of Chifley who will be very pleased to see them. I also welcome the fact that some of these bills that we are debating today will be able to fund the proposed $150 rebate to those low incomes. Again I understand the opposition is voting against this measure, seeing as a proposal that should not go through. I delighted that this budget picks it up. Given the high levels of unemployment, this budget is providing something like $1.3 party. billion in labour market programs. Even when we had the high growth rates in the 1980s and we the tremendous increase in the level of employment growth, it was a sad fact that only one in seven new jobs, the jobs that Labor Chifhad created, were going to the long-term billion unemployed. Dollars spent on long-term unemployed through special labour market is money well spent., As we are faced with the higher levels of unemployment, I think people on this side of the House at least will be keen to make sure that we get to the cost benefits that go with spending even more money on labour market programs to the needs of the long-term unemployed, to keep them in touch with employment and allow them to re-enter the work force once get the economy buzzing along at the four to five per cent required to make a dint in the overall thrust long-term unemployed. Some have said that they are very disappointed that more has not been done in this budget for the long-term unemployed. I think it is only fair, to point out that the Prime Minister has taken the unprecedented step of ,setting up a special task force to look at the issues of employment and unemployment. I think it is very appropriate that we look at the these issues, given the many changes in the economy. There has been a dramatic change in participation rates for women in the work cuts force. The balance between part-time or casual employment versus permanent employment, enterprise bargaining and the productivity increases that have occurred are all factors that have added up, if you like, to these larger structural unemployment. I think it is very good that an expert committee is to look at these issues. The first report is due to be presented in December and hopefully the government will publish a white paper early in the new year. I am delighted to advise the House-I regret that the honouron able member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer) is 'not here-that I am certainly being consulted it on that issue, because it has been my pleasure am to be a member of the caucus working group. I know that a lot of people in my electorate are waiting on the results of that working The passage of these bills will mean that a couple in receipt of a pension, with two children, will receive 24 per cent more in their pension. The paltry record of those opposite in their term of office was that that same pensioner couple with two children had a net decrease. One of the issues that opposition members constantly raise is the level of taxation in Australia. They are always saying that we need to decrease levels of taxation. It matters not one fig that we now have the lowest level of taxation of OECD member countries. In fact, with the United States recording a slight increase, we are even lower than the overall level of taxation in the United States. But that satisfies those opposite not one whit; they want to see taxation rates driven even lower. I do not understand for what purpose. The shadow Treasurer is very anxious that we should have Asian levels of taxation. We can learn much from the Asian economies, the way the Asian tigers have developed and what is fuelling their terrific rate of growth. However, we should not copy their taxation levels and, in particular, eliminate our social welfare system-our safety net-that we have had a very proud tradition of encouraging. If we were to copy anything, we might look at Asian economic planning, because economic planning seems almost a dirty word in Australia. I am impressed that most countries have at least a five-year horizon for planning: for example, Indonesia has a 25-year planning horizon with five-year tranches. Unfortunately, Australia does not have that at the moment. I have mentioned the $2 billion fiscal stimulus to the economy. The Prime Minister told the House again today that Australia has the lowest interest rates for some 20 years. That is of great benefit to small business. A businessman in my electorate told me what a great difference these lower interest rates make. He was able to save something like $100,000 every quarter, and that was terrific impact. One of the. other innovations being funded by these measures in the budget is the $30 a week home-care allowance. I regret that the opposition may be putting this initiative of the Labor government at risk. The opposition should remember that the package of proposals it took to the electorate was thoroughly rejected at the last electionbasically because it really was going to come down hardest on the working class, the poor and those least able to afford it. The opposition should not lecture those on this side of the House. (TIme expired)",37
88,Mr JULL,PAIRS,"I suppose  has had a very hard job trying to justify the measures in this budget, particularly the measures we are debating tonight through the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill. I am fascinated that every day in this House we get these great tours of OECD countries, especially after we have had 18 months of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) ramming it down our throats that we are part of Asia, that our future is in Asia, that we have to compete with Asia and that we have to get into the Asian markets. In the meantime, we go on this magical mystery tour around such exotic destinations as Austria, Belgium, Iceland, Spain, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland. . But I am fascinated that in all these debates there is one country in our region that never gets a guernsey, and that is New Zealand. New Zealand has been through a pretty torrid time over the last 10 years, but it is fascinating to see what New Zealand is doing to us in the area that we are supposed to be getting into. If we look at the results that New Zealand has achieved in the last few months, it is really quite extraordinary. For the first time in 20 years New Zealand's trade is in the black and it can compete. It is giving us a whipping in those Asian markets. Why is New Zealand giving us a whipping? The reality is that New Zealand has taken the hard decisions, has fixed up its taxation system and has deregulated its labour market. Before the election we were told what shock horror it would bring to the people of a this country if Australia went on this system. It is fascinating that the unemployment rate in New Zealand is now declining and is less than 10 per cent. We still have to take the hard decisions. It is absolutely extraordinary that people come into this place and argue about the necessity to increase the fuel tax. We are told that this is not really going to be a problem at all, but anyone with a minimum of intelligence can tell that the flow-on effect on the cost of production of all sorts of goods and services is absolutely enormous. We will become less and less competitive as we go on. This is a most amazing budget. On budget night the opening words of the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) were that this budget was all about creating jobs, yet under the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill the government is going to destroy about 10,000 jobs in the Australian tourism and hospitality. industry. This evening I would like to concentrate some of my comments on that area of the bill which imposes the fringe benefits tax on excess travel. This is one of the most amazing and ill thought out proposals I have ever seen. While this debate is taking place here, I hope the opposition parties in another place are referring a full examination of this proposal to a senate committee to show just how ridiculous and half-witted the whole thing is. The idea of imposing fringe benefits tax on excess travel is not a new one. The concern has been around for a while. The reality of the situation is best summed up in a quote from that guru of the Australian Labor Party, the former Minister for Tourism, the Hon. John Brown. In a submission that he made on behalf of one of his clients, he certainly summed up 'the situation when he said that the Labor Party's real difficulty is that it has not really matured enough to realise just what the 'industry was all about. He said that the Labor Party did not know the reality of the situ-tion and that it was just of the philosophical effort of the government to 'go and get the tall poppies.' The government can go and get the tall poppies if it likes, but the reality is that there has been a maturation of the Australian accommodation industry and the hospitality industry and the results coming from these particular moves will see some massive reductions in employment. A study has been completed by the Australian Hotels Association-I regard' it as a fairly conservative study-which has gone to the government and, no doubt, will go to the senate inquiry. This study spells out the situation chapter and verse. We do not have to have access to that study to learn of the concerns in the industry at the moment. I think honourable members would agree that the gentleman who serves as the divisional chairman for accommodation of the Australian Hotels Association, and one of the finest hoteliers in Australia, Wolfgang Grimm, summed it up this morning when he issued a press statement to Australian Associated Press pointing out what would be involved in the Sydney market alone. It is quite frightening when we see the results of that study. He says that the five-star Regent Hotel in Sydney stands 'to lose 250 staff; the five-star Hotel Intercontinental will have to shed 230 employees; four-star hotels such as the Hilton would shed 150 jobs; the Ritz-Carlton Hotel, the ANA Hotel, the Hotel Nikko and the Holiday Inn-Menzies Hotel would lose 40 staff each; the Park Hyatt Hotel would lose 60 staff; the Renaissance Hotel would lose 50 staff; and the Novotel at Darling Harbour would lose 37 staff. That is one city alone. Why are those people going to lose staff? It is because we are told in these budget papers that the Australian Taxation Office will refer to a document headed TR93/22 as the guidelines for setting a limit on business travel. That covers the amounts that can be claimed by those Commonwealth public servants who are on a travel allowance. The fact that this government would try to relate any Public Service travel allowance to what happens in the real world is beyond my comprehension, for a number of reasons. One part reason is that there are so many different divisions of the allowances made for travel , because they are calculated on salary ranges. There are differences in the level of travel from city to city and from state to state. There are even differences in the travel allowances allowed from town to town. If we consider the application of this measure and the general mood of travel,' there is really no relationship between the amount given and the reality of trying to live in some of these cities. I will explain that a little bit further. When we look at the total daily allowance that is aIlowed in Sydney for public servants whose annual salary is in the range of $61,147 to $102,399, it is interesting to note that they are aIlowed $193.60 a day. That aIlows $116 for accommodation, $62.35 for food and drink and $15.25 for incidentals. If they go to Melbourne, they get $201.60 a day; if they go to Brisbane, it is $176.60; if they go to Canberra, it is $161.60; and so it goes on. Out of the capital cities we find some other gems. There are two weighted differences between certain country towns and other country towns. For example, there is a rate of $99 per day in Broome. I suppose if we wanted to stay in the youth hostel in Broome with the backpackers we would probably get by for $99 a day. When one goes to Norfolk Island it is $87 a day. If ones goes to Yulara, it is $167.50 a day. There are other rates for other areas. If an employee has an income below that magic figure of $61,147, the rates come down dramaticaIly. Do we honestly think, if we are in the business of sharpening up the administration of Australian business, that accounts departments wi11 be physicaIly going through every line cent by cent trying to sort this out? One of the first things to contend with regarding this particular move in this budget is the cost that will be imposed in administration to try to work out this mess. PracticaIly, of course, Australian businessmen do not operate in the same way as public servants. When public servants go to a conference it is not unusual for the head of the department to go to hotel A, for his lackey to go to hotel B and for the junior clerk to go to hotel C. Quite often the reality is that businesses undertake their conferences and the physical work that they are required to do in the same hotel. The situation really does not come into it. Yet we are told by this government that the reality is that people are just trying to rip off the system. We are told that the government is reaIly after the taIl poppies who are paying $1,400 a night for a suite. I will tell honourable members who hires the $1,400 a night suites in hotels in Australia. It is really quite interesting to get a section. Yes, there are some businessmen from Japan who come in and hire the suites. Yes, sometimes Australian businessmen hire the suites. They are often used for trade shows and various displays such as that. But one of the biggest groups of users, particularly with one hotel chain. is federal ministers who are upgraded. It is quite fascinating, when looking at the range of allowances given for Commonwealth public servants and the range of aIlowances proposed for Australian business, to see that the overnight aIlowance for a minister of the Commonwealth is $300. Surely, some of our senior executives should be all owed the same amount as federal ministers who are pulling $300 a night, no questions asked. But no, we are not going to look at that all; we will try to impose this crazy system that is being proposed. It is worse than that. The bottom line is that the FBT will also be imposed on conventions held in Australia. International conventions are a big market. Domestic conventions are a big market. Conventions were worth about $1.6 billion to Australia last year. The market is so big that Australia has put enonnous investment into specialised convention centres. Just last week we saw in the Queensland budget that $87 million has beenaIlocated this year alone to begin the Brisbane convention and exhibition centre at South Bank and that money has also been given to the Cairns convention centre. The government proposal will apply the FBT to conventions held in Australia. Someone with half a brain who was staging a convention would go offshore, because offshore conventions are to be exempt. I am sure there will be a tremendous raIlying of the troops when they are told that a convention is to be held in Bali, Fiji, Thailand or some other exotic destination because it will be cheaper than having it in Australia. When we talk about 10,000 jobs going in the hotel industry, we can say that we will be crippling the Australian convention industry completely. The move is absolutely stupid. The cost of compliance will be great, but I can tell honourable members that the boys are crossonto it already. No-one need think that the convention business will be left alone; it will not be. This industry will not be allowed to die. One of the first things that will happen is that there will be package deals organised all over the place which will incorporate the price of the airfare, the cost of accommodation and the cost of all meals. 1 guess that will apply, too, to straight business travel. first thing someone would have to do would be to buy the package from the airlines. Nobody has been able to tell me at this stage how we will get around this one. If the honourable member sitting up the back, the honourable member. for MCEwen (Mr Cleeland), wanted to go from Melbourne to Sydney, he could go along to Qantas Australian and say, 'I want to fly to Sydney and I want a night at the Regent Hotel'. He could be told, 'We have this special for you'. The special would be at a particular price, the principal part of which would be the full listed airfare. If the total cost of the trip $500 or $600, which mayor may not be the allowance, you can bet your bottom dollar he would have the full airfare included in the price and the accommodation package would be thrown in for peanuts, and it would be balanced out somewhere else. So it will not be as hard as all that to get around the set-up. We will see this happen particularly with conventions if we are not to see the convention industry go out the door. Even worse than that, we require this infrastructure for the further development of Australian tourism. The fact is that overseas visitors want fiveand four-star hotels to stay in. The Sheraton chain is undertaking the development of some 59 properties around South-East Asia at the moment. Do honourable members know how many new properties we have under construction in Australia? The answer is nil. The reason it is nil is that are no incentives to build new properties. We do not have the taxation incentives that our rivals in South-East Asia have. The Australian banking and financial institutions do not have the confidence to invest in tourism because at the moment the margins are just not there. Through this tax move, we will make sure that nobody will invest in new hotel infrastructure here in Australia. We are already seeing operators taking care of business by stopping further refurbishment of existing properties. 1\vo major chains at the moment, one of which is based in Melbourne, have come out quite publicly and said, 'The refurbishment of our properties is this stopping as of now because we cannot get a The return on our money'. In the hotel industry there is a rule of thumb that the room rate should be one per cent of the cost of construction of the room. At the moment in Australia a room cannot be built for less than half a million dollars, which means that the room rate should be $500 a night. The reality is that no-one is getting those prices. The prices are coming down and will continue to come down as properties go down market to try to accommodate the provision that we have in this legislation. The reality is that 43 per cent to 44 per cent of the hotel business in Australia at the was moment is business travel. The hotel business will come down market to meet the requirements; staff will go out the window, as was mentioned before; and we will see a downgrading of our properties. That will not be good for the future development of tourism in Australia. Studies have been done which indicate that by the end of this decade Australia will need another 92,000 beds if it is to accommodate the present predictions on the numbers of tourists who will enter this country. They are not my figures; they are government figures. Where the devil will Australia get investment to provide 92,000 more beds by the end of the decade when one has provisions like this that will scare investors away in their hordes? This particular provision really is one of the most ridiculous of all time. While we have mentioned accommodation there and conventions, it is every aspect of the industry that suffers. We have not mentioned the restaurants. When the FBT first came in, we saw what that did to the restaurant industry-it caused absolute devastation around Australia. Nobody would deny that rorts were going on, but rather than try to clean up the system and get a sensible system, as has been undertaken in virtually every other country in the world through caps or a voucher system, this government knocked it on the head and the jobs and the restaurants went down like ninepins. And this government is going to do it again. Look at some of the allowances proposed under TR93/22. The cost of providing three meals a day is really quite unreasonable. The restaurants will suffer. Whether we like it or not, the reality is that the staff involved in the restaurant industry will suffer too because the hospitality industry has the capacity to be able to provide lots of jobs in the shortest possible time. If the FBT were lifted tomorrow in its entirety, 22,000 jobs could be created immediately in the restaurant industry. But the government is not interested in that; it would rather see those jobs go. This provision will have a bouncing effect throughout the Australian economy. Taxi drivers, everyone who is involved in the tourism and hospitality industry, will ultimately suffer from this particular move. I appeal to the government to take note of the Senate inquiry and make sure that that examination really brings out the ridiculousness of this particular move. I hope that the government then has the guts to do one of two things: either drop this particular provision completely; or, if it must go ahead with it, at least get to a stage where we have some decent limits available. While the Hyatt hotel . chain and the tourism task force have suggested that $600 a night is not a bad place to start-it probably would be negotiable-let us start at the ministerial limit of $300 a night and not the $150 a night that is proposed in this stupid measure. '",39
89,Mr CLEELAND,PAIRS,"MCEwen) (5.57 p.m.)It is always a pleasure to follow the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull). I accept that he has a very genuine interest in the tourism industry. Indeed, he was one of the very few members of the opposition who drew attention to the effects of the goods and services tax as it would apply to the tourism industry. Of course, we all know that, if the qpposition were sitting on this side of the House and we now had a goods and services tax, it would be quite devastating and the tourism industry would now be arguing with a liberal government about getting some changes. I wonder whether the honourable member would have crossed the floor of the House to vote against the goods and services tax. But I take on board what the honourable member said because I accept and understand his deep and enduring interest in tourism and its effect on Australia. I also have to draw to the attention of the House the effect of the fringe benefits tax. I well recall standing in this place when we brought in the original fringe benefits tax. I recall vividly newspaper headlines around Australia claiming that we would destroy the hospitality industry. At the time we were all told that there would not be a restaurant left in Australia within 12 months. Death, doom and destruction were forecast to all. 1Welve months after the original fringe benefits tax was brought in, it is now history that in fact the restaurant industry boomed. 1Welve months after the introduction of the fringe benefits tax there were more restaurants in Australia than before it was introduced. That shows the difficulty we all have in this place in forecasting the effect of taxation changes. As I will say later, I certainly have concerns about some of the changes proposed by the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill and cognate bills. I also have concerns about the effect that those changes will have on the wine industry. I might be wrong in my forecasts; nevertheless, I still have those concerns . This is very largely an omnibus bill which covers a whole host of related taxation matters. It never ceases to amaze me when I hear those opposite in this place-and I have had the advantage of reading some of the speeches made last week by members of the opposition-talk about history and where they stand on matters of taxation principle. I have only to go back to the 1970s and section 260 of the then Income Tax Assessment Act and a former Attorney-General of this House and a former member of the Liberal Party of Australia who became the Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia. He almost singlehandedly-accompanied by fellow judges such as Sir Harry Gibbs-tore section 260 asunder, with the total compliance of the then conservative government. We did not hear one peep as the greatest tax rorts in the history of this country were visited upon the Australian people. Indeed, we still hear Sir Garfield Barwick described as a very fine and honourable gentleman. I must say that that is not my view at all. I was rather surprised, for example, to hear Sir Harry Gibbs, a former judge of the High Court, say that if Australia becomes a republic there will be riots in the streets. This is same gentleman who had no concerns abOut section 260 when he sat on the High Court. So we hear these things from the conservative elements of this country and this parliament. But look at their history, where they sit and what they have done. It is little wonder that we on this side of politics treat all of that with a grain of salt. Their history on taxation matters is not one to be proud of. It was only very recently during the 1993 federal election campaign that a goods and services tax at the rate of 15 per cent was going to be visited upon the Australian people. Despite the fact that we knew that would destroy tourism, have a major impact on the wine industry, and was the most regressive tax measure this country has seen attempted to be implemented, the opposition still ran with it. My opponent, the then member for MCEwen, Mrs Bailey, for more than 12 months told the people in her electorate that a tax on necessities would be good for them and not regressive. She told them that such a tax would do them no harm at all and that the price of bread would rise by only the GST rate of inflation, which, depending on which part of Fightback one read, ranged from 3.9 per cent to 4.4 per cent. So for 12 months we had this debate in the electorate of MCEwen, with Mrs Bailey saying that under a GST the price of bread would rise by only the rate of inflation. She said that such a tax would be good for people andÂ· that it would not be regressive at all. It is a great pity that some of the people on the other side of the House did not tell their leader that he was wrong, that the opposition's proposals were regressive, that the backbenchers would not accept the GST and that the opposition should implement some changes to that tax because it was a most regressive proposal. Going into the election there was enough politics on the other side to force that change, and suddenly we were told that a tax on necessities would indeed be regressive. I am pleased that message finally got through and some changes were made. It was indeed commendable that some of the backbenchers and some of the the election candidates from the conservative parties realised that. My side of politics has always opposed regressive taxes. I go back to the 1985 tax summit when we talked about introducing a goods and services tax. Like in more recent days in this place, the then caucus, of which I was a member, said, 'No. We won't accept those regressive types of changes'. On my side of politics, caucus does have a capacity to effect change. We are not ashamed of that. In fact, it is one of the things of which we are very proud. As a caucus member, one can effect those changes. Go to Victoria and have a look down there and see what is happening. The most regressive and nasty conservative government in this country at the moment is ripping into rural Victoria like we have never seen before. It is closing down primary schools, ripping into rural hospitals and closing rural railway lines. Does one find one member of the National Party of Australia or one member of the Liberal Party standing up to Jeff Kennett and saying, 'It's not on. '? Not one of them has done that. We are a bit different in the Labor Party. We have the ability to stand up and tell our leaders and our cabinets that there are things which we do not accept. Of course, our leader is quite prepared to accommodate and discuss with us those sorts of changes. I find the opposition's conservatism and its caving into its leaders as often as it does . really quite amazing. There is nothing in the macro policies which this tax measure is going to produce that I find particularly alarming. However, what does worry me is the fact that in 1989 Australia had the second highest tax rate in the OECD whereas the 1990 OECD report shows that as a percentage of GDP we are now the lowest taxed country in the DEeD. That worries me because I believe in a progressive tax system. I believe that our income tax rates are probably too low and are no longer as progressive as I would like them to be. On the other hand, indirect tax collections in this country have fallen quite 'Sharply; in fact, our indirect tax revenue is down alarmingly. Measures must be taken to repair that side of the revenue base. While I accept measures that will do that, I would much prefer to see more progressive, rather than regressive, tax measures. It, is no secret to this House that I have publicly expressed my concern about the impact of the increase of sales tax on the wine industry. There are a number of reasons for that concern and for my opposition to those changes. As a member of parliament, I have had a long association with the wine industry. My electorate of MCEwen is one of Australia's premier wine producing areas. In 1985, when we first looked at intr-ducÂ­ ing sales tax at the rate of 10 per cent, the Victorian parliament of the day conducted a major inquiry into the Victorian wine industry and a report was tabled. That report included a major discussion on the elasticity of the domestic price of wine. In April of the same year, another major report on the wine industry, prepared by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics, was tabled in this House, partly in response to the grape prices and vine pool proposals of 1985-86. That report also indicated the very low elasticity of the domestic price for wine. The long-term elasticity was minus 1.2 in the Victorian report and minus 1.3 in the federal report. In more recent days, a report was released in South Australia and we have also seen the release of the Sharp report, both of which indicated the same type of figures: in domestic price terms there is very low elasticity in wine prices. I am not one of those people who believe in free markets or this laissez-faire competitive market rubbish. I believe that we have a major role to play in promoting exports and, where possible, assisting those industries proving to be major growth export areas. The Australian wine industry is, without question, a major new export area. It is estimated that in the next decade or so $1.2 billion will be spent on new capital in the industry, and by the tum of the century we will be exporting close to $1 billion of wine. In the electorate of MCEwen there is a large number of new small vineyards. In the King Valley, where we are currently growing tobacco, the tobacco growers are looking for alternative crops because of this government's tax increases and the huge tax increases imposed by the Victorian government after Jeff Kennett's backdown on his promise not to increase taxes for tobacco growers. One of the new crops in the King Valley is grapes for wine production. It costs approximately $10,000 per acre to establish a vineyard. In addition, there is the lead-up time for the vine to grow and for the viticulturist to get to work before one can expect a reasonable crop. Then one has to carry the capital costs of the wine making equipment. It seems to me that people are being forced out of tobacco production because of the restrictions and costs involved. However, while one of the few options for them is to move to wine production, we are increasing taxes and inhibiting their capacity to do that. The producers I have spoken to have told me that small producers who want to go into the export market need a domestic sales component to carry them through the export phase. They tell me that it is enormously difficult to go overseas and obtain a market share. Slowly, they have to start clawing their way into those export markets. I know of several vineyards which are now exporting but not making a profit; indeed, they are carrying much of their capital cost while they are clawing into that export marketplace. Anything we do which will have an impact on a growth industry-on the market share of the wine industry-concerns me because I do not believe that we should do anything in this country which will affect in any way, shape or form such a prospective major exporter because most producers are very'small and highly capitalised. From time to time, all of us in this place will stand up and put forward our .own theories and views on what the future effect of certain taxesÂ· will be. I was here when the ftinge benefits tax was introduced and I well recall the great horror stories that went around the place to the effect that it would destroy industry. That did not happen. Industry survived and prospered. Perhaps I am wrong and others are right, but from my own perspective and that of my electorate, I oppose the measures contained in this bill. It was suggested by some of the conservatives in my electorate that I should cross the floor on this issue. Clearly, that is fact, I regard that as an absolute joke because this is a bill of many parts; there is no single issue. There is no way that I would cross the floor and vote with this miserable opposition who would have destroyed the wine industry with its GST. Its approach to this legislation is so shallow. Mr Anderson-Rubbish! We would have significantly lowered their costs.",43
90,Mr CLEELAND,PAIRS,"I am very glad of the interjection because, obviously, members of the opposition have not bothered to talk to the wine producers, who knew all too well what the GST would have done to them. If members of the opposition had bothered to talk to a few of them, if they actually bothered to talk to rural people about their problems, they would have realised that the GST was not welcome. I know that because I went and spoke to them. I sure as hell did not find them flying the Liberal Party flag in my electorate during the election, except for the few who belonged to the Liberal Party, and even they were fairly quiet. The opposition should not kid itself. If it wants to find out how its mob is regarded, it should go down to Victoria and talk to rural people. It should go down and count how many schools will be closing in Victoria over the next few months and where they will be closed. It should go and talk to National Party members who are leaving that party in Victoria in droves because of what is happening in the rural areas. It might give them a shock. Mr Anderson-You're only trying to muster a few votes for the Labor Party.",46
91,Mr CLEELAND,PAIRS,"My membership is already going up at an alarming rate. People are leaving the opposition parties and joining us because they have suddenly realised that they should not have voted for Kennett in the first place. They have had a dose of conservative politics in Victoria and they do not like it. It is pretty painful and pretty vicious. As I have indicated, this bill is a very large omnibus bill and it has my support. As I have publicly indicated, I am opposed to the increase in the wine tax; however, I still a no-no. In commend the bill to the House.",46
92,Mr GEAR,PAIRS,"I table a supplementary explanatory memorandum to the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill, a supplementary explanatory memorandum to the Customs Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill, a supplementary explanatory memorandum to the Excise Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill and a correction to the explanatory memorandum to the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill.",46
93,Mr ANDERSON,PAIRS,"As is universally recognised, the budget, in all its various forms, is a failure. It is a failure because it adds to business costs. It is a failure becal)se it hurts the poor more than the rich. It throws to the winds those words of Bob Hawke about restraint with equity in difficult times. Even in terms of its own predictions about job opportunities it is a failure because it predicts no improvement in Australia's chronic unemployment figures for the next 12 months. Above all, it is a failure because, at a time when this country is crying out for leadership and direction, it offers only injustice, confusion and broken credibility. The very stuff of leadership is lacking, absent, not there. It is being recognised as a failure by everyone around the country, even surely now by. those who crafted it. It is not just the Australian Democrats and the Greens, it is not even just the overwhelming bulk of the Australian people, it is the core of the labour l'10vement, the unions and the backbench opposite, who see it as a dud. The budget fails to recognise the urgent and desperate need in this country to get serious about developing an internationally competitive economic environment. Taxes on production inputs not only remain, they are increased. By that standard alone the judgment must be that it trends in precisely the wrong direction. The government boasts-indeed, we have heard it in this place repeatedly todaythat interest rates have come down in this country. They have done so compared with what we had in the past, but where are they by international standards? What do our farmers, manufacturers and small businessmen have to pay in comparison with those abroad with whom they must compete for international market share? The previous speaker, the honourable member for MCEwen (MrCleeland), talked about the supposedly inflationary pressures that Fightback would have imposed on the Australian economy, but we have heard precious little about what this budget, in its own terms, predicts about inflationary pressures. Those pressures would be far more significant than those in Fightback and they would be coming at a worse time than we could ever imagine for the introduction of such pressures. We couple that with the other prevailing economic circumstances and find that \ye are looking at higher interest rates at railways. the very time when we need to get them down to the sorts of levels that our competitors abroad are enjoying. When we couple those inflationary pressures with the other problems that we have, and look at the overall broad economic environment in which we have to operate, we see that businesses right across the board will find that they simply are not able to compete in an environment that unties their hands. We constantly hear of comparisons between our taxation regimes and those of Europe. Mr Bruce Scott-But what about Asia?",46
94,Mr ANDERSON,PAIRS,"Then we hear that we are part of Asia and that our future lies in Asia. What aboui bringing our tax systemsthe burden on businesses in particular-into line with those export tigers of Asia that are so far outstripping us and that are showing us the way? As I said earlier, it is not as though our taxation policies are now inappropriate; it is worse than that. What we now have before us is a further trending in the wrong direction. I tum to some of the specifics that concern the people whom I represent. I refer first to the hike in fuel excise. It does not seem to have had a lot of attention focused on it, but the hike in fuel excise will add massively to the costs of the agricultural, forestry and food processing industries. In fact, it will add something in the order of $290 million-or would have done so in the form of the original budget estimates. Now, presumably, that has come down a bit, but not by very much. We heard this nonsense earlier from a previous speaker about how the GST was going to add to costs. Apparently, he has not read that the clear intent was to remove the costs of indirect taxation on industry, because the indirect taxation burden on industry is a tax on prosperity, exports and jobs. He, apparently, is not aware of that, chooses not to be aware or does not understand. But these industries, according to the government's own Treasury estimates, are currently paying more than $l.5 billion in fuel excise every year, even allowing for the diesel fuel rebate where it exists. Mr Bruce Scott-It will close Queensland",47
95,Mr ANDERSON,PAIRS,"It will close down regional Australia; so much for that regional task force. Bill Kelty is talking about what we can do to get regional Australia going; he might have been a little more positive during the last election. He scuttled the very major reform, the very thing, that would have most helped decentralisation-much cheaper fuel. If we add this latest increase in the budgetary take, we find that the burden on the agricu1tural, forestry and food processing industries together comes to something like $1.8 billion-a significant increase to the burden under which it already labours. This, of course, makes those industries that much less competitive against companies in other countries, particularly Asian countries, and New Zealand-that dreaded scourge which is written off because it is pulling ahead, but it is doing things that the labour movement in this country do not approve of. Australia is much less competitive against companies in other countries which do not have to pay these types of taxes on exports. If we couple this anti-investment, antigrowth, anti-export approach to taxation with our hopelessly slow reform of work practices-now, of course,Â· put on the backburner again because of the appalling grab for more power by the ACTU, with references to allencompassing tentacles and all sorts of things like that it is no wonder our food processors have trouble matching the competitiveness of imports. It is no wonder companies are looking to locate offshore. It is no wonder we have slipped from the fifth global exporter of processed foods in 1960 to the 11 th today. The Australian Maritime Association has predicted that the added fuel costs arising out of this budget will add $16.1 miIlion a year to the cost of coastal shipping. This is absolutelyamazing. Waterfront reform was supposed to have been where this government had got it all right-not to mention shipping reform where, to give the government its dues, some real progress has been made. But we find that, after a struggle to reduce crew numbers, because each crew member adds around $110,000 to shipping costs, the government, with one budget, has saddled the industry with costs which are the same as employing another 146 crew.",47
96,Mr LLOYD,PAIRS,It is stupid.,48
97,Mr ANDERSON,PAIRS,"Stupid is hardly the word for it. It is no wonder the National Farmers Federation says that both farm business and farm families will be worse off. So will the communities they live in, and so will Australia, with its current desperate need for export dollars. It is really quite obvious that neither the Democrats nor the government have any knowledge about what is needed to reduce costs, tum the economy around and redevelop job opportunities. They are great at dividing up the cake, they are great on the distributional argument, but they are utterly hopeless when it comes to the question of how we are going to bake a bigger cake so that everybody can have a more generous slice. Richard Farmer had it right when he said, 'Don't look to them for the solutions, they stiII haven't worked out how they got it wrong right through the 1980s'. We have to ensure that our businesses are not saddled with the cost burdens that our competitors do not face, otherwise we will not be able to compete on domestic markets against countries such as New Zealand, let alone expand exports. Without exports and import replacement, how are we going to manage our $172 billion-and growingoffshore debt? How are we going to maintain a reasonable standard of living? How are we going to give our young people job opportunities? This is a budget of despair for Australians in general and rural people in particular. Those ruralÂ· people are as mad as hell, they have had enough and they want it changed. Many of them now have had three or more years of business losses. They gain nothing from this budget except more costs. They look at the dangerous level of government expenditure, coupled with rising inflation, and understandably worry about higher interest rates, which is what crippled so many of them in the first place. The increase in unleaded fuel alone will add close to $20 million to farm costs. The road transport forum says that the hike in the cost of diesel fuel will add $6,000 to the average annual operating costs of a semitrailer and $3 to the average family shopping basket of $70. If we were to assume that the average family outÂ· in the bush buys, say, $140 worth of groceries a week, the increase will be $6. Then add the cost of filling up the family car which, in the bush these days, is usually a six-, sevenor eight-year-old Commodore or Falcon-they are often older-and often has 300,000 or 400,000 kilometres on it these days. Mr Bruce Scott-In the bush the cars are old enough to vote.",48
98,Mr ANDERSON,PAIRS,The cars are old enough to vote; that is right. They would not vote for this lot.,48
99,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! Perhaps the honourable member will address the chair and not the audience.,48
100,Mr ANDERSON,PAIRS,"I beg your pardon, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am at a loss in trying to work out a way to adequately explain the impost of these sorts of changes on rural Australia. When rural families fill up that motor car, it will cost them another $6 to $7 a week, and what are they offered in return? They are offered a $3 a week rebate. That will go a long way. Mr Bruce Scott-It won't even cover the extra cost of food.",49
101,Mr ANDERSON,PAIRS,"That is right. We talk about taxation on food. We hear a lot of selfrighteousness about that issue, and not just from people in this place. We hear it occasionally, and I have to say regrettably, from some of the various policy units-for example, the churches. I would like to know why some of those are not complaining about the increase in taxes on food, because that is what this increase will do. If the tax on diesel is increased, which .is the basic means of getting produce around in this country, the. cost of foodstuffs for Australian families will be increased. It is a tax on food. Where are some of those do-gooders? Mr Forrest-Where is the social conscience now?",49
102,Mr ANDERSON,PAIRS,"Where is it? Are some of them perhaps a little like watermelonsgreen on the outside and red on the inside? So there is little help for rural people in this budget. Looking at the expenditure side, we find only $474 million of Commonwealth funds is out laid for agriculture, forestry and fishing. While the budget actually shows $1.638 billion will be spent, farmers themselves will contribute $723 million in taxes and charges, and $440 million is the diesel fuel rebate-or what remains of it. Of the actual contribution of $474 million, the Department of Primary Industries and Energy uses 20 per cent. It is hard not to conclude that the government is not very serious about cutting its own expenditure. The cost of running DPIE has increased by 111/2 per cent, from $86 million last year to $95 million this year,and we find that, despite reforms in AQIS, its outlays have increased by $18.3 million. The balance of the money for primary industry consists mainly of dollar for dollar research and development grants. So the amount of money the budget shows will be expended on agriculture is really quite misleading, and people need to be aware that we really have taken the brunt, not only of the cost of increases but of outlay deductions over the last few years. We have heard a lot about some of the other direct measures which are going to hit farmers. There will be a tax on wine, and now we hear people opposite saying, 'Maybe this isn't such a good idea. Maybe this is going to hurt some of my constituents. Maybe it is going to wind back on regional development'. Regional development is a very pretty thing to talk about on the government side, so we might see some changes. The tobacco excise is to increase dramatically, and I hope that those opposite will develop a conscience for the people that they are putting out of business-those good, honest tobacco farmers who, through no fault of their own, find that their product is not wanted. They are now regarded increasingly as social lepers, but they have no blame attached to them.",49
103,Mr LLOYD,PAIRS,They are taxed out of existence.,49
104,Mr ANDERSON,PAIRS,"They have been taxed out of existence. Fishermen will be forced to pay 100 per cent of the cost of managing Australia's fisheries instead of the 90 per cent they currently pay. While the diesel fuel rebate is to continue, the government has given clear notice that it will not necessarily rebate the full excise in the future, and of course we now have this 'administration fee'. The government has also failed to sort out the problems of paying superannuation to itinerant workers and fruit-pickers. I suggest that this is a matter which really ought to be attended to as a matter of urgency. ',' I also draw the attention of the House to the serious matter of the failure of the government to provide any more money for wool promotion after the end of this financial year. This is a major worry. The Garnaut report, in common with the overviews of this issue of virtually everybody else in the wool industry, acknowledges the need to do significantly more to boost the standing and sales of, and the demand for, Australian wool. On the backs of very low prices, the wool growers cannot afford to keep funding for promotion at adequate levels. In fact, in the wool industry's hour of great need, we are now spending on the promotion for this magnificent product-a product that, until as recently as three years ago, earned virtually $1 in every $10 of Australia's export dollars-about the same as that spent on promoting Kit Kat internationally. Farmers cannot afford more money. The international processors appear to be stalling and now the government is-I would suggest, very much against the national interest-apparently not prepared to continue funding for wool promotion. Mr Bruce Scott-They have written the bush off.",49
105,Mr ANDERSON,PAIRS,"As the honourable member for Maranoa has pointed out, the government has written the bush off. The budget particularly fails the rural poor. Farm families, who will not only suffer increased costs in their businesses, will also find that they are hard hit in terms of the costs of living. Treasury figures, interestingly enough, show that the self-employed farmer in the lowest income bracket-which is most of them-will be $1.19 a week worse off as a result of the budget. But Tim Colebatch of the Age points out this figure is really pretty laughable. 1\vo weeks ago in the Age, in an article headed 'Treasury tells fairy tales', Mr Colebatch pointed out that the treasury models for these figures left out bracket creep, assumed that everyone drove unleaded carsthose in the bush would all like to drive unleaded or diesel cars if they could get them, but they cost a fair bit of money; in fact, cost more money now than they did a few weeks ago-and implied furthermore that the Australian government would give away $2 billion a year net to Australian households. That assumption', Mr Colebatch said, 'is wrong, and hence Treasury's conclusion that the great majority of households will benefit is likewise wrong'. In addition, from 1 January most farm families with a 16-year-old or 17 - year-old child will lose Austudy of $64.90 a week. This will put in real jeopardy that child's chance, in many instances, to gain a decent education which may be vital in terms of escaping what, for many people, has tragically become a rural povel1y trap. The government suggests that parents can get assistance through the social security additional family payments scheme. It forgets to say that the asset limit for farm families for this benefit is $363,500 rather than Austudy's asset limit for farm families of $734,000. Then we come to question of roads. The roads that country people must travel on and transport their produce, including this nation's much needed export produce-I cannot highlight that enough-will be further neglected as a result of this budget. Despite the huge hike in fuel excise, road funding is being slashed. We are close to the point where, for every $10 collected as excise from motorists and transport networks-including the railway networks. of this country-less than $1 will be returned to road funding. In short, the deal stitched up between the Australian Democrats and the government is nothing but a bandaid for the growing cancer blighting Australian businesses. The government superficially addresses the more obvious points of regressivity but fails absolutely to address the underlying illnesses in our economy. While it apparently took just a few minor changes to the budget to convince the Democrats to sell out and pass it, the coalition believes that the total philosophy of the budget needs changing, because it is currently inappropriate. We must reduce costs on our productive sector so that it can compete abroad and at home against imports. Only they then will businesses start employing the one million Australians out of work. Only then will the sell off of farms, in botil its narrow and broader sense, slow. Only when the situation starts to tum around will we see again the stability and opportunities that the lucky country once offered to all its people. Mr Braithwaite-Get rid of Labor. That's the only way we're going to do that.",50
106,Mr ANDERSON,PAIRS,"That is right. While the government will now toss the poor another dollar a week and not go ahead with a 3c a litre rise on leaded fuel and a few other things such as that until 1995, the increases in fuel and other prices wi11 cost far more. I tum very briefly to another broader issue, however, which goes beyond mere policy matters. Lee Kuan Yew observed some time ago that we were in danger of becoming the poor white trash of Asia. More recently, he commented that culture may be more important than policy in determining a nation's fortunes. Whilst I believe that there are many admirable and likeable things about we Australians as a people, I think he has a good point. We need to change a lot of our attitudes and behavioural patterns in some substantial ways if we are to conquer our nation's serious economic and social problems. Yet our national leadership seems to me to be so appallingly bad-(Ttme expired)",51
107,Unknown,PAIRS,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8.00 p.m.,51
108,Mr ROBERT BROWN,PAIRS,"On budget night, 17 August, the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) presented the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill. This cognate debate deals with that bill and with the Customs Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bi11 and the Excise Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill. The general theme of those three pieces of legislation concerns the deficit reduction process which has been set in train by the government. When the Assistant Treasurer presented the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bil1 on 17 August he emphasised a number of elements of the legislation. These include: the personal tax cuts, the low income rebate, the Medicare levy,. unused annual leave and unused long serviCe leave payments, taxation of credit unions, taxation of friendly societies and other registered organisations, car parking expenses for the self-employed, non-deductible expenses, fringe benefits tax, excess domestic travel and sales tax. The particular provisions intended by the government were identified by the Assistant Treasurer in his second reading speech. Since then a number of changes have been considered by the government and have been accepted. I understand that later, during the committee stage, the government will move a number of amendments to give effect to those changes. The Prime Minister (Mt Keating) and the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) issued a joint statement on 30 August indicating that, as part of those changes, the personal tax cuts which had previously been brought forward to 1 November 1993 would now be delayed until 15 November. They will be delayed for two weeks; previously they had been brought forward eight months. The low income rebate to taxpayers whose taxable income for the 1993-94 and subsequent income years is less than $23,200 is to be increased from $100 to $150. Lump sum payments for unused annual leave and unused long service leave which accrued to 17 August 1993 will continue to attract a concessional rate of tax. There are other adjustments t6 the generalÂ· provisions of the budget and one adjustment to the prQyisions of last year's budget. As a result of concerns that have been expressed by interested groups in the community, the government has taken the opportunity to introduce some changes. It is important for us to realise when considering changes of this kind that government budgets are not just economic packages. If we happened to live in a totalitarian society, they could well be. We happen to live in a liberal democracy, in a social democracy, and we have in government at the present time a social democratic party-the Australian Labor Party. The Labor Party for the 100 years of its existence, if it has done nothing else, has certainly been a political party which has responded to the aspiratiqns and the concern of the Australian people. It is for that reason that the Australian Labor Party has continued to exist for 100 years. As I said on a previous occasion in my contribution to the general debate on the budget, the Australian Labor Party not only is the longest living party in Australia, the party with the longest continuing existence, but it was also the first workers party in the history of the world. Mr Bevis-It was the first workers government in the history of the world.",51
109,Mr ROBERT BROWN,PAIRS,"In fact, the first workers government in the history of the world was in Queensland. It only lasted for six days because it was a composite coalition government. Honourable members will understand the trauma associated with the establishsetting, ment of that government. Those people who had been in government believed that their right to govern would continue forever. Suddenly a government came into existence as a result of a coalition in Queensland and, as the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) quite rightly observed, it was the first said: workers government in the history of the world. All the forces of reaction were brought to bear on that government which lasted for six days. It has been different since then. One of the reasons why the Australian Labor Party has continued to exist as a great social democratic party is that it has been responsive. It has recognised that in the process of economic management and developing budgets at whatever level of government there are also important social and political considerations, important social and political dimensions and imperatives that should be brought to bear on the construction of any financial or economic statements. While ever we live in a liberal democracy that is the way it should be. It is not a sign of weakness or capitulation; it recognition of the political realities and the social imperatives which drive Labor Party governments and which provide, to a very large extent, our motivation. people in countries like Australia do have the opportunity through their party political representatives, through opposing and competing political parties, the media, pressure groups and sectional interests of various kinds, to influence the management of the public sector. But while it is important that government, in the construction of its budget and in modifications built into that budget, does respond to circumstances of that kind, the integrity of the budgeti-self needs to be maintained. It needs to be responsive to economic circumstances. It needs to be coherent, comprehensive and consistent. It needs to reflect the government's general approach to public sector management and to economic policy. Increasingly, a budget needs to indicate the direction of government policy to provide greater certainty to the community about what direction the government intends to take, what sort of goals it is what type of considerations underpin those concerns and those approaches. The government needs to provide clear indications about what it hopes to achieve over time. That is what this legislation is about-a deficit reduction program. In connection with taxation, the Treasurer In tenns of meeting the deficit reduction of about 1 per cent of GOP, there will be no fiscal imperative on us to raise taxes further. In the light of present circumstances, that provides a fairly clear statement of the attitude of this government towards general taxation levels. Concerning outlays, the Prime Minister said: . Let me make it quite clear: we are not cutting outlays any further ... because it's irresponsible, it's indecent, it's unfair and it's just not smart. It is important to emphasise that the Prime Minister was not talking about the detail of outlays but about their general level. Any government, from one year toanother, will bring about adjustments in the general prioriis a ties that it accords different programs and areas of spending. The Prime Minister also indicated subsequently that he was talking about the general level of outlays. The government's commitment towards the deficit reduction involves a commitment to reduce the budget deficit to one per cent of GOP by 1996-97; that is, to less than $6 billion compared with the $15 billion that it would otherwise have been. That involves a $9 billion cut between now and 1996-97. a While the government has established that as its general direction and commitment, there is no way in the world that we Clln forecast with any certainty what the deficit would be in 1996-97. What we can do is precisely what we have done; that is, to indicate a direction and an objective, and establish a principle. That is what this legislation will do. It may be that as time proceeds it will be necessary to modify or update the objectives each year in the light of changing circumstances and forecasts. If we examine the results of government deficit forecasts over the last few years it becomes apparent that, while it is possible very frequently to have the deficit very close to the forecast, it would be fortuitous in the extreme to have the realised deficit exactly the same as-or even close to-the forecast deficit. For example, in the 1990 budget a surplus was forecast of $8.1 billion. The result was a surplus of $1.9 billion-a fairly significant discrepancy. In the 1991 budget the deficit was forecast at $4.7 billion; the result was $9.3 billion. In last year's budget the deficit was forecast at $13.4 billion and it turned out to be about $14.6 billion-which was not too far out except that during that period the deficit had been revised to $15.9 billion. Governments can provide budgets and future indications as a fairly clear indication to the community about what they are doing. It is important to make sure that the degree of flexibility retained by the government is not constrained to any significant extent. Just recently, the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Bernie Fraser, is reported to have said: One lesson that has been hammered home to me over the years is that policy flexibility is defence against shocks of various kinds ... It is a simple lesson but, in economics as in other fields, the simple lessons are often the last to be learned. The government has indicated its general commitment, direction and purposes in order to provide a greater degree of certainty for the business community and, I suppose, to satisfy the concerns of the markets. That is part of the reality with which we live. In the absence of that greater degree of certainty, the markets may well have responded more erratically. ;1 indicated eariier that some of the changes to the general provisions in this legislation were part of a group of modifications which were negotiated and announced by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer on 30 August. About a week ago, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer stated that there would be an increase in the rebate for low income earners from $100 to $150 each year. I agree with that; I endorse, welcome and applaud it. They also said there would be a reduction in the differential between leaded and unleaded fuel from 5c a litre to 2c a litre. That was to be achieved by deleting the 3c rise in leaded fuel proposed in the budget-another provision which I applaud and welcome. People having eye tests will continue to be eligible for Medicare rebates. I agree and welcome that measure. Unused long service leave lump sum payments that were accrued up to 17 August 1993 will continue to attract a concessional rate of tax. Other changes have been announced separately. The retrospective element of the unrealised capital gains on shares for pension entitlement purposes has been removed as well. While the amount might not be great, it is important that the government do that to keep faith with people who clearly had made decisions concerning their retirement on the basis of the provisions as they existed before. There was an element of unfairness in making retrospective decisions which, in some cases, would cause people who had made their retirement plans on the basis of what they expected to realise to be thousand of dollars behind. The combined effect of those measures that the best the Prime Minister and the Treasurer announcedis that the prospective addition to the deficit for 1996-97 will be in the order of $380 million. So, instead of the deficit being 1.1 per cent of GDP, it will rise to 1.2 per cent of GDP. I have not heard any responsible commentator suggesting that that represents a significant departure from or betrayal of the government's previous undertaking. I mentioned recently that for the first time in the history of the Commonwealth it was this Labor government which, during the 1980s, budgeted for surpluses and realised surpluses. In 1987-88. for example, the surplus came in at $2,061 million. In 1988-89, it oame in at $5.890 million. In 1989-90, it came in at $8,036 million. In 1990-91, it came in at $1,907 million. That is a total, over those four years, of $17,894 million. That made it possible for the Commonwealth government to reduce Commonwealth government securities on issue; that is, Commonwealth government sector debt, from $49,000 million to $34,000 million. I would have much preferred to see the economic circumstances which gave rise to the government's being able to exercise fiscal restraint and budget for surpluses continue so that the government debt could have been reduced further. But we took advantage of the opportunity provided by economic growth to secure those surpluses-as the Prime Minister said, to bank them-and, when they were required for fiscal stimulation such as the government is involved in at present, to use them. These have been important considerations by the government. The particular and overriding consideration of this legislation is contained within the expression 'deficit reduction'. Where we have a freed-up financial market, as we have in Australia, and markets responding with various degrees of volatility-I agree with the Prime Minister that to a very large extent that has been in response to the attitude of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and the opposition generally of trying to destabilise financial markets and put pressure on the dollar-it is important for the government to make a very clear declaration of its intentions and purposes and a clear commitment about the direction it intends to take. The government has done that with this legislation.",52
110,Mr MCARTHUR,PAIRS,"I am pleased to see that myoId adversary, the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), has revised his speech since his attack on the Fraser government. Now the tables are turned and he is trying to defend the indefensible in the present government's budget legislation. I wonder where the honourable member for Charlton, the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), who is at the table, and their other colleagues were when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was on the burning deck alone campaigning during the last election, as he so clearly said on Sunday morning? Where was the honourable member for Charlton when the people were walking around with the old hea<;l bowed towards the guillotine? That is exactly what the Prime Minister said. I wonder what the honourable member for Charlton was doing during that week and how he is getting on now defending this budget which is indefen-- . This government has come to power by some stroke of luck, and this has been admitted by the Prime Minister and others. Those opposite have no policy. They had a position of no increases in either direct or indirect taxes. This budget has not been accepted in any quarter. These taxes have increased and the government does not know where it is. Time magazine last week hit the nail on the head when it said that its public opinion poll found that this budget was regarded by Australians surveyed as the worse in 15 years. Was the honourable membt<r for Charlton aware of that as he walked around his electorate and talked to the people there? The opposition and minor partiesMr Robert Brown- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. As you know, it is grossly disorderly for people to interject. In order to avoid interjection, I ask you to prevail upon the honourable member speaking now and ask him not to invite responses from me which would make my behaviour disorderly and which I know would cause you to call me to order.",54
111,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,There is no point of order.,54
112,Mr MCARTHUR,PAIRS,"I was just inqulflng about the honourable member's popularity in his electorate in recent weeks after this budget was brought down. He is not too keen to respond on that issue. However, the opposition and minor parties, business and community groups have called for changes to be made. A large number of backbenchers, whose electorate offices have had telephone calls from so-called true believers around Australia who were misled on the policies and the attitudes of the government when they voted for it on 13 March, have called for changes to be made. Michael Easson-his wife, the honourable member for Lowe (Mrs Easson), is a member of this House-described the long service leave changes as an act of bastardry. No doubt he is fairly close to the scene of power as his wife is on the government benches. The honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), the President of the Australian Labor Party, whose electorate is just down the road from Corangamite, said that the Prime Minister had not been exercising what was normally good political judgment. The honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore), who is a well-known supporter of the government, said that the hostile reaction from his Labor backbench colleagues in caucus to the budget was the angriest and most determined exercise of power that he had seen in his 17 years in the parliament. These are the comments of a fairly careful observer of the Labor Party in action. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), known for his independent view, said that the increases in fuel excise were highly discriminatory against rural Australia, especially his own electorate of Kalgoorlie. I would agree entirely with him on that matter. The honourable member for Forde (Mrs Crawford) agreed with the honourable member for Kalgoorlie about the increases in fuel excise on the same day. To cap it all off, on Monday the honourable member for Greenway (Mr Gonnan) accused the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) of being out of touch and suggested that they should spend some time on the back bench. I think he suggested that they should have a holiday just to catch up with what was going on around the electorate. It is a great pity for the Australian people that they did not take the advice that had been flowing into government members' offices and to the opposition; we have been hearing it from every quarter. The Treasurer always said that the budget was not negotiable, but, as he found, the reality in the Senate is that he has had to negotiate a number of times and make adjustments, and we see these flowing through from time to time to this House. The government says that the budget now reflects the concerns of Australians about its initial presentation. This is absolute nonsense, as we all know. These bills should not be called deficit reduction bills but tax increase because this budget will be part of a strategy that will deliver the Labor government an additional $32 billion in tax revenue over the next four years. This compares with only $5.2 billion extra over the last four years. If we do the figures we can see that with bracket creep the government is really going to increase its revenue take. Yet the Prime Minister had the gall to say, not long ago, in November 1992: What I'm promising is not to put up tax ... He went to the people on that. These bills may have been altered in style but certainly not in substance. Australia still has this massive national debt of about $172 billion, and the government is very careful to avoid any reference to that startling statistic which imposes on the living standards of every Australian. We have a budget that has, as a starting point, a deficit of almost $23 billion, not the $16 billion claimed by the government. Australia is in a worse position today than it was in the terrible Whitlam era some 20 years ago. The revenue from asset sales has not come to fruition on the promised amounts suggested over the last four years. The promised profits from the Reserve Bank of $3 billion are huge in dollar tenns, but the way the dollar has been falling in recent days, the Reserve Bank might need to use those reserves to prop it up. We still have a budget which the Treasurer says is a budget for jobs; however, in the fine print we know that the budget is estimating that unemployment will remain at 10.75 per cent. That is very much the same as it is today. The budget talks about giving extra assistance to small and medium sized exporters, and yet at the same time loads these enterprises with new costs in the fonn of additional sales tax, fuel excise and changes to fringe benefits taxes. We still have a budget that will result in Australia's low level of business investment-I7 out of the 24 advanced industrialised nations-remaining at this poor figure. The investment possibilities in Australia under the present Labor government are an indictment of the government. Australia needs more investment so that the community can bills, earn more and so that more jobs can be provided for Australia's one million unemployed. The budget will not alter the low growth, high unemployment recession that Australia has been locked into, partially because of worldwide conditions-I concede that-but more due to the failure of this government to address the real reforms that would improve Australia's mediumand long-term economic position. The budget says that the economy will grow this year by 2.75 per cent. Unemployment will apparently remain very much the same at 103/4 per cent. Yet it was .the Prime Minister who said on 31 March 1992: If we cannot make 4 per cent growth a year, the whole lot of us ought to give the game away ... That was his view about the time of the One Nation statement being introduced and implemented. He was very optimistic that the four per cent was achievable. The key to Australia's future is to try to build a solid foundation by achieving in our own way what the thrift-oriented nations of the Asia-Pacific have. I was particularly interested in the comments of a respected commentator and planner, Phillip Ruthven, in a letter in today's Australian Financial Review, when he covered this matter very well. He said: But a visit to the thrift-oriented nations of Pacific would be my prime recommendation. The four pillars on which they have built their stunning success (and we once did a long long time ago) are: thrift, vision, focus, and productivity. None of these are in evidence in Australia, beginning with the first mentioned. By that he means there is no thrift, no investment and no real savings that Australians can invest to make those jobs available. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer have repeatedly sought to misrepresent the opposition's position. The opposition has always favoured tax cuts. That was our position before the election; that is our position now. The Australian people deserve tax cuts, even more so now that the secretary to the Treasury, Mr Ted Evans, has confirmed to a Senate estimates committee that his department's analysis of the budget changes has made no allowance for the effects of insidious bracket creep. This inflationary effect is set to add about $4 billion to the amount of income tax paid by Australians in the next four years to 1996-97. Bracket creep is one of the terrible factors involved in the whole taxation structure in Australia, as hard working Australians move up into the next tax bracket. I am pleased that the Secretary to the Treasury has confirmed that by 1996-97 Australians will be paying more tax, not less. Retail spending is a pretty good barometer of the Australian economy. Since 1990 the amount Australians are spending has increased in real terms by only 2.2 per cent. The economy remains in a slump. This will worsen if Australians are forced to pay every cent of these extra taxes. The alternative is for the government to be a good housekeeper in tough times, examine its own expenditure proposals and cut down on expenditure, rather than increasing taxation. With the Prime Minister's repeated assurances before and during the election campaign that there would be no new taxes if the Labor Party were elected, the opposition cannot support some of the measures in this bill. The opposition is not in favour of an increase in sales tax of two per cent, with the exception of that on luxury cars. The opposition will not support increases in sales tax .charged on wine from 20 per cent to an eventual 32 per cent. the AsiaSome commentators have overlooked the fact that it is not just a 10 per cent increase but an extra two per cent that is being slipped in over the next couple of years. We will also not support the 5c aÂ· litre increase in the price of unleaded petrol and the 7c a litre increase in the price of leaded petrol from the proposed increases in excise. The opposition will not support the extra tax that will be charged retrospectively on accrued annual leave. The budget's changes to fringe benefits tax have the potential to send Australian conference delegates overseas. We have heard from the hotel industry exactly what that will do to it. The Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) claimed today that the opposition's decision to vote against these four measuresÂ· was setting a very dangerous precedent. I do not . agree with that and the oppcsition does not agree with it. The Labor Party ha"" been very keen to vote against these measures historically in the Senate and, given half a chance, it would vote against us in government. To put that into perspective, whilst we are voting against four measures, that accounts for only $1.5 billion out of a total budget of about $115 billion. So we are in fact supporting 98.5 per cent of the government's budget proposals. The opposition's stance is responsible against a government which has acted irresponsibly in framing this budget against the election promises it put forward prior to 13 March. The government claims that the analysis of Treasury shows that the vast majority of Australians will be better off as a result of this budget. On Wednesday, Dr Neil Warren of the University of New South Wales, in relation to what the reality is, said: . . . you don't get all these people being winners and only a few people being losers ... That is the reality, and the government knows it. Dr Warren suggested that many people would be only a few cents ahead if any analysis went back from 1996-97 to today and accounted for the bracket creep of higher tax rates, which would be even more significant now that inflation is expected to rise to 3.5 per cent next year. All these bills are under a cloud, and the basis of these taxation measures being put forward is being challenged by intelligent commentators. If the government is seeking to impose taxation, under section 55 of Australia's constitution it cannot deal with more than one subject of taxation. So again we see a government trying to overcome the difficulties in the Senate by putting the taxation and revenue measures in one bill. This bill not only deals with more than a single taxation proposal, but also it includes both income and expenditure proposals. The opposition's legal advice from Colin Howard and others suggests that the legislation could well be found to be invalid by the High Court if it were to be challenged. The Australian Taxation Office's legislative services group was similarly concerned about this before the Bill was even drafted. It will be very interesting to see the conclusions of the Senate committee that is inquiring into the legality of the bill before the House. Even with the foreshadowed amendments to the bill, the government admits that its supposed original target of a budget deficit of one per cent in 1996-97 will now not be met. The key plank of what the Treasurer and the Prime Minister have been saying is that they will reduce the budget deficit to one per cent. They now say that it will be 1.2 per cent. Given their previous forecasting record, this would be very optimistic indeed. Like all their arrangements, they talk about tax cuts in the future. The second group of tax cuts will be in the never-never., Who will be in government? It will not be the current Prime Minister, that is for sure. The government is offering a pie in the sky tax cut arrangement. The government's credibility is in tatters on the world's financial markets because of its abject failure to stop yet another rise in government expenditure this year. The much heralded tax cuts, which were l-a-w during the election campaign, have been put off for two weeks, which has quite an impact on the government's final arrangements. Not only that, the government is suggesting that lower income earners are only second-class citizens because this group has to wait until it puts tax returns into get its $100. But the government was very kind to lower income earners. It now gives them $150. It is so good of the parliamentary secretary to make that adjustment. After they have paid their tax and put in their tax returns the government will give them back $150, just to keep the backbench and the parliamentary secretary, who is at the table, happy.",54
113,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Order! I hate to interrupt the honourable member for Corangamite, but I want to let him know that he must in tenns of the standing orders refer to members by their correct titles. He is in fact the Assistant Treasurer.",57
114,Mr MCARTHUR,PAIRS,"Well he is even more responsible, Mr Speaker. He has even more responsibility to give those low income earners more than $150. It is almost fraud. I know that we are not supposed to use that term in this place, but it is very close to misrepresenting the truth-the way in which some of the tax rearrangements have been made to give an extra $50 just ,to keep the politics right. The bottom 20 per cent of income earners in Australia spend about 3.1 per cent of their income on petrol and the next 20 per cent spend about 3.6 per cent. In contrast, the top fifth of income earners spend only 2.7 per cent. So we see from those figures that the government has also attacked the low income earners in the way in which it has increased fuel tax excise in this last budget measure. Government members are making it difficult . for their own constituency-the low income earners and those persons who are driving the older motor cars. This is just another good example of a government which claims it has the compassion but has no capacity to put that rhetoric into practice. The deficit reduction bill-what a marvellous name-could' have been called the government's increase of debt bill. We find that the savings the government is seeking to make in this deficit reduction bill will not be met. On 19 August, Dr Vince FitzGerald, who is the government's guru, said in the Age: ... the government feels that it's getting to the stage on' cutting outlays where there's not a lot more that can be done. I don't th ink that's He is in fact saying that the government should be making greater cuts to get its budget in order. The lack of government resolve in really cutting expenditure might be brushed aside by the government members and the Treasurer, but the financial markets and the Australian community are very awake to the government's position. Over the last 48 hours, the money markets have given an indication of the world's view on Australia's current financial position. In its September issue, the Australian Business magazine released a poll of 300 accountants which found that almost 40 per cent of the respondents found Australia an unattractive investment destination. What was even more worrying was that the percentage was higher for accountants of foreign companies. Perhaps that explains why such companies as Gillette and Johnson and Johnson are now supplying Australia from New Zealand; that is because of the investment climate here and the uncertainty created by this government in the budget bills before the House. Finally, the government's treatment of accrued long service leave and annual leave amazes this side of the House. We are absolutely surprised that a Labor government would treat its own true believers in the work force in that manner: overnight to place a tax, in a retrospective fashion, on the accrued long service leave and annual leave of those persons who have worked long and hard in an expectation that they would receive these benefits. The opposition will condemn and vote vigorously against not only the thesis involved but the retrospective nature of this measure and the fact that the government would even contemplate such a measure that would hit its own supporters so hard.",57
115,Mr BEVIS,PAIRS,"It is a pleasure to support the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill in this chamber and, in doing so, to take the opportunity to .Iook at some of the broader economic perspectives-some of the big picture questions-in relation to the economy. When I listen to the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur) and other opposition speakers, I am reminded of true. the comments which the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) made in the post-budget luncheon at the National Press Club. He referred to the fact that there are some people in Australiaand in this debate-who would like to see us adopt the sort of tax rates applicable in Hong Kong; there are some others who would like to see us adopt the sort of services available in Sweden; there is a third group that wants to do both at the same time. When we listen to the debate in this chamber, and to the comments those opposite have made outside it, the opposition fits pretty squarely into that third group. On the one hand, the opposition attacks measures designed to raise revenue and reduce the deficit, whilst on the other hand it cries crocodile tears about the impost that some of thoseÂ· measures create for some Australians and about many of the services which the opposition at the last election undertook to either reduce or abolish altogether. I will come to some of those measures shortly. I want to look at some of the broader questions in relation to the budget, the deficit which is contained in it, and the government's program to reduce that deficit over the next three years. The budget provides for a deficit in this financial year of approximately 3.8 per cent of gross domestic product. That compares favourably with recent budgets. In last year's budget we had a deficit of 3.6 per cent. The budget proposes that by 1996-97 the deficit will be reduced to 1.2 per cent of GOP. That is an attainable target, and it is one which most countries around the world with whom we want to compare ourselves would be green with envy to achieve. The 1993 OECO figures show comparable countries with central government budget deficits of a similar magnitude to that of the Australian government. In the latest OECD outlook for June this year, the United States has a projected central government deficit of 5 per cent; Japan, 2.1 per cent; Germany, 2.4 per cent; France, 4.7 per cent; Italy, a whopping 10.5 per cent; the 'UK-a government which has been in conservative hands for over a decade, run by the sorts of fundamentalist right wing policies that the opposition took to the last election-has a deficit of 8 per cent; and Canada, 3.4 per cent. Against that, we measure our performance in the last financial year with a budget deficit of 3.6 per cent, and a projected deficit in this budget of 3.8 per cent. A simple cursory look at those figures demonstrates the responsible fiscal management that this Labor government has put in place in managing our economy. It is little wonder that we are in a better position than most of those countries to which I have referred, because it was not that long ago that we returned a surplus budget. In fact, the Labor government with the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) as Treasurer returned four surplus budgets. Some people on the opposition might say, 'So what?'. The facts of life are that they happen to be the only four surplus budgets this nation has had from its central government. In all the years that the Liberal Party was in office since it was formed by Bob Menzies, it did not have a surplus budget on a single, solitary occasion. It should be remembered that we are talking about the period of the post-war boom':-of the 1950s and 1960swhen the going was pretty easy economically. We did not have to be too clever to run an economy in growth mode. Throughout that period of enormous growth in the 1950s and the 1960s, when Bob Menzies and the lazy Liberals ran the country, not once did they manage to get a surplus when they were on the treasury bench of our national parliament. The Liberal Party's track record gives it no credibility in any debate about macro-economic policy. As Fightback demonstrated last year, when it comes to talking about microeconomic policy and social welfare, the views of the Liberal Party are still well and truly out of kilter with what Australians want. I would also like to draw the House's attention to the fact that we are this year reducing the percentage of GOP which the government is taking in taxes. We are actually reducing the tax revenue as a percentage of gross domestic product. This year the budget papers project it to be at 23.5 per cent of GOP; last year it was 23.6 per centfractionally higher. In 1991-92 it was a little bit higher again at 24.1 per cent. What did the Liberal Party do in its last budget? The last time it had the opportunity to put into place the sort of rhetoric which those opposite now find convenient to toss around was in the 1982-83 budget. The last Liberal budget had a tax revenue percentage of GOP of 26.1 per cent-2.6 per cent more of the economy sucked up in taxes. Still the opposition could not manage to run a surplus, even with that extra slice of the cake. The Liberal Party managed to spend more than it took in. This government has demonstrated a degree of fiscal responsibility that the Liberals were never able to manage. That is recognised around the world and it is recognised in the international markets, even if it is not recognised by the opposition. As the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), who is at the table, commented earlier, today Standard and Poor's confirmed Australia's AA rating. I think even more important than the AA rating was its forecast for the future which went from being a negative forecast to a stable forecast for the Australian economy. That is something in which I think the government and the people of Australia can take some comfort. If those opposite had any genuine concern for the state of the economy and the interests of those whom they claim to represent, they might try to share some of the limelight for that good achievement. This morning on the AM radio program one of the chief spokespersons for Standard and Poor's in Australia was commenting about the uncertain economic environment within which Australia operates, and he was talking about the decision to maintain our AA rating. He said this morning on the ABC's AM radio program: ... if you look at Australia in terms of its internapaying tional competitiveness today, even especially taking into account the recent further fall in the exchange rate, Australian exporters are about as competitive as one could possibly hope for to deal with that type of uncertain economic environment and that shows up in the fairly healthy growth of exports that we have seen over the last several years. That was the comment this morning from Standard and Poor's on the performance of this government in preparing Australia to be internationally competitive. The honourable member for Corangamite found it convenient to paraphrase the Prime Minister's pledge to the people of Australia about not increasing taxes. As a diligent member of this House who listens carefully in question time, I am sure he would be aware that the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), raised this matter in the House on 17 August in a question to the Prime Minister. The que!!tion was answered by the Prime Minister. For the benefit of the honourable member for Corangamite, who may not have caught it at the time; let me repeat the answer that the Prime Minister gave. I will repeat the full sentence, not that part of the sentence which happened to suit the purposes of the opposition at the time. The Prime Minister said: ... to maintain the tax to GDP ratios we roughly have at the moment. In other words, what I am promising is not to put up tax. That is in fact the full context in which the Prime Minister made the statement. I have already pointed out that not only has the Prime Minister honoured that pledge in this budget; we have in fact brought in a revenue take less than it was last year. It is unfortunate that the honourable member for Corangamite missed that answer during question time a week or so ago. Importantly, these bills provide for income tax cuts which were promised by the government before the last election, and were in fact legislated for prior to the last election. As I said on one other occasion, they are wholly appropriate, and I endorse the government's decision to provide those income tax cuts. Those cuts provide significant benefits to middle Australia. These people on incomes between $20,700 and $36,000 were previously a tax rate of 38 per cent. Their composite rate for 1993-94 will fall to 35.5 per cent. Those people in the income bracket of $36,000 to $38,000 were previously required to pay tax at a marginal rate of 46 per cent. In this financial year that will fall to 38.5 per cent. Those on an income between $38,000 and $50,000 per annum were previously paying tax at 46 per cent, and that will fall to 44.125 per cent in this financial year. When looking at those figures we should have some appreciation of what an average wage is. We all know that the average weekly earnings figure can distort the situation in many households, but it is probably as useful a figure as we have for the purposes of these debates. Average weekly earnings for all malesMr MCArthur-You're drawing a long bow there.",58
116,Mr BEVIS,PAIRS,I might say that is not a problem of who is in office. It happens to be a problem of the measurement-it is simply not an ideal measurement. Mr MCArthur-A long bow.,60
117,Mr BEVIS,PAIRS,"Average weekly earnings for all males currently stand at $612.50 per week. That is just under $32,000 per annum. When we talk of those people in that tax bracket of $20,000 to $38,000-and they are the major beneficiaries of this income tax reduction-we are talking very much about middle Australia, about those people who are on average weekly earnings or a little bit above or a little bit below. They are the people these bills seek to provide significant assistance to. I am pleased to support those changes. I am also pleased to note that the government is lifting the ceiling for that middle income bracket from $36,000 to $38,000, and that will provide some buffer against the bracket creep to which the honourable member for Corangamite referred. It actually addresses that problem for those people on average weekly earnings who may have otherwise crept over the limit, and it will ensure that they will continue tial benefits in reduced taxation from the measures contained in this evening's bills. It has been a long-held commitment of the Labor government and the Labor Party to ensure that there is a redistribution of wealth and to ensure that those people in the greatest need are also looked after. That feature is contained in this bill, in the budget and in related bills, in a number of ways. It also has to be recognised, though, that this bill and this budget are in the context of policy over the last decade, and that policy has seen a massive improvement in the facilities, services and financial assistance available to low income Australians. I will mention a couple of those to illustrate the point. The family alIowance supplement, now operating under another name, which this government introduced provides up to $43 per child per week tax free to low income Australian families. A family with three children can receive up to $130 per week untaxed to assist it to meet the necessary costs of bringhave ing up a family. If the family is renting accommodation, it can receive up to an additional $42 per week to assist with its rental costs. A family on a low income of, say, $20,000 to $23,000 per annum with three children, and renting a house, will receive, under our government, by decisions we took long ago, $172 per week tax free. These are measures we put in place in previous budgets which the opposition opposed and attacked at the time. It should not be forgotten that prior to the last election the opposition had a policy-as distinct from now when it has no policy but only has revenge and guilt as its main motivation-which would have seen not just government outlays cut but a chainsaw taken to the budget. In fact, I recall that after the last budget speech in the previous parliament the Leader of the Opposition put quite plainly on the table his desire to see $7,000 million cut out of government expenditure in that financial year. Of course, - hose opposite were going to abolish Medicare and do alI the other things they undertook to do; quite obviously that would be the only way those sorts of savings to get substan- could be generated. Other measures have been included in the budget which have assisted low income families. In that respect I think the Prime Minister's comments in question time on 1 September illustrate the point quite well. .I will quickly quote from one part of that statement when the Prime Minister pointed out: . Between March 1983 and July 1993, just over 10 years, a process worker-the lowest paid level of the metals award-who was married with two children, experienced an increase in real disposable income of 14.9 per cent; that is, 14.9 per cent real above adjustment for inflation. The Prime Minister used a number of other examples in question time that day to illustrate the point, and that reinforces the comments I made a moment ago. Earlier the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) lamented the propensity on this side of the House to refer to the OECO. One of the reasons we do that is that it happens to the statistical data to use. He seemed upset that we did not compare ourselves with New Zealand often enough. So let us look at New Zealand for a moment, and look at the tax revenue as a percentage of GOP. The OECO's most recent report shows that Australia is now the lowest taxed country in the OECO as expressed by total tax revenue as a percentage of GOP. That puts us somewhere around the 28 to 29 per cent tax rate mark. If we look at New Zealand for comparison purposes, as suggested by the honourable member for Fadden, we find its tax revenue is not the 28 to 29 per cent that Australia has; its tax revenue is of the order of 36 to 38 per cent-well above the Australian level. That brings me to the next issue I want to raise-the question of petrol. Petrol prices are an important matter and of concern to a lot of people. It might be useful and illustrative to look at a comparison between Australia's petrol price and that of New Zealand. The last time these surveys were conducted they showed that the price of leaded petrol in Australia was 66.8c and, because there was no differential at that time, unleaded petrol was the same. For comparison purposes, in New Zealand the price of leaded petrol at that same time was 78c, nearly 12c more, and the price of unleaded petrol was 75c. Why was there a difference? There was a difference because in New Zealand there is an additional charge on leaded petrol. In fact, there is a difference there of 3c per litre, and that is less than the price difference that this government proposes. If the comparison with New Zealand does not meet with the approval of those opposite, perhaps we should look back to mother England, back to Thatcher's policies and back to all that those opposite hold dear. At the same time the survey shows that leaded petrol was $1 and 8.8c per litre in the United Kingdom, whilst unleaded petrol was $1 even per litre. That is right; there was a price differennately, tial of 8.8c between leaded and unleaded petrol in the United Kingdom. Are these the sorts of conservative policies or outcomes to which those opposite want to commit themselves, given that they seem keen to commit themselves to a lot of other things that emanate from these conservative governments? I want to acknowledge what I believe are important improvements in the budget papers. The changes to the long service leave tax on accrued long service leave are welcome. The important continued inclusion of eye tests within Medicare was widely supported in the community and fits very comfortably with the Labor Party's traditional policy platform. I note. that the government's changed handling of shares. held by pensioners has also been well received in the community without in any way diminishing the overall economic responsibility of the budget.",60
118,Mr CADMAN,PAIRS,"Mitchell) (9.01 p.m.)Until this afternoon nobody knew what budget mark 2 was going to be like. Nobody except perhaps a few ministers and some favoured caucus members knew what deal had been settled between the government and the Australian Democrats. Until this afternoon nobody knew what provisions the legislation would contain on the taxing of long service leave, the taxing of accrued holiday payor any of the other matters that were under debate and negotiation between the government and the Democrats. This afternoon we saw the legislation. We have just heard the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) acclaim the budget as if it were something that was devised by the most gifted and brilliant economist and delivered by the best public relations men and actors that Australia could find. That is far from the truth because government members are a bunch of actors but they delivered a lemon. It took outcries from the caucus and the Democrats before the government would listen. Five or six months ago the coalition parties presented to the Australian people their ideas of what should happen in Australia. Unfortuthe Australian people rejected those ideas. Goodness me, the Australian people would like an election today to have another go at that.",62
119,Mr GEAR,PAIRS,No; you would.,62
120,Mr CADMAN,PAIRS,"I believe that the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) would go for a row. We would not see him again because government members would be thrown out of this place, as the Australian people are sick and tired of the lies that the government told not only about the opposition's policies but also about its own policies. Here we see the remains of the budget. It is still not completed. We do not yet know what the Greens are going to do to the budget. When will we get edition 3? There might even be another edition after that. Is this not an amazing thing? It just seems like the American congress where the budget is dealt with for a protracted period of maybe 12 months. I hope that is not the circumstance here, but it could well be another month or two before we know the shape and the size of the budget, before we can Â·understand and before people can plan their future. Tonight we are debating the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill, the Customs Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bi11 and the Excise Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bi11 that are connected to the tax raising part of the budget; they are all aimed at reducing the so-called deficit by raising. taxes. Is this not a briIIiant bit of juggling? The government raises a whole bunch of taxes here and gives them out there as the tax cuts that are l-a-w. What does the government do? It just makes it more difficult for the battler. The government does not achieve much for the battlers of Australia. The government was worried about its election promises, so it brought them forward, gave people half of the promises, did a bit of a juggle around and blew the deficit out to around $16 112 billion, maybe $17 112 billion. Most commentators think the deficit is really $17 112 billion because one has to allow for the bit of extra inflationary pressure as a result of the One Nation statement or the last budget. On 26 February 1992 the government said something that is now impacting on our budget. I think it was the One Nation statement. So that inflationary factor-a bit of growth factor-is following through into this budget. So it is probably a real deficit of about $17 112 billion. And we are dealing with the legislation tonight. How can anybody plan anything in these circumstances? This budget document is changed by the day. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) are courting the favours of the Democrats. The government has really lost any sense of direction. It does not know either where it wants to head or where it wants the nation to go. The overseas market has shown its lack of confidence in the government and in the government's ability to govern properly. The Prime Minister and the Treasuter have produced a budget which has caused an uproar in every sector of the Australia community and the Australian dollar has taken a hammering. That takes some doing. That sort of result shows great incompetence. While the budget looks solid, it is wobbling like a blancmange. It has wobbled so much that in fact it has fallen apart. Tonight we have something in writing at last. But how long will this stick? Assessing the amendments to these taxation deficit reduction bills, one can see that the deal done with the Democrats really has brought forward the period in which the excise on leaded fuel will be raised. It has brought it forward six months from February 1995 to August 1994. So, under this proposal, people will have to pay more sooner; yet there is supposed to be a whole bunch of equities in there for everybody. I just do not know how the sums work out. But the government is paying for it somehow. It is not surprising when one considers the prevatications presented by the ALP leading up to the March election. There was no accountability then and there is none now. One wonders whether the ALP and the truth are just mutually exclusive-one can never get them together. It was the commissioner who talked about the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding), who was then the deputy leader in Victoria, describing him as having a greater affiliation to his party than to the truth, which I think is interesting. Here we see it repeated in the J:Iouse and in the budget. Fascinating stuff! In the 1993-94 budget, the Treasurer is dealing with the deficit by spending about $114 billion while raising $99 billion. The Treasurer plans to increase his deficit, not decrease it. So we see a jump in the amount of money that Australians owe. Optimistically, Budget Paper No. 1 mentions national savings to assist in lowering the deficit. The Treasurer should consider the level of unemployment which is eating away at the forced savings incurred by the superannuation guarantee levy. As unemployment increases the level of savings through this avenue will drop. Both FitzGerald in his report on savings, National Savings, and the National Fiscal Outlook report released at the Premiers Conference earlier this year say that the federal government cannot proceed with its income tax cuts and concurrently have the financial markets believe its target of reducing the federal deficit to one per cent of GDP in 1996-97. It just cannot be done. In fact, FitzGerald says that the one per cent deficit target is barely adequate. That is what a Labor Party prepared report says; and, given certain parameters, that is the report prepared for the government by Dr Vince FitzGerald. He makes the statement that the government's targets are barely adequate. Some slight changes in the level of inflation, a drop-off growth or something unexpected like that-in fact, a lot of factors could change it-will make that target impossible to achieve. The Treasurer has accused the Liberal Party of Australia of adopting the attitude, 'To hell with the deficit'. Mr Beers of Standard and Poor's, a source from which the government was quoting today in support of its policy, distinctly says the coalition is not advocating an increase in the deficit. No party in AustralDemocrats is is. We certainly are not advocating an increase in the deficit. This is just another attempt by the Treasurer to divert attention from the charade of 17 August. The Prime Minister has gone to great lengths to attack the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) on comments he made in regard to changes to Fightback and the GST. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer are guilty of pledging tax cuts that they could not deliver and have affirmed their intention not to change or negotiate the budget mark 1, and yet here we are debating something that they said would never happen and on which they would never negotiate. To think that they had Lachlan Payne the hide and the effrontery .to talk about some modest changes to Fightback, the best, most extensive document yet prepared by a coalition going into an election.",62
121,Dr THEOPHANOUS,PAIRS,"He wanted to stick with it next time, did he?",64
122,Mr CADMAN,PAIRS,"It was the government that intentionally told mistruths in order to be re-elected. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services (Dr Theophanous), who is in the chamber, was part of that. That was most regrettable because I thought he was a man of greater integrity. I am sure that in his own electorate he. would not have repeated some of the things that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer were saying. It was the government that irresponsibly decided to bundle all the taxation legislation together now wants a rubber stamp on it. The Prime Minister does not like being on the receiving end. He pledged to vote for the GST if the coalition were elected, thereby nullifying the votes of Australians who did not want the GST. That was totally irresponin sible. Now he is attacking the Leader of the Opposition and the coalition for the stand they have taken on the part of half the Australian community. Australians were all told that there would be no new taxes, that there would be $8 a week for the textile, clothing and footwear industry, and that pensioners would be removed from the tax system. They were all told that and they all believed it. Because the and the Greens came out against budget mark 1, does that make them irresponsible? Will the. Prime Minister, after he has done the deal, again refer to them as 'that irresponsible swill in the Senate'? Who knows what the Prime Minister is likely to say or do. If the Treasurer is looking for exports to fund our deficit, he should think again. The funding he has thrown at export industries will mostly be gobbled up in fuel charges. On budget night, the fuel oil excise increased from 5.441c per litre to 8.441c per litre. For one tonne of fuel, $90.65 is payable in excise, up from $58.70. I will read to the House some comments by Lachlan Payne, the Chief Executive of the Australian National Maritime Association, who said: Benefits of the latest round of Australian shipping industry refonn will be effectively wiped out by the 1993 federal budget increase in marine fuels excise ... Shipments of cargoes carried around the Australian coast will be more Â·costly, and imports, carried in vessels not subject to excise payments. are bound to become moreÂ· competitive ... The increased excise of fuel will have the result of making Australian domestic industries less competitive in the domestic market place. Bruce MCIver of the Road Transport Forum also said that the increase in fuel excise and sales taxes would be up by about $8,400 per truck. In fact, he warned the truckers bf Ausand tralia not to become .too excitable but to maintain their calm in case the government changed its mind on some of the excise taxes. It is apparent that the government will not change its mind and that the extra cost of transportation will be built into everything that every Australian buys, whether it be food, clothing or whatever. Here we have a secret tax spreading throughout the Australian community. By his own admission, the Treasurer has been looking at the economies of the US and Japan, hoping that they will help bring us out of recession and reduce our deficit. If, as the government claims, we have been out of recession for two years, or the recession bottomed out .two years ago, why is the Treasurer waiting for the US and Japan to help us out of this problem? The reason is that he is looking for a solution to the problems that he and the Prime Minister have created. The government has lost its direction completely. It was elected by the people on the promise of tax cuts and no new taxes. The budget delivered on 17 August increased revenue by increasing existing taxes. The Treasurer has justified increasing taxes on the ground that Australia is the lowest taxed developed country. However, with public sector borrowing requirements of 5.1 per cent of government spending as a proportion of GOP, we are not at the bottom of the OECD list but, with the USA and Japan underneath us, we are near the top. How is the average Aussie doing? How is the Aussie battler doing out of this? Not too good. I do not know whether the parliamentary secretary has spoken to any Aussie battlers lately-perhaps he is spending a lot of his time in Canberra-but I would like to introduce him to a few. I would like him to meet Glennis'and Harold, who live in a pretty ordinary house at St Marys in western Sydney. How did they fare under the 1993-94 budget? Harold earns $22,600 gross as a laboratory assistant, He pays mortgage costs of $515 per rnonth. Dr Theophanous7'""Their mortgage would have gone down.",64
123,Mr CADMAN,PAIRS,"No, but they are good payers and they are going well with their mortgage. He is paying $45 per week maintenance for a child of a previous marriage. They are spending a little over $100 per week on food. G1ennis is a very good manager and she keeps exact accounts, so I had no trouble finding out from her that the family car is a 1983 Toyota and uses 68 Iitres of super petrol per week. Living in St Marys, Harold has to drive a fair distance to work every day. The wholesale sales tax and petrol price increases have cost them $3.04 per week. For this outlay they will receive a lousy $1 a week cut or rebate this financial year. They will have to wait until they pay all their taxes and pick it up at the end of June 1994. When Harold comes to the end of his working days, how will he replace his 1983 Toyota? It will have been devalued in price and, from August next year fuel will be full tote odds because of the increase of 7c a litre on leaded fuel. Taking all these things into account, but not bracket creep or any of those difficult calculations, by this time next year Glennis and Harold will be $2.76 a week worse off and trying to meet increased prices and all the rest of it. I would now like to introduce a bunch of guys who were really dudded by the government by reading to the House something from the ETU News, the official publication of the Electrical, Electronic, Plumbing and Allied Workers Union of Australia. This is terrific stuff because it was published just after the election. First of all we have Malcolm Dougbls, a lorry driver and EPU delegate. He said: I worked for about six weeks as Labor's campaign director in the north Mount Druitt area, finding people to work at polling booths and making sure all the ALP how-to-vote literature and paperwork got out. Mr Ruddock-What was he doing?",65
124,Mr CADMAN,PAIRS,He was working for the ALP. He was supposed to be a representative of the workmen on the floor but he did this for six weeks. The good citizens who were paying his wages gladly released him to the ALP. I suspect that he was on secondment to the ALP. Mr Ruddock interjecting' Mr MACKellar interjecting,65
125,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,I do not think that the honourable member needs any encouragement.,65
126,Mr CADMAN,PAIRS,"They have been very helpful, thank you. Mr Braithwaite-It's one of the true believers he's talking about.",66
127,Mr CADMAN,PAIRS,"One of them here actually is a true believer. Malcolm Douglas, the lorry driver and ETU delegate went on: ... the union movement's help was appreciatedhe means by the ALPbut I reckon the government now has to do a back/lip and defer the tax cuts it promised. They owe it to the country's future. They should divert those funds to industry. Not big business but Australian inventions. It's crazy that something invented here ends up being developed overseas and sold back to us. This is a guy who, after the budget, is saying to the government, 'You are up a tree'. He had backed the government; he had worked for it. The heading for the next article is 'Sweetest Victory of All'. It was submitted by Ken Doherty, a senior leading hand, special class electrician, and senior ETU delegate for Rheem Australia. He said: ... Labor must be mindful that the trade union movement helped to get them back because we represent the majority of voters. Like all working people, I'm claiming tion to Labor's re-election. We talked in the workplace about all the issues, all the policies, all the Libs' hidden agendas. We helped all right. And the Keating government shouldn't forget it. Another guy who wrote in the ETU News and who is particularly interesting is Danny Isherwood. The he-ding above the article submitted by him states that he is one of Labor's true believers and that he hails the Keating government's election victory. The heading states that the article underlines the importance of Labor's aims. He states: Labor is usually 99 per cent for the worker and vice-versa. But now that they've retained government I think Labor should lift its game. They've got to get the worker-and companies, too-back on their feet. Voters just wouldn't wear the GST and people decided to stick with the devil they knew. That is absolutely right. He continued: I believe in the Labor party but they must never forget where their votes are coming from. I believe that amongst those honest tradesmen who were dudded and cheated by the Australian Labor Party we see the germ of truth of middle Australia. We see it in the lives of Glennis and Harold who are battling to make ends meet and who have found that, under this budget, their lives have become more and more difficult. as they finish up with assets that are worthless due to the policies of the Australian Labor Party. (TIme expired)",66
128,Mr MACKELLAR,PAIRS,"I am sorry that the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) has left the chamber. I was hoping he would stay because, when I went back to my room a little while ago, he started his speech by saying-he will forgive me if I do not get the words absolutely right-that he was delighted to support the legislation brought forward by the government. I have in front of me a copy of the Sydney Morning Herald of 1 September which contains an article which is subheaded 'Keating loyalists turned on him'. It states: Senator Loosley opened by saying that the mishandling of the Budget had elevated the profile of the Democrats and allowed the Opposition Leader, Dr Hewson, ""to get up from the mat"". The Sydney Morning Herald got it a little a contribu- wrong next when it stated: The NSW Right's Mr Arch Bevis ... The honourable member, of course, is not from the New South Wales Right. as he is the member for Brisbane. Mr Ruddock-The one that just spoke.",66
129,Mr MACKELLAR,PAIRS,"The gentleman who just spoke. The article states that Mr Bevis: ... was next and he /layed Mr Keating for, among other things, ordering a new dining table for the Lodge which last week brought unwelcome publicity. This is the man who flayed his leader for, among other things, ordering a new dining table for the Lodge. I am glad to see the honourable member for Brisbane is back in the chamber. He came into the House earlier tonight and said that he was delighted to support this government legislation. We have heard for a while-particularly since the budget, of course, but for 10 years before that-prediction after prediction from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), first as Treasurer and secondly as Prime Minister. Each of those predictions, without fail, has been proved to be false. So why would anybody, either within the Labor Party or outside the Labor Party, and particularly the Australian people, give him any credence whatsoever for any statement that he would make? He has proved to be utterly wrong in all of those predictions and there is absolutely no doubt that he will be wrong in the predictions that he has made about this present budget-mark 1, mark 2, or mark 3 which we still have not heard about. I think this is one of the more unusual situations that I can remember in my time in the parliament. Here we are, some time after the budget has been introduced, and the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) has to put before us at question time the amendments that the government is bringing forward to the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993. Subsequently, during the debate itself, he brought in explanatory memoranda to bring us up to date with the changes that the government has made. Following the consultation with the Greens, I am a bit surprised that we have not had more amendments tonight. There is still time-we have about another 35 minutes before the guillotine operates-for the Assistant Treasj.lrer or the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) to come in with more amendments, and subsequently more explanatory memoranda, to bring us up to date with budget mark 3. If it were not so tragic, it would be humorousthe way this government has treated the Australian people and the absolute absurdity of this budget process. It is something that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Affairs (Dr Theophanous), who is sitting at the table on behalf of the government, should feel very strongly about because, among!)t other things, he has a certain reputation for being a man of some principle in matters economic and other things. It must be very difficult for him to sit there and interject time to time because it is an absolute travesty of a process that this government is subjecting the Australian people and this parliament to in its deliberations about budget mark 1,2 or 3. The Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill is before the House tonight in a cognate debate with the Customs Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill and the Excise Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill. Together, as we all know, they are instruments simply of betrayal not only of those who voted Labor at the last election but of the Australian people and the nation as a whole. Let me just remind people that in the leadup to the last election the Prime Minister and the Treasurer gave firm commitments that they would not be putting up taxes. For example, during the Labor Party's policy launch, the Prime Minister stated that there would be no big new taxes. A few months previously, on 19 November last year, the Prime Minister told the ABC Lateline program, 'What I am promising is not to put up tax'. The Treasurer was equally forthcoming on 16 September last year when he said, 'I emphasise that this will be achieved without resort to any new taxes'. On another occasion he said, 'We will not increase the overall burden of tax'. On 19 August 1992 he stated, 'The point is that the tax cuts can be funded without any new tax'. That is just a small selection of the statements made by the Treasurer and the Prime Minister last year and earlier this year which led to the Australian people, unfortunately, believing them, because they were unequivocal statements; there were no ifs or buts. They were promises. Remember that marvellous statement that they were I-a-w-Iaw? We are going to change that, of course, too, during this budget. The fact is that these bills do put up taxes and they do increase the tax burden for many hard working Australian families, as my colleague the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) has already mentioned. No amount of manipulation of the name of the bill or the Prime Minister's bullyboy tactics from will overcome the widespread community realisation and perception, particularly by people like the honourable member for Brisbane, the parliamentary secretary sitting at the table, or Labor colleagues right across the factional spectrum, that the Prime Minister was, to put it as kindly and as parliamentarily as I can, nothing short of totally deceptive to his own people and to the people of Australia. The government went into the election with a clear and unambiguous promise not to increase taxes. Within months, all of that, as we have seen, has been thrown aside. The government has introduced a budget which increases fringe benefits tax, will increase the tax payable on accrued annual and long service leave, although there have been some changes there, will increase the tax liability credit unions and friendly 'societies-the government must be very proud of that-and will increase the price of a wide range of consumer goods by increasing their wholesale sales tax rates. Remember what a terrible, dreadful thing an indirect tax was? What has the government done? It has whacked this tax up right across the board. The budget will also increase the price of wine and cider and will increase the price of tobacco and petroleum products. That is the betrayal of the Australian people, and those opposite know it. The Prime Minister promised us no increased taxation. But not only have he and his Treasurer brought down a budget which is dominated by a wide range of tax increases, but those increases will have their greatest impact on lower income Australians. That is the fact of the matter. Government members, when they went back to their electorates after the introduction of the budget, foundbecause I found it in my electorate and they would have found it in spades-that the people whom they represented got in touch with them and said, 'Hang about, I thought you were supposed to represent us, the lower income people in the Australian community. What are you doing to us?'. In' other words, as honourable members opposite found out-and this led to that caucus revolt-the tax measures are grossly regressive, and they know it. The impact is disproportionately on those very people who were, poor souls, the true believers. They gave their trust to the Prime Minister on 13 March. He is known now throughout Australia as a person whose words people cannot trust. He will never be trusted again. He is a person who has shown that anything he says has a use-by date on it of about half an hour after he says it. Any predictions that he makes will simply not come true. We have before us this evening three bills-the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill, the Customs Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill and the Excise Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill-which are in total breach of the ALP's election commitment. The bills are grossly inequitable in that they disproportionately fall of on the lower income Australians, and none of them will do anything to put Australia back on the road to economic recovery and higher levels of employment. We have all been betrayed. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer, to compound their problt<ms, believed that they could circumvent, hostility to these taxation increases in the Senate by lumping them all into one bill and calling it a deficit reduction bill. Under the precedents in this parliament, they believed that this would force the opposition and the minority parties into acceptance of the total package. What they did not count on was the uncertainty which has arisen over the constitutionality of their actions. This argument centres on the interpretation of section 55 of the constitution which states: Laws imposing taxation shall deal with the imposition of taxation, and any provision therein dealing with any other matter shall be of no effect. Laws imposing taxation ... shall deal with. one subject of taxation only .. . The question of whether the bill deals with the imposition of taxation is also important as regards section 53 of the constitution. It states: The Senate may not amend proposed laws involving taxation . . . The Prime Minister is insisting that the bill cannot be amended. He is also claiming that the bill does not impose tax and can, therefore, include more than one taxation subject. If that is the case, then the Senate can amend the bill. To put it quite simply, the Prime Minister has outsmarted himself, arid he is now marooned between section 55 and section 53 of the constitution. He simply cannot have it both ways. If he wants one bill to include all of his taxation measures, then those measures are not an impost and the bill may be amended by the Senate. If he is correct in saying that the Senate cannot amend the bill, then he is admitting that the bill does contain taxation imposts. It is then unconstitutional in that more than one taxation measure is included in that bill. We all know that the opposition has announced its intention to refer the constitutional validity the bill to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. This has been supported by the Australian Democrats. The matter could end up in the High Court. I tum now to the detail of the legislation. I have to say that the budget has generated more letters and calls from my constituents than any other that I can recall in my many years in this parliament. The budget's proposal to increase taxation retrospectively on lump sums for accrued annual leave and long service leave has produced the greatest volume of concern, although the wine tax, the sales tax increases generally, and the credit union measures come a very close second. As we know, the government has backed down on its accrued leave proposal, and it has made a number of other concessions because of pressure from the Australian Democrats and Independent senators. As I said at the start of the speech, further concessions are possible. I would be very grateful to the honourable member for Brisbane or to the parliamentary secretary if they could inform me and the House whether there have been any later changes, since this bill has been debated in this chamber, to the possible final make-up of the budget. Members of the Labor Party must understand that what we have had is a situation introduced by them which is little more than a slap. in the face to those conscientious employees who have worked through to retirement in the expectation of increasing their retirement funds. The shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), has already foreshadowed in this House that the coalition parties will be moving an amendment to the bill to effectively delete any taxation increase on this accrued leave. The proposed removal of certain taxation exemptions for credit unions is another betrayal. I remind members of the government that this was thoroughly examined by the so called Martin banking inquiry. The present Speaker of the House of Representatives chaired that inquiry. It was agreed by participants in that inquiry, by both Labor and coalition members alike, that the exemption from company tax for credit unions should continue. I read that there is a possibility that of this may be the case, but we have not heard the final outcome of that little scenario yet. The government went into the election with the credit unions believing that the exemption would continue. But there was not to be a bit of it. It was another post election betrayal, and all for relatively insignificant amounts of revenue. The 55 per cent increase in sales tax on wine defies common sense at a time of economic hardship in Australia-particularly for an industry that has been one of Australia's most impressive export achievers. The industry itself seems agreed that this increase will result in reduced domestic sales of between nine and 13 per cent. It will be a factor likely to discourage, rather than encourage, future export s a l e s Like a number of other members, I am well aware of the case put forward for equality of treatment for all branches of the alcoholic beverages industry. But common sense alone should have suggested that now is the most inappropriate time to attempt to achieve that equality. It is a nonsense to talk about equality between the various branches of the alcoholic beverages industry, because the making of wine is significantly different to the brewing of beer or any of the other alcoholic beverages that we partake of. Winemaking is a primary industry; it is not something that can be turned on or off at a moment's notice. Once the vines have been planted and the grapes have been harvested, the product is there. It cannot just be turned on and off as a brewery can be. It is simply not possible. To talk about equality between the various branches of the alcoholic beverage industry is, quite simply, to reveal a total ignorance of the way these things operate. The wine tax increase is indicative of the malaise that now pervades this government. It does not understand the psychology of the business community; it has failed to realise that, to achieve an internationally competitive export-oriented industry, the business community has to be encouraged into new directions, to be guided towards the attainment of an outward-looking culture. Given our 200 years of isolation and insulation, the process requires both commitment and skill over the longer teon. Short-teon expediencies, such as a wine tax in the very trough of a recession, are the very antithesis of what is needed for a burgeoning wine export industry. We have a bright spot on our export industry scene. What does this government do? Firstly, it does not understand what it is doing, and secondly it whacks the industry with this huge increase in taxes. I am reminded of the plethora of statements about indirect taxes made by members of the government, particularly the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, before the election. What do we have now? We have sales tax increases right across the board. The honourable member for Brisbane can say that it is only one per cent; it will go up again; it is designed to go up again. Is it not a terrible thing? All those things which the government railed against us for-food and laundry items--will go up. What a dreadful thing that the opposition was proposing! What is the government doing? It is whacking taxes up. Government members should be ashamed of themselves. The tax on petroleum products is a fascinating one as well. We have heard again from the honourable member for Brisbane about the various aspects of taxes in the UK and in New Zealand. I would have thought that even he would have realised that the physical dimensions of Australia are just a fraction different from those in the UK or in New Zealand. But it does not. worry him in his analysis of the tax. He is a loyal man for the government. He is delight-- to support these measures introduced by his government that - e will be stuck with. I tum to the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill and point out to the House that just as the contents of the bill are deceitful, so is the title. It has nothing to do with reducing the budget ,deficit. It is sirpply an inappropriate cluster of measures to increase taxation on a wide range of products and services commonly consumed and used by ordinary Australians. The government insists that it is part of a program to reduce the budget deficit to one per cent of gross domestic product by 199697. The projected budget deficit for 1993-94 is already higher than the budget outcome for 1992-93, and the 1996 goal can only be achieved with economic growth of a magnitude that the majority of responsible commentators tell us is most unlikely. It took almost a year for the One Nation projections to be well and truly discredited. It took about four months for the Prime Minister's pre-election promises to be discredited. It has taken less than a fortnight for the 1993-94 budget to be rejected wholesale by its own supporters. So much for the validity of its forward projections. Like all the government's recent economic projections its forecast for 1996-97 is worthless, and the most likely scenario is ongoing mismanagement that leaves Australia with a mounting debt, outgoing balance of payments difficulties and-this is the most tragic part of allunemployment stuck at close to the one million mark..",66
130,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,PAIRS,"I will be the last speaker on the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill-which is a great pity; in view of its importance, but perhaps it does not really matter. We are debating a bill with a false title, and the full details of the bill are not before us. As the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MACKellar) said, it is likely to be changed in any case. When we are debating a bill like this, it scarcely gives us much comfort when we think of the potential illegality of the bill itself and the manner in which it has been prepared and presented to this parliament. I will deal with the falseness of the title first. I think it is important for us to realise that this deficit for 1993-94 will be $2 billion greater than the deficit for 1992-93. If it were not for the fact of asset sales worth some $2,400 million, that deficit would be nearly $4 112 billion greater, than it was last year. For 'that reason alone it is an absolute falsehood to bring to this House this budget deficit reduction bill. Everybody knows that in 1994-95 and following years, when it is supposed to be effecting this reduction, true to Labor Party policy and direction over the last couple of budgets the government will have another excuse as to why these measures cannot be implemented and the deficit will still be there. The real falsehood of this budget is the called 3c reduction in the price of unleaded petrol required by the Australian Democrats. That amendment is due to flow through in a year's time. There is no Australian who, having seen the light of day of that first increase, does not believe that at some time in the future that amount will not go on again. It has already been stated that these taxes are there to be increased time and time again by this Labor government. The title and the intention of this bill are false. It is rather amazing that, when the Labor Party is in desperate trouble, sity to compare apples with oranges and what is happening here with what is happening overseas. But it never makes comparison with countries the size of Australia, with the population of Australia and the potential of Australia because by comparison we would fail miserably. The one exception is New Zealand-a country a lot smaller in size and population than Australia. New Zealand is now taking our companies offshore because it is more comfortable for them to trade there than it is in an environment like Australia under a Labor government. The other thing that we hear so much about is . the percentage of GDP. I suggest there would be very few people outside this parliament-and a lot inside this parliament-who, firstly, do not know what GDP is and, secondly, how it is achieved. I feel we should drop the GDP for something more effective, which I call an EPI-an effective productive income-because that is what is going to help Australia get out of this depression, and a depression it is. We only need to read the comments from social welfare commentators to realise this is the case. We make comparisons falsely. We make an assessment of GDP, whether it is one per cent or 1.2 per cent. People do not appreciate that what we have to do is export, or import substitutes, keep our companies on-shore and manufacture on-shore in order to produce an effective income that will reduce the size of the deficit. That is the only way around it. The 1993-94 budget has been conceived in deceit, born of broken promises and executed in total chaos, contradiction and confusion. so- Even the best true believer would agree with me. Some might say that it is predictable for the opposition to rail against these things and make these comments. I want to refer to some of the things that have been said about the budget and this budget deficit reduction bill. An articleÂ· in the Brisbane Courier-Mail said: This is a failed annual Budget: failed because it is aimed, not really at combating the nation's dreadful unemployment, but at increasing revenue in a regressive fashion. This budget's entire focus is to pick every pocket in sight. The second article is from the Sydney Heraldit has a propen- Sun. It states: A political confidence trick. What the Budget gives in personal tax relief, it recoups by increasing hidden taxes and creating new ones. We were not supposed to have new taxes, but it has already been agreed by a senator in the other House that the administration fee for the diesel fuel rebate is in fact another tax. That is one small item. The article continues: A near jobless recovery. Labor has not done enough for the unemployed. The third article is from the Adelaide Advertiser. It states: The Keating Labor Government has lied to the people. It lied before this year's election in a desperate gamble to win another term in office: a term it did not deserve, given the parlous state of the economy. The government lied about planned, and legislated tax cuts, it lied about not introducing a goods and services tax, it lied about protecting the weak and disadvantaged in our community, and it lied about stimulating industry to create jobs. An article which appears in today's Australian states:  yesterday accused Mr Keating of ignoring the country's 'real problems' and getting 'sidetracked' into things that are 'relatively trivial'. That is not what we are saying; that is what some Labor people and some of the papers are saying. I have never seen people so angry in the electorate; I am certainly angry. Policies and promises have been broken, people have been deceived, and a government has obtained office through a tissue of lies. Never before in my period in office have I had calls and letters from people who admit that .they voted Labor asking us to oppose these measures in full, to take the most vigorous action. These letters are coming from people in business, pensioners and low and middle income people. One area which I believe has been betrayed more than any other sector is primary industry. The great crime is that it is obvious that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) was not made aware of what was going into the budget. Mr MACKellar-He didn't have a clue.",70
131,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,PAIRS,"He did not have a clue. The honourable member is absolutely right. That was demonstrated earlier in an answer the minister gave to a question from the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb). No minister who is supposed to be looking after the portfolio of primary industry would have agreed to the increases in sales taxbecause they do flow on to primary production-or the increases in the cost of fuel, particularly the leaded content. It is rather interesting to note that these people have not purchased cars and replacements for years and years. As the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) said' thisÂ· afternoon, some of these vehicles and equipment are so old that they could vote. That is a fair description of what is happening out in the Q\.!sh .. The administration fee is a tax in another form. The restriction on fuel rebates is limited to three years. Rural adjustment is diminished from $151 million to $44 million. Drought is still creating havoc across the country but relief has diminished. Country folk do not receive equal treatment in education and health to peopie in the city. This budget diminishes their treatment further.",72
132,Dr THEOPHANOUS,PAIRS,It is not correct.,72
133,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,PAIRS,"It is absolutely true about education. Schools in Queensland are discharging country students because the government interfered with Austudy. It can be demonstrated in public schools in Brisbane and around my constituency. People in the tourism and service industries will produce the income to get Australia out of the mess it is in at the moment. I suggest that the GDP measurement used for calculations contains a lot of false income and profit. It is not producing what we want for Australia. The budget marks an escalating bias and prejudice against business people and primary producers-the people in the bush. I have heard a Labor member. say the budget was a disaster for the constituency I represent. Fuel tax increases will affect primary producers and all country people to a greater extent than those in the city. It has already been demonstrated that there will be an increase in grocery prices of $3 per week on average per household. The great tragedy of the last election was that it was not accepted that the only viable way to get Australia out of its fix is to have a value added tax. This budget puts a value added tax on the necessities of life-transport and services. I remind honourable members that even in a Telecom Australia bill there is a sales tax and excise component. All of these amount to a tax on services and all are particularly unfavourable to country constituencies. The Australian Democrats are in the same category as Lazarus in accepting a 3c a litre decrease in the price of leaded petrol. It will not affect the price until three or four, years down the track. This contrasts with what the coalition was offering at the last election. So, in all, this budget is disastrous for people in the bush. It is interesting to look at some of the comparisons in the budget papers about the growing cost of the deficit. The 1992-93 deficit showed an interest component on public moneys of $5.452 billion. It is estimated to go up this year by over 20 per cent to $6.755 billion. The forward estimates go to $8.2 billion in 1994-95, $9.2 billion in 199596 and $9.9 billion for 1996-97. So in five years we have doubled the interest component. That is a scandal. Every time we talk of $1 billion of interest for servicing a debt we are talking about an increased budget deficit. No-one would go commercially to a banker and suggest that he lend money to pay the interest on a debt. That is precisely what this budget does. While we can ascertain from the budget papers that the government's securities on issue are $65.4 billion, the total government debt is $79.1 billion. This budget adds and budgets in the future will add to that debt. In May 1993 the Auditor-General found that federal government liabilities were $127 billion. This matter deserves a greater airing than it has had in the past. An item in the Townsville Bulletin on April Fools' Day 1992 demonstrates where the foreign debt is getting us. It says that in 1983, when this government came to power, foreign debt rose to $23 billion. In the 1984 budget it went to $28 billion. It was $51 billion in the 1985 budget, $75 billion in the 1986 budget and $83 billion in the 1987 budget. In 1988 it was stated, 'Our foreign debt has begun to fall', but it rose to $92 billion. The government said that the 1989 budget would bring home the bacon. The pig has not been caught yet, let alone the bacon brought home. In that year the foreign debt rose to $100 billion. So it goes on. In 1992, foreign debt reached $150 billion. That all happened under the auspices of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), first as Treasurer and then as Prime Minister. The latest figure on the 1993 deficit is about $170 billion. We should be concerned at that growing debt figure-from the point of view, firstly, of the escalation budget deficit and, secondly, of the foreign debt itself. All of this is very important. We should also examine what this bill does and does not do. It imposes extra taxes on goods and services and adds costs to our exports. The tax on tourism services, telephones and everything else contradicts what the government promised at the last election. This bill does tax food and essential items. The only difference between this tax and the GST we proposed is that our tax would have rebated all the costs on essential foods, education and health; yet all these services will be landed with a tax under this budget. What is worse, these taxes are discriminatory and affect those least able to pay. The bill morally, economically and constitutionally is corrupt. It will not address the major economic problems of the day. An item on Dateline this evening stated: Australia was in a depression as bad as the Great Depression but soup kitchens had been replaced by dole queues, youth job taskforce co-chairman Lindsay Fox said today. We are obviously in a bad state and this bill does not address the major economic problems. It does not provide the productivity and incentive the economy so desperately requires to keep our businesses and manufacturing units onshore. It does not bring equality and equity to all Australians. It does not employ one additional person. Because of the effect of the fringe benefit taxation and the disallowance of benefits for employees, including accommodation, the tourism industry has estimated that 10,000 jobs will be lost as a result of that measure alone. . The industry also has a problem with the tourists that it expected would travel around Australia. They will now not be able to afford to do so because of the increase in the cost of fuel. As I said, this bill does not decrease the deficit but does increase our commitments both nationally and overseas. It certainly does not keep the government honest.",72

143,Mr DOWNER,PAIRS,"It is indeed disgraceful that we on this side of the House, as members of Parliament elected to represent Australians, have not been in a position to move our amendments to this disgraceful piece of legislation, the Excise Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill, and the piece of legislation rammed through before it, the Customs Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill. This involves a vastly regressive increase in fuel taxes on Australians and a disproportionate increase in fuel tax on those who use leaded petrol. The Labor Party comes into this place piously and sanctimoniously and argues that it has a concern about low income Australians, but that approach is destroyed once and for all by the CUstoms Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill and the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill. The fact is that it is low income Australians who will disproportionately bear the burden of this regressive measure. That has been borne out by the Treasury's own analysis of these measures-an analysis which was as optimistic from the Labor Party's point of view as could be imagined, by including assumptions which could be described as little short of outrageous. It is also confirmed by work that has been done at the University of New South Wales. It is confirmed by work done by the Australian Institute of Taxation. The simple point is that this is a grossly regressive measure. It is also a betrayal of the Australian electorate because all those people sitting on the other side of the House, including the honourable member for Wills (Mr Cleary), went to the last election deceiving Australians into believing that no such measure like this would ever be introduced. The fact is that those opposite betrayed the people-not the people who voted for the opposition but the people who voted for the Labor Party. Government members will now go back to their electorates and will have to explain to those people why it was that they were betrayed. The third point I would make about this legislation is that it comes at a time when this country has around one million people out of work and has $170 billion of net foreign debt. It comes at a time when we are running a balance of payments deficit which, in the budget papers alone, will blowout to $18 billion this year. The government has introduced measures in this legislation which will make this country less competitive, will make our exports more expensive and will make it harder for people to find jobs. The Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) said in his budget speech that the budget was about jobs. This legislation and the other two bills rammed through before it under the guillotine are about destroying jobs. This measure will cost something like 52,000 jobs around Australia. It will make our shipping less competitive, it will make our transport systems generally less competitive and it will ensure that this country remains grossly uncompetitive. If the Treasurer thinks it is funny to cut off the debate, he is damned by his gross betrayal of the electorate",79

146,Mr EVANS,ADJOURNMENT,"I would like to take this opportunity to highlight the work of two very important and worthy community organisations in the Cowan electorate. The first highlights the .success of one community organisation in improving the quality of life for two local residents; the second highlights an impending tragedy for one local welfaredrganisation that is unable to meet the increasing needs of many in our community who simply cannot make ends meet. As a community it is increasingly important that we begin to look beyond government for the provision of community services. In the Cowan electorate we are fortunate to have working amongst local residents many community based organisations that are servicing the needs of our community. In the first few weeks of becoming the newly elected federal member of parliament I was approached by two constituents. Mr and Mrs Bailey are both deaf. Mrs Bailey is profoundly deaf. As we can appreciate, this presents Mr and Mrs Bailey with additional day-today barriers. Mr and Mrs Bailey approached me seeking my support to purchase a TTY - a telephone typewriter. The TTY assists deaf people in communicating with other people over the telephone. Given the Baileys' financial position, the cost of $499 seemed beyond their reach. Instead, they requested my assistance in gaining this financial support. After many approaches to local community groupsincluding local Rotary, Apex and Lions clubs-I was contacted by Mr Murray Matthews of the Girradoola Lions Club. Needless to say, Mr and Mrs Bailey were delighted to hear of the news that the Girradoola Lions Club would gladly provide the financial support-supplemented by my personal donation-to purchase the TTY for the Baileys. It was encouraging that, after two years and many letters to local groups, the Baileys were finally abl- to obtain the use of a TTY that would provide a substantial difference to the standard and quality of their living. The Girradoola Lions Club will be holding a champagne breakfast to gain sponsorship of this project on 17 October 1993.",80
147,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,What a great club.,81
148,Mr EVANS,ADJOURNMENT,"As the honourable member for Fisher says, it is a fantastic club. I would like to thank the Girradoola Lions Club and in particular Mr Murray Matthews for their generosity. I am sure that they will find comfort in the knowledge that their fundraising is changing the quality of life for the Baileys. In contrast, I would like to talk about the difficulties facing the Salvation Army Balga Corps. It is all too easy to forget that this evening across Australia many families go without some of the most basic of requirements-many may be cold, lonely or simply hungry. They survive out of the generosity of many of the community based organisations that provide a day-today service to the many needy in the community. All of us would be aware of the enormous and generous support extended to the community throughout Australia by the Salvation Army. Unfortunately, the availability of the professional and caring service provided by the Balga Salvation Army is under threat due to a lack of resources. Last month I was contacted by Captain John Poke of the Balga Salvation Army. It was through Captain Poke's correspondence that I was made aware of the impending crisis. In the 12 months to June this year, the Balga Salvation Army assisted more than 750 families. That assistance cost the Salvation Army more than $36,000. Unfortunately, as a result of funding restrictions, the Balga Salvation Army will have less than $8,300 to use to serve local needy families until January 1994. In the five months to December 1992, the Balga Salvation Army was required to service 437 families with a total funding of $21,300. Over the next six months it will have less than $8,300 to service a much greater demand. In his letter to me, Captain Poke spoke of the difficulty facing the Balga Salvation Army: ... there is an expectation from people in the community, that the Salvation Army has helped us out before, so families come to us again with that expectation that we will be able to assist them. With this severe restriction ,upon us, it means we will either have to find funds elsewhere or put our energies into raising monies and not into helping people. The Salvation Army throughout Australia has a proud and notable record of community service. It is a tragedy that funding restrictions will place the Balga Salvation Army Corps in one of its most difficult periods for many years. MACKillop, Mary",81
149,Ms CRAWFORD,ADJOURNMENT,"In the current debate about who should be represented on our Australian currency, I want to pay tribute to a unique Australian, Mary MACKillop-a woman before her time, and indeed a woman who has been beatified and will become the first Australian saint. Surely then she is deserving of our recognition. . Who was Mary MACKillop and what did she do? She was born on 15 January 1842 in Fitzroy, the eldest of eight children. After a prosperous start, her family became impoverished. She worked as a shop girl, a governess and a teacher. She knew and understood poverty. She had real contact and real understanding of what it was to be poor and excluded. However, she had been fortunate in being educated by her father who had studied for the priesthood in Rome before marrying her mother, Flora MCDonald. On 19 March 1866 she and Father Julian Tennison-Woods founded the Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart. They were to live in poverty and dedicate themselves to educating poor children. We need to be reminded about Catholic education in the 19th century. It was run by the church and was paid for by the states which subsidised churches to carry out education. But education, because of the lack of formation of teachers, was a very ad hoc affair, and for the poor and for girls was often non-existent. The Josephites organised it. Here was an ongoing structure where people were fonned to be teachers, and where there really was education. It is Mother Mary's great contribution, for they were the first religious order in Australia to enter into education-with the exception of the Christian Brothers who came for a very brief time in the 1840s. Mary MACKilIop and her Sisters of St Joseph of the SacredÂ· Heart lived in poverty and dedicated themselves to educating poor and isolated children. They withstood the snobbery of the day and continued their work. In 1871 Mary was excommunicated for alleged subordination. The church was paternal and bishops believed that they should have control, whereas Mary, who had a much more forward thinking view, saw the need for a system in which authority would be delegated. The schools were closed, but still she held to her very strong faith and her belief in the rule of her order. The excommunication order was lifted in February 1872. The SisterS of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart later branched out into caring for orphans, visiting the sick and providing a' refuge for unmarried mothers. It needs to be noted that large numbers of unmarried mothers were part of society then. This woman is no plaster saint-as we have seen on the ABC-she is a pioneer. She was prepared to see the needs of people. We are told that she never saw a need without reaching out to do something about it. Her life was translated into action. Her order was to be open to the needs of the time and the needs of the future. As an Australian, the characteristics of her life were very different from the saints of her time, who were mainly Europeans living in cities where there was established wealth to back up any ventures they took on- She was outgoing, resourceful and had plenty of initiative and determination. When she was born, not only she, but Australia, was very poor. Melbourne was still a village. Mary MACKillop championed equality, educational opportunity and access of the poor to society's wealth long before such causes had become fashionable. She should be recognised on our currency. She heads a long list of formidable Australian women who were ahead of their time and who stand out in the fields of endeavour. . We must acknowledge her contribution to modem Australian society on our currency. It is her unique Australian-ness that we should celebrate. As the debate on the images on our currency units continues-I submit to you, Mr Speaker, that she is a woman upon whom we can all model ourselves-Mary MCKillop should be on our currency to remind us daily of her commitment to equality of opportunity and the need for action. Australia and hundreds of Australians have much to thank her for and we need to be reminded daily of that fact. Child Abuse ' Mr SINCLAIR (New England) (10.49 p.m.)-The fourth Australian national child protection week was launched in Canberra on Sunday by Nick Farr-Jones, the former captain of the Australian Wallabies side. On the same day in Adelaide, the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley) launched the national strategy for preventing child abuse. Regrettably and, I believe, having full knowledge of the fourth national child protection week, the minister failed to acknowledge the commencement of this week. She also failed to recognise the work being undertaken around Australia by a number of organisations affiliated with a body called NAPCAN, the National Association for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect, with which my wife Rosemary has been associated since she founded the body some years ago. That body, through voluntary agencies in many towns and cities around Australia, has been raising funds to combat child abuse, the figures for which, as we all know from newspapers, television and radio, are increasing at a tragically alarming rate. While it is welcome news that the federal government has developed a strategy, to date it has provided no money. While this strategy has been launched by Senator Crowley, not only has she failed to recognise the significance of the fourth annual child protection week, but she also has not recognised Operation Paradox, a police child sex abuse phone-in established in association with the founding of the national child protection week concept. The difficulty is that NAPCAN has been functioning on a voluntary basis. It raises funds in order to produce magazines and educational material. Indeed, pamphlets such as 'It's Okay to Say No' and 'Don't Shake Babies' have been produced by that organisation on a voluntary basis. Government departments throughout Australia are dependent on that material. So good is the material that it is now exported to a range of other countries. Yet Senator Crowley failed to recognise the efforts made by these voluntary groups and the enormous contribution made by those who, on a voluntary level, have sought to combat a phenomenon which everybody in this House and around Australia would find hard to reconcile with the concept of our society. Tragically, child abuse is on the increase. It is a reality of society where social and economic traumas are, unfortunately, becoming more and more a matter of everyday life. It is important that governments contribute towards combating the problem. It is no use developing a strategy unless money is provided and there is recognition of the very worthwhile charitable bodies around the nation which are working in the field and which would be only too pleased to contribute to and work with the government. Senator Crowley was invited to participate in a joint launch of this year's new press kits. She declined to do so. I find it most regrettable that, in launching her own strategy, she seemed to be trying to attract to herself and to the government publicity which should go to others and for which, therefore, no particular pride obtains. Rather, the government's efforts need to be directed towards solving the problem. I trust that the government, in what I regard as a worthwhile move, does not embark on this strategy only for the publicity that is attracted by combating a tragic cause. Rather, it should be committed to solving the problem - identifying the reasons why child abuse occurs and recognising that it is a product, sadly, of men and women in our society. The figures from 50,000 or so reported cases in 1991 show that children younger than 12 months have been abused more often than those in any other group. The government should be looking at the issue of proper parenting and helping to inform children and others in society that help and care are available. I trust that the government will provide funds for the strategy in the future and recognise the efforts made by so many men and women in communities throughout this country. Ipswich Railway Workshops",81
150,Mr LES SCOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"Oxley) (10.53 p.m.)Mr Speaker, the Ipswich railway workshops have played a tremendous part in the life of the Ipswich community for many years. Last Saturday,4 September, I had the pleasure of attending a family day at the workshops. This day was an open day which over 10,000 people attended, from the very old to the very young, with many in family groups. Established in 1864 as Queensland's' first railway workshops, the original workshops were sited around 1.6 kilometres south of the existing site and just north of the Bremer River. Rolling stock for Queensland's first railway line between Ipswich and Grandchester was assembled at the Ipswich workshops. The rapid growth in the use of rail in the early 1880s led to the construction of new workshops at the present site in North Street, north Ipswich in 1885. The carriage shop was the first building to be finished and, of the original buildings, five are still in use today. The rapid industrial and population growth which occurred in Queensland during the late 1940s and early 1950s resulted in new workshops being built at Redbank, which have carried out all maintenance work on dieselelectric locomotives since 1958. During the 75 years that it was involved in the manufacture of steam locomotives, some 218 locomotives were built by the Ipswich railway workshops, with thousands of wagons, carriages and rail cars also being built there. Over recent decades, the workshops have been responsible for the maintenance of existing carriages, wagons and rail motors, as well as the manufacture of components used in other workshops throughout the state. The workshops celebrated their centenary in 1985 but, sadly, time has caught up with Queensland Rail and it is now proposed to merge the activities of the Ipswich workshops with the Redbank railway workshops complex at Redbank. The open day was organised as a program of events designed to inform people and stimulate their interest in the proud history the Ipswich workshops. and rail in Queensland. Events on the day included a tour of the workshop drawing office, laboratory and training centre. The program also included present day production processes, including various static and wdrking displays. Other activities included: model trains; a first aid display; a pole top rescue demonstration; a martial arts display; vintage motor cycles; and a demonstration by the Ipswich heritage square-dancing group. A large number of local businesses also gave substantial support to theÂ·<tay. I am sure that the thousands of people who took part in the day's activities came away with an appreciation of the significant role the workshops have played in the history of the Ipswich region. For 128 years, the Ipswich railway workshops have provided employment to generations of families in the Ipswich region. The contribution of the workshops to the economy of the Ipswich region is impossible to calculate, with a large percentage of the tradesmen who served their apprenticeships at Ipswich workshops going on to work in other sectors of the Ipswich economy, including the Swan bank power station, the coal mines and private industry. The high level of skills developed by these tradesmen during their time at the workshops has benefited the economy of the Ipswich region enormously. Above all, the workers at the Ipswich railway workshops have contributed greatly to the economic development of Queensland. The rolling stock and components they have built, as well as the carriages and wagons on which they undertook maintenance, were all essential to the opening up of much of the state for development. The workshops have also produced a number of people who have made an enormous contribution to the Queensland labour movement. Two such people are the late Jack Devereux, a long time official of the Metal Workers Union, and Les Brown, a former Deputy Mayor of the CIty of Ipswich and a life member of the Australian Labor Party. The family day was a fitting tribute to the workshops' proud history of service to the people of the Ipswich region and to the of people of Queensland. The day would not have been possible without the cooperation of the trade union movement and the efforts of the large number of workers who gave their time on Saturday. The family day committee, the trade unions and, above all else, the workers themselves are to be congratulated on their efforts in putting the day together. It proved an extremely successful day for a city that is extremely proud of its heritage. Wine IndustryÂ·",83
151,Mr VAILE,ADJOURNMENT,"It was with a great deal of concern and intrigue that I listened to the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) assuring us that the budget was all about creating jobs-then, in the next breath, he blew away thousands of jobs in the Australian wine industry as a direct result of the monumental 55 per cent increase in the sales tax on wine. In the electorate of Lyne there exists a number of quality boutique wineries which, through hard work and intelligent planning, have been achieving phenomenal success. The most notable of these wineries is Cassegrains winery which, along with the Charley Brothers winery, is providing much needed employment in the Port Macquarie area. The Cassegrains winery produces some of the world's best quality wine of which 40 per cent is exported, mostly to Japan, but it relies enormously on the domestic market to achieve economies of scale. As is the case with the majority of small export companies, domestic sales underpin exports. Domestic wine sales are extremely price sensitive, and this 55 per cent increase will wreak havoc on this local industry. The concern of Cassegrains for its future is certainly not unfounded. If this tax is introduced, domestic sales are expected to drop by 31 million Iitres with a corresponding drop in grape demand. Along with this, the Winemakers Federation of Australia estimates a loss of export income of around $126 million per annum. The recently released Sharp report clearly states that the Australian wine industry's competitive advantage is neither as secure nor as strong as some would wish. It said: Any change in the tax system which reduces the ability of Australian wine exporters to invest in building of market-based assets has the potential to substantially downgrade the industry's international competitive advantage. These sales tax increases will therefore place the Cassegrains family winery at a distinct disadvantage. Cassegrains survival to date has only been because members of the extended family work six days per week all year round at minimal wages. They recognise that they cannot keep this up forever and are currently trying to plan for their future. With the introduction of this sales tax on wine, along with all the other burdens on business which this government has introduced over the years, the future looks very bleak. This is not scaremongering. A decision to close this winery may be the only alternative open to the business. I would like to put on record some correspondence recently received from Claude Cassegrains",84

(b) China applies an overall annual quota on wool imports up to the top stage of processing. A global quota is set by the China State Planning Commission which is then distributed to each Province. Th.equota is a planning target rather than NA (3) What (a) tariffs or (b) non-tariff barriers does Australia place on the importation of wool or woollen prqducts. (4) What measures is Australia taking to have the measures referred to in part (3) reduced or removed. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) The major wool-buying countries which apply tariffs. on wool imports are China, the United States of America, the EC, India and the Republic of Korea. The tariffs applied to wool imports by these countries are set out in the table below. Greasy Scoured Wool tops 15% 20% 40% 65% 24.3c/kg clean 28.7c/kg clean free 2.5% 2% 2% of to per cent on greasy wool, 14 per cent on scoured of Korea apply the following tariffs on wool products. Yarn Woven Fabrics Interior Textiles % % % 7 5.1-tO 7.2-17 6.4-9.6 12 11 13 100-150 100-150 15 per cent on imports of wool products quoted reflect Austrade's advice that these are the rates of Australian wool products. fabrics is either 9.6 per cent or I60yen/sq metre, a fully binding constraint on wool imports, and may be revised during the course of a year in line with changing market conditions. The US and the EC apply quotas to the imports of wool products negotiated either under the Multifibre Arrangement (MFA) or bilaterally. While the US and the EC do not currently apply quotas to imports of Australian wool products it is of concern to the Government that our access to these markets for wool products could be restricted if quotas were introduced. Since 1955 the United States has had in place, under the Fann Bill legislation, a price support program for wool and mchair, with payments to producers determined by a fonnula linked to the support price for shom wool which in tum is linked to tariff collections which are rebated to producers through the support program. Japan applies discretionary licensing arrangements to processed wool, however, these currently do not impact on the levels of wool imported. (2) The major focus of the Government's efforts to Iiberalise import restrictions for wool has been on China, the USA and India. These are the markets where import restrictions provide a major impediment to our access for wool and wool products. The Government has been pursuing a liberalisation of China's import restrictions bilaterdraft ally at Ministerial level through the Joint Ministerial Economic Commission (JMEC) and during various Ministerial discussions. Most recently the Prime Minister discussed with the Chinese Vice-Premier the potential for closer cooperation between Australia and China in the future development of the wool industry during his visit to China in June this year. The Prime Minister received a favourable response from China in relation to its preparedness to consider reviewing its import restrictions on wool in the context of a joint effort to exploit new marketing opportunities. The Government is currently developing a strategy to progress this issue and to ensure that it is consistent with the Government's global strategy for the wool industry it will take into account the recommendations of the Wool Industry Review Committee which haS recently completed its report. In addition, representations have. been made through the Joint Working Group on Wool which was established under the umbrella of JMEC and involves Australian and Chinese officials. Australia is a member of a GATT Working Party currently considering China's GATT application. As part of the accession process China will be required to bring its trade regime into GATT consistency. This will include a removal of all nontariff barriers that it currently applies to imports. Australia has emphasised to China that a reduction of its tariffs on wool, and tativerestrictions, would assist in speeding up China's application. However, to date, China has refused to consider eliminating its quotas on wool as part of its GATT accession process. The Government, through its participation in the Uruguay Round, is pursuing a liberalisation of the import restrictions. applied by the United States to imports of wool and wool products through: the negotiation and binding of reductions in the tariff levels that apply to raw and semiprocessed wool, and seeking binding commitments for the reduction of the level of production subsidies provided to the US wool industry Australia has indicated its support in recent bilateral discussions for US Administration proposals to apply a cap on payments to US producers under the current arrangements. The Government is currently participating in negotiations during the GATT Uruguay Round to liberalise the international textiles trade through the dismantling of the MFA. The proposed arrangements require the US and EC to phase out quotas they have negotiated on the imPQrts of textiles and clothing goods under the MFA. This would be undertaken in line with a schedule set out in a new GATT Agreement on Textiles and Clothing. The Agreement sets out the provisions proposed to be applied during the transitional period for the integration of the textiles and clothing sector into the GATT. Australia is not currently a signatory to the MFA but we will be a member of the proposed Agreement on Textiles and Clothing. Under the proposed Agreement the US and the EC would be required to advise and where possible consult Australia of their intention to introduce quotas. Where this is not feasible Australia could initiate the consultations. If a mutually satisfactory solution is not reached then the matter could be referred to the GATT Textiles Monitoring Body (TMB) which would consider it and make a recommendation. Whilst there is an expectation that both parties will abide by the TMB's recommendation it would not be binding. However, Australia is seeking a commitment from both the US and EC during the Uruguay Round that they will not introduce quotas on imports of Australian wool textile products nor take safeguard action against imports of Australian woollen products. In relation to the level of the production subsidies paid to US wool producers agreement has now been reached between the US House of Representatives and the US Senate, in the context of the 1993 US Budget, to reduce payments to wool and mchair producers from $125,000 in 1994 to $50,000 in elimination of its quanti- 1997. TheOovernment has been holding GATT Article XXVIII negotiations - ith India concerning the withdrawal of its zero tariff binding on greasy apparel wool imports and the application of a 40 per cent tariff in its place. These negotiations are expected to be finalised shortly. Following Ministerial representations, Indian authorities announced in May last year that full duty drawback would be afforded for imported wool used for exports. In addition, India announced in June this year that it had replaced its prohibition on the import of wool tops with a 65 per cent tariff. The Government will further pursue a reduction in the Indian tariff on raw wool and wool tops during the Uruguay Round. 3(a) As from I March this year the following tariffs apply to the import of wool and wool goods: apparel and certain finished textiles 47 per cent woven fabrics 34 per cent other fabrics 29 per cent existing non-quota Textile, Clothing and Footwear (TCF) 21 per cent. (b) Australia does not maintain any non-tariff barriers on the imports of wool and wool products following the termination of global quotas on TCF goods on I March this year. I (4) Under the Government's (TCF) Arrangements which came into full operation on 1 March 1989 tariff rates on wool and wool products will be reduced as follows: apparel and certain finished textiles will be phased down to 25 per cent by I July 2000 fabrics will be phased down to 15 per cent by I July 2000 TCF goods which were previously not subject to quotas will be phased down to 10 per cent by 1 July 2000 and TCF goods already having rates of 15 per cent or less will phase down in line with general reductions for manufacturing tariffs. Disability Support Pension (Question No. 219) Mr Moore asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 17 August 1993: (1) Are the permanently blind automatically qualified for a disability support pension; if so, why. (2) What other permanent disabilities are recognised for automatic qualification. Mr Baldwin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. Section 95 of the Social Security Act provides that a person is qualified for disability support pension if he or she is permanently blind. The automatic grant of pension to permanently blind claimants also applied under the invalid pension rules. Invalid pension was replaced by disability support pension on 12 November 1991. The policy of granting invalid pension on the basis of blindness was given legislative authority in 1912. Successive Governments have taken the view that payments to the blind on the current basis should continue because of the special significance attached by the community to the condition of blindness. (2) No other permanent disabilities qualify a person automatically under the Social Security Act for disability support pension. To qualify for disability support pension, a person who is not permanently blind must have an impairment of at least 20% and a continuing inability to work. In most cases, a decision on a person's qualification for disability support pension involves an examination of the person by a Commonwealth Medical Officer who advises a Departmental decision-maker on the level of the person's impairment and fitness for work. Section 116 of the Social Security Act provides, among other things, that such a medical examination is unnecessary where it is manifest from the nature and extent of the person's disability that he or she qualifies for disability support pension. Departmental guidelines identify conditions and disabilities which can be considered to qualify persons for disability support pension on ""manifest"" grounds. Examples of such conditions include stage 4 of HIV infection (AIDS), severe brain damage and quadriplegia. Disability Support Pension (Question No. 233)",85
