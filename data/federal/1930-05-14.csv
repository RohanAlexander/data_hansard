I should walk out pretty often, and if on every occasion on which I have to walk out to meet my engagements I were taken to be as protesting against something that was being said, I should always be protesting. As Prime Minister, I have so many calls and deputations that it is difficult for me to remain in the chamber for any considerable length of time. I remember the occasion referred to by the honourable member. My action in walking out of the chamber then had no significance whatever in regard to what he was saying.

33,Mr ANSTEY,AMALGAMATE D POSTAL,"It is not proposed to give the war pensions assessment appeal tribunals power to make permanent pensiou assessments. The making of pensions permanent is a continuous policy, and is effected in every case where it is reasonable to do so. During last financial year, for instance, the pensions of 1,792 incapacitated soldiers were made permanent. There are many cases where the soldier's incapacity varies considerably from time to time, and in cases where the degree of incapacity is progressive, it would be unjust to make the pension permanent.

46,Mr FORDE,EFFEOT ON MACHINERY,"-The answers to the right. hbnorable member's questions are as follow:1. and 2. There have been no alterations in the schedule itself. This is in the form of a proclamation, and could only be altered by the Governor General in Council. The prohibition of importation applies to the goodsspecified unless the consent of the Minister has first been obtained. The right honourable the Prime Minister stated in this House that the Government would be prepared to give f a ir and sympathetic consideration to any case in which it ' could be shown that unnecessary hardship would be - inflicted. Such a schedule necessarily involves instances in which it is not in the interests of the community rigidly to enforce the prohibition in its entirety. To as meet those cases permission to import goods covered by the proclamation has been given in the cases set out in the statement appended. The items speak for themselves, and, in general, they represent restricted classes of goods within the prohibited - range, which are rerequired by the community and are not made in Australia, or rationings on the principle laid down when the proclamation was announced to the House. 3. The consent given operates in each case from the date of importation of the goods affected. 4. There,is no objection to bringing before the House at a later date a supplementary statement of any further exemptions that may be found necessary, and this will be done. STATEMENT. .

UNEMPLOYMENT STATISTICS.",20
49,Mr SCULLIN,EFFEOT ON MACHINERY,"On the 1st May the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Gullet) asked me whether I would consider the practicability of publishing unemployment statistics monthly instead of quarterly. I have obtained a report from the Commonwealth Statistician who advises that the methods of collection available do not render the variation suggested practicable. He states that this matter has had the serious consideration of the Commonwealth Bureau of Census and Statistics over a long period, and that it was considered at the conference of the Government Statisticians of Australia and New Zealand, held in Hobart in January, 1928, at which it was resolved that, with the existing organization for the collection of data for the compilation of statistics of unemployment, it is undesirable that such collections shall take place more frequently than quarterly. Mr Wickens adds that the matter of unemployment statistics has been listed for further consideration at the conference of Statisticians to be held in Brisbane this month. FEDERAL CAPITAL.

I now desire to furnish the following answers to the honourable member's questions:1. Yes. 2. No. The yard dues received from the first sale were not sufficient to cover interest charges per annum on the capital sum expended, quite apart from the necessity to provide for maintenance, sinking fund and administration. 3.

51,Mr LYONS,EFFEOT ON MACHINERY,"On the 9th May the honourable member for ""Wimmera (Mr. Stewart) addressed to me the following questions, upon notice.1. Whether it is a fact that the policy of making one member of a party telephone line in country centres responsible for the collection and payment of the accounts of all other subscribers to such line is the cause of widespread dissatisfaction? 2. Will he give consideration to the abandonment of this policy and the substitution there for of one in which the department will collect its own accounts from individual subscribers on party telephone lines? I am now in a position to infor m the honourable member as follows:RENTS. 1. There is no evidence of general dissatisfaction with the policy, which appears to meet the wishes of the majority of the telephone subscribers affected. 2. The practice applies only to party lines in country districts which are wholly or partly erected and maintained by the subscribers concerned. The rendering of independent accounts was tried and abandoned owing to the difficulty in effecting the necessary apportionment amongst the subscribers. The extent of the payment to be made by one subscriber for the right to use a portion of the plant provided by another, or by the department for another subscriber, is naturally a matter for settlement between those interested. The subject has been carefully reviewed, but I am satisfied it will not be in the best interests of the parties concerned to make any change. WINE INDUSTRY. EXCISE DUTY REMITTED.",21

54,Mr BLAKELEY,EFFEOT ON MACHINERY,"Darling-Minister for Home Affairs ) [ 3 . 2 7 ] - I m o v e That, in accordance with the provisions of the Commonwealth Public Works Committee Act, 1913-21, the following proposed work, which was referred to and reported upon by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, be proceeded with, viz.:-The proposed erection of public baths at Canberra. 28's. 32's. The establishment of these baths will f ill a long felt want in Canberra. It is proposed that they shall be 100 feet long and s. d. s. d. 40 feet wide, with a depth ranging from QUALITY, 60'S. 3 feet 6 inches at the shallow end to 9 6 6 7 6 8 5 11 6 0 feet at the deep end. The basin is to be 7i 6 8i 6 9} lined with white tiles, and black tiles are 9 5 10 6 0 to be used for the provision of sub8 5 9 5 10 divisioual lines for racing and other pur2 5 3 5 4 7 5 8 5 9 poses. 4 11 5 0 Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL - A r e white QUALITY, 64'S, tiles available? 6 9 6 10 Mr BLAKELEY - The Acting 6 2 6 3 7 0i 7 1 Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr . Forde) is inquiring into that matter. If 6 1 6 3 6 0 6 l i white tiles cannot be obtained, I believe 5 6 5 7 that it will be possible to procure tiles of 5 11 6 1 some other colour that are manufactured 5 2 5 3 7 li ' 7 2i in Australia, or the opal glazed tiles 7 li 7 2i which also are manufactured locally and are placed upon the market at a very reasonable price. The Public Works Committee had placed before it a number of other propositions, but both it and the Government considered that in the. existing circumstances they were altogether too extravagant. One scheme provided for the building of a rather elaborate structure, with a covered-in pool and pro- tralia. vision for the heating of the water. It would have been a somewhat magnificent enterprise, and would have cost upwards of £30,000. .",22
55,Mr LACEY,EFFEOT ON MACHINERY,It also included submarine lighting.,23
56,Mr BLAKELEY,EFFEOT ON MACHINERY,"As I am reminded by the Chairman of the Public Works Committee (Mr Lacey) provision was made for submarine lighting also. There will be ample dressing accommodation for both sexes. One of the chief reasons why the Government proposes to go ahead with the construction of swimming baths in Canberra is that the only available swimming facilities near the city are provided by the Molonglo River, which, from time to time, becomes contaminated during flood, and on two occasions residents were warned by the health authorities against swimming in it. At present there is no place in Can-berra where children can be taught to swim, with the result that most of them are growing up in ignorance of the art. If for no other reason than that,' it is desirable that swimming facilities should be provided here.",23
57,Mr LATHAM,EFFEOT ON MACHINERY,Will the Minister say where the baths are to be constructed?,23
58,Mr BLAKELEY,EFFEOT ON MACHINERY,They will be in the vicinity of the Telopea Park school. The site is screened by trees.,23
59,Dr EARLE PAGE,EFFEOT ON MACHINERY,"Cowper) [3.32,] I think that honourable members should have an opportunity of considering this proposal in relation to other works which have been recommended by the Public Works committee, and for that reason I ask the Minister to postpone consideration of the matter, if only for a day.",23
60,Mr BLAKELEY,EFFEOT ON MACHINERY,We cannot agree to that. We have already considered a proposal for postponement.,23
61,Dr EARLE PAGE,EFFEOT ON MACHINERY,"Then I consider that the House has a right to ask for fuller information, not only in relation to this proposal, but regarding the whole public works programme. Everybody recognizes that there is an acute shortage of money for public purposes, and many will take the view that it is not desirable that this work which, after all, will provide only a convenience for leisure hours, should take precedence over what are urgent matters in other parts of AusSince the proposal was first made to erect swimming baths in Canberra the whole situation in regard to providing money for public works, whether out of revenue or loan, has undergone a change, and it is now only right that the House should have an opportunity of exercising its judgment as to which works should be undertaken with the limited amount of money available. . Dr MALONEY (Melbourne) [3.35] I compliment the Minister upon his proposal to, erect swimming, baths in Canberra. Has his attention, ever been drawn to the advantages of the chlorination of the water used in swimming baths? Recently new swimming baths were opened in Footscray, Melbourne, and chlorination of the water supply is a feature of them. During the visit of Dr Truby King to Melbourne he demonstrated his faith in the efficacy of this method of treatment by drinking a tumblerful of water taken from the pool. I hope, further, that white tiles will be used to line the baths, and that a system of illumination underneath the water will beadopted. This is the system in operation in the Footscray baths, and I have never seen anywhere a more charming effect.",23
62,Mr MACKAY,EFFEOT ON MACHINERY,"Lilley) [3.37] - The proposal to erect public swimming baths in Canberra was first made some years ago, and the Minister for Home Affairs, then seated in opposition, was a most enthusiastic supporter of it. T am surprised,, however, that the Government should attempt to carry out this work at the present time. Probably within a few weeks the Treasurer will bring down proposals for increased taxation; the Postmaster-General is short of funds for providing much-needed telephone extensions and increased postal facilities; yet the Government, apparently without giving the matter any real thought, brings down a proposal to spend £10,000 on a work which, however desirable, cannot be regarded as necessary or urgent. Most visitors to Canberra, after viewing the splendid city which has been built at a cost of so many millions of pounds, think that those who live here are doing pretty well as things are, and a government which proposes to spend £10,000 on the provision of public swimming baths here in existing circumstances cannot escape the charge of extravagance. The Minister said that the Molonglo was a polluted streamprobably in flood times it ber-Jines discolored, but there are, nevertheless, many good ""swimming holes in it. I protest against the expenditure of this money on what is not an urgent work.",23
63,Mr WATKINS,EFFEOT ON MACHINERY,"Newcastle) [3.38.] I hope that the Minister will proceed with this undertaking. I agree that we need to practise economy at the present time, and I also agree that we need money for telephones and other desirable works; but I do not think that is a sufficient reason for refusing to provide the people of Canberra with the swimming facilities so greatly needed. Those persons who are fortunate. enough to reside on the sea coast have sea beaches at their disposal, and even there swimming baths are built for them. I am surprised that honourable members who spend most of their time amid the comforts of coastal cities should cavil .at the spending of £10,000 to provide reasonable swimming facilities for the people compelled to live in Canberra. The matter is too paltry to be discussed, in a national parliament.",24
64,Mr NAIRN,EFFEOT ON MACHINERY," [3.39.]- I also protest against the Minister's proposal to go on with this work at the present time. A feature of the Labour party's last election campaign was that if the party were returned to power there would be no expenditure on public works that were not of a reproductive character. proposed baths will not be reproductive, and if we may judge by the results of other expenditure incurred at Canberra, we may anticipate that they will show a substantial loss; in fact it is doubtful whether they will pay the wages of the attendants. . I recognize that a convenience of this kind would be much appreciated by the people of Canberra, but throughout Australia are larger towns in drier areas .which are in more, urgent need of public baths; such baths as exist elsewhere are provided from the pockets of the citizens, who have co be content with facilities that are within their own means. The proposal now before the House has not even the merit of conforming to the original plan of Canberra; it is altogether too costly for present requirements, and yet is not part of the permanent scheme. I do not object to the residents of Canberra ' having baths, but they should not be given any more privileges at the expense of the general taxpayer. At the 30th June last, the capital expenditure on Canberra was £11,400,000; on which the interest is £365,000 per annum. In other .words the taxpayers of the Commonwealth are paying £1,000 a day in interest on this white elephant.' During the last election campaign, Labour candidates were loud in their denunciation of the extravagance that has occurred at-Canberra. I agree with their criticism, and I , and many other honourable members, believe that it is not too late to shut down this artificial city. I hope that some of us will, have the courage to put such a proposal - fairly and squarely before the people - 'No moTe tragic error has occurred in Australian public affairs than the establishment ,of the Federal Capital at Canberra. If ' the financial condition of the Commonwealth does not permit of the provision of baths that conform to the standard laid' down by the designer of the city, and yet baths must be provided, let us provide merely for present needs. I suggest that this matter be referred back to the Public Works Committee, with a view to Obtaining a recommendation more in accordance with what, the Commonwealth can afford at the present time.",24
65,Mr CROUCH,EFFEOT ON MACHINERY,"Corangamite) [3.45]. - This is the first occasion on which I Tho have spoken in the House on any matter relating to Canberra. My only object in rising is to assure the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) that if - he will move that the Seat of Government be removed to a place where baths are already available, I shall support him.  - There is a good deal in the argument of the honourable member for Perth (Mr. Nairn), that other communities which desire conveniences like, public swimming baths, have to provide them by funds contributed by their own citizens. Most of the expense in connection with the establishment of the Federal Capital at Canberra has been borne by the nation, but it is questionable whether the provision of swimming baths is a national obligation. I assume that before long Canberra will be controlled by a municipal body, and this proposal might well be deferred for its consideration. I strongly urge the Minister tp postpone this motion, at any rate, until honourable members have had an opportunity to study the report of the Public Works Committee.",24
66,Mr LACEY,EFFEOT ON MACHINERY,"Grey) [3.47] - Ap parently the honourable members of the Opposition are animated by the idea that the duty of an Opposition is to oppose, regardless of the merits of any proposal submitted by the Government to the House. I have, at times, questioned the wisdom of expending large sums of money in Canberra, but what has been done cannot be undone. Nearly £12,000,000 has heen expended in the establishment of a federal city here, and if a motion that Canberra be scrapped were seriously submitted, honourable members would be bound to give due weight to that fact, irrespective views regarding the wisdom of ever having embarked on the enterprise. In connection with the matter now before the House, substantial economy has already been effected. The first proposal submitted to the committee involved an expenditure of £23,000. Although the Government is not obliged to refer to the committee proposals involving an expenditure of less than £25,000, the Ministry evidently thought it advisable to have this project investigated. After taking considerable evidence, the committee recommended the provision of baths, better than were first proposed, and yet to cost £13,000 less. A large proportion of the people in Canberra are compelled to live here, and they have been transferred from capital cities they enjoyed, as well as sea bathing, public baths established by municipal councils. Canberra has a growing population, and it is high time that swimming facilities were provided for its children. In this connection 1 quote the following extract from the evidence of the headmaster of one of the public schools hereWe have about 180 children over the age of eight years at the Ainslie school, and only twelve of them, seven boys and live girls, can swim. The total number in attendance is 250. and I believe that practically the whole of the children would attend the baths for instructional purposes. Last year the department proposed to hold a swimming school in the Molonglo river, but owing to the state of the stream the arrangements were cancelled. About i)0 per cent, of the children were then anxious to learn to swim. The committee gave special consideration to this subject from the point of view of the school children. It was principally in their interests that it recommended that the depth of water at the shallow end of the baths should be 3 f t . 6 in. Provision is made in the scheme recommended by the committee for the chlorina tion and filtration of the water, as suggested by the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney). It would b«ridiculous to refer the matter back to the Works Committee, for it has made a thorough investigation into the subject. It could only recommend again after another inquiry what it now recommends. The committee visited very many public of their baths throughout Australia. - M i \ MACKAY - Coul d not a baths bt built for half the proposed expenditure?",25
67,Mr LACEY,EFFEOT ON MACHINERY,"It would not be possible to do anything worthwhile with an expenditure of £5,000. The committee is of the opinion that £10,000 must be expended in order barely to meet the reasonable requirements of the case. The report of the committee gives details of the cost of many public baths which were .inspected, and I invite honourable members to compare those costs with the expenditure now proposed to be incurred. The Malvern baths were perhaps the best that we inspected, and it will be possible with the expenditure of additional money subse1 quently to make the proposed Canberra baths equal to them. I have often urged the Government to where expend more money in country centres and less in cities, but after a very careful inquiry I am convinced that this proposed expenditure is thoroughly warranted. The baths it is proposed to construct here will not meet all the needs of the case; in the course of time, when the financial stringency has eased somewhat, baths will be required in other parts of Canberra. The committee favoured the site now proposed because it was close to the largest public school here, and would provide swimming facilities for a greater number than would baths constructed on any other site. I hope that the Minister will not heed the request of the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) to postpone further consideration of this subject. The report of the committee was ordered to be printed on the 10th April, and honourable members have had ample time to consider it. I trust that this work will .be pushed on, for it will provide not only much-needed swimming facilities for the population of Canberra, but also work for some of the unemployed.",25
68,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,EFFEOT ON MACHINERY,"Warriugah) [3.55.]-The main consideration in connection with this subject should bo whether the proposed work is urgent. \. can see nothing urgent about it. It is idle to say that Canberra is in any worse position in regard to swimming facilities than many inland towns in Australia. As a matter of fact, it is better off, because of the rivers which flow through the Federal Capital Territory.",26
69,Mr CUSACK,EFFEOT ON MACHINERY,If the people wanted ro swim in the rivers where would they undress?,26
70,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,EFFEOT ON MACHINERY," Dressing sheds could be provided at an expenditure very much below £10,000. That is not an insuperable difficulty. The Minister said that the Molonglo river had been declared to be unsuitable for swimming purposes, but he qualified his statement by saying that the examination of it was made after a flood. In my opinion the rivers in this locality are admirably suited by their purity and other qualities for swimming. It was reported in the press today that the public accounts for the first nine months of this financial year show a deficit of more than £3,000,000. In these circumstances we should scrutinize very carefully every proposal to expend public money, and only the most urgent work should be put in hand. It was at first proposed to construct the baths at Canberra at an expenditure of £23,000. The cost of upkeep was estimated to be between £2,000 and £3,000 per annum! It appears that after a considerable amount of evidence was submitted to the committee, Mr Murdoch, formerly Commonwealth Director-General of Works, was asked whether a baths could be built for £10,000. His answer was in the affirmative, and the committee thereupon recommended that a baths to cost that amount should be constructed. No details have been given in the report of the manner in which the expenditure is to he incurred. It seems to me that as most of the work will be done by tilers and concrete workers, not much employment will be given to unskilled labourers.",26
71,Mr LACEY,EFFEOT ON MACHINERY,The .honourable member is misrepresenting the case.,26
72,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,EFFEOT ON MACHINERY,"If that is so, a member of the Works Committee will have an opportunity later to correct' me. The report of the committee is entirely unconvincing. We have been given no information as to the number of persons who will use the baths, nor of the annual cost of maintaining them. It seems to me that at least these salient points should have been considered by the committee. All that the committee has said is vague. Its report might be paraphrased in this way-""It is estimated that baths of a certain type will cost £23,000 and that the upkeep will cost between £2,000 and £3,000 annually. We will not recommend such a large expenditure. We will recommend a project to cost £10,000. It does not matter what the upkeep and other details are. These are minor considerations."" It has not been shown that the people of Canberra want these baths, which will be merely another expensive ornament to this city. Seeing that the swimming pool will be only 100 feet by 30 feet it will be merely a toy baths. In addition to that, the baths will be far away from the main centres of population, so that the people will not have reasonable access to them. It will take the people who do not own motor cars a day's travelling to get to the baths and get back to their homes again. All that the Minister has told ns is that white tiles will be used. He added that if a sufficient number of white tiles was not available cream tiles would be obtained. If necessary, he said, a line of red tiles would be put around the centre of the pool with perhaps some pink ones lower down. He also observed that it was at first thought that lights might be installed at the bottom of the pool, but that was not now proposed. The whole proposition has no substance in it and I hope that it will not be persevered with.",26
73,Mr CUSACK,EFFEOT ON MACHINERY,"Eden-Monaro) [4.4] I am surprised that the Opposition is against the construction of a baths in this city, for it is a necessary adjunct to every >city. To my mind it is a reflexion upon the Government that our capital city is still without a public baths. If a party of international swimmers came to Australia we could uot hold a carnival in Canberrabecause we have no baths. "" That would surely give such visitors the impression that' politics is a dirty game- "" To swimj or not to swim,"" or perhaps I should put it "" to wash, or not ""to wash"", is the question. Apparently the members'of the Opposition do not want to swim or to wash. It is a reflection and a stigma upon this Parliament that it has not provided a public baths for the' capital' city of the nation, which now has a population of more than S,000 people, many of whom are children. I. understood that it was not the function of the Public ""Works Committee'to deal with proposals for 'the expenditure of such small sums as £10,000.",27
74,Mr LACEY,EFFEOT ON MACHINERY,"The Public Works Committee was considering a proposal to cost £30,000, but it recommended an alter-na^ tive proposal to cost only £10,000.",27
75,Mr CUSACK,EFFEOT ON MACHINERY,"Ye t the Opposition wants the committee to make a further inquiry. It is an absurd suggestion. Eor the honour of Australia we should bring this national city up to date, particularly in regard to bathing facilities. The Cotter water is available for these baths, which, when constructed, may be used for the purification of politicians and others. If we have clean bodies we shall have clean minds. Those who cannot swim should learn to swim. A politician should have a knowledge of water as well as of land, because at some future date he may be called upon to join the Navy. The Opposition has said that a swimming baths should be constructed at Canberra only when this city is administered as a municipality. That is a remote possibility because the Federal Capital has been established by the nation, l t is not like the ordinary city which depends for its development on its own resources. The national exchequer stands behind Canberra. We have expended £12,000,000 in its development and we should be failing in our duty if we did not make provision for a swimming baths. at the Federal Capital. I hope that this proposal will be accepted without further objection by honourable members opposite.",27
76,Mr FRANCIS,EFFEOT ON MACHINERY,"Moreton) [4.7] - I am one of those who believe 'in Canberra, and I am glad indeed that we have a national capital; but at this stage economy-should be exercised in regard to the provision, of further facilities - The people of Canberra are very fortunate'.; - They have a splendid water supply from .'the Cotter river. In addition they are able to swim in the beautiful Molonglo river, - many parts of which were improved under the previous administration. There is, therefore, no urgent need to construct a swimming baths at Canberra, particularly during this time, of depression and financial stringency. Almost every request made by honourable members to the Government for new works in their electorates is being refused on the score of economy. It is absolutely futile to approach the Post and Telegraph Department in respect of alterations or facilities, because even the most sympathetic officials of the department find themselves unable to accede to any request for the want of funds. Yet the Government is providing money for the construction of a work that is certainly not urgent. I do not believe that the people of Canberra themselves are asking for this facility at a time like this, when unemployment is rife throughout the country, and there is urgent need for the construction of reproductive works. I have perused the report of the Public Works Committee on this proposal, and I find that it contains few details. According to that report the proposal was to construct in Canberra swimming baths estimated to cost £23,000, and I defy the chairman or any member of that committee to point to any details in the report concerning a proposal at a cost of £10,000 - This, project should be.deferred, or referred back to the Public Works Committee with instructions to furnish this Parliament with proper details, as it is required to do under the provisions of the Commonwealth Public Works Committee Act. I have read most of the reports submitted by the Public Works Committee, and with the exception of this report they have been model reports.",27
77,Mr BI,EFFEOT ON MACHINERY,AKEIJSY - It is very evident that the honourable member is not now a member of that committee.,28
78,Mr FRANCIS,EFFEOT ON MACHINERY,"I am at a loss to understand why this report should have been furnished to Parliament without any particulars with respect to the proposed expenditure of £10,000. I urge the Government to re-consider its decision to construct swimming baths at Canberra at. this time of great national emergency.",28
79,Mr CURTIN,EFFEOT ON MACHINERY,"Fremantle) [4.12] - - It is true that the report does not contain - details of the scheme, but if the honourable member for Moreton . examines the type of baths which the committee has recommended and compares ' the estimate for that proposal with the estimate of £23,000, he will find that the difference in the estimates is due to a cal modification of the original proposal.",28
80,Mr FEANOIS,EFFEOT ON MACHINERY,Then there is all the more reason why the details should be included in the report.,28
81,Mr CURTIN,EFFEOT ON MACHINERY,"-It was not so long ago that parliamentary committees were urged to prune their reports as much as possible in order to reduce the cost of printing. I can see in the report adequate information as to why baths of thetype and size recommended should cost less than the original proposal, under which the bath9 were to be covered and the water heated. The present proposal provides for smaller baths, and these are to be uncovered, and without heating appliances. By cutting out those details the committee was able to submit a bedrock estimate of £10,000. It is all very well for honourable members like the honourable member for Warringah (Mr. Parkhill) who come from places where bathing facilities are available, not only to themselves, but to their children, to oppose this proposal. I have yet to learn that any educational curriculum of this country, that does not provide facilities for tuition in swimming, is to be regarded as satisfactory. We have cookery classes established by the nation in connection with the educational department of the Capital Citv. We have technical education facilities, .carpenters? benches and an engineering shop established at the Telopea Park School as part of the educational system chargeable/to this nation. 'The - arents of the children of Canberra have no selective opportunity. They have been compelled, - in carrying out their duty to the Public Service of this country, to come, to Canberra, and therefore they are in a position entirely different from that of the ordinary citizen, who ha.3 selected the locality in which he happens tp live. The great majority of the public servants have been conscripted and forced to reside in Canberra. Therefore their children, have equal rights with the children residing in any other up-to-date city of Australia. While it is true that at hundreds of places throughout Australia swimming baths have been provided by municipal authorities as distinct from the nation, ,the fact remains that, because of national radi- policy, there is no municipal authority at Canberra. This Parliament has, therefore, to take responsibility for that position. We have not yet granted municipal status to the people of Canberra. It is absurd for iis' to ask them to provide their own swimming baths, especially when there is no administrative authority under which they could raise and expend the necessary money. The committee, in recommending the construction of a swimming baths at this stage, took into consideration the needs of the children. It was not neglectful of the financial' situation of Australia generally: but it felt that au expenditure of £10,000 to enable more than 1,000 children to be given facilities for swimming would be more than justified. It was ascertained in-evidence that only about 3 per cent, of the children attending primary schools in the Capital City are able to swim. This is the national centre of Australia, and until swimming facilities are provided we shall be affronted with the outrage that only 3 per cent, of the children living here are able to swim or have, opportunities to learn to swim. There is an obligation on this Parliament. to remedy that disability at once. It is just as important that berra children should learn to swim as it is that the boys should learn to use plane, or the girls to cook. . The honourable member for Moreton (Mr Erancis) has said that we should not incur this expenditure at this stage. I submit that if it is wrong to expend £10,000 on this project, it is wrong to of spend money on other non-utilitarian proobjections jects. Within the last few months honorI able members opposite, who now protest against this expenditure on the ground of economy, were complaining of the Goformative. vernment's action in deferring expendican ture on another work which they regarded as of some importance. In that instance, the expenditure involved was £250,000.",28
82,Mr FRANCTS,EFFEOT ON MACHINERY,Not for this year.,29
83,Mr CURTIN,EFFEOT ON MACHINERY,"No ; but there was the commitment. If the whole case against this proposal is that £10,000 cannot spared at this juncture",29
84,Mr LATHAM,EFFEOT ON MACHINERY,Eo r this purpose. Baths would be very desirable if we could spare the money.,29
85,Mr CURTIN,EFFEOT ON MACHINERY,"In times of stress the conservative-minded always look round see whether expenditure can be cut down; and in their survey they include of education, the health services of the community, and other provisions for social amenity. The opposition that has been shown to this project this afternoon is characteristically true to label, and those who have raised it are typical of those who consider that in times of stress money should be spent only on the paynied ment of interest, and the maintenance the ordinary obligations of everyday society.",29
86,Mr LATHAM,EFFEOT ON MACHINERY,Kee p postal employees in their positions.,29
87,Mr CURTIN,EFFEOT ON MACHINERY,"Does the honourable member suggest that the saving of this expenditure would enable the whole of the requirements of honourable members opnational posite, in connection with postal services, to be met?",29
88,Mr LATHAM,EFFEOT ON MACHINERY,"That has not been sugrevenues gested, and the honourable member knows it quite well.",29
89,Mr CURTIN,EFFEOT ON MACHINERY,"Is it suggested that there is involved in this matter the quesCantion whether or not the capital city should be scrapped, or, as the honourable a member for Perth (Mr Nairn) suggested, the wisdom of having established it here ?",29
90,Mr GREGORY,EFFEOT ON MACHINERY,Le t us scrap it.,29
91,Mr CURTIN,EFFEOT ON MACHINERY,"Le t us face that question courageously, and decide it upon its merits. Let us not visit upon the children this capital city the full weight of our to what has already been done. cannot find in the report of the Public Works Committee anything that warrants the criticism that it is not sufficiently inI t explains why these baths be constructed for £10,000. The sole argument advanced against their construction is that of economy. I reject that, because I do not regard £10,000 as an element in the determination of what is an economic or a non-economic policy for this Parliament to pursue. The children of this capital city should he as prebe sentable as those of any other community in Australia, and should have equal rights.",29
92,Mr LATHAM,EFFEOT ON MACHINERY,No one denies that.,29
93,Mr CURTIN,EFFEOT ON MACHINERY,It is useless to compare Canberra with an ordinary country to town. Honourable members have sought to make this place the pivot of the systems national life of Australia.,29
94,Mr NAIRN,EFFEOT ON MACHINERY,The honourable member speaks differently in Western Australia.,29
95,Mr CURTIN,EFFEOT ON MACHINERY,"I do not speak differently in Western Australia. I should be ashamed to go to Eremantle, with its magnificent beaches, and say that I had dethe children of Canberra the opporof tunity to learn to swim. The education curriculum in all of the States makes swimming a compulsory subject wherever the necessary facilities exist. There is a definite pressure upon the people of all the States to provide those facilities. I have explained how the citizens of Canberra are handicapped in that respect, and why the provision of those facilities here is a obligation. I can see no reason why honourable members opposite should be willing to draw upon the national to make provision for cooking classes at Telopea Park School, and object to pay for a swimming pool.",29
96,Mr MARRS,EFFEOT ON MACHINERY,"Wentworth) [4.25] Representing, as I do, a' district that has the finest surf beach in the world-Bond i - and the club which holds the surf - championship of Australia-the Bondi Surf Club- I feel that I ought to say something upon this matter. I fear that if further opposition is offered to this proposal by honourable members who siton this side, we shall be designated "" spoil sports"", and I have no wish to be so designated. The honourable member for I'remantie (Mr Curtin) has stressed what I regard as the main point, the needs of the - children. A little while ago there was an appalling harbour disaster on Sydney Harbour, in which the ferry steamer - Greycliffe was involved, and a number of my pals were caught in the smoking room and were drowned. But several young people, who were passengers on the ferry boat, and were able to swim but a few yards, succeeded in reaching pieces of wreckage and lifebuoys, and thus were saved. Had they not been able to swim that four or five yards, they must have gone down. If the expenditure of this £10,000 may in some future disaster be the means of saving the lives of on* or two of the children who are now attending the Canberra schools, it will have been well spent. We must also consider this matter as it affects the public servants who have been brought to Canberra, and do such excellent work for the nation in the service of the Parliament, and in the different departments. They were forced to come here because the Parliament came here. Should we not make some provision for them to obtain relaxation in the heat of summer? A third point that impressed me was raised first by the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page); I refer to the need to exercise economy. Bnt the fact that the Minister for Home' Affairs (Mr Blakeley) has brought down this proposal, on the report of the Public Works Committee, convinces me, that the Treasurer (Mr Theodore) considers that he can afford to make available the £10,000 involved. For some time the Treasurer has beeu urging the nation to economize, and to. reduce as far as possihle, its expenditure on luxury items. The other day a relative of mine, who is at present in London, cabled asking that, on account of financial stringency, I should take steps to have made available to him a few hundred pounds. I interviewed the bank with which I have been dealing for 30 years, and was informed that they did not want to send the money, but that if they did they would charge me 7 per cent, for the transfer.",30
97,Mr SPEAKER,EFFEOT ON MACHINERY, Order ! The honourable member is dealing with a matter that has hardly any relation to the motion before the House.,30
98,Mr MARRS,EFFEOT ON MACHINERY,"It is related to the subject of economy, which has already been raised in this debate. The, point I make is, that the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Blakeley-) would not have brought down this proposal if it had been opposed by the Treasurer. I was told by my bank, "" We do not mind so much, but Mr Theodore says that this money must not be sent out of Australia because there are thousands of Australians in London who are asking for similar amounts "". Having allowed the Minister for Home Affairs to bring this proposal forward the Treasurer must be satisfied that he can afford the expenditure. I am surprised that the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Archdale Parkhill) should oppose the motion. He has but to walk down to one of Australia's finest beaches at Manly in his electorate and have his surfing, but he has no thought for Canberra's residents in the heat of mid-summer. I believe in borrowing money for productive works. The productive side of this proposal is that the children will learn to swim, and that the residents of Canberra will have relaxation. We must also consider the tourist traffic. We should encourage the people of Australia to visit Canberra in large numbers, and thus assist the business people here, who are now finding it a hard struggle to keep going. The more people who come to Canberra the more money will be spent in the hostels and shops. For those reasons, but mainly for the sake of the children, I urge the Minister to go on with this matter, and force it to a vote if necessary.",30
99,Mr GREGORY,EFFEOT ON MACHINERY,"Swan) [4,31] - The complaints made by some honourable members that the report of the Public Works Committee does not give detailed information is hardly justified, as honourable members will find if they read the report through. It deals with the several propositions put forward, and shows how the committee reduced the amount it was proposed to spend on the provision of public baths in Canberra from £33,000 to £10,000. Mr FRA.NCIS - Where is that information ?",31
100,Mr GREGORY,EFFEOT ON MACHINERY,"In the report, as the honourable member will see if he reads it. That, however, is apart from the question whether the country can afford to spend £10,000 on this work. There is also the question whether we should continue to spend money in Canberra at all, and whether we should not re-consider our whole policy in relation to it. This £10,000 is a small item in comparison with what has been spent here. Up to the present time we have spent nearly £12,000,000 in Canberra, and we have very,' very little to show for it. Some assert that there is no need for swimming baths here, because Canberra is traversed by a glorious river which should be able to provide all the swimming facilities required. According to the Griffin plan, weirs were to be thrown across the river, and a series of lakes formed in the centre of the city to reflect its many charms. It has been stated that one cannot have a beautiful city without running water, yet last year the Molonglo, if it did not absobecause lutely cease running, was at any rate reduced to a trickle, and a scum formed over the pools. Five years ago, however, it was in high flood, and when the floods subsided the streets of Queanbeyan were feet deep in silt. What possibility is there of establishing a lake system in Canberra by means of a river subject to 3uch changes? Personally, I believe that we should scrap Canberra as quickly as we can, and place our capital near some centre of population where we can get into touch with important interests easily when the need arises. We have a beautiful climate here, and we might use the place as a sanitdrium. Indeed, its suitability for the establishment of a mental institution should not be overlooked.",31
101,Mr SPEAKER,EFFEOT ON MACHINERY,It is not in order for the honourable member to develop his argument in that direction.,31
102,Mr GREGORY,EFFEOT ON MACHINERY,"I believe that Parliament should reconsider the whole .matter, with a view to abandoning Canberra as the seat of government.",31
103,Mr LATHAM,EFFEOT ON MACHINERY,Is it not a fact that Duntroon Military College holds swimming competitions in the Molonglo river against the representatives of other military establishments?,31
104,Mr BLAKELEY,EFFEOT ON MACHINERY,"Darling-Minister for Home Affairs) [4.35] - It is true that the authorities of the Duntroon M i l i tary College have used the Molonglo river for' such purposes, but it is also true that on two occasions the health authorities have declared the Molonglo unfit for swimming purposes. After floods, when the carcases of beasts are floating, down the river, the water is most obnoxious. Also, when the river is very low the water has a distinct odour, and is not regarded as healthful by the medical authorities. It seems extraordinary to me to hear honourable members of the Opposition making impassioned orations over a proposal to spend £10,000 on public swimming baths in Canberra. With rare exceptions they have swallowed proposals for the. expenditure of not £10,000, .but £10,000,000, over the past ten years. When those proposals came forwardthey gave' them their blessing as if they were carrying out the Lord's work. In thai matter, at any rate, I a,gree with them, they assisted in the establishment of the very beautiful city of Canberra. Nevertheless, honourable members sat behind a government which wantonly wasted money in the construction of Canberra, and they now oppose a project which has many virtues to recommend it. For instance,.the last Government, which the opponents of this proposal supported, supported a system of administration for Canberra in connection with which this Government, by one series of reforms, has effected a saving of £47,000 a year.",31
105,Mr LATHAM,EFFEOT ON MACHINERY,The position is different now from what it was under the last Government ,31
106,Mr BLAKELEY,EFFEOT ON MACHINERY,"The same situation confronted the last Government, and it absolutely refused to deal with it: It refused to take the necessary steps to reduce actThat administrative costs. The last GovernAct 1922-1928. ment could have saved £20,000 during the last year of its office if it so desired; yet the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Francis), the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Archdale Parkhill)., and ot,her3 blame the present Government for its proposal to spend £10,000 on swimpage ming baths, though they had no word of protest to offer against the wastefulness of the Government they supported.",32
107,Mr FRANCIS,EFFEOT ON MACHINERY,The last Government was responsible for the report regarding administration on which the present vernment is working.,32
108,Mr BLAKELEY,EFFEOT ON MACHINERY,"That is not so. This matter was not even referred to committee by the last Government. The honourable member for Moreton gets up in this House and makes speeches' on' subjects which he has not even troubled to investigate before entering chamber. The Public Works Committee's report was available to him two Weeks ago, but he was not sufficiently interested even to look at it. The same remark applies 'to the honourable member for ringah, the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Mackay), and the honourable ber for Perth (Mr Nairn), who did not even look at the report before making their speeches on the subject today. speeches themselves were sufficient proof of that. The Government has given this matter very careful consideration during the. last six months, and has paid full 'attention to the financial situation Commonwealth. We took the matter up where it was left by the last Government, f t was,, not necessary for us. to ""refer to the Public Works Committee, but decided that the proposal should be caresubstitute fully - scrutinized, and the best scheme adopted. This proposal is worthy support of honourable members irrespective of party - It is necessary that the 'Capital City of the Commonwealth should be vided with swimming baths, not only for have not already become liquid or been the benefit of public servants and ""tourists, b'Ut of the children living here. Question resolved in the affirmative . PUBLIC SEEVICE BILL . Motion (Mr Scullin) agreed tolie have leave to bring in a bill for an to amend the Commonwealth Public Service GERMAN NATIONALS : PROPERTY RIGHTS. NA AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENTS. Debate resumed from 30th April (vide 1251) on motion by Mr SCULXINThat the paper be printed.",32
109,Mr LATHAM,AGREEMENT BETWEEN GERMAN AND,"Kooyong) [4.42] This, though merely a motion for the printing of a paper, invites the House to consider the terms of "" an agreement beGotween His Majesty's Government of, the Commonwealth of Australia and the Government of the German Reich regarding the property rights and interests of Gerthe man nationals subject to the rights created under 'the Treaty of Versailles."" This must be considered in conjunction with another agreement which includes the settlement concluded at The Hague conthe ference in respect to reparations. Article I . of the agreement provides for the adoption of what is known as the Experts Plan-the Young Plan. It is satisfactory to observe that a further Warstep has been taken in the settlement of the problems resulting from the Treaty memof-Peace. The Commonwealth of Australia, under the Government in power in 1920 determined to enforce its full rights The under the Treaty. A good many of us have not felt very satisfied for a number of years past with the adoption of that policy to its ful l extent, and I do not disgu se the fact that when I found myself : of the having to administer for a time some portions of that policy I acted with considerable reluctance. But i't is difficult it after a policy has been in operation for we a number of years to abandon it, and to for it something entirely different', though that is what is now being of the done under this agreement. No one can regard this as an entirely satisfactory solution of the difficulty. It prois proposed bhat German interests which 4 liquidated or, been finally disposed of shall be released. As' between-individuals, that must give rise to a certainmeasure - of injustice. A person whose .property has been liquidated bas lost it altogether, except for a claim against Germany, which that country should honour; but one whose property has not been liquidated will get it back. This new policy represents a cutting of the Gordian knot, which, in the circumstances, is probably justified. I haA'c no Opposition to offer to the course proposed, but I ask the Prime Minister whether the Government is satisfied regarding the identification of the interests which are definitely excluded from, the agreement. It would be most unfortunate if there were room for dispute as to what properties had been liquidated or finally disposed of. I presume that the Government has gone into that phase of the matter, as otherwise serious difficulties might arise. Mr SCULLIli"" (Yarra - Prime Minister) 1-4.45] - Regardin g the point raised by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Latham) as to the identification of interests, the Government has gone into this matter, and a conference was held and a committee appointed to handle cases. Australia was represented by the High Commissioner, who was assisted by our financial advisor in London, Mr. Collins. Before any finality was reached all the particulars were sent to Australia. The Attorney-General's Department went into the matter very thoroughly. Mr. Collins considered particular cases, and my department here went into the question of identification. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that this agreement does not represent an entirely satisfactory solution of the problem, nor do I think that such a solution is possible at this stage. I agree with what the Leader of the Opposition said on a former occasion. I hope that there will never be another war; but, if there is, I trust that there will be no seizing of private property, such as occurred during the last war. Under this agreement unliquidated property will be handed back, but it will be impossible to hand back property already disposed of. The former owners of such, properties must look to the German Government for redress. Under the new agreement with Germany, Australia is forgoing approximately £200,000 a year in comparison with what she was entitled to receive under the Dawes agreement. That will provide a margin out of which Germany can settle claims regarding properties which were seized, and have been liquidated.",32
110,Mr LATHAM,AGREEMENT BETWEEN GERMAN AND,What amount will Australia receive per annum?,33
111,Mr SCULLIN,AGREEMENT BETWEEN GERMAN AND,"I cannot say, but the liquidated properties are valued at £1,500,000 in Australia, and at £2,500,000 in the Territories. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA BILL. SECOND READING.",33
112,Mr SCULLIN,DEVELOPMENT A ND MIGRATION,"Yarra-Prime Minister) [4.49] - I move That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to abolish the Development and Migration Commission, which was created in 192© to deal, first, with migration, and secondly, with development. The activities with which it was associated are. to be placed under departmental control. Ministers will be directly responsible to Parliament for the carrying out of this work. The details of the bill can be better discussed in committee, so I shall confine my remarks today .to general principles. The work that was carried on by the Development and Migration Commission will be divided into two parts-development will be placed under the control of the Prime Minister's Department, and migration under the control of the Department of Transport. The London administration, instead of being a separate body, will be under the direction of the High Commissioner's office. The commission consisted of four members, whose salaries totalled £13,250, or more than the salaries of any State Ministry, except that of New South Wales. It was a separate body, only indirectly subject to the Minister, ai'd having power to appoint its own officers and! fix their salaries. Under the re-organization the staff will be under the control of the Public Service Board, which will fix salaries and conditions. When the officers of a governmental body are not subject to the Public Service Board, distinctions and differences in respect of - salaries and conditions are set up which do not make tor the smooth working of the Public Service. The experts who were appointed hy the commission to advise on different enterprises are being tained under the control of the Prime Minister's Department. Of course expert advice on any enterprise is essential. Dr EAKLK PAG*: - Will those officers, be under the control of the Public Service Board?",33
113,Mr SCULLIN,DEVELOPMENT A ND MIGRATION,"Yes ; with some exceptions, which I shall enumerate. It is not a sound policy to establish a body with power to appoint a staff outside the control of the Public Service Board, and, to a large extent, outside parliamentary control. The cost of administration of the commission, including salaries of commissioners, Australian and London organizations, investigations and reports in Australia nnd London, training of farm labourers and dom:estic servants, subsidies to the .Fairbridge training school and other training farms, subsidies to voluntary organizations and publicity, Avas set out in the Estimates of the previous Government as £111,000. The present Government, when reviewing the Estimates, asked the commission if it could revise its expenditure. The commission reduced the total to £107,000. Under the proposed scheme of departmental control the estimate of expenditure for the next financial year will be £57,000. The estimate of the amount required for passagemoney in the current financial year was £100,000; thus the total expenditure proposed in the Estimates of the last Government was £211,000. The estimate of the present Government for the next financial year is-Administration , contributions, &c, £57,000; passage-money £20,000; total, £77,000. The amounts paid for assisted passages since the £34,000,000 agreement was signed have been1925 £191,309; 1926, £314,892; 1927, £304,164; 1928, £218,855; 1929, £137,373; total, £1,166,593, or an average of £233,300 per annum. When the Government assumed office it was confronted with two serious probBritish lems^-growin g unemployment and the difficulty of finding money to pay for passage of migrants and to carry on the expensive organization, that hod was £l,166j000. been built up. The Commonwealth had entered into an agreement with the British Government and the State Governments. My Government approached refirst the British Government. We pointed out the financial and economic position of Australia, aud the serious and increasing extent of unemployment, and said that it was not sound policy to borrow money to pay the passages of assisted migrant? when there was already in Australia au army of unemployed consisting of both the native-born and migrants who had not been absorbed in industry. The British Government, realizing the position, met us in a fair and reasonable manner. The Commonwealth stipulated that assisted migration should be restricted to the reunion of families. If a father had been assisted to come to. Australia, refusal tn assist his family to join him would be a serious hardship. The British Government agreed to proceed with certain of its obligations in respect of development if ' the Commonwealth continued the system of assisted passages so far as it related to the re-union of families, .and the migration of boys for farm training and domestic servants requisitioned by the States. To that condition the Cornmouwealth Government agreed. Very much stress has been laid ou the fact that, under the £34,000,000 agreement, u large amount of cheap loan money was made available to the States for developmental purposes. In fact, there is a popular opinion that the £34,000,000 was being lent by the British Government to Australia at a low rate of interest and that the money could be utilized for developmental purposes and so provide work. The truth is that, under the agreement, money for developmental purposes had to be borrowed by the Commonwealth through the Loan Council. The British Government, paid a certain proportion of the interest, the Commonwealth contributed another proportion, and the money was handed over to the States at a low rate of interest. During the five years in which the agreement operated the amount contributed by the Government as interest on loans for development was £1,163,000, whilst the the amount paid by the Commonwealth Government for assisted passages alone",34
114,Dr EARLE PAGE,DEVELOPMENT A ND MIGRATION,"How much did the British Government pay, for assisted passages during the same period?",35
115,Mr SCULLIN,DEVELOPMENT A ND MIGRATION,"The same amount as the. Commonwealth. My point is that the Commonwealth paid more for assisted passages than it received from the British Government as a contribution to interest, and, in addition, the Commonthe wealth had to shoulder the whole respondevelopmental sibility of providing employment for migrants.' I say deliberately that tralia did not carry out its agreement with the British Government, and of thereby failed in its obligations to migrants. That is a serious statement, but the truth of it is obvious. One of the conditions of the agreement by which the British Government made a contributend tion to interest and paid one-third of passage-money of assisted migrants, was that the migrants should be satisfactorily settled in Australia. The large number of migrants out of work today is proof that that obligation was not honored. £2,500. The amount of money that has been advanced to the States under the agreement in connection with schemes already approved is £6,445,379. Further amounting to. £2,037,597 will' .probably have to be made. Therefore, it is necessary to retain the services of certain advisers and experts to investigate schemes upon which these further adwho vances will be expended. The Governwork ment proposes also to retain some memservices bers of the commission in an advisory capacity."" Mr Gepp, who was chairman of ""the commission, will be retained part-time consultant.",35
116,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,DEVELOPMENT A ND MIGRATION,"""What will his duties be?",35
117,Mr SCULLIN,DEVELOPMENT A ND MIGRATION,"One-fourt h of his time will be available to the Commonmental wealth in an advisory capacity, and he will receive a retaining-fee of £1,250 per annum for the remaining four years for which he was originally appointed. had to find work for him to do. His salary was £5,000 per annum.",35
118,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,DEVELOPMENT A ND MIGRATION,Did he get any compensation?,35
119,Mr SCULLIN,DEVELOPMENT A ND MIGRATION,"No . This is a volunexpert. tary agreement; he could have claimed he paid for the balance of his term at £5,000 a year, but he met the Government fairly and reasonably and without duress or pressure. agreed to give his services as a part-time officer. If his services are required for more than one-fourth of his time he will be paid, for them pro rata. The very fact that we were able to loan Mr Gepp to serve on the Coal Commission for about eight months indicates that whole of his time was not required for work. The proposed adthe visory committee will consist of Dr AusRivett, Mr Gepp and Mr Gunn. The last-named gentleman will give the whole his time to the investigation of developthe mental projects. About eighteen months of his term of appointment was unexpired, and as the developmental works, in regard to which he will have to advise, will exover some years, a new .agreement the was made with him whereby he will forego the balance of his original term of appointment and be re-appointed for '.a period of five years from August, next at a salary of £1,800. His former salary was , Mr ARCHDALE-PARKHILL - Is there no departmental officer who could have done advances that work equally as well?",35
120,Mr SCULLIN,DEVELOPMENT A ND MIGRATION,"Havin g gone into the matter very thoroughly the Government the came to the conclusion that Mr Gunn, had been attending to developmental for the commission, andof whose very good reports had been made, was specially qualified for the job. 'He had won the. confidence of the"" Goyer.has a ments in the States where works under the agreement'are being carried out, and I do not think the Commonwealth could relieve any officer who could discharge these duties so well. Over several years Mr 'Gunn has gained special .knowledge - of the developactivities of the' Commission"" In any case we were underan obligation to retain his services until August, 1931, at £2,500 per annum; consequently ,'we v ' We learned that another, member, of'the commission, Mr Devereux, was highly regarded amongst wool men as a Wool He had about four years tof'go tb to"" complete 'his term *of appointment; : and his salary was £4,000per annum. It was necessary, therefore, that we should place him in useful service. In consultation with the representatives of'the ""Wool Council, the Government ascertained that the council was anxious to secure the services of a good man in London to advise it on certain aspects of the marketing of wool. The council regarded Mr. Devereux. as a man admirably suited for that work, and an arrangement was made to loan him to the council on the condition that the Government, should pay £2,500 per annum towards his salary for four years, and that the council should pay the balance and provide office equipment, and meet all other expenditure in London. Mr E. RILEY - What service will Mr. Devereux give to the Commonwealth?",35
121,Mr SCULLIN,DEVELOPMENT A ND MIGRATION,"He will serve the wool interests of Australia, and that, at mission. present, is a. very important service.",36
122,Mr GHOTJOH,DEVELOPMENT A ND MIGRATION,"What is the arrangement with regard to Dr Rivett? Mr Scullin"" - He is now connected with the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, and his services are available ""in that capacity to the advisory committee. Mr Mulvany ' will return to the Department of Markets as' Secretary. --- * Honourable members are aware that the Department of: Markets, and Transport has been divided. The Department of Markets is expanding rapidly, and will provide ample scope for Mr Mulvany's services-. I have laid upon the' table the agreements, that have'-been made,with these persons. ,It lia3 been stated that, although the Government has claimed ' to be saving approximately £50,000 on the administrative side of the Development and Stigration' Commission's work,- and approximately £S0',000 in passage money, this is not so,, because the transferred officers have merely gOhe into' various partment's and their salaries are being charged to thosfc departments. That is hot the case. The whole of the salaries of"" the Officers taken into departments' have been charged against development and migration, with the exception of the salaries bf Mr Devereux, who hag been found work in another capacity; Mr. Mulvany, who has gone back to his old position as Secretary of the Department of Markets; and Mr Farrands, who is a permanent officer of the Public Service, and has taken the'place in the High Commissioner's Office rendered vacant by the return to Australia of the Assistant Secretary. The Government has gone to a great deal of trouble to place .in employment outside the members of the staff of the commission whose services were dispensed with. Some of these officers have gone back to the State departments with which they were formerly connected and from which they were, loaned to the com1 I wish to emphasize that the Commonwealth pledged its word to the British Government that it would see that all the migrants brought to Australia under the £34,000,000 agreement were satisfactorily settled. Many, .of them have not been satisfactorily settled. The British Auditor General, in a report on this subject, said: "" There is no definite evidence forthcoming of satisfactory .settlement."" A good deal has been done by various organizations to settle the migrants who were brought here. But unfortunately it was believed that if the migrants who came to Australia with high hopes for the future - were placed in even temporary positions, everything would be all right. Many of these people were found work in the country in the harvest fields and elsewhere; but it was usually seasonal employment which gave out in six or eight weeks. The. migrants then found themselves out of work and drifted back to the cities: I have met large numbers of them in my own electorate. Even in recent months, I have.met some of them deonthe roads looking for work. I wish to say quite definitely that, while our first obligation,' as a community, is to find work for our own people, we have a special obligation' to settle satisfactorily the migrants who were brought to Australia under the terms of the Migration Agreement. For a long while Australia pursued the policy at a continually accelerating pace of importing workers, and importing work in the form of manufactured goods; but it was apparent that sooner or later that would get us into difficulties. The difficulties are now fronting us, and the Government has faced them. It is often said that a large population is an asset to a country; but the statement is only true with qualifications. If a large population is usefully employed in producing wealth, it is an asset, but if employment cannot be found for it, it is a liability. We should only bring people here from other parts of the world when wo can provide work for them. If we attempt to make the stream flow too rapidly, we will cause extreme difficulty and injure not only the people whom we bring here but our own people as well.",36
123,Mr QTJLLBTT,DEVELOPMENT A ND MIGRATION,I take it that the Minister does not suggest that assisted migrants were coming here in large numbers at the time his Government assumed office ?,37
124,Mr SCULLIN,DEVELOPMENT A ND MIGRATION,"At that time the number of assisted migrants arriving here had been considerably reduced. About 120,000 assisted migrants have been brought here in the five years since the agreement has been operating. This has involved an expenditure in passage money of approximately £233,000 per annum. The amount provided by this Government for assisted passages last year was £100,000. The amount that we will provide on the Estimates for 1930-31 for this purpose is £20,000.",37
125,Mr MAXWELL,DEVELOPMENT A ND MIGRATION,How many migrants will that provide for?,37
126,Mr SCULLIN,DEVELOPMENT A ND MIGRATION,"Betwee n 2,000 and 3,000; and many of these will be persons who are coming here to rejoin their families. The expenditure, therefore, must be regarded as humane. We must strive to deal justly with the migrants who have been brought here, and at the same time deal justly with our own workers who are out of employment. The migrants brought here under the agreement, and our Australian workers, have an equal claim upon us.. But a very serious position is facing th* Commonwealth and State Governments, for there is a great deal of unemployment in Australia today. The money that the Government issaving on the administrative side of the Development and con- Migration Commission will be availablefof expenditure in other directions, andso help us to face our difficulties. Debate (on motion by Dr EARLE PAGE] adjourned. NATIONALITY BILL. SECOND READING. Mr BLAKELEY . (Darling-Minister for Homo Affairs) [5.15] - I move That the bill be now rend a second time. The object of this measure is simply to Prime provide power to prescribe a fee for a certificate of naturalization or for a copy of a certificate. Sub-section 2 of section 32 of the act provides that a person to whom a certificate of naturalization is granted shall not be liable to any fee or charge in respect thereof. It is proposed to omit that sub-section and insert the following:The prescribed fee shall be payable in respect of the grant of each certificate of naturalization. Australia is practically the only British country that makes no charge for naturalization. Great Britain charges £10 for certificates in ordinary cases, and New Zealand charges £2. Canada levies a fee of 5 dollars for each certificate, and makes an additional charge of 50 cents for the taking of each oath of allegiance. The fee in the United States of America is 20 dollars. The Commonwealth is involved in cousiderable expense in dealing with applications for naturalization. Special inquiries have to be made and reports obtained in regard to every applicant. A considerable staff is engaged in this work. A fairly large expenditure is also involved in postages, telegrams, stationery and so on. I estimate, from ^figures which have been prepared for me, that it costs the Government at least to grant each application for naturalizatheir tion.",37
127,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,DEVELOPMENT A ND MIGRATION,Does the same staff deal with naturalization with passports?,38
128,Mr BLAKELEY,DEVELOPMENT A ND MIGRATION,Not necessarily.,38
129,Mr LATHAM,DEVELOPMENT A ND MIGRATION,It is entirely different work.,38
130,Mr BLAKELEY,DEVELOPMENT A ND MIGRATION,"That is so. Special a potentially great nation. officers of the Attorney-General's Departuot ment, and particularly of the Investigawhen tion Branch of it, dealing with nothing except naturalization, are engaged in this work. The Government offers special privileges to naturalized sons, for after 20 years' residence Australia, they become eligible for old age and invalid pensions. The wife of a naturalized person is also eligible to readjourned. ceive the maternity allowance. It seems to me that the greatest privilege that can be conferred upon a person who comes to reside in Australia from elsewhere is naturalization, for this is a great country, and citizenship of it is worth a great Advantages unparalleled in the history of civilization are available to the nationals who come here from other countries. It is often said that privileges which cost nothing are regarded as of little value, and there is a great way of amendmentdeal of truth in the statement. That privilege is becoming more more appreciated by the various nationals as they reach the stage of having resided five years within Australia, and become eligible to make application for naturalization. In 1925, the number of certificates granted was 909; in 1926, 1,169; in 1927, 1,122; in 192S, 1,C35, and in 1929, 1,732. It will, therefore, be seen that the number of persons making application for naturalization is rapidly increasing, and has practically doubled within six years. Mr E. RILEY - What charge is to be made for naturalization?",38
131,Mr BLAKELEY,DEVELOPMENT A ND MIGRATION,"The charge will be £3 per certificate. The practice of applying for naturalization certificates is becoming increasingly popular among these nationals, particularly in view of the £1 determination of the governments of countries of origin to prevent as far as possible migration from those countries, and the naturalization of their subas jects in other countries. As a result it has been necessary to increase the staff which deals with these applications. The Government believes that it is conferring a great privilege indeed upon foreigners who come to this country by giving to them an opportunity to become citizens of It is extortionate to ask these nationals, making these applications, to pay to the. Consolidated Revenue a sum of £3 per certificate so that we may be comXiensated to some extent for the liabilities perwhich we incur by accepting them as in citizens of the Commonwealth. . Debate (on motion by Mr LATHAM) NA BILL. In committee (Consideration resumed deal. from 9th May, vide page 1670) : Clause 2The Cotton Bounty Act 1026 is repealed. Upon which Mr Forde had moved by That the clause be omitted with a view and to insert in ,lieu thereof:-""2 -(1. ) The Cotton Bounty Act 1926 is, subject to this section, repealed. (2.) The' provisions of the Cotton Bounty Act 1926 shall remain in force to the"" extent necessary to authorize payment of bounty on(n) seed cotton grown in Australia, delivered to a place appointed under that act, and graded as prescribed by that act, prior to the commencement of this act; and (6) cotton yarn manufactured in Australia prior to the commencement of this act and in the 'manufacture of which not less than fifty per centum of Australian-grown cotton has beep used, and upon which bounty has not been paid prior to such commencement. (3.) All the provisions of the Cotton Bounty. Act 1926 shall remain in force in respect of the payment of bounty under the last preceding sub-section, and shall, so far as. applicable, extend to, and be deemed to authorize, the payment of bounty upon cotton yarn manufactured in Australia the materials used in the manufacture of which consist, to the extent of at least ninety per centum, 'of Australian grown cotton, and, in the remainder, of cotton imported by the manufacturer prior to the first day of April One thousand nine hundred 'and' thirty.""",38
132,Mr FRANCIS,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"Moreton) [5.25] Thi3 clause has already been debated at considerable length, and I am taking this opportunity to reply to some.of the objec-. tions to the bill.. The honourable member for Corangamite (Mr Crouch) has, during this debate, said that the bounty is likely to prove useless, that it is unjust to the spinners, and that the cotton mills are not keeping their undertaking to the Tariff Board. I hope to show, during my remarks, that that is not the case, and that, the industry will eventually be a success if given the assistance provided in the bill.",39
133,Mr MAXWELL,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"What does the honourable member mean by "" success "" ?",39
134,Mr FRANCIS,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"I mean that with the assistance now proposed to be given, the industry, both on the primary and on the secondary side, will become permanently and definitely established in the national'life of this country.' The honourable member for Fawkner (Mr. Maxwell) has said that the cotton industry would never be a success, and that thesooner it was wiped out the better it would be for Australia. That is an extraordinarily pessimistic view to take of one of our biggest and most important primary industries, which is likely to develop into an important secondary industry. The honourable member's statement has no foundation in fact! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gullett) said that smashing duties, under this and other legislation, particularly the customs tariff, would increase unemployment. In addition the honourable member for Werriwa -(Mr Lazzarini) had considerable doubt as to whether the proposals of the Government were wise, but he did uot go so far as to oppose'the-bill. . For a number of years I have made a careful examination of this industry and, as a result, I am convinced that it is one of the few big industries remaining' to Australia that can be developed on the primary and secondary side. Our first attention in Australia's development should be. given to industries by which primary products can be produced in Australia, while, at the same time, there is a large demand for the secondary products of that industry. Cotton-growing fully complies with these conditions. There are, in Queensland, hundreds, of thousands of acres' of land with the required rainfall and temperature, suitable for the production of cotton.' Cotton was first produced in Queensland in 1860, and the industry has had various vicissitudes. It was revived in 1913, and steadily improved until 19191920, when. 45,500 - lb. of cotton were produced. In - subsequent years the development wasreally remarkable. For the information of honourable members, I submit some particulars concerning the development and possibilities of the cotton industry which has recently been, developed in Queensland. Following upon the shortage of cotton during the war, and because the urgent need for the-.Empire-to be self-supporting in this and other essential commodities was 1 realized, - a search was made by the cotton-spinning industry of Great Britain to ascertain the most - suitable country within the Empire in which superior, long-stapled cotton could be produced. After an exhaustive investigation the sub-tropical areas and forest lands of Queensland were, considered to be .the most suitable for the establishment, of the long-stapled cotton industry, and in. that State the in'dustry has been developed. The honourable member for Fawkner has stated - that the cotton industry has not developed. Mr -.MAXWELL -- I did not. I said that there was no-evidence before us that the industry was nearer ; being self-supporting-that it was five years ago when we invested £900,000 in i i . V",39
135,Mr FRANCIS,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"Le t me say that the industry ou both the primary aud the secondary side has materially developed, and if given the assistance now asked for, will become permanently established in the national life of this couutry as one of our most important industries, having the widest scope for development.",40
136,Mr MAXWELL,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"""Will the industry be able to develop without further assistance from the Commonwealth Government?",40
137,Mr FRANCIS,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"I am. hopeful that the industry, if given the necessary assistance, will soon be self-supporting. The following figures Will give honourable members some idea of the growth of seed-cotton production in Australia. In .1901, we produced 950,000 lb. of cotton; in 1922, 3,900,000 lb.; in 1923. 11,500,000 lb.; in 1924, 15,000,000 lb -; in 1925, 18,000,000 lb.; in 1926, 11,500,000 lb.; in 1927, 7,069,312 lb.; in 1928, 12,180,259 lb.; and - in .1929, 7,965,339-lb.",40
138,Mr GULLETT,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"Thos e figures do .not indicate"" any considerable development.",40
139,Mr FRANCIS,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"The ' . industry developed .from 950,000 . lb. to 18,000,000 lb - It has . experienced a . number of difficulties. It has had to face the uncertainty of support and the uncertainty of the Commonwealth Government's policy in respect of its development, and what is more, it has had to contend' with the financial depression which is now general throughout Australia. Definite these difficulties, its production .increased from 950,000 lb. to 18,000,000.'. lb. "" .This industry, is peculiarly suitable for development on much of our undeveloped second-class land in sub-tropical, areas, which are as yet sparsely , populated. ' ' ""Australia is under a special obligation 'to assist in developing those areas. , Mr MAXWELL.:-What does all this ..development cost ? . "" - Mr Francis -^-Taking into consideration thepossibilities of this great industry, I am sure that we' would be 1 amply repaid for the little expenditure that we are now asked to incur. The cotton plant itself is eminently suitable for the development of the class of area which is now being planted. It has great drought-resisting capacities, and once the plant is established it will resist almost any drought. Many mixed farmers, whose maize and other crops have failed because of drought, have been saved from ruin by the small returns that they received from their cotton areas, which were unaffected by drought. Poultry farmers, pig farmers and others have been abletosupplement their incomes with returns from small crops of seed cotton. I hope that these proposals of the Government, which really represent a superstructure on the ideal founda Minister for Trade, and Customs, will develop the industry in Queensland as I should like to see it developed. There is no danger of over-production. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Gullett) has urged'that we should discard the growing of cotton "" : Mr LATHAM:-The honourable member for Henty! He was not speaking in his - official capacity.",40
140,Mr FRANCIS,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"I am glad-of the correction. The honourable .member, of course, was not speaking for the Opposition, but was expressinghis personal views on the bill. He said - that we should discard the growing of cotton, and develop the production of maize and butter. . I remind him - that today ' there is overproduction' of those' commodities. : - Mr GUL'ESETT - The production of butter is'highly profitable; * 1 i ."" ' n . Mr Francis' - Certainl y it is. But why should we' go out of this industry, which in both its primary and secondary sections may 'be'come one of the best that we have, in order to' develop the butter ' and'maize'industries^'in which we are at present oyer producing? The'value of the ' cotton* go'o'ds ""that"" Australia imports is £11,000,000 annually. There is thus a field for considerable deA-elopment on the secondary side of the industry.",40
141,Mr MAXWELL,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,Why not try producing tea ? .,41
142,Mr FRANCIS,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"I leave it to the honourable member for Fawkner to advocate that. My duty is to prove to the committee that these proposals of the Government are in the best interests of a very important primary and secondary industry. If the honourable member for Fawkner can make out for tea as good a case as can bo made out for cotton growing, I shall be pleased to support him. If the secondary side of the cotton growing industry cau be developed to the extent of reducing materially our importations of cotton goods, employment will be found for probably 20,000 workers, and that would mean the provision of sustenance for approximately 80,000 persons. Some significant facts are associated with the part that cotton plays in the general life of the community. nexion with defence, it is necessary to the manufacturers of cordite, without which no rifle or big gun can be discharged. It enters into the manufacture of motor cars to a greater extent than does rubber; and whether in peace or war, motor transport is indispensable to Australia. It covers the widest field in the textile industry, being used in the manufacture of the coarsest canvas as well as the finest muslin - It forms the basis of the artificial silk industry. It is the raw material of the knitted underwear and hosiery industry. It is used in the woollen manufactories. Its by-products are used by margarine and soap-makers. It provides the dairyman and the poulterer with a valuable stock food. To the paper-maker it supplies a high class pulp. Bedding manufacturers, upholsterers and motor car body builders use the waddings . that are made for cotton waste and the lower grades of cotton. There is scarcely an industry, and certainly not a home, in which cotton in some form or other is not used. From Chemistry and Industry of the United States of America, I quote the following statement to illustrate the importance of this industry. If I were asked "" What won the w a r "" ? 1 would unhesitatingly answer, ""The cotton plant."" Let us consider for n moment some of the things the cotton plant contributed. The four outstanding things required by a soldier in any war are food, clothing, housing and ammunition. Second only in importance to the nitrogenous foods for soldiers are the fats that they must have. Most of the lard consumed by our armies was compound lard, made from cotton-seed oil. Much of the butter they ate was oleomargarine, of which cotton-seed oil was the principal component. The dairy products aud meat which they consumed came from cattle largely fed with cotton-seed meal and hulls. Much of the clothing of our soldiers was made of cotton. Their hats were made of felt, a product of cotton linters. The buttons on their uniforms, when not metal, were celluloid, also a product of cotton linters. The 'artificial leather used in their equipment was made from cotton linters, and the real leather came from cattle which were fed on cotton seed meal and hulls. The tents which covered our soldiers were made of cotton, the mattresses upon which they slept were stuffed with cotton and their bedclothes were either made from cotton or from wool of sheep which were In con- fed to a large extent ou cotton-seed meal. The basis of ammunition, or explosives, was cellulose and glycerides, one coming from cotton linters and the other from cotton oil. This was such an important factor during the World War that the War Department took over all the cotton-seed oil mills and operated them under licence. Can you find one single source that contributed so much to the welfare of our soldiers as the cotton plant? It may not hare won the war, but we certainly could not have won without it . The cotton-seed produces four main products: the linters, meal, hulls, and oil. A resumd of the history of the cotton seed products industry will show that within a space of half a century the chemist has developed from this little insignificant seed sixteen 'principal commercial products and hundreds of minor ones. To-day there are hundreds of millions of dollars invested in plants using the cotton seed as a raw material, and this is the second largest manufacturing industry in the southern States. It is not, however, confined to the southern States, for most of the large refineries producing the finished products are located in the big cities of the east and middle west. Hundreds of chemists have made this little cotton-seed their life study, and it is entirely through the science of chemistry that ithe. industry bus been developed. The following list will prove Linters - Mixing with Cotton seed< Hulls Paper stock Cake and meal Feed for Cotton seedOil [67] how wide are its ramifications:Batting Waddnig 'Pads Cushions Stuffing material for - Comforts Horse Collars [Upholstery Absorbent cotton Mixing with shoddy lamb's wool for fleece-lined underwear I Mixing with wool in hat-making Felt Artificial leather Lamp and candle wicks Low grade yarns Twine Rope Carpets Artificial silk Cellulose Writing paper Basis for explosives (Celluloid toilet articles Feed Fertilizer Household utensils Fibre { Stuffing for horse collars Basis for explosives Fertilizer Dyestuffs 'Cattle Poultry Horse I Swine Food ""Confectionery f Bread Cake [Flour .Cracker Winter yellow oil Summer white oil Winter white oil Lard compounds Lard substitutes Edible products Stearin Hydrogenated fat Butter oil Cooking oil Salad oil Oleomargarine Summer yellow oil - Butterine Setting olives Packing sardines Laundry and toilet soap Candles Medicinal emulsion Miscellaneous Cosmetics Miners' illuminating oil Lubricating oil Tempering edge tools Mixing with putty Paints ""Soap Washing powder Soap stock Glycerol Roofing tar Dyestuffs, paint The by-products obtained annually from cotton seed alone in the United States of America are valued at over £100,000,000. In this direction also there is room for considerable development in Australia. The scheme devised by the late Mr. Pratten, when Minister for Trade and Customs, of which these proposals are the superstructure, provided for the payment of a bounty amounting to £900,000, of which £600,000 was to be used to encourage the development of cotton growing lands, and £300,000 was to be set aside for the development of the secondary section of the industry.",41
143,Mr MAXWELL,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,The honourable member will remember that that was supposed to complete the structure.,43
144,Mr FRANCIS,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"I shall deal with that supposition; and I am certain that when I have done so the honourable member for Fawkner will change his attitude towards this bill, an attitude which, unfortunately, is identical with that adopted by him five years ago. The proposals of the then Minister for Trade and Customs were^ designed to ensure ultimately the success of the industry. Unfortunately, however, he had to depend upon the secondary side of the industry to give effect to his policy. Misfortune overtook the industry when the biggest firm of cotton-spinners, G, A. Bond & Company Limited, was compelled to go into liquidation. The reason for that was, not lack of support by the Government, but over-capitalization and bad management. The Chairman of Directors of the firm, Mr G. A. Bond, drew such extraordinary fees and allowances from the company, and paid such liberal gratuities and allowances to his relatives and friends, that the firm was compelled to go into liquidation. Upon an application that was made by the liquidators and others interested in' the company, a New South Wales court ordered Mr. Bond to return to the liquidators the sum of £90,000, which in its opinion had been wrongly drawn from the firm. Such extraordinary happenings could not be foreseen. The great cotton-growing industry ought not to be condemned by honourable members because of its failure to make the progress expected, when that failure was due to these extraordinary misfortunes with which it has been beset. The firm of G. A. Bond & Company Limited has since been re-established, and proof has been afforded that it is able to produce cotton yarn at a price considerably below that at which it gave an undertaking before the Tariff Board to sell it.  to reach fruition because of this particular mishap to one of the biggest establishments for the manufacture of cotton yarn.",43
145,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,How many growers are there in the electorate of the honourable member?,43
146,Mr FRANCIS,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"I am not here to put the parochial view of my electorate. This industry, I believe, will do much to relieve the distress that exists throughout Australia today. I speak not as the representative of Moreton, but as a Queenslander and an Australian, and as one who has the utmost confidence in the ability of the industry, ultimately, to prove completely successful. The failure of certain large spinning companies to establish branch factories in Australia, as they promised that they would do, contributed to the disappointments the industry has experienced, and prevented it from making that progress which every well-wisher had a right to expect. This measure, which has been built on the late Government's proposals, and which provides for additional tariff duties on certain imported cotton goods and yarns, should ensure the permanent establishment of the industry in Australia. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gullett) has contended that the lands on which cotton is grown today are suitable for dairying, and maize and lucerne-growing. That is true to only a limited extent; it applies only to the richer lands, and not to those on which cotton can and should be grown. Cotton is best grown on second-class forest land. When it is grown on richer country there is too much wood and leaf, and encouragement is thus provided for the increase of insect pests. There is the further disadvantage also that a sufficient number of bolls is not formed. It is not profitable crop unless grown on what is by no means ideal dairying land, and certainly land which is not necessarily suitable for the growing of maize or lucerne. It may also be pointed out that we are overproducing sack things as butter, .maize, &c, but we are certainly not producing too miuch cotton. There is a local market fx>i 120,000 ibales of cotton a year, and we are producing only 9,000 bales. ""We are importing £11,000,000 worth of cotton goods each year. In fact, cotton is the largest single item on our whole list of imports. If all the.cotton we needed were produced in Australia, it would require 300,-000 acres of laud to grow it. That would promote closer settlement, and furnish much employment in field and mill.",43
147,Mr MAXWELL,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"If cotton'can be prospinners, duced in Australia at payable prices, should it be necessary to induce people grow it?",44
148,Mr FRANCIS,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"Practicall y all our Australian industries have required a tain amount of encouragement in their initial stages. All I ask is that this try should be given the same measure of encouragement and protection that has been given to others from time to time. : am convinced that honourable members will never regret giving this assistance to an industry which has every prospect of season's developing into one of great importance. The honourable member for Corangamite (Mr Crouch) referred to the knitting mills at Maryborough, Victoria. not agree with him that the mills have had to pay more for cotton yarn since the imposition of the new tariff. They have been asked a higher price for percentage yarns, but not for pure cotton yarns. Most honourable members who debated this bill on Friday last directed their remarks against the tariff. Without desiring to reflect in any way on the Chair, I consider that a general debate on the tariff should not be allowed ou a measure such as this, the purpose of which is to provide for the payment of a bounty on cotton and cotton yarn.",44
149,Mr GULLETT,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,This is merely part of the assistance which has been given to the industry; the whole thing should be taken together.,44
150,Mr FRANCIS,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"The policy of the present Government on this matter is the same as that of the last Government. The present bounty was to continue for one year only, but in this bill it is proposed to continue the bounty on a graduated scale until September, 1936. The 'Only alternative to that would be to let the ^cotton-growing and spinning industries die out. If that were done, the £400,000 which has already been paid in bounty would be wasted, as would be the capital invested in the industry, and the grants made by the Queensland Government through the Cotton Board.",44

It Iras been alleged by some honourable members that the price of cotton goods has been cerincreased since the new tariff became operative. In order to test the truth of industhat assertion, I wrote to one of the largest firms in Ballarat engaged in the manufacture of cotton goods, and asked I for a comparison of prices for this year and last. Their reply is as follows:In answer to your question, "" How this prices compare wit h last season's, both in underwear and half hose,"" we have pleasure in stating below some of the prices, and from them you will note that a reduction from 15 per cent, upwards has taken place:I do IN HALF-HOSE.

It is evident that there has been a reduccelanese tion of at least 15 per cent, jn prices since last year. The quality of the goods made by this firm is excellent; they can bear comparison with those produced in any part of the world. Only this week the firm received a repeat order from New Zealand for 500 dozen half-hose. They are today competing successfully in Now Zealand against German and British manufacturers. That letter is a complete answer to the statements of the honor hill), who said, among other things, that he did not know how I would be able to face the poorer people in my constituency in view of the increased prices of cotton wearing apparel brought about by the tariff. If there is to be a monopoly in the manufacture of cotton g6ods, I prefer that the monopoly should be in Australia, where we have a chance of dealing with it. However, there is no danger of a monopoly. Since this Government has increased the tariff, knitting mills are springing up everywhere, and for the most part they are successful. ! t is not fair to quote the example of the mills nt Maryborough. This firm was established by Messrs. Cuttle and Schemp, and the first factory was opened at Clunes. There it Avas successful, and the factory was later moved to Maryborough. Later Mr Cuttle died, and the other partner was handicapped through illness. The, firm did not prosper, but it was not because the price of cotton yarn was raised unduly.",44
153,Mr GKEGOBY,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,What is the reason for the increase in the price of cotton goods hi drapers' shops?,45
154,Mr MCGRATH,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"I think that, the drapers must be responsible; at any rate, it is evident that the manufacturers are not. If the drapers increase the price of goods to the public it is not fair to blame the manufacturers or the tariff.",45
155,Mr MAXWELL,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,What is the reason for the drop in manufacturers' prices?,45
156,Mr MCGRATH,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"In the case of the firm I have mentioned, much of their success may be attributed to skilful management, and the adoption of progressive methods. They have fitted their factory with the best machinery that obtained. They are now installing motors and machinery 'for the manufacture of goods, this being the first firm to undertake this class of work in Australia. In November of last year they were struggling along in a small way, employing only about 100 persons. When the new tariff was brought down, they obtained a new lease of life, and the directors went courageously forward to take advantage of the new market provided. The almost immediate result has been a reduction in prices of 15 per cent, to the retailers. That is sufficient answer to the free traders who say that protection increases prices. The honourable  challenged me to justify my support of the Government's policy before my electors. I have accepted his challenge, and any time the honourable member visits Ballarat I shall be pleased to show him over the factory to which I have referred. Much of Queensland is tropical, and it is our duty to foster the cotton-growing industry, which is suitable for such latitudes. Even if we have to pay something more for our cotton goods we should do our part to develop the tropical portions of that State.",45
157,Mr BERNARD CORSER,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"Wide Bay) [6.5] - I was one of those who supported the second reading of this bill, and it is natural that I should be interested in the amendments which the Minister has brought down. Those amendments, it seems to me, are in some respects opposed to the spirit of the original bill. None of the honourable members who have spoken to these amendments have really dealt with the amendments themselves. I make an exception in favour of the honourable member for Eremantle (Mr. Curtin); but he merely mentioned the fact without touching the amendments; all the others dealt with the tariff. I regret that, in doing so, they went so far as to challenge the right of the cotton industry to protection. The present duty on cotton products was imposed because the spinners said such action was necessary and it is not fair to charge the cotton-growers of Australia with the whole responsibility of the protection which the industry is receiving. The honourable member for Eawkner (Mr. can be Maxwell) referred to the fact that £900,000 had been made available for the assistance of the industry by the late Government, but he did not mention that, for reasons over which the growers had no control, £640,000 of that amount was never used at all. It was not made available because of conditions affecting the secondary side of the industry; conditions with which the growers had no direct concern. It was intended that the primary side of the industry should be built up through the encouragement afforded to the secondary branch-encouragemen t which would induce the manufacturers to use seed cotton grown in Australia. It was considered that the assistance given by the Bruce-Page Government would be sufficient to develop the primary, as well as the secondary, side of the industry. Afterwards, it was claimed by the manufacturers and spinners that the protection was not sufficient to enable them to carry To-day the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH) made the interesting statement that machinery is being installed in his electorate that surpasses anything previously used in this industry in Australia. That is gratifying to the cotton-grower, who has always realized that the trouble in the disposal of his product and the marketing of the manufactured goods has been due to obsolete equipment and unscientific methods of manufacture, which did not enable the Australian factories to compete with the goods of other countries. Auy shortcomings in this respect are not to be accepted as evidence that the grower has failed, or that cotton cannot be grOwn in Australia.",45
158,Mr MAXWELL,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,Can it be grown at payable price without government assistmembers ance?,46
159,Mr CORSER,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"The success of the produced grower is dependent largely upon successful use of his product in the secondary industries. If a spinning company failed because the managing director was drawing £10,000 a year from the business, and relatives were receiving amounts that were afterwards questioned in court, and as a result of the use of being out-of-date machinery, the penalty should not be visited - upon the growers who pay Australian rates of disagree wages for everything they use in the be production of their crop. Memother bers of all parties in this chamber claim that the labourer must be properly compensated, and that Australian standards of living must be maintained. Can we ask the cotton-grower to comply with those conditions and yet produce in competition with the products of black labour?  price is all right if the public can afford to pay it.",46
160,Mr CORSER,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"The Australian public has already paid for lots of things. Even Western Australia has been successful in getting a substantial payment from the Commonwealth exchequer. The honor complains because the State Governments are to be asked to accept 50 per cent, of the liability in respect of the guaranteed on. price for wheat. When the honourable member's own industry is concerned, he asks for the same assistance from the Commonwealth as is given to the cotton industry. The cotton bounty is one of the few contributions made by the federal authority to Queensland industry. The people of my State have not benefited by the construction of the east-west railway.  industry?",46
161,Mr CORSER,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"Does the honourable member complain of the assistance given by the Commonwealth to develop a portion of Australia in which those members who live about the southern capitals would not reside? Cotton production is not solely a Queensland industry. In Western Australia are idle lands well adapted for a cotton-growing, and I advise honourable representing that State to urge their people to take advantage of this measure. Already Western Australia has small quantities of cotton quite the suitable for the local market.",46
162,Unknown,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,Sitting suspended from 6.15 to S p.m.,46
163,Mr BERNARD CORSER,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"The honourable member for Henty (Mr. Gullett) spoke in glowing terms of the nature of the country in which cotton is grown in Queensland. He said that it was second to none in Australia. I agree with him in that regard; but I with his contention that it would better if this country were put to some use than cotton-growing. Cotton is a product for which 'there is a large market in Australia, whereas there is not a"" large available market for ''some of the other commodities that these farmers could produce. It is highly desirable that Australia should endeavour to produce here some of the commodities that she is at present importing, rather than that she should extend her production in lines which she already finds it difficult to export. The cotton industry offers very great possibilities, and if we can develop it on sound lines we shall be able to settle ten producers where there is only one today. It is desirable, therefore, that the Commonwealth Government as well as the State Government should do everything possible to encourage the industry. The Bruce-Page Government set a good example in this respect. It was the first Government which endeavoured to develop the industry in both its primary ancl secondary branches. It was the first administration to provide a bounty on cotton yarn. The bill now before us provides for an extension of the period in which the bounty will be payable. The bounty granted under the 1926 act was for cotton yarn made in Australia which contained 50 per cent, of Australian cotton. At that time the Australian spinners and cotton experts argued that Australian-grown cotton was of a superior quality, and that it was necessary to mix it with a proportion of inferior imported cotton. The policy adopted by the previous Government was considered to be wise.",46
164,Mr BLAKELEY,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,Wh v stone-wall the bill?,47
165,Mr BERNARD CORSER,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"I am not stone-walling it. This measure is of vital importance to Queensland and Australia, and I consider it necessary to reply to some of the criticism to which it has been subjected. I am leading up to the amendment now before the Chair, which the. Minister did not explain. He merely said that it had been prepared at the request of the spinners. Although the scheme propounded by the previous Government was declared by all sections of the industry to be satisfactory, the spinners suddenly came to the conclusion that they needed more assistance. They declared tL-t they had accumulated large stocks of Australian cotton which they could not usef but had to leave lying about in bales. They claimed that they should be given an increased bounty if they used it, and conducted a vigorous agitation, which eventually gained them their end. Apparently the manufacturers will use their accumulated stocks of Australian cotton if this amendment is agreed to. We need to be careful that we do not grant the manufacturers assistance at the expense of the cotton-growers. The bill provides for a gradual reduction of the bounty to be paid to the cottoiigrowers, although they will still be required to observe Australian wages and conditions in their operations. In the past the cotton-growers have had to be satisfied with a return of 4d., 4£d., or 5d. per lb. for their cotton, and out of this they have had to pay from l f d . to 2d. per lb. to the cotton-pickers. Notwithstanding this, the manufacturers will reap the whole of the advantage of this amendment if it is agreed to. The manufacturer should be obliged to pay the producer a fair price for his cotton, particularly as the amount of the bounty will be gradually diminished until, in 1936, it will amount to only £d. per lb. I was astonished at the list of amendments to this bill tabled by the Acting Minister. The purpose of the amendment under notice at the moment is to authorize the payment of bounty provided under the Cotton Bounty Act of 1926 on(a) seed cotton grown in Australia, delivered to a place appointed under that act, and graded as prescribed by that act, prior to the commencement of this act; and (6) cotton yarn manufactured in Australia prior to the commencement of this act and in the manufacture of which not less than fifty per centum of Australian-grown cotton has been used, and upon which bounty has not been paid prior to such commencement. This really means that the spinners will be able to get the full advantage of the 1926 act on stocks of cotton which they have on hand, but have not used, and at the same time reap the increased advantages afforded by the provisions of this bill. The amendment, therefore, is wholly to the advantage of the spinner, which leads me to insist that we must not lose sight of the fact that, if the cotton industry is to prosper in Australia, the welfare of the cotton-grower must be the prime consideration. It is a somewhat poor outlook for the grower that the bounty of l ^ d. is to diminish gradually until 1936, when it will amount to only i d . per lb. After that year uo bounty will be payable, and the cottongrower will be dependent upon the cottonspinner. If we are not careful we shall destroy this industry at its base. I think the Acting Minister should have given us a little more information to justify the acceptance of this amendment.",47
166,Mr MAXWELL,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"B y increasing duty in favour of the manufacturer, and insisting that he pay a certain price to the grower, would wo not be continuing the bounty in another form?",48
167,Mr BERNARD CORSER,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"Not necessarily; because wrapt up with this question is the ecouomic position, Drought about by the Atistralian standard of living. We must protect our growers from the competition of growers in black labour countries. Unless we give them some assistance, at least equal to the basic wage in secondary industries, we shall be working on a wrong basis altogether. Therefore we cannot complain . if the industry is given some protection, even by way of tariff revision. I cannot see that that assistance could be taken as being equivalent to a bounty. really providing for the policy which has determined the Australian standard of living. In giving effect to that policy we must protect the producers of Australia, so that they may be on an equal footing with other sections of the community, who, in turn are protected by industrial awards, or by tariff duties on those commodities that the producers have to buy. While some honourable members may claim that it is wrong to increase our tariff, at the same time it must be recognized that if we are to take away bounties, we must substitute an effective tariff. The policy of this Government is eventually ito abolish all bounties. I would sooner have the bounties continued than have any subsequent revision of the tariff.",48
168,Mr MAXWELL,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,Then the honourable member admits that there is no prospect of this primary industry developing without Government assistance?,48
169,Mr BERNARD CORSER,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"I do not claim - that the tariff constitutes Government assistance. It is an assistance given really at the expense of the consumer, and in accordance with the established policy of the country.",48

171,Mr BERNARD CORSER,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"The honourable members who represent Western the Australia would object to any proposal to wipe out the Paterson scheme, because that would adversely affect the ever increasing butter industry of that State. They do not offer any criticism of that scheme.",48
172,Mr GREGORY,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,We voted against it.,48
173,Mr BERNARD CORSER,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"The honourable member would not vote against it today. Recently 1,028 leading professors of economics applied to the Congress of the United States of America for the rejection of increased tariffs before that body, and they also requested the President of the United States of America to exercise his veto on the tariff measures if they were passed by Congress. They gave economic reasons for their action. In their opinion high tariffs were operating adversely against the production of that It is country, and against humanity,' and were forcing up the cost of production, and compelling governments to subsidize waste and inefficiency in industry.",48
174,Mr GREGORY,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,Whic h was quite right.,48
175,Mr BERNARD CORSER,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"If a similar argument is to be used against the tariffs imposed in this country, and if eventually the tariff is--to be varied, then we should still reserve the right to return at least to the direct 1-Jd. bounty which the cotton-grower has enjoyed in the past.",48
176,The CHAIRMAN,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,Mr MCGRATH) The honourable member's time has exr pired.,48
177,Mr GULLETT,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"Henty) [8.20.]- I am pleased that the Prime Minister (Mr. Scullin and the Treasurer (Mr Theodore) are present, because I wish to appeal to them, in the interests of the great knitting industry of this country, to . restrain the ardour of this young Acting Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Forde) who desires to speed and bolster up .the cotton-growing industry of Queensland. I shall confine my remarks to the position in which the knitter of Australia is being placed because of the imposition of these new duties on cotton yarns. The knitter is being punished very heavily. Already he has lost a lot of business, and the new duties have brought about a substantial amount of unemployment, which is still increasing. The Acting Minister on Friday last made three statements with reference to the knitter, who in my opinion is being victimized in the interests of the spinner and the cotton-grower - The Acting Minister said that the spinners are now capable of supplying all classes of the yarn which is subject to the new duty, and is required by the knitters at the present time. He also said that the knitters at a conference with the Minister, held some time ago, raised no objection to the new duties on yarn; that the knitters had no grievance today; and that the representations which were being made from this side of the House were so much party politics. I submit, with all respect, to the Acting Minister, that his statements were quite unfounded. It is beyond all question that the spinners today are not supplying the yarns necessary for the carrying on of the large and well-established knitting industry of this country. They are not supplying requirements, and they are not in a position to supply them, and the substitutes that they are offering will not enable the knitters to carry oh their industry satisfactorily. Further, the knitters of this country emphatically deny expressing approval of the imposition of full duties on many classes of yarns which they use. The facts about the alleged agreement by the knitters are these. At a conference held in Sydney in November last, attended by the Acting Minister and certain manufacturers from Victoria and New South Wales as well as representatives of the Austral Silk and Cotton Company and George A. Bond Limited, the matter of a duty on cotton yarns was discussed, and it was eventually agreed that the trade, as represented, would have no objection to the duty of 35 per cent, being placed on soft cotton, or, in other words, white cotton. At that conference Mr Gullett. the matter of coloured cotton and random dyed cotton was discussed, and the spinners' representatives stated that they were quite prepared to allow this yarn to come in free of duty. It was only in March last, that the spinners approached the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Forde), without consulting the manufacturers, in regard to the imposition of a 35 per cent, duty on coloured and random dyed cotton yarn, and this duty was agreed to and imposed on the 10th March, 1930. That actually is the story of this alleged agreement by the knitters in respect of the new duties. The Acting Minister stated most emphatically on Friday last that the knitters had been behind him in extending these duties. The following is an urgent .telegram which I received today from the Secretary of the Hosiery and Knitted Goods Manufacturers Association of Victoria :Executive of the Hosiery and Knitted Goods Manufacturers Association of Victoria embracing all branches of the trade in session today emphatically protest against duties imposed 10th March on all coloured or random dyed, or mixture coloured cotton yarns used in knitting industry. That telegram is perfectly clear. It shows that the statement of the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs that the knitters have agreed to the new duties, is entirely unfounded. I understand that a similar association in New South Wales known as the Hosiery and Knitted Goods Association of New South Wales has agreed to these new duties, but there is this extraordinary fact to be taken into consideration. I am informed that the President of the New South Wales Association is also the Chairman of George A. Bond Limited, the spinners, and that the Vice-Chairman of the Association is Mr. George MCLean, who is the manager of George A. Bond Limited. So that in New South Wales the spinner is also the knitter, and naturally there is no protest from the knitter against these new duties in favour of the spinner. I appeal to the Acting Minister and to the Prime Minister to assent to the repeated request of the knitters of Victoria. The great knitting mills of that State have again and again appealed to the Minister to conveue a conference on this question. They have pointed out that ""they are being penalized, and have been compelled to work short staffed because they cannot Minister:get from the Australian spinners the material which has been made dutiable. They are working short time and are against being progressively compelled to lay-off ing staff. It is remarkable that the Acting Minister should not grant this request for a conference. The following is a letter, written to the Acting Minister, cotton by the secretary of the Hosiery and Knitof ted Goods Manufacturers Association of Victoria, dated 14th March, four days necessity after the wide extension of these duties:A meeting of the committee of the Victorian Knitters Association was held today, at which the officers of the Australian Textile Workers Union were present by invitation. I particularly draw the attention of the Acting Minister to that fact. The letter proceedsAs an outcome of the meeting the committee decided to submit for your earnest and immediate consideration the following resolution :That in view of the serious set-back to the industry as a result of the operation of the recent tariff schedules, which has rosulted in supplies of various yarns urgently required by manufacturers being practically cut off, by reason of the ability of local spinners to make immediate deliveries of yarns, we urgently appeal for au immediate conference to be held for the purpose of investigating the administration of the tariff schedule, and also the apparent inability of local ners of yarns to meet immediate requirements. We respectfully suggest that the following should be represented at such conference:1. The Federal Government. - 2. Manufacturers using all classes yarns. 3. Spinners of all classes of yarns. 4. Australian Textile Workers Union. 5. Parties concerned in Sydney. The Australian Textile Union is behind this request, which is 'an eminently reasonable one. Obviously it is suffering disability because of the operation of the tariff, as its men are being dismissed from their employment. The Acting Minister cannot lightly brush aside the request, in view of the telegram that I have read. He cannot say, as he did again and again on Friday last, that the knitters are satisfied. The following further resolutions were carried by this association and forwarded to the Acting 1. Resolved that a protest be made at the conference with the union representatives the discrimination shown in T.D. 30/205 (6) as between the knitting and weavindustries as it is considered the knitting industry should be on the same favourable basis as the weaving industry. 2. That we emphatically protest against the imposition of duties on coloured and random yarns for the knitting industry in view the fact that same cannot be produced locally at present, and we cannot see the for this imposition of duty when the Australian spinners notified the manufacturers and the Minister that they were not interested in the question of the production of dyed and random dyed yarns. 3. That we emphatically protest against the discrimination ofallowing condensor and waste yarns in free for the towelling, blanket and weaving industries and making them dutiable for the knitting industry. We consider that they should all be on the same basis in accordance with resolution number 1. An extraordinary feature of the refusal of the Acting Minister to allow the by-law admission of yarns for the knitting industry is that he is allowing by-law admission, duty free, in respect of all or a large proportion of the requirements of the weaving industry. He is discriminatin- ing between the weavers and the knitters, and between two classes of employees. His attitude is inscrutable to me. Bond's say that they can supply a substitute for a number of these yarns that they are not spin- manufacturing. Last Friday I quoted the case of the Cosmos Knitting Mills Limited, of Footscray, Victoria. That company spent a year in conducting heavy and expensive experiments, which enabled it to procure a particular type of of material with which it turned out 50,000 boys' jerseys.",48
178,Mr FORDE,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"""What are those garments made of?",50
179,Mr GULLETT,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"A cotton and wool mixture, based on an imported cotton mixture yarn. When the new duties were imposed this firm wrote to Austral Silk and Cotton Mills Limited, and G. A. Bond & Company Limited, asking them to quote for this particular material. The former company repliedWe have to inform you that we do not manufacture mixture colours cotton yarns exactly as your sample. . . . We suggest a substitute by means of twofold or multifold yarns; at any rate individual yarns of appropriate colour to produce a general colour effect. The posticm is that after a company has shown notable enterprise in having manufactured a first-class article based on quite a commonplace cheap British yarn, the action of the Government has had the effect of cutting off its supplies, and all that it can obtain is an inferior substitute manufactured in Australia. Can it be expected that under those circumstances its business can be carried on without loss, and that unemployment will not result? During the course of this debate reference has been made to the increased number of factories established, and the manufacturing activities that have been induced by the operation of the new tariff schedules. But the fact has been ignored that since this Government came into office the ratio of unemployment has increased from 12i per cent, to 14J per cent. In the light of this hopelessly unbusinesslike handling of the matter, and the positive discrimination shown between one section' and another, I do not wonder that unemployment is increasing.",50
180,Mr BLAKELEY,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"The honourable member's Government was responsible for the unemployment; it wasted, squandered, and mismanaged.",51
181,Mr GULLETT,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"The increase of 2 per cent, in the unemployment figures has occurred since the present Government came into power. I do not say that it has been entirely due to the Government; but I do say that violent changes of this character lead to all sorts of unexpected consequences, and that for a long time they will do more harm than good. I have a number of definite requests to make to the Minister, aud I trust that he will give them consideration. I do not wish to receive any more of the cheap abuse that he has formerly engaged in, nor to have the good old charge of being a free trader levelled against me. I am not at present opposing either the duty or the bounty; but I ask that, in administering them, some consideration be shown to the most important of all the branches of industry associated with cotton today, the knitting industry, in which are invested large sums of money in the establishment of extensive factories and the employment of thousands of workers. It is being penalized for the benefit of other branches that may be established in the future. I ask the Acting Minister not to rush this matter, but to take it quietly. Why should he aim to bring about a big extension of the cotton-growing industry in Queensland ? Why not be satisfied with the existing acreage for a year? I suggest that he make this change gradually, and with a minimum amount of dislocation, financial loss, and unemployment in the knitting industry. Yarn is a raw material; not a manufactured article. Labour represents about 75 per cent, of the value of the cotton goods that are manufactured in Australia from imported yarn. I ask the Minister to allow in free under by-law all yarn that was on firm order before the new duties were imposed; that all mixture yarns required be allowed in free until an exact yarn is being spun within the Commonwealth; and that condensor yarns be admitted under security to all manufacturers irrespective of the purpose for which they are to be used. At the moment I believe that very little condensor yarn is being made here. I appeal also for the admission of dyed and random-dyed yarns that are not now being supplied in sufficient quantities to meet the demand. Finally, I ask for the admission of heather mixture yarns duty free under by-law, as they are not being manufactured in Australia. I appeal for these admissions to be made retrospective where it can be shown that the knitters have not been passing on the increased duties. These yarns must be imported until the spinners in Australia are spinning them, if the knitting mills are not to close their establishments. To impose a duty on them is merely to place a tax on raw material to the detriment of the manufacturers and the workers in the knitting mills of this country. It is a foolish as well as an unprincipled actiou. To-day there are 50 knitting employees to every spinning employee. The disproportion is remarkable. I again appeal to the Minister to agree to the request for a conference, and to meet the knitters as far as he possibly can.",51
182,Mr MACKAY,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"Lilley) [8.45] - The Acting Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Forde) has at all times been most enthusiastic in advocating the claims of the cotton industry. Now that power has been placed in his hands he has gone as far as it is possible to go to foster that industry. Many attempts have been made in Queensland in the past to establish the cotton industry, but the great difficulty has always been the cost of production. The cost of picking cotton in Queensland varies from 1-Jd. to 2d. per ft., whereas in the United States of America it is as low as i d . and $d. per lb.",51
183,Mr FORDE,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,Cotto n is picked largely by coloured labour in the United States of America.,52
184,Mr MACKAY,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"That is true. Australia coloured labour would not be tolerated. We must pay white labour for the job, and that is what has constituted the difficulty right from the beginning. No one suggests that it is not possible to grow enough cotton in Queensland to supply Australia a dozen times over. The obstacle is that it costs too much to harvest the crop. In the district in which I live one man planted 1,000 acres of cotton in one of the boom periods, thinking that he was going to make a fortune out of it. When the cotton was grown he provided housing accommodation and brought families from different parts to do the picking. He tried it only once, however, because he lost so heavily over the experiment that he resolved to leave cotton alone for the future. If cotton-growing is to he a success it must be conducted in a small way, so that a man with 5 or 10 acres of cotton can, with the assistance of his family, do all the picking without having to employ outside labour. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Gullett) attacked the policy of the Government, particularly its proposal for assisting the secondary side of the industry. It must be evident to every one, however, that unless we assist the secondary side of the cotton industry the primary side has not one chance in a thousand of succeeding. What we really have to consider is whether this industry is a natural one for Australia. I am sorry to say that, in my opinion, it is not. As a representative* of Queensland, I should like to see everything possible done to make its industries thrive; but I am sure that my constituents have too much sense to wish the Commonwealth Government to bleed the taxpayers white in order to assist an industry which has not a fair chance of succeeding. This is an artificial industry, and the Government has made a mistake in attempting to foster it. The Acting Minister was lavish with his promises as to what is going to happen in the future. He spoke of the thousands of men who would find employment in the industry; but if the growers are asked to pay award wages they will be up against serious trouble from the very start. I am surprised that honourable members on the Government side of the House have not given some In thought to the increasing price of cotton goods. The honourable member for Henty quoted facts and figures which have not yet been contradicted. I should like to believe that the cotton industry in Queensland will be as successful as prophesied; but I have grave doubts regarding it.",52
185,Mr FORDE,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"Capricornia-Actin g Minister for Trade and Customs) [8.50]. - The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gullett) read a telegram which he had received from certain hosiery and. knitting goods manufacturers in Melbourne. I also received a similar telegram in connection with dyed and randomdyed yarn, concerning which a complaint was made. The duty wa^s applied to those yarns because it was found that many of the dyed yarns were being, brought into this country, bleached, and used in competition with kinds made dutiable under the tariff. A complaint to this effect was made to the department, and a thorough investigation was conducted by one of the most reliable officials of the Customs Department, who learned that the tariff was being evaded in the way I have indicated.",52
186,Mr GULLETT,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,That is an amazing story.,52
187,Mr FORDE,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"I am surprised that the honourable member, who had a brief if inglorious experience as head of the Customs Department, should adopt that attitude, because I know that he has complete confidence in the officer of the department who made the investigation.",52
188,Mr GULLETT,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"I have, but the trouble caused by an occasional dishonest man could have been overcome without recourse to the action taken by the Government.",52
189,Mr FORDE,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"The duty was applied only to certain yarn which could have been manufactured in Australia. It does not apply to mercerized cottons, yarns for the manufacture of cotton tweeds, sewing cotton, yarn used in the manufacture of towelling, and many other varieties. All those things are exempted from the duty imposed in the November tariff. To-day I received from the Austral Silk and Cotton Mills in Melbourne a telegram which reads as follows:We are informed Victorian Knitters tion resolution forwarded today to you ing duty on dyed and random dyed cotton yarns. Dyed yarns in solid colours and random dyed yarns are produced and offered by local spinners. Hence we request duty on these remain. We do not produce multi-coloured mixture yarns being yarns spun from coloured cotton fibres dyed before spinning, and hence do not oppose recession in that classificationAustral Silk and Cotton Mills.",53
190,Mr GULLETT,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,Do they decide the policy of the Government?,53
191,Mr FORDE,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"No ; certainly not; but they have as much right to express an opinion as any' other section of the people. Complaints have been made against the Government's tariff proposals, but it must be evident to honourable members that nothing can be achieved by a lopsided system of protection. We must have a comprehensive policy which will protect both the grower and the spinner; moreover the manufacturer' who takes the product must also receive adequate protection. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gullett) complained about what has been done for the spinners, but I should like to remind him that when this Government came into power the rate of duty on blouses, skirts and underwear manufactured from cotton materials was ls. and 2s. each. This Government increased it to 2s. and 4s. each. The duty on wool and silk good3 under the last Government was 2s. 6d. and 4s. 6d., and this Government increased it to 5s. and 9s. each. All we require is that Australian-spun yarn be used wherever it is suitable. The spinners have large quantities of yarn ou hand. They have not been able to sell it, and they have a right to ask for a market, especially as they have adhered to the promise given to the Tariff Board. If we do not protect the Australian spinners, how can we expect them to buy Australian-grown cotton? Allegations have been made that since the new duties have been in operation prices have been raised and the public exploited. During the week-end I had inquiries made into those charges, and reports have now come to hand from the collectors of customs in New South Wales and Victoria. The Collector of Customs in Victoria sent an officer to Maryborough, and learned from Mrs Cuttle, the managing director of the Maryborough Knitting Mills, that she had not placed any orders for Associa- cotton yarn with the Austral Silk oppos- and Cotton Mills. In view of that admission the criticism of the Government's policy falls to the ground. The yarn purchased by the Maryborough Knitting. Mills, regarding the increased price of which a dispute arose, was percentage yarn, which contains a small amount is* cotton, and in respect of which no bounty is paid. Mrs Cuttle further stated that no hands have been dismissed because of an increase in the price of cotton yarn charged to knitters. She bought no cotton from the Austral Silk and Cotton Mills, and the price of the yarn she has bought from Geo. A. Bond and Company has not been increased; but she fears that, with the price of cotton, which she alleged will be higher than before the introduction of the November tariff, the output of her mill will be further reduced. The investigation officer ascertained from Mrs. Cuttle that at peak periods the Maryborough Knitting Mills had employed more than 400 hands, but never more than 450, whilst the average was approximately 300. She stated that the number of hands employed fluctuates, and that there has been a reduction recently through loss of trade.",53
192,Mr GREGORY,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,Du e to higher costs.,53
193,Mr FORDE,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"As she has said that she bought no yarn from the Austral Silk and Cotton Mills, and that the prices of the yarn bought from Geo. A. Bond and Company have not been increased, the loss of employment cannot be attributed to the high cost of yarn. The decline in the average number of hands employed began nine months before the introduction of the November tariff. Questioned as to the falling off of business, she attributed it to the following causes:-(a ) Importations of knitted piece goods, which were made up into various, articles of clothing similar to those she manufactures; (6) competition in trade; (c) trade depression; and (d) fashions changing over from cotton to silk. Mrs Cuttle added that during the last twelve months the overdraft of the mill has been substantially reduced, and upon this the company has been complimented by its bankers. The investigation officer also checked the selling prices of the Austral Silk and Cotton Mills. This company submitted to the Tariff Board two lists of prices, which it guaranteed not to increase unless production costs were increased by additional wages, or higher duties on raw material. One list was based on a bounty of - id. per count per lb. and the other on i|d. per count per lb. Unfortunately the Tariff Board published only the latter list, probably on the assumption that the Government would adopt a bounty of ^d. per count' per lb. The Government, however, granted only - id., and the following list shows that the Austral Silk and Cotton Mills, not only refrained from increasing the guaranteed price, but actually reduced the prices of some of the counts:Prices guaranteed to Coasts. Tariff Board-basi s Current Selling one-third-penny Prioe-Ma 10 24 12 24 14 24 16 24 18 24 23} 20 24 24 26 30 28 Regarding the relations of the Austral Silk and Cotton Mills with the Maryborough Knitting Mills, I received the following telegram on the 12th May, from the former:Reference statement in House by Mr Crouch as reported in press, we desire to report that inquiry by Maryborough Knitting Mills for IUT cotton yarns has been confined so far to the request for a copy of our price list of same. Mr Crouch's remarks apparently are based upon our quotation for special percentage yarns in reply to definite inquiry by that mill, but this production in no way is connected with the subject of cotton yarn bounty or duty on cotton yarn. That statement has been verified by the department. An investigation officer visited the factory of Geo. A. Bond and Company at the week-end, and inspected its books. He found that this company had not increased the prices of any of its cotton yarns, but that a reduction was made in the price of twist yarns of sixteen counts. In regard to the prices charged by the knitters, an investigation officer visited the following knitting factories in Melbourne, and ascertained that no increases of' prices had taken place 1 since certain yarns became subject to increased duties on 22nd November last:J. Eugster, 110 Elinders-lane; Foy and Gibson Proprietary Limited; Australian Knitting Mills Limited; and Myer Emporium Limited. Investigations in New South Wales proved that no increases have been charged in respect of men's athletic singlets, ladies' vests, men's shirts, men's underpants, women's hosiery, and men's hosiery, manufactured by Gei rge A. Bond and Company. As a matter of fact the prices of all Bond's goods have been reduced below the rates ruling on the 22nd November last. Men's shirts have been reduced from 42s. 6d. to 27s. per dozen, and men's underpants from 44s. 6d. to 30s. per dozen. Regarding retail prices, inquiries were made in Sydney of Mark Foy Limited arid Sydney Snow Limited, who pury 19S0. chased cotton goods, &c, from George A. bounty. 22J Bond and Company, and they disclose 224 that there has not been any advance in 223 the prices of any cotton garments sup23 plied by George A. Bond and Company 24 since prior to the 22nd November, nor has 254 either of those firms increased the retail 28 prices to the public. On the other hand,, various reductions in prices, have been, effected. A special inquiry was made also as to the theoretical effectthe increased cotton duties, that is, the increased charges that could have been made to the public if the manufacturers had added, or had been able to add, the value of the increased duties to the price of their goods: As already staLou, George A. Bond and Company have not taken advantage of the increased tariff rates, but have actually reduced their prices. But the theoretical surcharges they might have made are-Men' s athletic singlets, l^d. per garment; women's vests, i d . per garment. I am most anxious to do everything possible to meet the reasonable wishes of the knitters, and to that end I arranged a special conference in Sydney of reprer sentatives of the Sydney and .Melbourne knitters,, the cotton-spinning mills of Melbourne,, and George A . Bond and Company. We discussed the supply of yarn,, audi reached an agreement which was satisfactory tp> all. In regard, to. dyed audi random yarns,, a'thorough investigation will be made at once.. The Government doesno.t. wish to. penalize any section of' manufacturers. Human nature being what it is,, some knitters: pressed for' the dtities that were imposed in November last, but wanted to buy their yarni n the cheapest market. At the conference I pointed out that the Government, believes: in a, comprehensive policy of protection,, andexpects, theknitters to beconsistent,, and su-ppouttheAustralian spiimers,. who* are producing the yarn they require. Some unscrupulous people were importing dyed yarns and bleaching them,, and. selling them as white, aondin-, that waywere evading; the tariff. Because of that dishonesty, a duty was imposed on dyed yarns; but-, if that has caused', any hard - 1 3hip, I assure the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gullett) that,, although I am workingf r o m twelve to fourteen hours a day, I shall do myutmost to arrange aconference with the knitters with a view to removing anj injustice. But they will have to make out a good case. If , although they are opposed to the importation of knitted good's, they want to import yarn that canbe bought in Australia,' their inconsistency will' be frankly pointed out to them.. If ; however; .they can showa reasonablecase for the importation of dyed yarn at the old rates-, I shall give their representations, mos.tsympathetic consideration. Qn the T2th May ! received the follow*ing telegram from the Australian K n it ting Mills, Melbourne:As users of cotton yarns, and in riew of the satisfactory protection enjoyed by us in regard-, to thefinished garments, wearenot. opposed to the Government's protective duties on. cotton yarns. The Hosiery and K n it Goods Manufacturers Association of New South Wales wrote to me on the same dayThis association has read with interest the comments made by you in Parliament concerning, the cotton-spinning industry, in Australia, and desires to say that its members are pleased with the present position of the cotton-spinning industry inNew Southi Wales: Some considerable time ago this association opposed duties on cotton yarn, but. did so only because it believed that local mills could not supply knitters"" requirements. Siince then, however, from conferencesheldbetween knitters and spinners,, the members of this association are satisfied that all. their requirementscan nowbe met. It is theopinionof the members of this associationthat, as their manufacinnied' pr.or duct is now wholly protected,', it is reasonable that they should now useonly Australian made yarns. Members of this associationconsist of practically the whole of the' knitters in New South Wales. There has been noincrease in the price of yarn supplied by local spinners,, and' the quality, accordingto members-, is good. The members of this association-, although using"" locally-spunt yarn, hawe< in some cases already, reduced prices of their products; We are happy to give you this information, as we. appreciate the benefits, that have resulted through foreignproducts being excluded from this market. Mr GHLLETT : - Who is the chairman of the association?",53
194,Mr FORDE,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,Mr H . Thomas. Mr GULLETT : - Is he not chairman of George A.. Bond and Company? Mr Forde' - No .,55
195,Mr GULLETT,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"Georg e A . Bond and Company arespinners, and knitters . 1",55
196,Mr FORDE,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"The Deputy Leader of the Opposition urged that certain condenser yarn, for the manufacture of articles other than towels, should be admitted' free of duty. Bond aud Company have large quantities of substitute condenser yarn ready for delivery. The Tariff Board is absolutely satisfied that Bondi & Company have a real' substitutefor this - article, and' that it isi not now necessary to, import it . If . the. Deputy Leader of the Opposition will read the report of the board he. will see that that is so. Thehonorablemember for WideBay (Mr Corser) made certain observations' about the amendments: I point out to him that paragraph a of the proposed new section: 2 is for the benefit of P the« growers, and> paragraph b> of it is for the protection of the spiimers. The whole object of the amendment is to cover the last monthly deliverybefore the commencement of the new act. Stocks) o£ yarn, have not. been held, against the cotton-growers. Only/normal stocks of foreign l in t were Held.. If the bill had not been suddenly introduced with a clause repealing the original act the cotton-spinners could have obtained the full bounty until the 15th August, 1931, even if they had used 49 per cent, of foreign lint in their yarn. The Government has endeavoured to do the honourable thing by retaining the absolute rights earned by the spinners under the aet, which, until this bill is passed, remains in force. It is directly in the interests the cotton-growers that only 10 per cent, of foreign lint should be used in each count instead of the 49 per cent., which the spinners have a moral, if not a legal, right to use. I am informed that there are only about 100 bales of foreign lint involved, whereas the Australian lint purchased hy the local spinners this year amounted to 10,000 bales. The object of the amendment is to safeguard the interests of both the growers and the spinners during the period between the operation of the old and new policy. I assure honourable members that at the first opportunity I will meet the representatives of the knitting mills in Melbourne and discuss their grievances with them. It is my desire to deal with the industry from an Australian stand-point, and remove any genuine grievances which the Australian manufacturer may have.",55
197,Mr NAIRN,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"Perth) [9.17] appears to me that the Acting Minister is asking for too much assistance for this industry. Su'ch a large measure of help is not justified by experience. Of course, we all sympathize with the cotton growers, but it must be remembered that the bounty-cum-duty protection given to this industry is S5 per cent, against British, and 105 per cent, against foreign cotton goods. Is the industry worth buying at this price? The optimism of the Acting Minister as to the future of the industry is not shared by some in his own State who should be well qualified to express an opinion. Mr R. J. Webster, manager of the Queensland Cotton Pool, who, I understand, was once a candidate for Labour support, and therefore cannot be accused of political prejudice, is reported to have said that the Acting Minister's estimate of a production of 25,000 bales next year was too optimistic. He thought that it would only be by a very great effort that 18,000 balescould be produced. The cotton industry has been granted preferential treatment for a number of years-lon g enough, in fact, for us to judge whether there are reasonable prospects of its ultimate success. A fair inference to be drawn from the present position and from the Acting Minister's description of the languishing condition of the industry is that it cannot be conducted on economic lines in of Australia under Australian conditions. The Acting Minister stated in his second reading speech that in America the cottonpickers received 6-10ths of I d . per lb. of seed cotton, whereas in Australia they received l^d. per lb. The cost in Australia is, therefore, three times as great as in America, and American industries are not carried on under low-wage conditions. We were informed that the Australian cotton-pickers operated during the slack season in the sugar industry. It seems to me that these workers have fattened on the sugar industry and now want to add to their prosperity by giving some of their time to the cotton industry, At any rate they do not appear to' be prepared to do a fair day's work for a fair"" day's pay. [Quorum formedj. The primary and secondary branches of this industry are being rather cleverly played off against each other, with the unfortunate effect - It that the price of cotton goods in Australia is increasing year by year. We were at first told that the growers could not carry on their operations successfully unless a bounty of l i d . p e r lb. was paid. Then we were told that the manufacturers would not buy the local product. The next step was to grant a duty of 35 per cent. British and 55 per cent, foreign to protect the local manufacturer. It was next asked whether in view of this fact the growers should not be granted equal consideration. The result of all this has been, that the wearers of cotton goods in Australia, who constitute the great majority of our people, have been obliged to pay a heavy toll to this industry. It may be said that the retail price of cotton apparel has not increased by much, but it cannot be denied that the quality has declined seriously. Many manufacturers are today turning out goods of poor quality and charging for them the price of high' quality' products - If . the^ poli'cy of the' Government is approved, the 1 workers in the industry, and not the cotton-growers, will reap the greatest advantage. When they get their awards from the courts, or when the Minister prescribes the conditions which he regards as satisfactory, these workers will undoubtedly do very well. It is true that a few manufacturers may also do well in the industry, but I am not optimistic as to the general result. Not one of the hotbed industries that we have developed in Australia has been a success. Those who have followed the history of the sugar, steel and cotton industries must admit that our efforts to establish their operations in Australia have not been satisfactory. Not one of them is being conducted today on a sound basis. For this reason I cannot support this proposal.",56
198,Mr CROUCH,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"Corangamite) [9.37] I wish to quote a few figures in reply to the statements made by the Acting Minister in relation to the Austral Silk and Cotton Mills. I do so because I believe that the Minister desires to know the facts of the case. If he can be satisfied that this company has not stood by its undertakings, I am sure that he will act accordingly. Since this subject was debated by the committee on Friday last I have not had any further information from the Maryborough Knitting Mills, although I received a message from the solicitors of the Austral Silk and Cotton Company to the effect that they wished to see me. But I knew enough about solicitors to avoid an interview. An analysis of the statements made by the Acting Minister t6 day substantiates the case that I made A out . on Friday. The Acting Minister has admitted that the Maryborough mills, which some little time ago employed 400 to 450 workers, have since dismissed a considerable number of their hands. The reasons given for this were, first, no orders. for manufactured yarn and secondly, undertakings as to prices not kept. Of course, if there are no orders there must be unemployment. We agree on that. The Acting Minister confirmed my statement when he said that his officer had found that there had been no increase in prices.",57
199,Mr FORDE,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,Mrs . Cuttle stated that she had not bought any Australian yarn.,57
200,Mr CROUCH,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"The trouble is that the knitters could not buy their yarn except at an increased price. If the knitters have to sell their products without increasing their prices and yet have to pay more for their yarn, which is their raw material, there must naturally be a decrease in employment, because it is not possible to produce at a profit. If there is a large increase in the cost of the raw material, then, of course, there would be decreased profits and unemployment. The Acting Minister has said that the Maryborough Knitting Mills have given no orders.to the Austral Silk and Cotton Mills. The reason for that is seen in the greatly increased prices set out in a letter from the Maryborough Knitting Mills, part of which I read to the Acting Minister the other* day. The letter reads2Cth February, 1930. We have just obtained quotations for the supply of cotton yarn from the Austral Silk and Cotton Mills Ltd., and they quote as follows:Carded Cotton Yarn. Unbleached White. per lb. «. d. 1-10's. 1 11 1-12's. 1 11 l-14*s. 1 114 1-16's. 1 114 1-18's. 2 04 1-20's. 2 04 1-24's. 2 2 1-28's. 2 5 1-30's. 2 5 1-36's. 2 8 On referring to the Tariff Board's report and recommendation, which you very kindly forwarded to us a few days ago, we notice that at the end of same is annexure "" A , "" which states the schedule of prices at which Australian spinners undertook to sell cotton yarns in the event of the duties under the customs tariff taking effect. The prices at which the Austral Silk and Cotton Mills L t d . undertook to supply are as under:Carded Cotton Yarn. Unbleached White. per lb. ». d. 1-10's. 1 10 1-12's. 1 10 1-14's. 1 10 1-10's. 1 10 1-18's. 1 10 1-20's. 1 10 1-24's. 1 10 1-28's. 2 0 1-30's. 2 14 1-36's. 2 4 If you compare the two lots of prices above mentioned, you will find that the prices;, since the undertaking was given, have been increased to the following extent:1-10's - Id . per lb. 1-12's - Id . per lb. 1-14's - lid . per lb. M f f ' s - I j d . per lb. 1-lS's -2id . per lb. 1-20's -2|d . per Ib. 1-24's -4d . per lb. 1-28's -5d . per lb. 1-30's -3id . per lb. 1-30's -4d . per lb. The foregoing, as you will notice, are a very considerable increase in the prices, and it appears to us that this should be laid before the Minister for Customs, as it is apparently, to our way of thinking, an exploitation of the tariff. We might mention that present-day prices of Messrs. Geo. A . Bond & Co. (in liquidation) are exactly as set out in their undertaking to the Tariff Board on 6th March, 1929, and, therefore, we cannot understand why the Austral Silk and Cotton Mills L t d . should advance their prices as materially as shown above. Please accept our thanks in anticipation of your bringing the foregoing to the notice of the Minister of Customs. The Acting Minister has admitted tonight that in some instances there has been an increase over and above the guaranteed prices. He also said that the New South Wales Knitting Mills had sent him a letter of appreciation, expressing satisfaction with the prices charged by the spinning companies. Apparently, in New South Wales G. A. Bond Limited is satisfied that it is getting a fair deal; but my complaint is that in Victoria the Austral Silk and Cotton Mills have not kept their undertaking. The reason is clear. They are in competition at the present time with other knitting mills. In addition to being manufacturers of cotton yarn, which is the raw material for the knitters, they have their own knitting mills, and the Austral Silk and Cotton Mills are today attempting to kill competition by raising the price of their own raw material supplied to the country mills, while they supply their own knitting mills at price they wish. I take strong exception to that action. The Maryborough mill has complained that it occasionally requires 500 lb. of union yarn, and that the Austral Silk and Cotton Mills refuses to supply orders for less than 2,000 lb. Although I drew the Acting Minister's attention to that fact in a letter which I wrote to him ;ae other day, I think that he has forgotten it. I now ask him to instruct his officer to investigate that matter also. It may be said that in criticizing this bill I am to some extent, opposing the legislation of the Government of which I am a supporter, but I have no option but to take the stand that I am taking on this bill in the interests of a large number of my constituents. The township of Maryborough has about 5,000 or 6,000 inhabitants, and 450 of them are employed at the Maryborough mills. Their employment is gradually decreasing, and it will be a very serious matter to the town if , as the result of the action of the spinning company, employment ceases altogether. The honourable member for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH) rather questioned the efficiency of the Maryborough mill. It is the most up-to-date mill in the Commonwealth. I wish not to question the efficiency of the Ballarat mill, but to say that some time ago there w:-a a trade dispute between the management of the two mills, and as a result some of the old second-hand machinery at the Maryborough mill was transferred to the Ballarat mill. I deplore any controversy about the efficiency of these mills, hut I have seen the Maryborough mill, and 1I have been told by persons who should .know, that it is efficient, and I regret that the contrary has been stated by the honourable member' for Ballarat. However, I trust that the Acting Minister will instruct his officer to investigate the complaints of the Maryborough mill and particularly the complaint' that the Austral Silk and Cotton Mills have refused to supply it with yarn in quantities of less than 2,000 lb.",57
201,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"Warringah) [9.40] - On Friday last the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr. Crouch) gave an unmistakeable instance of an increase in the price of goods which any were recently protected by an increased tariff. I also emphasized further instances of increases in the price of wool and cotton goods as indicated by the honourable member for Henty (Mr Gullett). I pointed out that there would be a considerable increase in the cost of oof.ton goods as the result of the bounty given to spinners and the duties which are being imposed upon the cotton industry generally. In reply, the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH) pointed out that the Ballarat mill was quoting prices considerably less than those ruling some time ago. He said that no increase had taken place in the price of its goods, but on the other hand there had been a reduction in prices. The Acting Minister also quoted wholesale and retail prices to the same effect. I quite agree with them, because their statements are in-accordance with inquiries that I myself have made, but the reason given to me for the present reduction in the price of these goods is entirely different from that put forward by the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH). All these firms are jobbing because they have overtraded. They have goods on hand, and in order to get money with which to carry on the industry during this time of depression they are selling their goods at reduced prices. That was told tp me by two retail buyers, one of whom stated that he had given a large order at considerably reduced prices. He said that a similar position prevailed in all the cotton industries throughout the Commonwealth. This discussion has been most interesting. I heard with some amazement the patronizing tone of some of the telegrams from the manufacturers to the Acting Minister to the effect that they wanted this but would be satisfied with that. In addition we have heard the most intimate details of the manufacturers' businesses, and these, of course, have been duly recorded in Hansard. This is a most extraordinary way in which to carry oh the business of the country and to deal with what has been described by the Minister as a great national industry. ",58
202,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"I am merely repeating what the Minister has said. If this is a great national industry, surely it is not necessary to send out investigation officers post haste to verify every statement that is made in this Parliament? Certain statements were made on Friday afternoon; yet today the Minister can give them a categorical denial in the light of information which, he said, had been obtained during the week end from a distant part of the Commonwealth. It has been pointed out that by means of the bounty and the duty this industry will receive protection to the extent of 85 per cent, against British goods and 105 per cent, against foreign goods. In the absence of a denial by the departmental investigator, that must stand as an authoritative statement of the position. It has not been disproved, either, that Canada is able to carry on its industry with a duty of 1 \ per cent, against British goods, and 20 per cent, against foreign goods. If traders can reduce their prices to the extent indicated tonight, where is the necessity for this duty? It is inconceivable, in the light of such a statement, that they have not been able to squelch the British .and foreign manufacturers years ago, and to obtain complete control of the Australian market without the assistance of these duties.",59
203,Mr MAXWELL,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"In addition to that, they are exporting their goods to New Zealand.",59
204,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY," That is so. The Minister should, therefore, show the necessity for this duty. So soon as the imported stocks that are now on hand have been disposed of, and this duty has been imposed, the Minister will not be able to say that the prices charged are as low as they are today.",59
205,Mr LEWIS,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,The honourable member is a dismal prophet.,59
206,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"My dismal outlook is induced by a desire to conserve the interests of the people of this country. I noticed on Friday, and again today, a profound anxiety for the grower, the spinner and the knitter. I am dismal regarding the prospects of a section of the community that has not been referred to, the consumers. No mention of them has been made by the Minister during this debate.",59
207,Mr MAXWELL,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,They were not represented at the conference.,59
208,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY," These conferences were attended by Mr. So and So and Mr Somebody Else.' They had a talk. One said to the other "" You take this bit, and I ' l l take that"". They all went away happy, because they benefited at the expense of people who were not represented at the conference. That is an aspect of the matter that should concern at least some honourable members in this chamber. I make no apology for viewing with very great apprehension the effect which this tariff assistance will have upon certain necessaries of workers, of this country. Amendment agreed to. 1 Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause $ agreed to.

209,Mr GREGORY,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"Swan) [9.54.]-It has been the policy of the Commonwealth Government to provide bounties in the past. Only a little while ago the Acting Minister' for Trade and' Customs Forde) brought, down a bill for the ment of a bounty on themanufacture galvanized iron. Upon investigation' was shown, that that would amount in aggregate to the total sum paid in wages by tha manufacturer concerned. Sincethen another bill has been bi'ought downsteel dealing with a compulsory wheat pool. In. that measure, however; theGovernof ment advanced a new proposal-that Commonwealth shall pay one-half of stipulated guaranteed price, and that States, shall provide the balance. other words, if a loss occursone-half shall be made, good by the Commonwealth, and the. remainder by the States. I wish have a similar principle applied in congive nexion with this bill', and to all future bills which make provision for the paymeans, ment of a bounty. I , , therefore, move'JBhat after the word, ""accordingly"" word's "" one-half of the amount of "" be I do not wish it to be understood agree with the payment of the bounty. There is. nothing more discreditable than the way in which this Parliament interget feres with industry. Why not allow industry tomanage its own affairs? We by the spinners. have been told' that theActing' Minister (Mr Forde) met certain interested persons, and, in the manner of a great bah, decided that one personshall allowed' to import good'sfree o£ duty, while another person shall be compelled to pay the duty. The Deputy. Leader of all the Opposition (Mr Gu-Uett), stated: night that the weaver-can obtain his: yarn duty-free; whilethe knitter cannot.. The sooner the people realise thatcertain persons can approach? the Ministerand positionof the last tariff, and see the secure the admission of their goods; dutyenormous free, while others are unable to do so and the must pay the duties provided by the tariff list, the better it will be for them. This Parliament would be. better employed if it saw to theenforcement of the- legislation that it paisses. I question' whether any man will dare to' say that thocotton-growing industry is as imThe 1 in wheat, industry and the mining industry, whea operating fully/,, are responsible for enormousdevelopments in< every other, industry.. At least, seven or eight personsare given, employment, by the operation, of those industries, for every indi(Mr vidual whom they directly employ. payThe mining industry has beendeof stroyed on account of the high i i cost of production; yet during the last t i eseven years the Commonwealth Government has assisted it to the extent of Only £1,770, while in the case of the iron and industry the. assistance rendered has been valued at £1,400,000. If the people Queensland want this bounty, let the the Queensland Government beresponsible a for half of it. The spinsner is the man thewho is being well looked after. The duty In on cotton yarn is 35 per cent, in the case of British goods, and 5-5 per cent., in the case of foreign! goods; and, into addition, we propose by this bounty to the manufacturer assistance ranging from Id., per lb. to Is-, per lb. That that on the high-class yaa-ns. hisprotection will be 55 per cent., and. from lOd.. to Is., per lb. If the manufacturers theare to be given these concessions,, the inserted. States which profit by the employthat I ment, that is provided for their people should pay their proportion. I do not believe that the growers willsuch a great deal out of this, afterall. Most of the benefit will be derived Mr Forde:-The spinners havepoohpromised' to pay the growers a minimum, be of 5d. per lb., up to 1936.",60
210,Mr GREGORY,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"How can. the Government' follow thespinners through their operations ? I object to the large tod'egreeof Ministerialcontrol in the administration of tariff matters. Let honourable members: study the weekly notices issued; by the department prior to the im; list of exemptions, under item-174, for the importation of machinery. It is all very well for those who can get the ear of the Minister, and obtain exemptions, but what of the unfortunate person who has no way of putting his case before the authorities, and who just pays up? It has been suggested that if these proposals are given effect it will enable Australia to build up an export trade in cotton manufactures. This is the first time we have ever heard of the possibility of exporting any of our secondary manufactures, and if that desirable object is achieved in this case it will certainly be something to be proud of. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Clause 5(1) The bounties under this Act shall be payable in respect of(o) seed cotton which(i) has been grown in Australia; (ii) has been delivered to an (iii) has been graded in one of lint produced from seed cotton which has been grown in Australia; and . . . .",60
211,Mr FORDE,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"Capricornia-Actin g Minister for Trade and Customs) [10.5]. - I propose to move That after the word "" or,"" the words "" at the option of the Minister "" be inserted. The Attorney-General's Department stated that it is essential that some particular authority should determine whether the bounty shall be paid on seed cotton or on lint. If the clause were not altered individual growers could exercise their choice, which would be very undesirable from the point of view of the Commonwealth and the Queensland Cotton Board.",61
212,Mr LATHAM,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"Kooyong) [10.6] - I am not satisfied that the amendment moved by the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Forde) would cover the case. I understand that the object to be attained is to ensure that the bounty may be paid on seed cotton, or on lint produced from seed cotton, but that if it is paid on seed cotton it shall not be paid on lint produced from that seed cotton. I suggest that the intention could be better expressed than by inserting the words, "" at the option of the Minister,"" and leaving it at that. The clause would still be open to the interpretation that the bounty may be paid on seed cotton or, at the option of the Minister, on lint produced from seed cotton., It does not make it clear that the classes are exclusive, as it were. It would be desirable, I think, to reconsider this clause with a view to having it re-drafted, and re-committed before the third reading. It might he possible to include in this clause a definite proviso that no bounty shall be payable on lint produced from seed cotton in respect of which a bounty has already been paid. That would remove all ambiguity.",61
213,Mr MACKAY,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"Lilley) [10.8] - In April last the Acting Minister visited Brisbane, and conferred with the Cotton Advisory Committee. During the conference mention was made of a sum of £250,000 that was to be made available ap- for the assistance of cotton-growers. ""Will pointed place; and the Minister give the committee some the grades prescribed under particulars as to where that money is to section 7 of this Act; or come from; whether it is to be found by the Government of Queensland or by the Commonwealth, or whether it is to be part of the bounty?",61
214,Mr FORDE,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"Capricornia-Actin g Minister for Trade and Customs) [10.9]. A proposal was made that £250,000 should be made available through the Queensland State Agricultural Bank for the development of new cotton-growing areas. The State Agricultural Bank should, it was suggested, obtain the money by way of loan from the Commonwealth Bank, application being made for the money by the Queensland Government.",61
215,Mr MACKAY,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,Would the loan be guaranteed by the Commonwealth Government ?,61
216,Mr FORDE,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"No , it would he purely a business deal between the State Agricultural Bank and the Commonwealth Bank.",61
217,Mr MACKAY,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,Is it a contribution by the State Government to the cotton industry?,61
218,Mr FORDE,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"It will he a loan to the cotton-g^rowers of Queensland, and will be administered through the State Agricultural Bank. The Queensland State Government will, if necessary, ask the Commonwealth Bank to lend the money in order to meet the increased demands on the Agricultural Bank as a result of the expected expansion of the cotton-growing industry.",61
219,Mr BERNARD CORSER,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"Wide Bay) [10.11] - Surely the Acting Minister does not wish to evade the point that any loan to the Queensland Agricultural Bank would have to he guaranteed by the Queensland Government. That Government may be prepared to guarantee the loan of £250,000 provided it is for a period which will enable the money to be used effectively for the encouragement of production. It has been suggested that the money should be made available by the Commonwealth Bank for two years only; but what State Government could guarantee to return the money after two years when it had been lent to farmers, necessarily on fairly extended terms? A two-years loan is of no use to growers. The amendment now before the committee is to ensure that a bounty may be paid on seed cotton, or, at the option of the Minister, on lint. In the schedule tached to the bill the rate of bounty payable on seed cotton is set forth, but there is nothing about the rate of bounty payable on lint. It might be reckoned as 3 lb. of seed cotton to 1 lb. of lint, but there is no direct provision in the bill. As the lint is all mixed together in the ginneries no one can determine accurately how much .seed cotton has gone into the production of a particular consignment of lint. I should like to know from the Minister whether the growers have ever asked for the payment of a bounty on lint.",62
220,Mr FORDE,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,Sub-clause s 2 and 3 of clause 6 cover the points raised by the honourable member.,62
221,Mr BERNARD CORSER,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"I do not think that they do. On page 6 the provides a schedule of prices to' be paid for seed cotton, but there is no provision for lint. If lint is included under these provisions it will be necesconsideration sary to recommit the bill later in order to define the position accurately.",62
222,Mr LATHAM,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"Kooyong) [10.15] The Acting Minister should give serious consideration to the point raised by the cottonNo honourable member fer Wide Bay. The object of sub-clauses 2 and 3 of clause 6 is undoubtedly to deal with the situation described by the honourable member, but, as he has pointed out, they do not do so. Sub-clause 2, which is quite unambiguous, reads:The rates of bounty on lint produced from seed cotton shall be such rates as, having regard to the proportion which the weight of the lint bears to the weight of the seed cotton from which it is produced, are equivalent to the rates of bounty in respect of seed cotton. Pursuant to that provision it would undoubtedly be necessary to ascertain the weight of the seed cotton from which any particular parcel of lint was produced and to pay the bounty in accordance with the proportion of the weight of lint to the weight of seed cotton. To give effect to this provision it would be necessary to get the actual weight of seed cotton from which the lint was produced. Sub-clause 3, which readsThe Governor General may prescribe for each season, or part of a season, a standard ratio between the weight of seed cotton and the weight of lint produced from seed cotton, atis designed to prescribe a general standard to be applied to the working-out of the scheme of sub-clause 2. But although the standard ratio prescribed by the Governor General might be interesting and informative, it could have no application, as the sub-clause is worded, to sub-clause 2. I suggest, therefore, that it should be re-drafted. If it were provided that the Governor General should, each season, prescribe a ratio, and that the bounty paid in respect of lint should be paid upon the basis fixed by the prescribed ratio, the scheme would be workable, for it would then be known every year that so many pounds of seed cotton would be understood to produce so many pounds of lint, and the bounty would be paid accordingly.  bill Minister for Trade and Customs) [10.19] - I have referred the point raised to the draftsman, and suggest that further of the clause be postponed. Clause postponed. Clause 6 postponed. Clauses 7 and 8 agreed In. Clause 9bounty shall be paid in respect of any yarn unless(a) is is of good and merchantable quality; and (.6 ) one hundred per centum of the cotton used in its manufacture was grown in Australia: Provided: further that,, if the.

223,Mr FORDE,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"Capricornia-Actin g Minister for Trade and Customs) [10.23] - I move That after the second proviso the following proviso be inserted:""Provided further that bounty shall not Be payable oncotton yarn in the manufacture of which less than fifty per centum of Australian-grown, cotton has been used, unless the Minister is satisfied(-»') that there are insufficient sup(o) that the manuf acturer has used,, It. isunlikely that this proviso will ever become; operative, but it is designed t-> cover thesituation' which may arise if the Australian cotton cropf aids: sobadly th'ait. less than 50. per cent, of the manufacturers' requirements, waa available locally.

224,Mr BERNARD CORSER,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"Wide Bay) [10.25.]: - When the Acting Minister dealt with the amendment in clause 2 he said that it was a suggestion from the spinners, and this amendment is to a small extent consequential, but as its actual purpose is to strengthen the hands of the manufacturers I can quite understand that it has been suggested by them.",63
225,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"I should like to know if the - bounty is to be paid in proportion to the Australian cotton used, because no proportions are 1 mentioned in the bill.",63

229,Mr GTTLLETT,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"Henty) [10.29:] This is rather an extraordinary provision, contemplating as it does the setting up by the Commonwealth of a special tribunal appointed by the Minister to cover the cotton-picking industry. It is the Coal Tribunal all over again. The evil of appointing a special tribunal to function in one industry only is that such an authority does hot necessarily take into consideration the relation of the wages and conditions it determines to those obtaining in other industries. As happened in the coal industry it can award a special wage out of all proportion to the wages paid in other industries. For that reason I dislike the amendment. I do not like the idea of having special tribunals for special industries, and I trust the Acting Minister will not spring this extraordinary proposal upon the committee at this late hour.",64
230,Mr FRANCIS,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"Moreton) [10.31] While I favour the purpose of this bill I think it necessary to point out that, if the cotton industry is greatly to expand, its chances of doing so may be jeopardized hy forcing upon the farmers heavy costs of production. The industry has had special assistance, first in the primary stage, secondly in the manufacturing stage, and thirdly by the protection afforded against the importation of cotton goods from overseas; but rumours are current that an effort will be made to obtain a higher wage for picking cotton than has been paid in the past. In the United States of America cotton is picked for i d . per lb., whereas in Queensland we are required to pay l f d . or' 2d. If the industry is to prosper there must be a margin of profit for the grower over his cost of preparing the land and planting it , which, according to the latest Tariff Board report, is 2^d. per lb. When to that a further l f d . is added for picking there is is very little profit in cotton growing at present prices, although I am an ardent believer in the possibility of this industry being a great success and a great aid to the development of Australia. In the amendment he has proposed the Acting Minister takes to himself very many powers. I hope that he will be careful to see that the farmer gets his proper reward, and that the profit to which he is entitled is not taken from him by the exorbitant demands of the cottonpickers and field workers.",64
231,Mr BERNARD CORSER,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"Wide Bay) [10.33] - I protest against this amendment, which gives the Minister power to appoint an authority for the determination of wages and conditions in an industry which, so far as the producer is concerned, is already paying a wage equivalent to any award rate that has been given. Harassing conditions, not known today in regard to the growing of the crop, may be laid down, and may deprive the cotton-farmer of any benefit he is otherwise likely to enjoy from this bounty. The bounty is to be paid, not to enable a higher wage to be given, but to permit the industry to compete with success against importations from other countries where the wages and conditions of labour are not of the high standard enjoyed by the workers in Australia. If all the advantage to be derived from the bounty is to go in the payment of higher wages, and nothing to the man who has struggled to carve a far m out of the forest or scrub, the industry will be a failure. The Acting Minister has now brought down an amendment which, if carried, will give him the right to appoint an authority to determine the wages and conditions governing the growing of the crop, although we have just passed a clause which provides that after inquiry and report by the Tariff Board, if , in the ""opinion of the Minister, the lint produced from seed cotton upon which bounty has been paid is not being sold by the recipients - the cotton-growers-of the bounty at a reasonable price, having regard to the cost of production, the Minister may withhold the payment of the bounty. The cotton producer has not only to comply with the wages and conditions prescribed by a tribunal appointed by the Minister, but also to sell his product to the manufacturer at a price which, in the opinion of the Minister, is reasonable. I cannot see any hope for the producer at all. The whole of these amendments - seem to be framed in the interests of the manufacturer and the primary producer seems to be out of the picture altogether. I protest against this clause, and I shall certainly vote against the Minister having the right to inflict these unreasonable ditions upon the cotton-grower.",64
232,Mr LATHAM,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"Kooyong) [10.37] - I hope that the Acting Minister will not insist on this very remarkable and far-reaching addition to the bill. In all bounty bills there are provisions corresponding with clause 13 of this bill. Those provisions are carefully drawn and have now reached a standardised form. They provide that the Minister may apply to a judge of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court or to any Commonwealth authority established for the purpose of determining wages and conditions of employment, for a declaration as to what wages and conditions of employment are fair and reasonable for labour employed in the production of seed cotton or lint for the manufacture of cotton yarn, and if the conditions of employment and wages are below the standard so determined, then the bounty may be withheld. The reference is to a judge of an existing tribunal, the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, the constitution and powers of which *iave been the subject of keen debate in this Parliament; indeed, no subject has, in the history of the Commonwealth, received more attention than has the constitution of industrial authorities. Under this amendment it is proposed that the Minister shall have power to appoint an authority. There is no qualification for membership of that authority except that two members are described as representatives of certain interests. The Minister is to have power to appoint that, authority whenever he likes, for the purpose of determining the wages and conditions of employment. He is to have power to do this in respect of the labour employed in the production of seed cotton which is one industry, in the production of lint, which is another industry, and in the manufacture of cotton yarn, which is a third industry. The first two industries are carried on in the country and the the third in the city. The authority is to be appointed entirely by the Minister. One member is to be a representative of the Commonwealth. Obviously, that may be anybody. He may be a man of some' qualification, a police magistrate or a judge, or a man skilled in industrial conditions, or a man conwith no such qualifications. No qualifications whatever are prescribed in the bill.",65
233,Mr BLAKELEY,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,The honourable member should trust the Government.,65
234,Mr LATHAM,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"The Minister has not been present in this debate, and he should not join in at this stage for the purpose of making jocular remarks. The other member of the tribunal, a representative of the employers, is to be selected by the Minister. He will not be nominated or suggested by the employers themselves.",65
235,Mr MARTENS,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"The honourable member used to appoint the workers' representatives, and gave the workers no choice.",65
236,Mr LATHAM,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"The honourable member is making an entirely inaccurate statement. On no occasion did I , or the Government of which I was a member, select any representative of the workers except from a list supplied by the workers themselves. I presume that the honourable member is referring, to the International Labour Conference,.",65
237,Mr MARTENS,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,Yes .,65
238,Mr LATHAM,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"No representative of the workers was ever sent abroad by the late Government except persons nominated by the workers themselves. In fact, the representative who was selected was always the person marked No. 1, in a list containing three nominations. The amendment provides for the setting up of a number of authorities in three associated industries, possibly one authority in Sydney and another in Melbourne. That is not clear from the phrasing of the provision; but on these authorities most remarkable powers are .to be conferred. The powers of a judge of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court when acting under this legislation are set out in sub-clause 2, which readsOn the hearing and determination of the Application, the Chief Judge, Judge or Commonwealth authority, as the case may be, shall have all the powers which under the Excise Procedure Act 1907 are conferred on the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, and all witnesses and persons summoned to appear or appearing before the Chief Judge, Judge or Commonwealth authority, as the case may he, shall be entitled to the same privileges and protection, and be subject to the same liabilities and penalties,- as witnesses or persons summoned to appear or appearing before the President on an application within the meaning of that act, and the provisions of that act shall, so far as they are applicable, apply accordingly, mutatis mutandis, as if the application were an application within the meaning of that act. In other words, where the judge is hearcesses of manufacture. ing an application, precise provision made for the powers of the judge for the protection of witnesses; under sub-clause 9 an irregular authority appointed by the Minister under subpower section 7 is to have such powers in relano tion to the summoning of witnesses, production of books and documents and the taking of evidence, as are prescribed. The judge of the Commonwealth ArbitraState tion Court is tied down and his powers are limited ; but the authority appointed by the Minister is to have such powers as 'may be prescribed, and no provision whatever is ni de for the protection of witnesses as is done in connection with witnesses who appear before a and judge of the Arbitration Court. the Acting Minister has followed recent industrial events in Australia, he must aware of the difficulties which have in consequence of the setting up of may possibly arise. special tribunals which were not a part of our general industrial system. One was in connection with the engine-drivers' special tribunal in connection with the coal-mining industry, which awarded rates of wages which bore no relation to the rates awarded to engine-drivers performing work in places other than coal-mines. There has been a great deal of trouble on that account, i u regard to which one may have a degree of sympathy with the men concerned. These difficulties, which at times have been most acute, have been due to the fact that special tribunals have been set up which are not a part of the general industrial system of the community. If effect is given to this amendment, further difficulties will arise, not only in connection with the production of seed cotton and lint, but also in relation to the manufacture of cotton yarn, and these will affect engineers, electricians, and other employees engaged in the industry. I do not pretend to have any knowledge of the manufacture of cotton yarn ",65
239,Mr LATHAM,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"And the Minister for Markets and Transport knows as mucli as I do on the subject. Cotton yarn is produced in factories in which there will be the ordinary factory employees, such as those in the control of machinery, as well as others engaged in the proAlthough a is number of these employees will be and covered by existing awards, it is but proposed, under this amendment, to set up another authority, which will have to prescribe wages, but there is provision with respect to the relation the which is to exist between the awards made by this authority and those of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, or of arbitration tribunals. As all the manufacturers of cotton yarn and the producers of seed cotton and lint will apply for the bounty as a matter of course, it will mean that the awards made to those engaged in this industry, will overlap a number of other awards, thus bring about a condition of chaos. If No benefit will be conferred upon anybody by the adoption of this proposal. be As the clause stands,' it is effective arisen to deal with any situation which The rates of wages of the employees concerned are already prescribed by one authority or another, and no difficulty has arisen in the past in applying the provisions of the existing Cotton Bounty Act. If any difficulty should arise, a judge of tht; Commonwealth Arbitration Court is the proper person to deal with it . In these circumstances, I trust that the Minister will withdraw this amendment, which has the effect of introducing t a new system of industrial tribunals, to be appointed by a government with no provisions as to qualification, or jurisdiction, and with all the risks which arise from the appointment of special tribunals not related to other tribunals. This can lead only to confusiou, difficulty, and, indeed, chaos.",66
240,Mr GREGORY,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"Swan) [10.50] - I intend to vote against this clause. ""We have heard to-night of the various persons concerned in the matter of subsidies, and I suppose a section of the party opposite, on finding that the Government is granting some concession to the growers of cotton and the manufacturers of cotton yarn, desire that additional consideration shall be given to another section. Surely they should be satisfied with the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, which has been appointed to fix the conditions in this as well as in other industries. I object to the clause, which gives the Minister power to intervene. As we already have a Commonwealth Arbitration Court, the Minister should not be empowered to intervene as is proposed in this instance. This proposal will apply, not only to the growing of cotton, but to those engaged in the manufacture of cotton yarn in Melbourne and Sydney. We have already had considerable trouble' in connection with the overlapping of Commonwealth and State awards, and, if this 'amendment is adopted, a chaotic position will arise. Under this proposal the Minister will have power to appoint a judge or a magistrate, as well as representatives of the employers and employees, to constitute a tribunal and make an award, which will probably conflict with Commonwealth arbitration awards granted to employees engaged in similar work in other industries. If honourable members opposite believe in the Arbitration Court, why should they assist in giving the Minister the unlimited power proposed in this amendment? Honourable members know that I am opposed to the Arbitration Court, but the carrying of this amendment will make our industrial conditions even worse. It is placing too much power in the hands of the Minister, and will result in even greater conflict than now exists between awards. All classes of artisans will be employed in factories producing cotton yarn, and, notwithstanding the existence of Commonwealth awards, the Minister will have power to appoint a special tribunal and may do so in consequence of pressure which may be brought upon him.",67
241,Mr BELL,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,What for?,67
242,Mr GREGORY,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"That is what I should like to know. As I have said, perhaps it is because the supporters of the Government have decided that those whom they represent should also have something out of the bill. The amendment, which is an absurd proposal, will not have any beneficial effect, and if honourable members do not wish to create confusion in the industry they should oppose it. We are all anxious to develop our industries, and to provide good conditions for the workers, but there is no justification for giving the Minister power to appoint another industrial tribunal.",67
243,Mr LEWIS,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,Why bring the growers before the Arbitration Court in. Melbourne or Sydney?,67
244,Mr GREGORY,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"Thei r case could be heard in Queensland. Why should we give the Minister for Customs authority to appoint a special tribunal to deal with the industry? The proposal savours of something I do not like, and I trust the committee will reject it.",67
245,Mr FORDE,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"Capricornia-Actin g Minister for Trade and Customs) [10.55.]-The amendment to which exception has been taken is supplementary to clause 13, which readsThe Minister may make application to the Chief Judge or a judge of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, or to any Commonwealth authority established foi the purpose of determining wages and conditions of employment, &c. Honourable members know that frequently there is a long waiting list in the Federal Arbitration Court, with consequent endless delays. In the event of a dispute occurring between the growers and the pickers in Queensland, must they be put to the expense of waiting until a federal judge is available ? Can honourable members not conceive of a thunderstorm or a hail storm ruining a whole crop during the currency of, a dispute that cannot be readily terminated? Is it not advisable to have the power to appoiat some authority in Queensland to deal with the matter expeditiously?",67
246,Mr GREGORY,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,That would not apply to the factory.,68
247,Mr FORDE,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"Honourable members opposite have expressed at different times a belief in round table conferences and wages boards, and a desire to escape from the legality of the Arbitration Court; yet, when we propose to make provision to appoint an authority to deal with a dispute on the spot, they raise objections to such a course being followed. An authority comprising a police magistrate, a representative of the cotton-growers, and a representative of the employees in the industry, could probably settle a dispute in half a day. without all the delay and legal paraphernalia of the FederalArbitration Court. This amendment is proposed primarily to deal with the cotton-growing industry in Queensland. I believe that all sections of the community realise that there should be some provision for an authority to deal expeditiously with any dispute that may arise in the industry.",68
248,Mr GULLETT,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,Why in this particular industry?,68
249,Mr FORDE,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"All previous bounty bills contained a clause giving the Minister power to refer such matters to the Federal Arbitration Court. All honourable members who have had any experience of the Federal Arbitration Court know quite well that long delays, lasting sometimes un to twelve months, occur before plaints are heard by the court. This amendment will enable the Minister to step in quickly and appoint a police magistrate to act with a representative of the employers and the employees, to decide a dispute without delay. The proposed arrangement will tend to a speedy settlement of disputes that may arise in the industry, and prove inexpensive in its operation.",68
250,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"Warringah) [11.0.]-The extraordinary feature of this proposal is that it does find a place in any other bounty b i When the Wine Bounty Bill was before this chamber only a week ago, such a provision was not inserted. The ordinary procedure of the' Arbitration Court was considered good enough for the workers in the wine industry. There was no talk then of the clouds lowering, the wind blowing, and thunderstorms destroying the grapes, though it must be admitted that grapes are much more susceptible than cotton to damage by thunderstorms. Delays in the Arbitration Court apparently do not effect those who are engaged in the wine industry. Evidently because the geographical situation of the cotton growing industry is the centre of Queensland, and the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs is therefore particularly interested in it, hailstorms, thunderstorms and everything else must be guarded against. The honourable gentleman has stated that the reason for this proposal is that there is a long waiting list in the Arbitration Court. ' What value has that statement in the light of the fact that only a few days ago the Attorney-General took Judge Lukin off the Arbitration Court to act in the Bankruptcy Court because he could be spared from his duties in the former court?",68
251,Mr FORDE,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,The fact that an Arbitration Court judge has been taken off that bench,68
252,Mr LATHAM,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,He has not heen taken off.,68
253,Mr FORDE,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"The honourable gentleman quoted a newspaper statement to the effect that he had been taken off. If that is right, Judge Lukin will not be available to hear cases in the Arbitration Court, and that is all the more reason why we should have a simple, inexpensive authority to deal with any disputes that may arise in the cotton-growing industry.",68
254,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"It proves that he can be spared from his duties in the Arbitration Court and that, therefore, there is no waiting list in that Court. Then, there is the further fact that Chief Judge Dethridge has been taken off the Arbitration Court to act as a Royal Commissioner. Apparently there is not sufficient work for these judges. Consequently, the Minister's statement will not bear investigation, and not the facts are not as he has stated them l l . ' to be. What does he propose to do? Clause 13 sets out in detail the procedure to be adopted in the fixing of wages and conditions in this industry. No one objects to that. If the question of wages and conditions goes before the Arbitration Court, we are assured that not only will the grower, the manufacturer, and the workman get a fair deal, but also that at least some regard will be paid to the economic circumstances of the industry and the interests of the general public. Instead of having a. tribunal of that nature, which at least commands some public confidence, it is proposed that, so far as this industry is concerned, the Minister shall have the power to appoint a ramshackle tribunal of his own. Such a tribunal will not beget confidence in the general public It is merely an extension of the principle underlying the secret conferences that have been held in connection with this matter. A few men will sit around a table. The grower will say ""I want so and so out of the industry."" The manufacturer will say that he wants his bit; the employee will make the same demand, and if all demands are conceded it will be at the expense of the general public. A proposal of this nature is not fair to the Commonwealth, because the industry involves the payment of about £900,000 of public money. We are threatened with a repetition of our experiences of the coal industry. For years there were incessant fights between the capital and labour engaged in that industry, and everything that was gained was at the expense of the people of Australia. Prices for coal rose to an traordinary height. The proposed tribunal will not be competent to give all terests a fair deal, and the Minister has advanced no reason whatever why this amendment should be accepted. Such a provision is not to be found in any other measure for the payment of bounties. The Minister spoke of the risk involved in sudden thunder or hail-storms in cotton-growing districts. Is it to be imagined for one moment that in the event of a thunder-storm the proposed tribunal would be suddenly brought into existence and would be able to determine to what extent the industry would be affected? We have never before heard such an extraordinary explanation from a responsible Minister as that made by the Assistant Minister for Trade and Customs to-night. The proposal seems ifr. Archdale Parkhill. to be a most suspicious one. I hope that the Minister will re-consider the matter, and allow the interests of all parties to be safeguarded, as they would be quite amply by the provision already in the bill.",68
255,Mr FORDE,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"Capricornia-Assistant Minister for Trade and Customs) [11.8]. - I wish to clear up one point. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Latham) said that the authority to be appointed under this amendment would not be able to ensure to witnesses the protection afforded under sub-clause 2, which provides, inter alia. . . All witnesses and persons summoned to appear or appearing before the Chief Judge, judge or Commonwealth authority, as the case may he, shall be entitled to the same privileges and protection and be subject to the same liabilities and penalties as witnesses or persons summoned to appear or appearing before the President on an application within the meaning of 'that Act. . . . The authority which the Minister has power to appoint under this amendment will be in the nature of a wages board, which honourable members opposite declared in the past they preferred to the legalities of a court, and it will afford to witnesses the same protection as is given to witnesses before the Federal Arbitration Court.  [11.11] - The cotton industry is not sufficiently important to justify this departure from the recognized procedure. The expreceding Government was criticized for its appointment of boards and commissions. Apparently this Government will inbe criticized for the number of courts it intends to appoint. In view of the seriousness of the financial position in Australia, the Bruce-Page Administration endeavoured to reduce the number of courts, but this Government has established the Bankruptcy Court, and proposes to set up another authority to determine wages and conditions in the cotton industry. Can the people of Australia trust the Minister to determine matters in relation to this industry which is not likely to be of any real benefit to the Commonwealth? Honourable members supporting the Government may laugh if they please. They would have us believe that they deplore the volume of unemployment that exists in Australia a today. This proposal, I am afraid, will add to our troubles. The cotton bounty is the pet white elephant of the Assistant Minister for Trade and Customs, who represents Capricornia in this House. .Because of the measures taken to bolster it up, the cotton industry will, I fear, be responsible for still further unemployment. Can any honourable member seriously argue that it will add to the wealth of this country, or assist to reduce the cost of living? The wages paid in it will be at the expense of wage earners in every other industry in the Commonwealth. The only people who are asked to work more are the wheat growers. The cotton industry is never likely to be of one-half the value to the Commonwealth that the wheat industry is, and yet the wheat-growers will be expected to contribute their share to maintain this new white elephant. The Minister had a good deal to say about the possibility of sudden storms endangering the industry. Is it of such importance that its needs should be attended to more promptly than the needs of any other industry ?",69
256,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY," Order ! I must ask the honourable member to connect his remarks with the clause under discussion.  I had departed from my text. I do not see any reason for departing from the arbitration principle as it applies to other industries. Section 7 of the amendment is as follows:-The Minister may appoint an authority or authorities for determining, for the purposes of this section, wages and conditions of employment which are fair and reasonable for labour employed in the production of seed cotton or lint, or the manufacture of cotton yarn. The Minister tried to create the impression that this provision would apply only to the workers in growing the cotton, but it is evident from the wording of the amendment itself, that it will apply also to those employed in the mills. Judicial courts have been set up to determine conditions and wages in industry, and it is not right that such matters should be given over to the control of a Minister representing party interests. I hope that the Government will withdraw this amendment.",70
257,Mr MCTIERNAN,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"Parkes) [11.17] It has been said, that clause 13 of the bill covers everything necessary in regard to the conditions which shall be observed in the industry. It should be remembered, however, that the court in clause 13 does not operate unless there is an interstate dispute. It is clearly apparent that the Constitution contemplates that the Commonwealth Court of Arbitration and Conciliation shall have power to make awards with regard to wages and conditions in relation to interstate disputes.",70
258,Mr LATHAM,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,Clause 13 does not refer to the Arbitration Court; it refers specifically to the Chief Judge or a judge of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration.,70
259,Mr MCTIERNAN,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"The Arbitration Court of which they are members is a tribunal set up under the provisions of the Constitution, which say that the Commonwealth Parliamentshall have power to make laws for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of a State. The ground covered by this amendment is entirely different from that covered by the normal operations of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court.",70
260,Mr MAXWELL,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,Would not the State in which the industry is being carried on have full power to deal with the matter?,70
261,Mr MCTIERNAN,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"For State purposes it would, but this tribunal is being set up for the purposes of this bounty bill. In those circumstances I can see nothing revolutionary or novel about the proposal to set up a special tribunal. It is an effective provision to ensure a quick and economical method of dealing with the special matters referred to in the clause. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.",70
262,Mr FORDE,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"Capricornia-Actin g Minister for Trade and Customs) [11.19] - I have withdrawn the amendment in order to move in its place another which, while the same in substance, is designed to meet one difficulty raised by the Leader of the Opposition, who expressed doubt as to whether the tribunal to be set up could be deemed to be a Commonwealth authority. I desire to place that beyond all doubt and move:That the following sub-clauses be added the clause-"" 7.. the Minister .may appoint an authority or authorities for determining, for the poses of this section, wages and. conditions of employment which are fair and reasonable labour employed in the production of seed cotton - or lint, or the manufacture yarn; and any authority so appointed shall be deemed to be a Commonwealth authority within the meaning of sub-section 1 of this section. 8. An authority appointed by the Minister under the last preceding sub-section shall sist of a representative of the Commonwealth, a representative of employers engaged in the production of seed cotton or lint, or the manufacture of cotton yarn, and a representative of employees engaged in such production or manufacture.""",70
263,Mr LATHAM,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"Kooyong) [11.21] - I ask the Acting Minister to report progress. I have been a member of this House for a number of years, and I do not think that any previous government has asked members to sit much past 10.15 p.m. on the first evening of the week. Most honourable members have travelled long distances by train, and are not anxious for a long sitting to-night.",71
264,Mr EOBBE,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,I want to get the bill through. I am very busy in my department.,71
265,Mr LATHAM,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"The Acting Minister says that he is very busy. It seems to be a new thing for him to work twelve or fourteen hours a day. I have been doing it for years, and I am prepared to do it now if necessary. The alteration which the Minister now proposes meets the particular point that I raised as to the protection of witnesses and the powers of the authority, but I object to the conferring on such authority as this the powers of a judge of the Arbitration Court. It is improper to suggest that such a haphazard authority, appointed, perhaps, as the Minister informs us, to deal with a dispute in anticipation of a thunderstorm, should have the same powers as the judge of an arbitration court. The idea of the Government seems to be that tribunals should be appointed from time to time to deal with anything that may arise which the Minister considers of sufficient importance in the industry of growing cotton, manufacturing cotton lint, or of manufacturing cotton yarn. This is not to he an authority with a tenure, responsible for the continuity and regularity of the conditions of the to ' industry. We are to have tribunals to determine from time to time what wages and conditions are fair and reasonable in purany of the three branches of the industry for that I have named. There could hardly be a more ill-considered scheme presented of cotton to a responsible assembly. The honourable member for Parkes (Mr. MCTiernan) has made a most surprising suggestion. We can only suppose that he conhas misunderstood the words of the clause. He told us the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court has power,- as a court, .to deal only with interstate disputes. We all know that. That is a commonplace in this Parliament at least. He said that clause 13 therefore could not be applied save in the case of am interstate dispute. Had the honourable member gone on to draw the conclusion that the clause as originally proposed was invalid and ineffective, - and that the same provision which was passed last week in the Wine Export Bounty Bill was equally invalid and ineffective, as were all similar provisions in other bounty bills, he might have been thought to iiave made some discovery. But he did not draw that conclusion. The Commonwealth Court has power to deal only with interstate disputes. Insofar as this Parliament legislates under paragraph xxxv of section 51 of the Commonwealth Constitution, it can confer power on an authority only to deal with interstate disputes. But the legislation under consideration is not introduced under that section of the Constitution at all; it is legislation under the bounty power conferred by section 90 of the Constitution. That section confers exclusive power on this Parliament to grant bounties on the production and export of goods, an exclusive power modified only by the provisions of section 91, which provides that the States may, nevertheless, grant a bounty upon ""mining for gold, silver, or other metal"" and that "" with the consent of both Houses of the Parliament of the Commonwealth expressed by resolution "" a State may grant "" any aid to or bounty on the production or export of goods"". This legislation being under the bounty power, this clause is not limited to interstate disputes. Our bounty legislation bas been uniform ever since bounties have been granted. All the bounty acts provide that bounties shall be paid only when fair and reasonable conditions of employment are observed. The settlement of a dispute is utterly alien to this bill, and perfectly irrelevant. The limits of jurisdiction of the Arbitration Court have nothing whatever to do with anything dealt with in this lull. The bill does not purport to confer .niy additional power on the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. But this Parliament can require the court or the Comptroller-General of Customs, or the Soliciior-Geueral, to determine what wages and conditions are fair and reasonable in an industry to which a bounty is being paid, and what this clause does is to provide that a judge or the Chief Judge of the Arbitration Court may determine what wages and conditions of employment are fair and reasonable.",71
266,Mr MARTENS,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,At any old time that he likes.,72
267,Mr LATHAM,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"If the honourable member reads the first line of the clause he will see that the "" Minister may make application"", and thereupon the judge, may determine the wages and conditions of employment. The power of the judge is to be exercised when application is made by a Minister, and not otherwise; not at times to be determined by the judge himself. Nor is he to deal with special disasters that may arise. The Minister appears to have no conception of the meaning of his original.clause, or of the already <once-varied amendment which he has introduced. Disasters, catastrophes, calamities, and other horrors, and terrors are not within the jurisdiction even of the new Commonwealth authorities. The Minister was entirely wrong when he suggested that he could overtake the thunderstorm almost with the speed of light by the appointment of a special authority to deal, with a matter. The clause confers no such power. It is a power to determine wages and conditions of labour and, if exercised, will introduce an entirely novel method of determining what shall be the wages and conditions in the three grouped cotton industries. Already certain awards apply in the factories. Evidently they are satisfactory, as no one suggests that the operatives there are not working under proper conditions. This authority, not a judge of the Arbitration Court-wh o would be familiar with the existing awards, and would have some idea of proper relativity-is to determine those wages and conditions.",72
268,Mr FORDE,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,What about an award for the cotton-pickers?,72
269,Mr LATHAM,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"The Acting Minister has already abandoned, about two-thirds of the ground on which he stood. There is no - need for any further overlapping in industrial tribunals. The wages and conditions in the factories and ginneries have already been, determined; consequently there is not a shadow of justification for this proposal.",72
270,Mr BLAKELEY,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,The Leader of the Opposition is putting up bogys and knocking them down.,72
271,Mr LATHAM,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Blakeley) rouses from his torpor from time to time in order to get an interjection into Hansard. The Acting Minister has said that there is no award in. force applicable to the cottonpickers.,72
272,Mr FORDE,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"There was a State award, but it was abolished by the present Queensland Government. Why set up a tremendously expensive tribunal to determine picking rates, when they could be determined by a tribunal in Queensland immediately?",72
273,Mr LATHAM,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"The first answer to that is that if that is all that this clause is intended to deal with there is no need to mention in it the labour employed in the ginneries and factories. The second answer is that there is no reason whatever why a judge of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, whose salary would be paid in any case, should not deal with the case of the cotton-pickers instead of a tribunal composed of three persons who, presumably, would be paid fees. The clause provides for an unnecessary addition to our existing machinery. The amendment was not thought of when the clause was drafted, but it appears to have been introduced as a means of bringing a new rural award into operation in Queensland. The State Parliament abolished the rural award formerly in force in that State.",72
274,Mr MARTENS,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,It did not; the award Was abolished by an executive minute.,72
275,Mr LATHAM,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"At any rate it was abolished by action which was legally effective in Queensland, and for' which the present Queensland Government was responsible; and the Government has not been turned out of office hy the Queensland Parliament. There seems to be little doubt that the object of this amendment is to re-impose the rural award in Queensland.",73
276,Mr FORDE,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,The farmers have no objection to paying decent wages.,73
277,Mr LATHAM,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"If any evidence had been submitted to the committee that the workers in this industry needed protection, steps could be taken to protect them; but no such argument has heen advanced. I suggest that the determination of the wages and conditions of the cottonpickers should be left to be controlled by the Queensland Government or Parliament unless some obviously wrong, outrageous or scandalous ill-treatment has been meted out to the workers there. If that had been the case we should have heard of it three or four times over from the Acting Minister.",73
278,Mr BLAKELEY,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,Why is the Leader of the Opposition stone-Walling the bill?,73
279,Mr LATHAM,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"That remark is offensive to me, and I ask that it be withdrawn.",73
280,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY, I do not think that a charge of stone-walling can be regarded as offensive.,73
281,Mr BLAKELEY,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,This is the most disgraceful stone-walling that has ever taken place in this Parliament.,73
282,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"- I think that the use of the word "" disgraceful "" is objectionable, and I ask the Minister to withdraw it.",73
283,Mr BLAKELEY,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,I withdraw it.,73
284,Mr LATHAM,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"If the workers in this industry had been ill-treated in any way, the Acting Minister would have mentioned it ; but it is much too late to advance that as a justification for the amendment. If the amendment is agreed to, confusion must follow, and there is a danger that the real object of the Government might be destroyed. I hope that the committee will reject the amendment on the grounds that it is wrong in principle, and that there is no need for it.",73
285,Mr MACKAY,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"Lilley) [11.43] - I do not think that a single member of this committee would stone-wall a bill of this importance. This is the first time an important principle of this kind has been introduced into a bill by a ministerial amendment. Had a proposal of this kind been included in the bill in the first place, the Opposition would have fought it at every stage. The real object of the bill is now becoming apparent. While my sympathies are entirely with the cotton. growers, I have no confidence that the proposals of the bill will afford them any assistance. This whole scheme, it seems to me, is designed to protect the manufacturers, aud to provide high wages, at the expense of the taxpayers, for the workers in the industry. It certainly cannot assist the cotton-growers. While I admit that the men who work in country districts have as much right to a good living as the men who work in the cities, and am prepared to do my best to secure this for them, I must say that economically the cotton industry cannot be used for the purpose of paying even the basic wage to any section of the community. What I object to, so far as this amendment is concerned, is the introduction of the system of special authorities for fixing wages. As pointed out by the honourable member for Warringah  ence of the operation of these special authorities in the coal tribunal. We know that the miners and coal-owners get together, the owners saying, "" We have to get our profits,"" and the miners saying, "" We have to get our high wages,"" and the people who buy coal have to pay both with the result that industry in general is penalized. If the same sort of thing is to happen in the cotton industry it will not outlive one season. I am surprised that it is proposed to set up a special authority, seeing that cotton is only grown in Queensland, where there is a State Arbitration Court available which cannot be said to be not in full sympathy with the workers. As constituted today, it is exactly the same tribunal as was appointed by the State Lahour Government. It is to the credit of the Moore Government that, when it altered the basis of the Board of Trade, it reappointed the three gentlemen who previously held office. There is, therefore, no occasion to go to extra expense or to harass the growers by setting up this special authority, and I certainly object to the Minister springing this surprise in the committee stage of the bill. If the Minister with his big majority sitting behind the Government insists, surely it is desirable that the representatives of the employer and the employee should select the chairman. If the cotton growers of Queensland had the slightest idea that their industry was to be made use of to bolster artificial conditions in Australia, they would have said that cotton-growing could go, because they could make use of their land for other purposes. It is not too late for the Minister to realise the position. I strongly urge him to allow progress to bo reported, because it will be quite impossible for him to get this amendment through without serious objection from honourable members of the Opposition. The hour is already late, and as there are other important clauses to be debated, the Minister must be prepared to sit to at least 4 o'clock in the morning to get his measure through. Mir. FBAKCIS (Moreton) [11.48] - I regret very much that this important industry should have its prospects jeopardized by this extraordinary proposal brought forward in such a hush-hush way. There was not .the slightest reference to it on the second reading, and the Minister has apparently used very possible means to keep it from honourable members. Now that the - Prime Minister has entered the chamber, I trust that he will not 88k honourable members to sit late on this the first sitting day of the week. The present proposal is unworthy of the Government. It should not be brought forward at such a late hour, and, in any case, honourable members of the Opposition are entitled to some oourtesy for the assistance they have rendered in getting the bill through. If any obstruction has been raised it has come from the Acting Minister himself. He has found it necessary to get up and reply after every speech delivered from the Opposition. I have not seen this done on - any other bill. : [H8] nn sure 'that, if a record were taken of the number of speeohes on this measure, the Minister would be found to have occupied the greater part of the time.",73
286,Mr LEWIS,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,I rise to a point of order. I want to know whether the honourable member for Moreton is in order in making reference to the number of speeohes made by the Acting Minister and what relation it has to the clause under discussion?,74
287,The CHAIRMAN,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,Mr MCGRATH) The honourable member is quite entitled to make an incidental reference to the time occupied by a Minister.,74
288,Mr FRANCIS,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"- I shall not continue my reference to which the kindergarten member for Corio (Mr Lewis) seems to take objection. I am seriously interested in the development of the cotton industry, and at all times I have done all I possibly could to get it established successfully. I am sorry to see that the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs, who has also made a certain contribution to. its development, is now trying to shatter its prospects hy creating an extraordinarily just suspicion in the minds of the farmers. I am satisfied that there is more harm than help likely to come to the f armers from this proposal. I am sure that the growers will be as certain as I am that the whole purpose of the. bill, particularly of the amendment we are now discussing, is to build'up artificial conditions in Australia and to assist those engaged in manufacturing and knitting rather than the producers.' TMB proposal will deny to the producers of Queensland the fruit of their industry. Never before has such an injustice been perpetrated. For years these farmers have been building up an industry in the hope that they would get a chance to develop it successfully.",74
289,Mr MARTENS,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,How will the amendment injure them?,74
290,Mr FRANCIS,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"The honourable member for Herbert has perhaps forgotten that every time there has been an effort to develop cotton-growing, those engaged in the field work have taken all the honey from the comb and left the farmer with the wax.",74
291,Mr THEODOBB,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,Why is the honourable I am member obstructing the bill ?,74
292,Mr FRANCIS,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"If the Government will agree to the proposal made by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Latham) I shall stop at once, but my concern is to see that the farmers in the cotton growing industry obtain justice. If Ministers are interested solely in the secondary producers, let them say so frankly. I am anxious to see the industry prosper;",75
293,Mr SCULUCH,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,But do you want the bill or do you not?,75
294,Mr FRANCIS,COTTON INDUSTRIES BOUNTY,"I want to see the industry meet with every success. Mr SctrixiN - If Queenslanders do not want the bill, the honourable member can sit down, progress can be reported and the bill dropped.",75
