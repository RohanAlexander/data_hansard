1,Mr MANNING,Unknown,"In view of the adverse vote on the question of Imperial preference recently given in the House of Commons, and the very far-reaching and injurious effect the decision must have on soldier and other settlement on our i r r i gation areas, will the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) consult with the Leader of - the Opposition to ascertain whether, even at this belated hour, the Opposition will see f it to abandon its attitude of indifference on this vital matter, in order that a united appeal may be made to the Labour Government of Great B r it a in , in the hope that the decision may yet be reversed.",12
2,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,I think the honourable member's question would more appropriately have been addressed to the Leader of the Opposition. I have appealed to him aud to; all the members of the Opposition to support the Government in its efforts to obtain preference for the industries of Australia but my efforts in that direction have not been successful. I do not think there is much prospect of achieving what the honourable member,12
3,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Is the Prime M i nister aware that the Labour party has made it publicly known that it was in favour of preference, and would have voted for it had that matter been placed before the House separately? Further, is he aware that the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Manning) was oue of a number in this House who prevented the Labour party from expressing its views on this question?",12
4,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"It is difficult to answer the honourable member without appearing to try to score a political advantage.. I remind the honourable gentleman that he had every opportunity to assist the Government 'in its efforts to influence the British Government towards granting preference: Those opportunities were all scorned by the honourable gentlemen opposite, and the assistance, which, under existing political circumstances in Great Britain , would have been of the greatest, value, was not forthcoming. For that I express my regret.",12
5,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,It was due to the manner in. which the Government presented the matter to the House-. NA CANADA.,12
6,Mr GREGORY,RECIPROCAL TRADE WIT H,"In view of the fact that Canada, with an unlimited market for raisins aud currants, has made an offer of special preference to Australia, will the Prime Minister inform the House why the papers connected therewith have not been laid on the table?",12
7,Mr BRUCE,RECIPROCAL TRADE WIT H,"As the honourable member is no doubt aware, negotiations have taken place between this Government and the Government of Canada regarding a reciprocal trade arrangement. Senator Wilson proceeded to Canada during the period he! was abroad, and consulted with the Canadian Government. He returned to Australia only a few .days ago, and there has not been an opportunity since then to discuss the matter with him. As soon as a decision has been arrived at, the intention of the Governmenferwillbe made clear to the House. OIL AGREEMENT BILL . Mji-. FENTON - In a Bill which passed through this Chamber last night provision is made for the payment of £125,000 to the Anglo-Persian O il Company, which sum it is proposed to raise byway of loan. Seeing that the Treasurer next month is expected to announce a surplus of £10,000,000, does the Prime Minister not think that a better course would be to pay that money from the surplus, instead of borrowing it at 6 per cent. ? - ",12
8,Mr BRUCE,RECIPROCAL TRADE WIT H,"I am afraid that, in reply to questions without notice, not express my opinion on every matter which may be raised by honourable memmake an appointment? bers. Every opportunity was given last night, while the Bill was under discushonorable - sion, for the point raised by the honorlow : able member to be discussed. Later, when nnanciai measures are before the trial House, further opportunity for discusbers sion will be given. UNEMPLOYEDINTHENORTHERN belong.

That section of the line has been permanently surveyed. The MinisNations ter then said he would give the matter call consideration. I now ask him that has been done, and, if so, what decision was arrived at !",13
9,Mr STEWART,RECIPROCAL TRADE WIT H,"I very much regret that the honourable member has not been furnished with a reply. I shall again look into the matter, and shall let the honourable member know as soon as possible. SKIN WOO L CASE.",13
10,Mr MANNING,RECIPROCAL TRADE WIT H,H as the Government yet arrived at any decision in the ment. skin wool case?,13
11,Mr BRUCE,RECIPROCAL TRADE WIT H,"Certain representations were made to the Government by those ment persons who put into the Wool Pool skin wool, which was subsequently purchased age' by Great Britain . A f t e r those representaployment. tions wer.e made, counter representations work, were made by other interests concerned in that wool. The Government has conage sidered the views expressed by both sides, at sea. and further consideration will be given them during the early part of next week: I hope to be in a positiou to make an announcement of the Government's decision on Wednesday or Thursday of next week.

16,Mr CORSER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AN D,"the Minister for T r a d e and Customs, upon notice I. Is it a fact that the Institute of Science and Industry is unable to perform a considerable part of its statutory functions on accoimt of want of money to carry on important investigations, and that its work has been severely restricted to a few special investigations? 2. Does the Government consider that, in a large and practically undeveloped country like the Commonwealth of Australia, there is a necessity for determined continuing and well organized scientific work. If so, will the Government make ample provision on the next Estimates so that all necessary investigations can be; made ? 3. Will he cause the Journal of Science and Industry to be again published and circulated monthly 7  attaches great i m p o r t a n c e to the question of the a p p l i c at i on of science to in d u s try , and considers there is g r e at necessity in Australia for continuous and w e l l organized scientific in v e s t i g at i o n . Difficulty has beeu experienced in the past in connection with this matter by reason of the existence in the various States of Departments carrying on work of this character, which has led to a sure of duplication. Subject to this duplication being done away with, the Government is prepared to take active steps to expand the work of the InstiOffices) tute of Science and Industry. The prohave vision of funds for the next financial is now receiving the attention of the Government. The matters by the honourable member will receive careful consideration. FEDERA L BUTTER BOARD .

These proposals been carefully and full y considered some other source? by the Government, and several consultion tations have taken place with representatives of the industry. In the form in which the proposals were submitted it was impracticable to give effect to follow: them, and this fact is recognized by the representatives referred to.

Whether every official' of the Mandated Territory of New Guinea is asked to sign an oath of secrecy, as well as un oath of allegiance ? 2. Is every missionary in the Mandated Territory asked to sign an oath of secrecy, and also an oath of allegiance? 3. Will the Minister make available with his replies copies of the oaths in question?",16
24,Mr ATKINSON,OATHS OF SEOBECY AND,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. The New Guinea Public Service Ordinance provides, inter alia, that no person shall be admitted to the Public Service unless he makes and subscribes an oath or affirmation of allegiance. So far as the Department is aware, officials are not asked to sign an oath of secrecy. 2. One of the conditions upon which authority was given for German missionaries to remain in the Territory for a period of seven years as from the 1st June, 1921, was that they should be prepared to take an oath of loyalty. So for as the Department is aware, German missionaries are not asked to take an oath of secrecy. 3. The form of oath or affirmation of allegiance required to be taken and subscribed by officials of the New Guinea Service appears in the schedule to the New Guinea Public Service Ordinance 1922. Particulars of the oath of loyalty in the case of German missionaries are being obtained. POST OFFICE , RUNDLE - STREE T,",16
25,Mr YATES,OATHS OF SEOBECY AND,"the Minister for W o r k s and R a i l w a y s , upon notice I. When will the work of erecting the proposed new post-office in Rundle-street east, Adelaide, be commenced? 2. Have any complaints been recently made as to the inconvenience occasioned by the congestion in the present building; if so, will he expedite the erection of the new premises?",16
26,Mr STEWART,OATHS OF SEOBECY AND,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l low:1. It is considered desirable to erect a building commensurate with the very valuable site which has been acquired by the Commonwealth in Rundle-street, Adelaide, and sketch plans' of a structure of several floors are in course 'of preparation with a view to submission to the Postal authorities, and, if necessary, the Public Works Committee. It is understood that the accommodation is urgently required, and consideration of this matter will be expedited as soon as possible. 2. It has been ascertained that no complaints have been received as to the inconvenience occasioned by the congestion in the present building; but it is advised that the lease of that building will be determined in August, 1924, and, pending the erection of the new building, it is proposed to convert portion of ALLEGIANCE. the premises on the acquired site into temporary postal accommodation. INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE.",16
27,Mr COOK,OATHS OF SEOBECY AND,"the Treasurer, upon notice^1. Haye over three millions of money' been paid in. overseas exchange principally on primary products, during - the past twelve months ? 2. If not, what was the approximate amount paid in exchange? 3.

(b) ' The Commonwealth Sank to enter into active competitive exchange business. (c) The creation of private facilities for clearing house purposes. (d) The encouraging of branches of overseas banks to engage in foreign exchange business on competitive basis ?",16
28,Dr EARLE PAGE,OATHS OF SEOBECY AND,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1 and 2. I have no information, and I am afraid it is impossible to answer these questions. 3. These are not matters which can directly be handled by the Government, but the'exchange difficulties will be ameliorated by the early passage of the Amending Commonwealth Bank Bill to permit the proper functioning of that institution as remodelled. NEW GUINEA. . ADELAIDE. WITHDRAWAL OF NOTICE OF MOTION . Notice of motion No . 2 (by Mr . FORDE ) r e l at in g to A d m in is t r at i o n of N e w Guinea, by leave, with d r a w n . COMMONWEALTH BANK BILL. SECOND BEADING . Debate resumed from 13th J u n e (vide page 1 2 9 2 ) , o n m o t i o n by Dr EARL E PAGEThat the Bill be now read a second time.",16
29,Mr CHARLTON,OATHS OF SEOBECY AND,"Hunter ) [11.18] The Treasurer (Dr E a r l e Page) , in m o v in g the*second r e a d in g of t h is Bill , gave a h is to r y of the central b a n k in g systems in many countries. That information will no doubt be of considerable assistance to members in debating the Bill . The Commonwealth Bank was established by a Labour Government, and, under the guidance of the late Sir Denison Miller, nfade progress which, although substantial, has not been so rapid as those who created the Bank desired. ""We expected that it would become a national bank, truly a people's bank. To do that it would have to come into competition with the existing banks, but it has not come into keen competition with them. There are many large towns in Australia where a branch of the bank is desired, but where one does not exist. I mention these facts to indicate that it has not functioned up. to the expectations of the party that created it . If we had continued in power, we should certainly have taken steps to make it a truly national bank, operating in the in terests of the people of Australia. In view of the great difficulties that the management of the Bank had to face, one can understand - perhaps why it did not make such great strides as we desired. When the original Bill was before this House members of the then Government were warned to be careful about the legislation that they Were endeavouring to pass. They were told that it was ""ill-digested,"" and that if it was put into operation it would injur e the country. To illustrate the attitude of opponents of the Bill , I shall quote a few extracts from the speeches of honourable members who then sat on this, but afterwards moved to the other side. The Bill was introduced by Mr Andrew ""Pisher, who moved that it 1 be read a second time. Sir Joseph Cook, now High Commissioner in London, in terjected that it was to give "" sovereigns for every one,"" meaning, of course, that the Government was giving away the people's money. The ex-member for Angas (Mr Glynn) did not think that there was any urgent necessity for the Bill , even if there was any necessity for it at all. The ex-member for Richmond, who is now Senator Mjassy Greene, was very anxious that the Bank should not be established. He said I sliould like to say at the outset that the deeper we go into it, and the more we read about it, the more doubtful we shall be. . .' I do almost beg of the Government, before they finally commit themselves and the 'House to this particular scheme, to' have a thorough (Mr Charlton. inquiry made. . . . We cannot tell whethei this may be found to be. the worse possible proposal which Australia could have adopted. That protest came from an honourable member who was regarded as a financial expert. The then member forEast Sydney, Mr Kelly",16
30,Mr WEST,OATHS OF SEOBECY AND,Not East Sydney !,17
31,Mr CHARLTON,OATHS OF SEOBECY AND,"I have apparently done an injustice to the honourable member for East Sydney. I forgot that he succeeded a much larger figure in politics than Mr Kelly, who represented the constituency of Wentworth - He saidThe financing is clumsy, and difficult, and bound to lead to muddle of a serious nature. The following objections were also taken to the measure: Mr Fairbairn saidTf the people desire such a bank, they must have it, though those who are clamouring for it will be disappointed in it when they get it. . . . If we arc to have a national bank, let it be. conducted on proper lines, and not by a mere hole-and-corner institution. These were the views of the late L o r d ForrestIt has not been proved that ""the measure is urgently needed, or that there is a gap which it will fill. . . . As there is no urgency for the measure, I should like the Government to postpone it. To establish a bank on unsafe lines will do uo good, and may do a great deal of harmThe late Mr Deakin saidSo novel an institution-on e so unknown and unprecedented-require s novel and unprecedented conditions for the security of the people whose money is at stake. Sir Robert Best said I say that no substantial benefits or advantages are going to be achieved by a transfer such as is now proposed by this Bill. Sir John Quick saidMy fundamental objection to the scheme in the Bill is that it has no substantial precedent in the history of the world's finance and banking. Sir Joseph Cook saidSo far as the great struggling masses outside are concerned, this is another piece of Dead Sea fruit that the Government are offering-them. . . . The House ought to pause before plunging into this enterprise, which must be fraught with serious consequences to the future of Australia. Among those who voted against' the t h i r d reading of the Bill were two members of the., present Government, the Attorneyr.General (Sir Littleton Groom) and the Vice-President of the Executive Council (Mt. Atkinson). From these facts it will be seen that the management of the Bank had to be very careful. It-had to take cognizance of a strong political party that was opposed to a national bank in any shape or form. In addition, people outside of Parliament with strong influence in financial circles opposed the Bill , and everything possible was done, I have no doubt, to prevent the Bank from coming into competition with private banks. The Treasurer has told us that absence of competition has made his task very much easier today in converting the Bank into a central bank. There can be no doubt of the necessity for the Commonwealth Bank. Records show that the banking institutions of this country are ou a very sound basis. In the Official Year-Book for 1923 there is a table dealing with the cheque-paying banks and their resources. I have no desire to quote the figures, except to say that the dividends of the private banks range from 7 per cent, up to 20 per cent. While the subscribed capital is £50,122,469, the amount placed to reserve, after paying dividends from time to time is £32,928,568. It is a good thing for the country that these private institutions are financially sound, but the figures show the necessity for the Commonwealth taking control of banking in order to regulate it in the interests of the people. Finance in the Commonwealth should be our Bock of Gibraltar, for it controls everything. Many of our present day difficulties have their origin in finance. It is claimed that the Bill is introduced to extend the powers of the Bank. The powers which the Bill claims to confer, however, are already in the Act ; they were put there by the Labour party. If honourable members will refer to section 7 of the Act they will see that this is so; they will find that the powers of the Bank remain intact in the amending Bill , which confers no additional powers. We have to look, therefore, for some other reason for proposing to amend the Act. When speaking on this aspect of the matter, the Treasurer saidWhen the question of a Commonwealth Bank was first mooted, it was generally expected that a truly national bank would be established- a bank of deposit, issue, discount, exchange, and reserve. When the Bill was introduced, however, expectations were not realized, and when the Bank began to function it became perfectly clear that a national bank had not been established, but merely a governmental institution in competition with the private banks. The Bill the Government now brings forward is designed to carry out the original expectation. Why is it that the Treasurer so scathingly condemns the limitation of the Bank's powers? Is not the Commonwealth Bank a. bank of deposit? Every one knows it is. There is provision to that effect in section 7 of the Act, and there is nothing in the Bill to amend it . Is it not a bank of issue ? Again, there is not one word in the Bill that alters the provision in the Act, which remains in the form in which it passed this House. Is it not a bank of exchange 1 Not one word in the Bill makes it more a bank of exchange than it is, for the Bill will give no additional power. The power is in the Act, and if the Bank has not reached out far enough in these directions, it was only necessary to make it do so. It is idle for the Treasurer to claim that the Bill confers additional powers when it does not do so. Is not the Commonwealth Bank already a bank of reserve ? There is nothing in the Bill to make it such. The Bank remains as it was originally, yet we hear much about it being given wider powers. What, then, is the motive behind the Bill , for T have shown clearly that it will netgive additional powers to the Bank ? It provides, among other things, for an increase of capital. Here again the Government proposes to do something that is unnecessary, for the Fisher Governmenb made provision for . a. capital of £10,000,000. Fortunately the Bank was able to carry on without raising so much money, and it has actually made a profit of £4,000,000. The Treasurer now proposes that half .that profit shall go into the Treasury, and that the Bank shall .borrow £6,000,000 from him at the current rate of interest. The amount of capital which the Bank may raise under this measure is the same as under the original Act. The Treasurer proposes'that half the Bank's profits shall De paid into the Sinking Fund Bedemption Fund. I have no objection to using the profits of the Bank in this way, but I think that the Bank's first duty is to liquidate any debts it incurs by borrowing. Then the profits could well be used to reduce the national debt. But the - Bank will be placed in a. most unfair - position if it is compelled to apply part of its profits to reduce the nationaiHdebt before it has liquidated its liabilities. As a matter of fact, the real object of the Governmeut in introducing the Bill is to place the management of the Bank under the control of a board of directors. is provided that there shall be eight directors. Two of these shall be appointed from within the Public Service, one of whom shall be the Secretary to the Treasury and the other the Governor of the Bank. The remaining six directors shall be appointed to represent, various big interests. Two are to be financial experts, two are to represent the pastoral interests and two the manufacturing in terests of the country. The big pastoral interests have played a very import a n t part in the government of Australia during the last two years-altogethe r too large a part, in fact. The Board of D i rectors is to control all the affairs of the Bank, including the 'Note Issue Department, which is to be entirely handed over to them. The Bill is nothing less than an attempt to k ill the Bank. How can the institution be made more of a national Bank than it is when it is proposed to appoint as directors persons who, generally speaking, are entirely opposed to the nationalization of banking, or of anything else? The board of directors, with the exception of the two publio servants, and possibly the two special currency officers, will, if the Bill is passed, be composed of men whoi are altogether out of sympathy with the objects of a real national bank operating in competition with the existing private banks. The Treasurer may say in reply to this contention that no managers or officers of private banks w i ll be eligible for appointment to the Board of Directors. That is so, but there is nothing in the Bill to say that men who hold large interests in private banks shall not be appointed. In fact, it may happen that a very heavy shareholder in a private bank will be appointed to the Board. It is hardly in accord with human nature to expect such a, man to operate the Bank in the interests of the general public. His first concern will be the preservation of the interests of the private banking enterprises with which he is connected.",17
32,Mr MAHONV,OATHS OF SEOBECY AND,That is the scheme.,19
33,Mr CHARLTON,OATHS OF SEOBECY AND,"I believe that it is. Why should we appoint men from - outside the Commonwealth Service to guide the affairs of the Bank 1 "" Th'e Treasurer stated in his speech that the practice the Government proposes <""o adopt has been followed by other national banks, which he mentioned, but I shall show, chiefly from information It supplied by the Treasurer himself, that there are fundamental differences between his proposal' and the conditions whioh govern the banks to which he referred. The Board of Directors is to control the note issue and issue new notes from time to time, but the Bill provides no method by which its activities in this respect may be supervised. It will be quite possible for it to protect the interests of private banks which desire to discount their bills by issuing such a number of notes that they will accumulate in the private banks, and no reserve will be available in the Commonwealth Bank to meet them. That position cannot be avoided. Another objectionable feature of the proposed Board is the considerable expense it will involve. Of the eight directors five are to receive £ 6 0 0 , and the chairman £1,000 per annum. The other two will be public servants. It is provided that the Board shall sit at least once a month. In practice that is what will happen, and the members of the Board will thus receive £ 5 0 per sitting. The Board will cosfc £4,000 per annum, apart from the salaries of the two public servants. It is provided, in addition, that there shall be advisory boardsi n the principal cities. I svippose that means one board in each State. These are to consist of three members, each of whom will receive £ 2 0 0 per annum. Therefore the advisory boards will cost an additional £3,600. The management of a bank is thus to involve an expenditure of £7,600 per annum. The Bill provides that, as far as possible, the members of the Central Board shall also be members of the subsidiary boards, but nothing is said about whether they are to receive two salaries. It is quite likelv that the men who occupy these dual positions will receive £600 per annum by reason of their membership of the Central Board, and another £200 per annum by reason of their membership of the local Board. Altogether too many boards have been appointed in Australia lately. The Government is controlled by boards. We have the Tariff Board, the Publio Service Board, the Note Issue Board, the Commonwealth Line Board, the - .Canberra Board, the P r u it Board, the ' Meat Board, the Expropriation Board, the Film Censor Board, the Bepatriation Board, the War Service Homes Board, the War Service Homes Advisory. Board, the War Service Homes Disposals Board, the Murray Biver Board, the Military Board, the Naval Board, a.nd the A i r Board. A dare say that if I had had more time. I could have added quite a number of others to the list. sufficiently long, however, to indicate clearly that the administration of the country in the last two or three years iiiis been handed over to boards, unci that the mentbetrs of the Government, have been passing on their responsibilities to other people The time has come when Ministers .should retain' full responsibility for the administration of affairs. We should get back to responsible government, and the work involved in acceptance of Cabinet portfolios should be done by the Ministers, who should be directly answerable to Parliament. the present circumstances, when complaints are made about loose administrative) methods, Ministers never fail lo blame the various boards. They will not accept responsibility which rightly is theirs. If Parliament agrees to the appointment; of a Board of Directors for the Commonwealth Ba.uk, ancl it is found, subsequently, that the affairs cf fchafc institution are not being conducted satisfactorily-that , in short, the Bank is becoming a bankers' bank instead of a national bank-the Government doubtless say "" The Board is to blame."" It will shelter itself behind this Board as it has behind many others. I strongly object to the long term for which appointees to the Board will hold office. One member is to be appointed for seven years, and others for six, five, four, three, and two years, respectively. Why should they be appointed for such long periods? There is only one reason. It is that the Government anticipates that another party will shortly occupy the Treasury bench, and it wishes to tie the hands of the new Ministers. That is the plain explanation of this aspect of the proposal. No one can justify appointing a member of such a. Board as this for seven years. Who can say whether the appointee will do his work satisfactorily ? The Government may feel confident when it makes its selection that the appointee is full y qualified, but it may find after he has occupied the position for a little while, that he is incomft petent. In such a case it will be very difficult to discharge him. No man "" in ordinary business life would appoint, an officer to an important position such as this will be for such a long term unless he had the fullest jxissible confidence in the man's ability. I could understand the Government proposing that, the memIfc Ls bers of the Board should hold office for. say, two years. By that time it would be possible fco ascertain whether they were competent, and if they were they could easily be re-appointed. To suggest appointing them for seven, six, five, four, or even three years, is ridiculous. The Bill proposes that the Bank shall have power to rediscount bills of exchange for other banks. In that connection the Treasurer saidOne of the most important functions of a central bank is that of re-discounting, by means of which, under all ordinary circumstances, each other bank is able to convert In its bills of exchange into legal tender money. He also observedWhenever a slight monetary stringency manifests itself there is a tendency for bankers to make every effort towards increase of 'cash reserves. Thus the stringency is aggravated . The Treasurer proposes to cure financial stringency by inflation. That could be done easily, of course, by issuing additional - notes, and I remind honorablo members that the Government will have » no power to l i m it the isstie of will notes by the Board. Those who control the Bank will control the notes. . Therefore it will be a simple thing for them to cure monetary stringency by inflating-the currency. One evil is fco be checked by developing another. May I remind the House that in all other countries the central banks require the member banks to pay reserves into the central institution. This Bill makes noprovision for a reserve to be controlled by the Commonwealth Bank. An y private . bank is to be allowed to present its bill for discount without offering any security. The Treasurer said that the Government did not propose to make it compulsory for private banks to pay in. reserves; he thoiight it would be better to leave that optional, but he hoped that the banks would put some reserves intothe Commonwealth Bank. How any in telligent man can propose to'leave it optional with the private banks to deposit reserves in the central bank which,,is. to discount the bills of private banks is beyond my comprehension. The Treasurer gave a summary of the banking practice in other countries, and it showed that in every instance the depositing of reserves in the central bank is obligatory.",19
34,Dr EAKLEPAGE,OATHS OF SEOBECY AND,In other countries where the central bank keeps the reserves the private banks find the capital.,21
35,Mr CHARLTON,OATHS OF SEOBECY AND,E x a c t l y ; and one of the weaknesses of this Bill is that it will compel the Commonwealth to provide the capital. The Treasurer statedTho Government believes that it is proposing all that can be done by legislation towards bringing about a true system of central banking. But he admits that the system he has they get discounted. proposed is not in operation in other countries.,21
36,Dr EAELEPAGE,OATHS OF SEOBECY AND,It is in operation in England.,21
37,Mr CHARLTON,OATHS OF SEOBECY AND,That is the one exception. I may be pardoned if I have a suspicion that the bank managers have been in close contact with the or his officials in connection with the drafting of this Bill . A rumour is curmember rent that - the first d r a f t was withdrawn considerably amended at the instance private bankers.,21
38,Dr EAKLE PAGE,OATHS OF SEOBECY AND,That is quite true.,21
39,Mr CHARLTON,OATHS OF SEOBECY AND,"I am glad to have the Treasurer's assurance. It however, that the private bankers are very well satisfied with the proposals that the Government has made. The TreaUnited surer further statedTlie policy of the management up present has heen not to enter into active rivalry with the trading banks, and in pursuance this policy the interest payable on Commonwealth Saving Bank deposits is and has ways been lower than the interest paid State institutions. It is fortunate that policy is such as has been described, because by reason of that policy the conversion Commonwealth Bank into a central bank has been rendered easier. I have always contended that the Comof monwealth Bank has not been developed to the extent that was intended by Labour party when the Bank was founded, and if that restriction of development facilitates the conversion of the bank into America. a central bank governed by such loose ditions as the Treasurer has indicated, is very much to be regretted. I invite the attention of honourable members to some features of the practice of central banks in other countries. The capital of the United States central banks must be subscribed hy the private banks in proportion to the assets of teach bank. This Bill makes no such proposal. In the United States each bank must keep a balance in the central bank, equal to 7 per cent, of demand deposits and 3 per cent, of time deposits. This Bill does not provide for that. The whole of the Commonwealth credit is to be made available to be drawn upon by the private banks, and they are not to be required to place one penny of reserves into the Commonwealth Bank as security for the bills that",21
40,Mr MANN,OATHS OF SEOBECY AND,Is the American Central Bank a trading bank?,21
41,Mr CHARLTON,OATHS OF SEOBECY AND,"How can it be if it is a central bank? It demands that the trading banks shall make deposits, but the Commonwealth Bank is to re-discount the bills of the trading banks without askTreasurer ing for any security.",21
42,Dr EARLE PAGE,OATHS OF SEOBECY AND,Does the honourable think that the central bank will or re-discount the bills of the trading banks of if they do not offer security ?,21
43,Mr CHARLTON,OATHS OF SEOBECY AND,"This Bill provides unno safeguard in that regard, and if representatives of private institutions are to be allowed to sit on the Board we cannot is certain, say what will happen.",21
44,Mr ANSTEY,OATHS OF SEOBECY AND,"If this Bill contained a similar provision to that operating in the States the trading banks of Australia would have to pay £14,000,000 into to the the central bank as a reserve.",21
45,Mr CHARLTON,OATHS OF SEOBECY AND,That is so. The of Federal Reserve Board in the United alStates has power to examine the books by the and affairs of each membet bank. The the only provision in this Bill is that the member bank shall present a quarterly reof the port; there is no power of examination. The Federal Reserve Board of the United States can compel the writin g off doubtful assets of the Federal Reserve Banks. The Commonwealth Bank will the not be able to do that. The Federal Reserve Board in the United States practically ' controls banking practice in The Commonwealth Central conBank will have no such control. The it Federal Reserve Board has power to i m pose a levy upon each member to make up any deficiency in the value of reserves withiu the Central Bank. This Bill does uot confer that power.,21
46,Dr EAKLE PACE,OATHS OF SEOBECY AND,The American CenB tral Bank is owned by the constituent banks.,22
47,Mr CHARLTON,OATHS OF SEOBECY AND,"Yes ; and because tem there is a one-way clearance. it is dealing with private capital it these precautions.. The Commonwealth Central Bank is to deal with public capital, and no safeguards are provided. The American Government issues guarcan antee notes to the Central Bank against deposited values. It exercises the medium of the Reserve Board superthere visory power over the banking system the country; but it does not contribute one penny of the capital or accept one cent.'s worth of responsibility. The monwealth Bank is to take all responsibulk bility under this Bill , thus quite reversshort ing the position that obtains in America. There the private banks provide the capithe Bank of England. tal of the Central Bank; in Australia i will be provided by the Government. That is a most important difference. The people of Australia are to be asked to provide capital to be drawn upon by private institutions without requiring any security or other safeguards.",22
48,Mr WHITSITT,OATHS OF SEOBECY AND,The private could buy out the Commonwealth Bank tomorrow.,22
49,Mr CHARLTON,OATHS OF SEOBECY AND,"That terial. Our duty is to protect the public interests, and this Bill is so drawn while it requires the public to provide the capital it does not safeguard public. In the United States capital is controlled by the but, according to this Bill, property is to be controlled by private capitalists. Again the practice in other countries is to be reversed here. banks are to utilize Government and the Commonwealth is to proper control over them. Africa, under the Act of 1920, the priadvances they get. vate banks are compelled to subscribe funds to the Central Beserve Bank in proportion to their reserve funds, they must keep a balance in the Central Bank equal to 10 per cent, of current deposits and 3 per cent, of time deposits. This Bill does not require the private banks to deposit one penny in the Cenproper tral Bank. Are we justified in passing a measure which does. not protect the Commonwealth in any way?. It is a markable fact that altliough the Treachanges. [60 ] surer gave the House a summary of banking systems in other countries in order to support his recommendation of this ill , an analysis of those systems shows that the practice is the reverse of what he proposes. In the British central sysPri takes vate banks having drafts on the Bank of England must pay them to their creditin the Bank of England. The Bank of England, with its drafts on other banks,, draw legal tender, and it thus prevents one bank amassing legal tender at through the expense of other banks. In this Bill is nothing to prevent that amassof ing of legal tender by one bank. Th Central Bank may indiscriminately dis count the bills of private banks, with t h Comresult that one bank may acquire the of the notes while other banks art of notes. Practically the whole of the gold in England is in the vaults of Even note ret serves are kept in the Bauk of England, the private banks keeping only sufficient notes to meet their daily needs. Neither of those two features of the Bank of England are to be found in this Bill .",22
50,Dr EAKLE PAGE,OATHS OF SEOBECY AND,And they are not found in any Act in England-the y are banks merely the actual banking practice.,22
51,Mr CHARLTON,OATHS OF SEOBECY AND,"And the Treasurer is discarding actual banking pracis immatice. I have here a letter to the honourable member for Bourke from the Bank that of England, which substantiates the statements I have just made. It is clear the that the Central Banks in other countries private are on a footing quite different from that Government; of the Central Bank which is to be estabGovernment lished in the Commonwealth. Each Central Bank abroad requires private capital to be brought to it . This Bill Private provides that the Central Bank shall be money, financed by public capital. In other have no countries the private banks must give In South security to the Central Bank for the",22
52,Dr EAKLE PAGE,OATHS OF SEOBECY AND,Does the honourable member urge that there should be private and capital in the Commonwealth Bank?,22
53,Mr CHARLTON,OATHS OF SEOBECY AND,"I do not; but I do urge that the bank should be administered by men who are in sympathy with it , and are prepared to develop it upon lines, instead of hamstringing it . In Great B r it a in recently, a Royal Commission was appointed to deal'with the requestion of ""currency and foreign exSome of the'members of that Commission were-Lord Cunliffe, Governor of the Bank of England; Sir John Bradbury, Secretary to the Treasurer; W . H . N . Goschen, Chairman Clearing Bankers' Committee; Lord Inchcape, Peninsular and Oriental Company; R. W . Jeans, Bank of Australasia.; Sir Charles Addis, Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. I have extracted the following passages from their recommendations : It is escntiiil that Government borrowing should cease at the earliest possible moment... This credit expansion (necessarilv accompanied by an ever-growing foreign indebtedness) can Jiot fiontinue without seriously threatening our national solvency. A primary condition of the restoration of a sound credit position is the repayment of a large portion of the enormous amount of Government securities now held by the banks.... The State should begin to reduce its indebtedness. The device of niaking money cheap by the increase of tliu note issue can only lend in the end to the collapse of the whole commercial fabric of the country. It is not necessary, nor do we think it desirable, that there sliould lie nu early resumption of the internal circulation of gold coin. Gold should be held in a central reserve as a backing for notes in circulation. All bunks should transfer any gold now held by tliem to the Bank of England. Our conclusions are unanimous. The application of the main principles on which they are based is of vital necessity to the financial stabilitv and well-being of the country. The Commission's recommendations on the question of exchange, and the Bill before us today is intended to give some relief in that direction, but it is very doubtful whether it will clo so. are constantly telling us lhat it is impossible to get any relief in this matter when the amount which is sent away from Australia to meet interest payments is in ex-' cess of the value of our imports. the Bill will enable the Commonwealth Bank to extend its banking operations in London and is an endeavour to overcome, as far as possible, the exchange culty, the Treasurer holds out very little hope of success. He has drawn our attention to the decision of the recent Economic Conference that the holding of tralian securities in London might ameliorate the position somewhat, but it is quite evident that the Conference did not regard this as a cure, and in all the circumstances the relief which this Bill will afford will be very small indeed. however, is no reason why we should not extend the functions of the Commonwealth Mr Charlton. bank to London and endeavour, in every possible way, to reduce the rate of exchange which, as it now stands, is a great handicap to the industries of Australia and to people who have financial dealings abroad. The present high rate of £3 per £.100 is clue, so we are told, to the fact that the Commonwealth and the State Governments have to pay £30,000,000 a year in interest on loans raised in Great Britain. The Treasurer contends that as a young country, we must continue our borrowing abroad, but I claim that we should be careful in doing so,- and that we should reduce our borrowing as much as possible, and so help to stabilize the rate of exchange. No doubt it will be difficult to cease borrowing, but as little as possible should be borrowed outside the necessary arrangements for renewals. During the last twelve months the Commonwealth Government has borrowed + : i 3.000,000 abroad, despite the fact that it iias an overflowing Treasury. Prior to the war, when a Labour Government was in power, all big Commonwealth public works were constructed out of revenue. Mas not the time arrived when the Commonwealth should get back to the first principles of government as carried out by that Labour Government, and thus avoid constant visits to the London money bear markets? I can understand the necessity for borrowing to meet war commitments, but during the last few years, we seem to have got into a. borrowing groove and to Experts be unable to realise where we are d r if t in g . If public works could be built out of revenue prior to the war, why cannot that policy be pursued today after making every allowance for the payment of inAlthough terest on the war indebtedness? I recognize that a high rate of exchange is a big handicap to people engaged in the commercial world, and that to a large extent diffii t nullifies our protective tariff, because, when w© have to accept goods in lieu of money from abroad, it is detrimental to industry in Australia. When the TreaAus- surer was speaking upon the note issue, he drew attention to what he termed a very doubtful matter. The note issue was the creation of the Labour party, and we were careful to keep the issue in the hands of the Treasurer, but since another party, That, has been in power, the control of the issue has been entrusted to a Board, and it is now proposed to transfer that control to a Board which will be created under the provisions of the Bill now before us, so that the Government will have no power over the issue of notes.",22
54,Dr EARLE PAGE,OATHS OF SEOBECY AND,"The Government will always have power, by proclamation, to bring it back to their control.",24
55,Mr CHARLTON,OATHS OF SEOBECY AND,"If the Labour party gets into power, it will face tion as it finds it,'and do what it thinks in the best interests of the country, whether it is done by proclamation or not. Speaking of the right of the banks to get notes, the Treasurer saidAt this early stage of warfinance,a step taken which never has been explained fully. 1 refer to tlio fact that the Government to the banks the right to get £3 in notes for every sovereign presented by the banks at the Treasury. Two out of every £3 of notes issued were treated as a loan to the banks, which were required to pay interest at the of 4 per cent, per annum and to repay tl»e principal not later than twelve months after the end of the war. . . . This three to arrangement was more doubtful in character than any other act of war finance. Of course, it was very doubtful, but inference one could draw from the Treawork their credits. surer's remarks was that the transaction had been carried out by a Labour Government ment.",24
56,Dr EARLE PAGE,OATHS OF SEOBECY AND,I made no such suggestion.,24
57,Mr CHARLTON,OATHS OF SEOBECY AND,"The transaction took place between the 4th August and the 5th September, 1914, when a Liberal Government was in power, so that if there was anything shady or doubtful about honourable members on this side are free from blame.",24
58,Dr EARLE PAGE,OATHS OF SEOBECY AND,"The transaction finally carried into effect in November, when a Labour Government was in office.",24
59,Mr CHAELTON,OATHS OF SEOBECY AND,"The Treasurer told the House that this arrangement which he condemned was converted into which the honourable member is complain one which actually gave the banks millions at a lower rate of interest. pointed out that £28,000,000 worth of notes were issued for 10,000,000 sovereigns placed in the Treasury by the banks, which meant that the banks £3,000,000 on which to base credits for every 1,000,000 sovereigns they placed the Treasury. I do not know that this arrangement was a great improvement that which the Treasurer has condemned. If the previous arrangement which the banks £ 3 to £ 1 was of a doubtful cliaracter, what can be said of one that gave the banks £28,000,000 for 10,000,000 sovereigns? The private banks must have' reaped a considerable benefit. In regard to war gratuities the Treasurer has in- formed us that the banks agreed to lend £6,000,000 at 5$ per cent., and were; given the right to get notes at the same ' the positime. In other words the Governmentsupplied the banks with the legal tender upon which the vast superstructure of bank credit is erected. The £6,000,000 in uotes was a basis for a credit which could be multiplied, some say, five times, and was others three times; but the £6,000,000 was not paid out immediately in cash. The gave banks could go to the Treasury at their' - free will and get notes to the extent of so £6,000,000-whethe r they took them all at once 1 do not know, but as they rate could do so they probably did-bu t they, were not compelled to pay them out i m one mediately. To June, 1920, only £675,878 had been paid out by them in war gratuities, while they"" held the unexthe pended, balance of £5,426,000 on which toI t would have been far better if the Commonwealth Governhad cashed their own war gratuity, bonds rather than depend on the banks. On the 14th December, 1920, when the control of the note issue was entrusted to aBoard, the bank's account was £5,073,000. In the first three weeks of the Board's existence, it gave to the banks on ""the-come-and-get-it principle"" an adi t ditional £3,700,000, making a total of £8,773,000 notes in their possession under the note issue. To my mind, it is not was in the best interests of the country that the Government should lose control of the issue of notes. There has been an agitation of late for a further issue.",24
60,Dr EARLE PAGE,OATHS OF SEOBECY AND,The matters about 1 more ing occurred when the Commonwealth He Treasurer had control of the issue.,24
61,Mr CHARLTON,OATHS OF SEOBECY AND,The additional issue occurred after the control had been had nearly taken over by the Board.,24
62,Dr EARL EPAGE,OATHS OF SEOBECY AND,But the control had in not been taken away from the Treasurer.,24
63,Mr CHARLTON,OATHS OF SEOBECY AND,"A Board had been on appointed to control the issue. The Bill will give no further power to the Comgave monwealth Bank. Not one of the amendments relates to the powers now given by the Commonwealth Bank Act. Therefore there can be no reason for urging that the Bill should be passed in order to give the bank additional powers, and the only grounds for urging that it should be agreed to are that it contains provisions for appointing a Board and creating a discount bank. On this Board men will be appointed who are outside the Commonwealth service, men who possibly do not believe in having a national banking system, or men whose business is wrapped up in private banks, or in commercial undertakings connected with those institutions. Are we to expect that a Board so chosen will act in the best interests of the try? I am afraid not. Now let me take the question of discounting. No provision is made for reserves against the money issued. The banks can come along with their bills, and have them discounted. There is nothing in the Bill to limit the amount that will be given to any bank, and if the Commonwealth Bank Board has on it representatives from outside who are sympathetic with the private banks, notes can be issued to the private banks without restriction to enable them to trade on them, mortgage them or deal with them in any other way. Private banks will be permitted to come to the Commonwealth Bank with their bills of exchange, and get their money, but there will be no safeguard to the Commonwealth. What a most excellent arrangement it will be for the private institutions! It is not surprising that they are not complaining about the introduction of this Bill, or about the creation of a so called central bank which means - the strangling of the Commonwealth Bank. If the Commonwealth Bank is to discount all bills presented by private banks, I ask honourable members to think for a moment what will be the position of people who wish to borrow from the Commonwealth Bank in the ordinary way of banking business. What will become of the general banking business of the Commonwealth Bank ?",24
64,Mr FENTON,OATHS OF SEOBECY AND,It will be strangled.,25
65,Mr CHARLTON,OATHS OF SEOBECY AND,"It will strangled. There will be no hope for it, if the provisions of this Bill, as presented, are carried out. Whether that is - intended .or .not I do not know, I can only speak of the Bill as I find it , and it makes no provision to prevent, what I have said. The representatives of the private banks can come into the Commonwealth Bank with their bills and they must be discounted. There is no provision for reserves, and if there should ever again be a financial crisis in this country, such as there was some years ago, who will have to bear the burden? Will it be the private banks? No, the burden will fall on the Commonwealth Bank, which we desire should be regarded as the National Bank of this country. There will be no reserves and no assets of any coun- kind against the moneys advanced to the private banks. Surely they never dreamed of such an opportunity for the expansion of their banking business as this Bill presents. The measure is ill conceived and ill-digested. I do not know why such measures should be brought before the House from time to time. Tho first consideration of honourable members in dealing with the Bill should be to safeguard the public interests. They should see that the public are protected, and then whatever may happen the public willhave nothing to lose. This Bill deliberately provides that instead of the private banks having to find tlieir own money for the central bank, as is done in the countries to which I have referred, and to which the Treasurer also alluded, the Commonwealth is to provide another £6,000,000 on top of the £4,000,000 profit the bank already has, and we are to say to the private banks, "" Having raised this money we will discount your bills and you take no responsibility at all."" It will probably be contended by the Treasurer later, on that safeguards will be provided to meet the objections I have urged, but again I say I have to speak on the Bill as it has been presented. I ask honourable members to peruse it and say whether there are any safeguards provided. I venture to say they will find that every word I have said is correct. I have gone very carefully into this measure, and I say that it provides no protection for the public funds at all. We are left at the mercy of the private banks. So far as honourable members on this side of the House be are concerned they will be no parties to a measure of this .kind. We stand for the development of the National Bank of the Commonwealth. We want it to-.be the people's bank. This Bill provides banker's bank. It is in the interests of ' w a y of amendmentthe private banks and no one else. To ' That test the opinion of the House on the that measure, I move That all the words after "" That "" be omitted with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words ""-in order to preserve the Commonwealth Bank as a national institution, and to extend its operations for tlio purpose of controlling credit and exchange, it is desirable that financial experts to be fully employed in the service of the Bank should be appointed to its management, the proposal of the Government to appoint persons representing squatting and commercial interests, who are diametrically opposed to national banking, being designed more in the interests of private financial institutions than of the people's Bank.",25

68,Mr CUNNINGHAM,OATHS OF SEOBECY AND,"Gwydir) [12.25]. - In speaking to this clause last night, ' I dealt with the very grave necessity of providing proper safeguards to prevent the aggregation of large estates, to prevent dummying, to secure that the right type of settler shall be encouraged,'and to preserve the rights of the people to the land. The more consideration I give to - the'matter, the more I am convinced that i o n honourable members are not fully seized to the adof the enormous responsibility resting upon them to see that adequate provision m e n t is made to secure that lands shall be available for settlement in the Northern Territory in view of the tremendous public expenditure which may .take place there in the future. We may incur the expenditure of millions in the construction of the North-South Railway. There is a tentative proposal by the Queensland Governto link up farther the Queensland LANDS BILL . railway systems with those of New South Wales. It is suggested that, starting in the vicinity of Bourke, a line should be taken to the border of New South Wales, and should connect with the whole of the of a Queensland railway systems, terminating at a point on the border of the Northern comTerritory near Camooweal. Honourable members who have had any experience of pastoral areas will recognize that it is most desirable that this railway construction should take place if the fullest use is to be made of the railways that have alto ready been constructed. Should the railway systems of New South Wales and Queensland be connected in the .way proposed, no doubt the Commonwealth will the be called upon to spend a large sum of terms money in connecting them again with of the Wyndham or Port Darwin by a crossrecountry line intersecting the North-South and thererailway. We may be sure such a proposal will meet with great hostility in this Chamber if provision is not made under land legislation to enable closer settlement to take place on lands which would be served by the railway. The honourable would member for the Northern Territory (Mt. Nelson) proposes that the big lessees shall not be given the right to subdivide holdings, and to nominate their for the subdivisions in order to hold the land against the people. He that if subdivision is considered the Minister shall do the subdividing, shall make the land available, not to favoured individuals, but that all eligible to hold land in the Territory given an equal chance at a ballot to secure it. That is the only fair to adopt. ""When there are hundreds of desirable applicants looking for land, it is entirely wrong to allow a Land Board to pick and choose amongst them. method under which the ""Western Land Board in New South Wales selects those to whom land is to be leased has given , rise to great contention in that There have been cases there in which, to aay the least of it, very grave has been aroused in connection with the allotment of lands.

In New South Wales the applicant fills in a form setting out his tinancial position, and if he possesses the necessary qualifications to fit him to become a land-holder, his name is submitted to the ballot. Only those successful in the ballot are called upon to appear before the Board to show reasons why they should be permitted to hold the land. By that course enormous to the applicants is saved. I have been applying for land for years past, but so far have not been successful. been required to attend before a Board on' each occasion, I could not afforded it. We on this side stand solidly for the system of balloting, and-for making the expenses of the land-seeker as light as possible. At one time in the history of land settlement ir. New Mr Gnnninghnm. their Wales it was necessary for an applicant dummies to deposit with his application a sum equal to the first year's rent. Later, the proposes Government considered that to be a hardnecessary ship, and the deposit was not asked for. and To-day, in that State a ballot costs only the price of a postage stamp. If a man is successful in the ballot, he then apshall be pears before the Board, which inquires into his financial position and his general system fitness to hold the land. He is rejected as a settler only if he is undesirable. The same conditions should apply in connection with the Northern Territory land. The At present we are in . the unfortunate position of having more land available there than is required by the few who desire it . But such might not be the case if the railways I have mentioned State. were constructed. The Minister for Works and Bailways, writing in the suspicion Farmers' Advocate of the 30th May last, bears out what I have said respecting the quality of the landfor We pushed on to Ryan's Well, 82 miles from Alice Springs, and came to the Nickers' aphomestead. They owned 700 sheep, and said sheep would fatten where goats would die, in and expressed the opinion that it was the finest sheep country in the world. We went the over, and had a look at the sheep. They weTe in good condition, although shut up every many night, and only let out to graze in the day may time. Mr Nicker, in reply to questions from by me, said if he could get fencing and means of system. sinking dams on 20,000 acres, he would gladly surrender the remainder of his lease of 300,000 acres, and' would be far better off disappointed. financially. That shows that if improvements, such Unless as railways, are provided, what is today a living area for one man only will support ten or twelve families. I hope that the Minister will see fit to include in the Bill a clause requiring personal residence on the part of the land-holders. The two greatest curses of every country have been the absentee landlord and the land monopolist. Residential conditions are imposed upon the agriculturist, but in his case there is no necessity for them. expense The agriculturist cannot afford to be' absent from his property, but the grazier is in an entirely different position. It is, If I had however, in dealing with the grazier that the evils of absenteeism are to be perhave petuated. If the Minister is not prepared to accept the amendment of the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Nelson), one can only say that the policy of the Government respecting the Northern Territory is in South opposition to the idea of a living area, and that the Ministry stands for the land monopolist. It is regrettable that Ministers have not the capacity to realise the great possibilities of the Northern Territory. It may be said that no one wants this land, but that might have been said of all the land in Australia in the early days of this country. One hundred years ago no one wanted the great areas of valuable land which are now eagerly sought after. Had some such provision as that now desired by the honourable member for the Northern Territory been made in the earlier land laws of Australia, instead of our State railways being run at a loss, and taking a heavy toll from the pockets of the taxpayers, they would be what was the intention when they were constructed, namely, that they would open up the country adjacent to the line and assist in the development of the country. We have built in Australia railways sufficient to settle 100,000,000 people, if the land adjacent to those railways were made available for settlement. Unfortunately, that land has been locked up. This Bill proposes to lock up the land in the Northern Territory from those who are most desirable as settlers, and who will be seeking it once the railways are constructed.. The construction of railways in . the Northern Territory is nearer realization than many imagine. The further we get away from the war period, the greater will become the financial resources of the Commonwealth, and so it will be possible to provide money to carry out these works. For that reason I ask the Minister to favourably consider this proposal. It is based upon the experience and the failures of past Land Acts in the various States. We cannot possibly provide for the efficient settlement of any areas of land unless the principle of a living area is accepted. is fundamental to successful settlement, and it is hypocrisy and humbug to talk of land settlement without it . It is the keystone of successful land settlement. Side by side with that is the necessity for personal residence on the part of the landholders. I do not mean that a man and his family should be forced to live 70 or 80 miles away from a settlement, and remain on the land during the whole of the year. The lessee should be required to erect a residence on the land, and to reside there for at least one half of each year. His wife and children could be domiciled in an adjacent township. A few years ago 100 miles was a great distance, but today it is less than half a day's journey by motor car. We, on this side, are not hide-bound in regard to residence conditions, and do not want to impose, undue hardships on women and children, but it is ridiculous to talk about land settlement if the land-holders are permitted to hold land without any restrictions whatever being placed on them.",26

Senator Pearce, the Minister controlling the Northern Territory, told me that this morning. realizing Mr CUNNINGHAM - W it h all due deference to the Minister in another place, I would prefer to hear what the Minister in this Chamber has to .say regarding that matter. I suggest to the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Foster) that he should seek furthe r information respecting this matter from the Minister.

The honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Nelson) should know what he is talking about in connection with this matter, and I listened with interest to his remarks. From the speakers on both sides of the That House I have gained valuable information concerning the Northern Territory. Unless we alter the clause we may create very grave dangers in the future by perpetuating a condition of land monopoly that has retarded the progress of every State of Australia. I give credit to honourable members-o n whichever side of the House they sit-for not wishing to perpetuate_ those evils. We ought to be very careful in considering the Bill , and, if we can do anything to prevent land monopoly, we should do it .

In recent years legislation has partly remedied the evil. The Federal land tax imposed by the .Labour party was particularly It was only wheu the effect of that tax began to be felt that the land monopolists-who owned an enormous portion of the rich north-east area-were to listen to reason. They then began to cut up theirland and lease or sell it in reasonable areas to people who wanted it for closer settlement. Those who were responsible for the land legislation of that time have much to answer for. speaking of the time when Tasmania was a Crown colony, shortly before it became a State. Those who presented areas-immense in a small State Tasmania-to a handful of favoured individuals in return for supposed did not realise what might happen in 40 or 50 years' time, and it is because the Government of the day did not impose proper safeguards that the progress and development of that portion of the State has been retarded. appearance of some of. the evils to which I refer is due to the fact that the Federal land tax forced the owners either to use the areas or to allow other people to purchase or rent them on reasonable An example of the evil effects of land monopoly is furnished by the town of Burnie, which is one of two seaports on the north-west coast, and is handicapped today because the Dieman Land Company, which was given an enormous grant of land for almost nothing, has refused to sell land for residential purposes except in blocks.

That system We have has proved much more satisfactory than the ballot method. Under the unrestricted ballot system there is as much chance of obtaining good settlers as there would be of obtaining a Shakespeare play by putting the letters of the alphabet into a box and shaking them. out. I am not always looking for ulterior motives in proposed legislation, but I am sorry to notice that or some honourable members opposite see boodling, ulterior motives, or corruption in every Bill presented to Parliament.

The honourable member for Denison (Mr O'Keefe) took objection to the provisions of paragraphs a and & of sub-clause 1 of this clause. He said that they might lead to dummying. As a of fact they only'provide that a lessee may subdivide for closer settlement land which he already holds. Why in the name of conscience should a man "" dummy "" land which he already holds? Such a content-ion is absolutely absurd: I am glad that lessees are to be given the right to subdivide their holdings.

If a man of outstanding merit applies he should be selected. there are three or four men of practically equal merit lots could be drawn to ascertain who should be given the land. That is the system which has been most satisfactory in South Australia.

86,Mr FOSTEB,OATHS OF SEOBECY AND,I agreed with the honourable member for Kooyong all the time.,31
87,Mr NELSON,OATHS OF SEOBECY AND,"The honourable member flatly contradicted my contention before the honourable member for Kooyong delivered his speech. I can quite understand the enthusiasm of the honourable member for Wakefield for this Bill . He was a member of the South Australian Parliament at the time the Northern Territory was taken over by the Common- I wealth Government, and he then did everything in his power to protect the in terests of the big pastoralists, and to prevent the Commonwealth Government from resuming any of their Northern Territory leases. He is adopting a similar attitude now. I ask the Committee not to regard these leases as they would leases in the southern States, which rarely exceed in area 100 square miles. In the Northern Territory the leases comprise 10,000 and 12,000 sajuare miles. Instead of allowing the lessee to nominate his successor to those portions of the leases which he will relinquish by subdivision, all persons desirous of settling on the land should have If an equal opportunity of getting blocks. The honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Manning)' dealt exhaustively with the ballot system, and mentioned that for one piece of land in New South Wales there were as many as 3,000 and 4,000 applicants. That is all the greater reason why we should make available the huge tracts of land in the Northern Territory, and so relieve the congestion of applications in the southern States. I am convinced that once the productive the possibilities of the Northern Territory were demonstrated there would not be 3,000 and 4,000 people scrambling for one piece of land in a southern State. The honourable member's only objection, to the ballot system is that a lot of undesirable applicants are included. There is nothing to prevent the Government ensuring' by regulation that only bona fide settlers shall be eligible for the ballot, and thus exclude persons applying merely for purposes of speculation. The Minister asked the Leader of the Opposition to tell hi m what clause 58 means.",31

The only authority the Board will have will be to approve of the area to be subdivided after the Minister has given his authority to the lessee. In 1945, again, the lessee will be able to nominate his successor to a quarter of his total holding, which means that after that year the original holder and his "" d u m m y "" will be holding 12,000 square miles of country.",31

91,Mr NELSON,OATHS OF SEOBECY AND,"The honourable member does not know what he is talking about. If 3,000 square miles were the maximum area it would not represent one station in the Northern Territory. Something like 48,000 square miles will be due for subdivision upon the first resumption.",32

Many members who are supporting the Bill have not even read it , and they are prepared to hand over a great inheritance to about half-a-dozen big squatters. 'The honourable member for Wakefield (Mr . Foster) followed the same policy on a previous occasion. Just prior to the passing of the Northern Territory Acceptance Acfc he was a member of the Government which amended the land laws of the Territory to eliminate all provisions relating to resumption. Thus part of the bargain of acceptance was that the Commonwealth should have no power to resume the leases held under the old Statute. Throughout this debate not one logical argument has been adduced by the Government or its supporters in favour of the Bill . It is quite evident that honourable menibers, including the Minister in charge, do not understand the measure. That is a most outrageous state of affairs. One naturally expects that a Minister who is piloting a Bill through the House shall be able to discuss its details, but the Minister in charge of this Bill had to call to his aid the Treasurer, who, in reply to my statements, simply read a bundle of notes. Ministers adopt the desperate expedient of ridiculing their opponents. It is very clear that the "" big interests "" have decided that the Bill miist go through in its present for m .

That fact bears out my contention during the debate on the second reading, that the whole of this land will be effectively locked up for the next century .

104,Mr ATKINSON,OATHS OF SEOBECY AND,"Wilmot-Vice-Pre sident of the Executive Council) f8.1] . I move That in sub-clause 2 the words '""' this section'"" be omitted, with a view to inserting in lieu thereof the words "" paragraph {<!.) of the preceding section."" The reasons for the amendment are that sub-clause 1 of the clause enumerates the various public and other purposes for - which resumptions may be made, and it is therefore unnecessary to place further ""reasons for resumptions ""covered by those purposes before Parliament. But when .it is desired to resume lands which have heen reserved and set aside for the public .use it becomes essential that the reasons actuating any such resumption should be placed before Parliament. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed ts. Clause 79Where the land to be resumed is required for cultivation purposes(6) in the case of pastoral leases the land resumed shall not include the head station or any of the leased land within five miles thereof, or the principal watering place on the land. . Mr GABB (Angas) [3.3] - I move That the words "" or the principal watering place on the land"" be left out. Honourable members are aware that I moved a similar amendment on a previous clause. In my opinion the phrase "" principal watering place"" is altogether too vague. It may be held to cover a river running through the whole of a lease. I do not intend to speak at length on this amendment. I am quite satisfied that this Ordinance was passed before it was brought into this House, and it has been galling to me to sit here and have to think go. The Minister has his instructions not to give way because the supreme court of Scott's Hotel has already decided what the provisions of the Ordinance shall be. I ' submit my amendment, knowing that it will be defeated, in order to bo consistent with the attitude which I adopted when a previous clause was before both under consideration.",34
105,Mr NELSON,OATHS OF SEOBECY AND,"Northern Territory) [ 3.5] - I . should like to point out, as I did in connection with a previous clause, that the words to which the honourable member for Angas (Mr Gabb) has taken - exception will leave to the lessees the right to hold the whole of the waters on big areas of 10,000 or 12,000 square miles.",34
106,Mr ATKINSON,OATHS OF SEOBECY AND,I thought the honourable member was satisfied with the promise to recommit clause 55.,34
107,Mr NELSON,OATHS OF SEOBECY AND,"I was satisfied that that clause should bo recommitted, but the amendment of it which the Minister proposes is not on all fours with that drafted by the* Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Stewart) last night. The amendment which is to be proposed will not protect the water rights for intending settlers. Under this Ordinance, as the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Latham) pointed out, the whole of the areas, bar the water ou them, can be resumed. That shows the absurdity of the Ordinance. It has to, be borne in mind that a number of leases: compriaing a, large holding are issued in the names of different persons, and in the administration of the Ordinance each lease will be treated separately. In the circumstances impossible for the Government to resume any water on any land. Question-That the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the clause (Mr . GABB'S amendment)-put .

Clause 89Notwithstanding the repeal of the Northern Territory Crown Lands Act 1S90 of the State of South Australia, the Fences Act 1892 and the Fences Act Amendment Act 1903 of the State of South Australia shall continue to apply to all freehold lands, and all lands held undur agreement or lease from the Crown, in ilia Northern Territory, and in the application Mr Nelson. of those Acts the word "" fence "" ov the words"" dividing fence"" wherever used therein shall be deemed to mean any fence ordinarily sufficient or capable of resisting the trespass of it will be cattle or sheep.",34
108,Mr NELSON,OATHS OF SEOBECY AND,"Northern Territory ) [3.13] - This is the clause providing for the .application of the South Australian Fencing Act, and it is further evidence that in this Ordinance the interests of the big men arc consulted in every possible way. It might be contended that the application of a fencing Act is very desirable and that such Acts have operated witli great advantage in every State of the Commonwealth. T admit that that AVES. ordinarily is so. Under this Ordinance, no improvement conditions are provided for, and this provision for the application of the Fencing Act is included designedly for the benefit of the big men. Honourable members will note the significance of this clause when they realise that if a small man secured a block of land alongside the area held by one of these big squat.ters, under this clause the big squatter would have the right to erect a fence along his boundary and could then demand a cash payment for half its cost from the small settler alongside. In this NOES. way he could financially embarrass the small man. All the benefits that might have accrued to the small settler from a scientific revision of our land law are Riley, E. absolutely denied to him under this Ordinance, and everything possible is done to; protect the interests of the big man.",35
109,Mr FOSTER,OATHS OF SEOBECY AND,"This clause applies only to freeholds, and how many freeholds are there in the Northern Territory? PAIRS. Mr NELSON - The honourable gentle 7 man is again demonstrating his ignorance ' of the matters under discussion. The clause applies to all land in the Northern Territory, whether held under a Crown lease or otherwise.",35
110,Mr FOSTEK,OATHS OF SEOBECY AND,It applies to freehold land only.,35
111,Mr NELSON,OATHS OF SEOBECY AND,"This clause not only gives the big man the right to erect a fence on the boundary of his run , but also the right to call in a surveyor, and to debit half the cost of his services to the small adjoining occupier. It is obvious that, if any small land-holder takes up land, the machinery ie available tb have him removed. The Minister might as well have been honest, and have placed at the head of the Bill , "" No small man need apply.""",35
112,Mr ATKINSON,OATHS OF SEOBECY AND,"Wilmot-Vice-Pre sident of the Executive Council) [3.16]. - I am sorry that the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Nelson) has indulged in such exaggerated statements. He said that the Government desired to benefit the large man at the expense of the small land-holder. The honourable member knows perfectly well what this clause means. He raised the same point before, and was then told that this clause had nothing to do with the Crown.",36
113,Mr NELSON,OATHS OF SEOBECY AND,I have read the Bill since then.,36
114,Mr ATKINSON,OATHS OF SEOBECY AND,"The member should have read the Ordinance. Any one who takes the trouble to compare the remarks of the honourable member with the clauses of the Bill concerning which they are made will realise how little he knows about the matter. The honourable member, notwithstanding the latitude allowed him, was unkind enough to say that I put the Treasurer up to speak. He has been long enough in this House to know that, had I spoken instead of the Treasurer, the debate would have been closed, as I had opened it . It ie a pity that the honourable member cannot accept his defeat in a better spirit. Clause 89 continues certain Fences Acts of South Australia, which apply to boundary fences between the holdings of adjoining owners. Every State has a similar Act, enabling a land-holder to call upon his neighbour to erect a portion of the fence on their common boundary. The clause has nothing to do with the - Crown and its lessees. Clause agreed to. Clauses 90 to 105 agreed to. Schedule and title agreed to. Bill reported with amendments, and recommitted for reconsideration of clause 50. - In Committee (Recommittal) : Clause 50(1.) The holder of any lands in the Northern Territory, under a pastoral lease from the Crown in existence at the commencement of this Ordinance may, at any time within three years after the commencement of this Ordinance, surrender his lease in exchange for a pastoral lease of the lands or part thereof under this Ordinance. (2.) A lease granted under this soction may include adjacent lands in two or more surrendered leases, whether in actual contact or not. (3.)

115,Mr ATKINSON,OATHS OF SEOBECY AND,"Wilmot-Vice-Pre sident of the Executive Council) [3.21]. - I move That after sub-clause 2 the fbllowing new sub-clauses be inserted :(2A) Where two or more leases of contiguous lands granted under the laws of South Australia are surrendered under this section by the same lessee, one lease only shall be granted in exchange there foi' in respect of .the whole of the land included in the surrendered leases.

116,Mr STEWART,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Wimmera-Minister for Works and Railways) [ 3 . 2 5 ] - I move That, in accordance with the provisions of"" the Public Works Committee Act 1913-21, tliofollowing works be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, for its investigation and report thereon, viz... Establishment of automatic telephone cx-rlianws at Unlny and Norwood, South Australia. It is proposed to extend the existing telephone exchange buildings, situated at the corner of Northgate-street and Bellevueavcime, Unley, and at the corner of Queen-street and East-parade, Norwood, South Australia, to provide for the establishment of automatic telephone exchanges. Automatic switching systems, having an immediate equipment of 5,500 subscribers' lines at Unley, and 5,700 at Norwood, with ultimate capacities of 9,400 and 8,900 lines respectively, are to be installed. These will afford sufficient accommodation to meet anticipated developments in Unley and Norwood. In addition, it is intended to provide heating, ventilating, vacuum cleaning, dehumidifying, air-washing, and compressed-air cleaning plant at each of the exchanges. The proposed building extensions will be of brick, harmonizing in design with the existing structures. These exchanges are urgently required, for the reason that the existing apparatus cannot cope with the development in the respective areas, and it is imperative that a full automatic system be established in each case to satisfy the demands of prospective subscribers. The annual revenue, based on the actual or estimated number of line connexions on the undermentioned dates, is as follows:30th June, 1023 (actual) £10,454: 1st January, 1925 (estimated) .. .. 34,233 32,633 1st January. 1930 (estimated) ' . -- 58.994 54,709 The estimated cost of the respective schemes, excluding cost of premises existing at present, is as under:Buildings £5,000 £0,000 Ventilating, heating, dehumidifying, compressed«ir cleaning, vacuum cleaning, and airwashing plant, electric light and power .. 3,800 Automatic telephone equipment and external line plant .. .. 120,170 125.305 Honourable members will observe that the provision of the telephone plant itself represents the 'greater portion of the estimated expenditure. I lay on the table the plans and specifications required by the Act. Mr Stewart.",36
117,Mr MAKIN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Hindmarsh) [3.28] The facilities covered by this motion are long overdue. In Soutli Australia, considerable inconvenience has been caused to business people .and others because of their inability to secure the necessary telephonic conveniences. While the works covered by the motion are certainly very urgent, I regret that provision is not to be made for an automatic telephonic exchange for the western suburban district of Adelaide. I have repeatedly brought under the notice of the Government the necessity for such an exchange. At pre-' sent, there is serious congestion in connection with the telephonic services in' that district. Not only are persons desirous of obtaining telephonic connexions being put to considerable inconvenience, but subscribers are being penalized because of the excessive rental they are called upon to pay by reason of their premises being so far from the Central Exchange. People living in districts 4 miles from the Central Exchange have to pay higher rents for telephones than those liviug in more distant places provided with local exchanges. The works proposed at Norwood and Unley are very necessary, and should be regarded as urgent.. I am glad that at this late hour the Government is prepared to submit the question to the Public Works Committee, and I hope that the Committee will not Unley. Norwood. unduly delay the presentation of its re£14,820 port. While T approve of this work, I trust the Government will not neglect its duty to other districts near Adelaide, and to the more distant parts of the State. The same consideration should be given to the claims of South Australia as has been generously bestowed on other States. The services provided in the State have been very inadequate, and the public has Unley. Norwood. been subjected to great inconvenience. The unsatisfactory service is in no sense attributable to the responsible officers in that State, who are among the best pro< curable. The State of South Australia is very fortunate in having the services 3,775 of Mr Kitto and Mr Monfries. If the Government would only take heed of their reports many of the services which are now so neglected and inadequate would be extended. I am glad to think that even now we are to receive some consideration, and I hope the Government' will realise that this is only a small instalment of what is necessary, so that in future, instead of having cause to complain, we shall applaud the Government for endeavouring to provide a satisfactory and adequate service.",37
118,Mr DUNCAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"HUGHES (Boothby) [3.35] - As the districts mentioned in the motion happen to be in my electorate, I should like to express my appreciation of the Government's action in submitting the motion to the House. I know, probably as well as does the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin), the difficulties that have been experienced for some years past in connection with telephone communication in that district. I have received many complaints and requests for an improved system, and I know that the extensions proposed will be heartily welcomed. I would like to pay a tribute to the postal authorities in my State. The telephone system in that State has always seemed to me to be extraordinarily good. I have personally had experience of the telephone systems in all the States of Australia, and while I do not say it for the sake of making an invidious comparison, I have not found any system in which the telephone attendants render a better service than they give in my State. That, to some extent, must be due to the control exercised over the employees by the Deputy Postmaster General. While thanking the Government for what it has done-the concession is somewhat belated-and expressing my gratitude for it , I would like to endorse what the honourable member for Hindmarsh has said regarding other parts of Adelaide. I know something about those parts, because I happen to reside in the district represented by the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Yates). I have no doubt that he often expresses the official views of that district, although .he may not always express my views. I hope that the difficulties which have existed in my district in the past will be greatly removed by the motion now submitted, and that improvements in other parts of Adelaide will follow. I am glad that the Government has submitted the motion, and I hope that the House will pass it readily. Mr E. RILEY (South Sydney) [3.38]. - I do not oppose the motion, but I remind the Government that there are other parts of Australia needing attention. The State from which I come supplies nearly half the revenue of the Commonwealth, [61] and yet we cannot obtain facilities equal to those given to a little place like Boothby. Tasmania, no doubt, will . shortly come along with grievances, and will want additional exchanges. It is very nice of the South Australians to form a "" Mutual Admiration Society "" and tap the Minister on the back. I would like to have ah opportunity of doing it , too. I hope the Government will honour the promise made to me in this House some time ago that a post office would be erected at South Kensington, near Maroubra Bay, and that the construction of an exchange at Randwick would be expedited. A congested population exists in those districts, but while we have received promises from the Minister, and nice letters from the Department, nothing has been done. I hope there will be no more of this pandering to South Australia, and withholding of justice from the State that supplies most of the revenue. South Australia should not be too greedy. Honourable members interjecting.",38
119,Mr SPEAKER,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Rt. Hon. W . A. W at t ) . - If honourable members do not attend to the call of the Chair for order,, the Chair will have to take its own course, and for whatever ensues honourable members will be responsible. Mr E. RILEY - I hope the Minister will look into the proposals I have mentioned. For the South Kensington post office land has been secured, but nothing has been done. At Randwick hundreds of people have been trying to obtain telephones, but replies from the Postmaster General say that the switchboard is full , and u n t i l the new exchange is built the requests cannot be granted. Members of this House, irrespective of party, do not object to money being spent on extending telephone services and building post-offices. The honourable member for East Sydney (Mr West) has been fortunate in getting a large exchange for his district. It was mainly owing to his efforts that the exchange was sanctioned. I hope the Minister will assist me in getting a post office at South Kensington and a telephone exchange at B.andwick.",38
120,Mr CHARLTON,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Hunter) [ 3 . 4 0 ] - I am pleased that the Minister has submitted this motion. It is necessary that every facility should be provided for telephonic and telegraphic services, not only rn South Australia, but also in every other State. Money was voted for those purposes when the last Estimates were before the House. I do not know whether it has been expended. We are very close to the end of the nnanciai year, and the need for increased telegraphic and telephonic facilities is urgent, I do not know why the motion is submitted so late in the financial year. I suppose the work will be carried out in the next nnanciai year.",38
121,Mr STEWART,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,We cannot do anything until we have received the report' of the Public Works Committee.,39
122,Mr CHARLTON,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"The Government is evidently taking time by the forelock in submitting the proposal now to the Public Works Committee. I hope the Committee will give consideration to it at an early date, so that this and other works approved by Parliament from time to time may be promptly carried out. I do not know how far the works proposed when we were dealing with the Estimates last year have been carried out. Some of them have been submitted to the Public Works Committee, but I do not know whether all of them have been. In view of the fact that large sums of money have been set aside for postal purposes, particularly for extending telephone services in country districts, the work should be put in hand and expedited as much as possible.",39
123,Mr STEWART,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,The Government spending more money this year than in any previous year on the class of works referred to by. the honourable member.,39
124,Mr CHARLTON,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I am pleased to tion hear it . I am not criticizing the ter, but am supporting his proposal. It is evidence of his desire to get something done when he brings forward a proposal of this kind so late in the day and at end of the week. It shows that he is willfor ing to do everything possible to work under his control. He should not forget that there are other works needing attention. A certain sum of money was set aside to be spent in three and unless we push along with works of this character we shall not be able to spend it . One year has nearly gone. I reported^ want to see the money expended as quickly as possible, because it will bring an increased return to the Treasury. If it be spent in small amounts the return from it will be greatly delayed. money has been put aside to be expended, the works are necessary, and, therefore, we should do everything possible to carrythem out, particularly at a time when there are many men out of employment in different parts of Australia. It is more necessary that work should be provided during the winter months than at any other season of the year, f b r in every State in the Commonwealth more men are unemployed in the winter than at other seasons. I congratulate the Minister on having submitted the motion. It shows his earnest desire to improve the facilities of the Postmaster-General's Departments If we expect this Department to be revenue-producing we must provide adequate facilities. I hope that the Public Works Committee will investigate the matter promptly, and present a favourable report in - the near future. Question resolved in the affirmative. ORDER OF BUSINESS.

125,Mr CHARLTON,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Hunter ) [ 3 . 4 8 ] - I am very loath to object to this alteration in the order of business, but I think that honourable members have done very good work today, and it is not a fair thing to ask them to give consideration to a new is matter at this stage.",39

128,Mr MAKIN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Hindmarsh) [3.54] - r - I wish to direct the attention of the Prime Minister to the manner in which representations made to the Government by the corporation of Thebarton, South Australia, for assistance by way of a road grant were received. The matter affects every metropolitan local governing body. The corporation of Thebarton represented to the Home and Territories Department that although the Commonwealth Oovernment owned property in the municipality, and made good uso of the corporation roads and other facilities, it tributed nothing towards the maintenance of roads, and paid no - taxes. Honourable members know that motor and other vehicles of the Postmaster-General's Department use the public highways in every municipality, and, so far as the corporation of Thebarton is concerned, the roadways are also used to a large extent in the conveyance of material required for the construction of War Service Homes. The State Bank of South Australia is the constructing authority for War Service Homes, but it operates as the agent of the Commonwealth Government. In consequence of the amount of traffic that goes over the roads of the municipality they have in a number of cases fallen into a state of disrepair. The Commonwealth Government is responsible for this in no inconsiderable degree, and the corporation requested some assistance from it to effect necessary repairs. The reply received' can only be regarded as an evasion. The Government stated that the War Service Homes were being built by the State Bank, and that the Government was not responsible for any road troubles that had occurred in consequence of that work. It provides the money for building the homes, however, and it must accept its share of responsibility. I trust that the Prime Miuister will give me an assurance that the Government will seriously consider rendering some assistance to the corporation of Thebarton, and to all corporations in a similar position, to enable them to maintain their roads in a proper way. The Government contributes towards the upkeep of country roads, aud it is only reasonable to expect it to contribute towards the maintenance of the roads which it uses so largely in the metropolitan area. Motor traffic has greatly ' increased the difficulties of road .maintenance, and much of the Government transport is accomplished by means of motors. In these circumstances I hope the Government will favourably consider my request.",39
129,Mr BRUCE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs) [3.55] - I shall discuss the matter mentioned by the honourable member for Hindmarsh with the Mmister for Home and Territories, and it will receive consideration by the Government, The amount involved in the specific case which he raises would not be very great, but the general conquestion raises a very big issue which will need serious consideration. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 3.56 p.m.",40
