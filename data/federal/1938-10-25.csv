BROADCASTS ON INTERNATION AL AFFAIRS. 114 4 112 i . Sir EART,E PAGE - On the 12th October 2 the honourable member for West Sydney 6 118 3 111 (Mr Bettsley) asked the following question, without notice:Will the Acting Leader of the House inquire 110 2 108 0 from the Australian Broadcasting Commission 107 0 104 11 whether it proposes to arrange for additional talks over the national network in connection 104 11 102 10 101 9 99 8 with the international crisis? If so, will he also ascertain the times during which such 100 8 98 7 talks shall be broadcast, whether the talks 97 7 95 5 will be similar to that broadcast last night by the Premier of New South Wales, and also whether persons equally as prominent as that 96 6 94 5 88 1 86 0 honourable gentleman will be invited to express 81 10 79 8 their views? Inquiry has been made of the Australian Broadcasting Commission with in the discretion of which the matter falls. I am advised by the commission that the talk by the Premier of New South Wales (Mr. Stevens), referred to by the honourable member, was not given at the invitation of the commission. Mr Stevens approached the commission and expressed a desire to give a talk on the "" Economic Implications of the Czechoslovakia Situation"". A script was submitted to the commission. The commission decided to accede to the request in thus instance, as the talk had no relation to party politics and it was considered that it would be of exceptional national interest. The commission has indicated that it is not intended to seek the services of other prominent people to give talks on the international situation, additional to those which are broadcast in the regular international affairs and news commentary sessions by the commission's regular commentators. The commission is, however, prepared to give consideration to requests from persons occupying responsible public positions to give talks of a similar nature. DEFENCE: NAV AL AND AERIAL EQUIPMENT.",15
14,Mr THORBY,UMBRELLA FLAT,"On the 20th October, the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney) asked the following questions, upon notice I. In view of the statement of the late Lord Fisher in his work Memories, that submarines would make Australia impregnable, and in view of a similar contention by Mr Samuel Eosa in his book The Invading of Australia, published twenty years ago, will the Minister give consideration to the expenditure that is being incurred in the building of cruisers, which are helpless against battleships, being diverted to the building of more submarines and aeroplanes, which are purely defensive and are effective against battleships? 2. What is the cost of (a) up-to-date submarines, (6) bombing aeroplanes, (c) capital battleships, and (d) cruisers? 3. Is it a fact that the overseas ing to and from Australia are owned outside Australia ? I am now in a position to in for m the honourable member as follows:.1. The present naval programme of the Navy has been adopted on the advice of the best naval experts, and the Government is satisfied that it is on sound lines. 2. (a) £230,000 to £500,000 (sterling) according to class; (6) the cost of bombing aircraft (if landed in Australia and in Australian currency) would be from £9,000 to £40,000 an aircraft, according to type; (c) approximately £8,000,000 (sterling); approximately £1,500,000 to (sterling). 3. The majority are; but a few of such vessels are owned by Australian companies. TELEPHONE AT UMBREL LA FLAT .  the honourable member for Bass (Mr. Barnard) made certain inquiries pertaining to the question of installing a telephone service to Umbrella Flat. The Postmaster-General has supplied the following information: An examination of the circumstances indicates that very substantial expenditure would be entailed in providing public telephone facilihalf-length ties at the emergency landing ground at Umbrella Plat and, in view of the relatively small amount of revenue that would be forthcoming, the department would not be justified in providing the service. POST OFFICE AT LOWER MITCHAM.  the honourable member for Boothby (Mr. Price) asked the following questions upon notice I. What was the date on which the department purchased a piece of land at Lower Mitcham for the purpose of building a post office to serve the surrounding districts? 2. What is the size of the block and its actual location? 3. Is it a fact that since the land was purchased there has been a considerable increase in the number of residents in the locality? 4. Have plans for the new post office been completed? If not, when can residents expect this Service? I am now in a position to furnis h the honourable member with, the following answers to his inquiries:1. A site was acquired on the 17th April, 1924. 2. 70 feet frontage to Unley Road by 170 ships tradfeet along Angas Road. 3. Considerable development has taken place since the land was acquired, but all reasonable public requirements are at present catered for by existing post offices in the locality. 4. Plans have not been prepared. It is not considered that the expenditure involved in erecting a new post office is justified under existing conditions. WIRELESS INTERFERENCE.  the lionorable member for Wide Bay (Mr Corser). referred to interference with wireless broadcast reception at Kilcoy. (d) The Postmaster-General bas supplied £2,000,000 the following information:The department has consulted the Brisbane City Council with a view to having the interference eliminated. Arrangements have been made for an officer of the department to visit Kilcoy in connection with the matter. PUBLIC TELEPHONES.  .the honourable member for Parramatta (Sir Frederick Stewart) inquired as to the basis of the guarantee of £28 per annum in respect of the provision of public telephones in certain circumstances. The Postmaster-General has supplied the following information:The guarantee referred to is designed to cover the annual charges incidental to the establishment of a public telephone of the type, and represents interest on the cost of providing and' installing the cabinet, exchange apparatus, line plant, telephone and coin box, plus the relevant depreciation and maintenance charges, and the expenses relating to the clearing of the coin receptacle.",16
