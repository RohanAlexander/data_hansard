In particular, I and impartial classification body representative the classification process to be conducted in fairness. I say this with the French film Romance Classification's press release dated 28 film Romance lifted'. It states: the lifting of the ban on the French film, Romance. follows an application by the film's Australian Board's RC (Refused Classification) rating. NA Wednesday, 11 October 2000 In announcing the decision, Ross Tzannes, Acting Board heard a presentation from Mark Spratt of Potential and considering the issues, decided to classify In reaching this decision, the Board noted the general Code that adults should be “able The board also believed the film's sexual depictions by reasonable adults to see what they want. In reaching this decision, Mr Tzannes notes: ... the classification of ‘R' would be accompanied Scenes”. I bring this press release to the attention of it clearly demonstrates what is meant by decision of the Classification Board-the Classification Review Board-the CRB. What application to review the original decision earlier, the decision to refuse classification I say ‘entity' because a search with the Australian ASIC-on 15 February 2000 revealed that the registered in the state of Victoria.

My first point about procedural fairness their deplorable exploitation of the good conduct Sydney Morning Herald, appear to have conspired during an administrative procedure in the classification intervened deliberately during the film classification of the Classification Review Board's decision. Under the rules of procedural fairness, I the same way as a legal decision in a court is-that pending the final outcome of a review determination Given the fact that certain persons have locus under section 42 of the act at any time, it was Sydney Morning Herald to publish its story applicant seeking review, Potential Films, opportunity to have its case for review Given the amount of research indicated profoundly open question whether he and hence, vicariously, existence of the appeal by Potential Films. appeal is nonetheless irrelevant to the issue a potential breach of procedural fairness ultimately led to the overturning of the primary decision.

The media article is replete with the use of the word ‘banned', coupled with the NA Wednesday, 11 October 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE offensive naming of individual members marginalising labels-for example, attributing lines of ‘He's a Conservative', with the implied making, versus someone else who is ‘not conservative' How do we adjudge the conduct of the media thousands of items each year. However, the particular film. Why? Could it have had anything cynical reply is that Romance was a test case ethical standards. It was an attempt, a successful is not. Why has there been this necessity to redefine The real reason for the reclassification is to erotica anyway? The Oxford Dictionary defines ‘erotic' is defined as ‘of or causing sexual excitement'. That is what erotica is. To place completely obfuscates the issue-as proposed aborted in February of this year. Whether or not erotica is violent, it is not the X classification. Specifically, the classification per se in the degrees of violence contained restricted nature is based on the content of erotica, excitement. That is why erotica is restricted or has socially acceptable or unacceptable levels of violence. Like so many classifications in Australian terminology contrived to deceive the reader into acceptance than it deserves. Australian culture ‘voluntary euthanasia' is one such euphemism. prescribed term under the Disorderly Houses example of a euphemism. For is there such a thing Is there such a thing as a brothel that is not there is not. Equally, is there erotica that otherwise of a degree of violence? I think not. Let us not forget one basic fact about legislation go to the classification of videotapes; Why do I make this distinction? It is because access to theatre compared with a child's access have allowed whoever is responsible for this obfuscate the real issues. Whether we call it erotica; it will never be anything else. Splitting must be proscribed to those who would be unable be protected against it. And we must realise video cassette recorders of children or anyone serious degradation of societal standards.

The OFLC classifies many Sydney Morning Herald sought to highlight this to do with the timing of this bill? A more before the board, a conspicuous lessening of attempt, to redefine what is X rated and what the classification? Let us look at it plainly. lessen the objection to what erotica is. What is ‘erotica' as ‘erotic literature'. The word love, esp. tending to arouse sexual desire or the word ‘non-violent' before the word ‘erotica' with the original legislation, before it was the essence of the classification that pre-exists in of erotica as X at all is in no way relevant in the film. No, the classification as being of a the content which arouses sexual desire or ultimately refused classification, not because it society, we have witnessed the demise of giving an act or thing a greater validity and is replete with examples of this.

No, is any less erotic simply by the existence or this legislation.
