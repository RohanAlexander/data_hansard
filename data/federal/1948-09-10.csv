1,Mr HADLEY,Unknown,"The honourable member for Deakin has stated that a man named Harm ach, a known Communist, was employed in the Munitions Supply Laboratories at Maribyrnong and had access to inner laboratories dealing with defence secrets and that he was at present overseas attending, among other meetings, a Communist conference at ""Warsaw. I ask the Minister acting for the Minister for Supply and Development whether the statement is true.",12
2,Mr RIORDAN,Unknown,"I heard the statement that the honourable member for Deakin made about Mai'in ach. Marmuch was a temporary metallurgist, grade 1, at the Defence Research Laboratories for three years from the lst July, 1945, to the 25th June, 1948, when he resigned. He had no access to any secret information. His work was mainly in connection - with the chromicizing of steel and other minor projects of a non-secret nature. He has not proceeded overseas for the Department of Supply and Development. On the 26th July last, the Melbourne fferdld published an article containing the statement that Mr and Mrs. Marmack were being sent by the Eureka Youth League to an international conference of working youth to be held in Warsaw in August. WAR GRATUITY.",12
3,Mr FALKINDER,Unknown,"In view of the promise that the Prime Mmister has our given to reconstitute the all-party War Gratuity Committee for the purpose of considering claims of members of the Royal Australian Air Force Head-quarters Staff, London, for an increase of war gratuity to the higher overseas rate, can he. say when that comhonorable mittee wiU be convened ? I have received letters from ex-anenibers of the Royal Australian Air Force who are in financial difficulties and who would be saved a great deal of worry by an early decision on this matter.",12
4,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"What I said was that matters relating to war gratuity arise from time to time and that Opposition members of the committee were good enough to come together, without being formally convened, and that they had agreed to add two to their number. The object of the meeting would be to advise what changes, if any, should be made to the War Gratuity Act. Previously, I also said that subject to the consent of the Opposition members on the committee, I should arrange when a number of matters ha? come into refer them to the committee. Beside. the honourable member himself, the honourable member for Fawkner and. the honourable member for Henty have mentioned such matters to me. At present, I am not able to say when I shall call the committee together, to consider those matters, but I shall do so at a reasonably early date. SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT. Motion (by Mr CHIFI.EY) agreed toThat the House, nt its rising, adjourn ta Wednesday next, at 3 p.m. FILM TEE CENTRE.",12
5,Mrs BLACKBURN,Unknown,"I ask you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, whether your attentionhas been drawn to a British documentary film. The Centre, produced by Paul Kotha, dealing with the work of' the Peckham Pioneer Health Centre, London. As the work of that centre is greatly in advance of' anything yet accomplished in this country and might serve as a model for own welfare work, would it be possibleto have that film shown in the near futurefor the benefit of members of the Parliament? I understand that the film is now Overseas in the National Library.",12

8,Mr CHIFLEY,METROPOLITAN PORTLAND,Neve r mind whether it is unusual or not. I am stating the facts.,14
9,Mr HARRISON,METROPOLITAN PORTLAND,"And the company pays a 16 per cent, preference dividend.",14
10,Mr CHIFLEY,METROPOLITAN PORTLAND,I know all about that.,14
11,Dr GAHA,METROPOLITAN PORTLAND,The dirty little suspicious minds of the Opposition are showing now.,14
12,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,METROPOLITAN PORTLAND,Order 1,14
13,Mr CHIFLEY,METROPOLITAN PORTLAND,"In acting as trustee for the party of which I am leader, I have some very high examples to guide me. I believe that I am acting correctly. However, returning to cement, we did consider the proposal. I did not make any decision at the time Mr Hamilton interviewed me to seek permission to establish a cement-making plant in the Berrima district. I referred him to an officer who knew all about that matter. Mr. Hamilton did not interview me again, but later when I and certain other Ministers considered the proposals, we had before us information which we understood to be factual. It was to the effect that although there was some surplus cement-making capacity in New South ""Wales, there was a shortage in other States and that the production of cement in New South Wales was reported to be between 80,000 tons and 100,000 tons less than annual requirements. In quiries at places like Mort's Dock indicated that, although orders had been placed for machinery in the sterling area, delivery could not be made for two or three years. In view of the cement requirements of the extensive public works programme covering the years ahead, we decided that it would be to the advantage of this country to have an additional cement-making plant as soon as possible. Whether that decision was wise or not may be arguable, but it was made because we 'believed that an extension of our cement-making capacity was desirable to meet our own needs and to develop our export trade. Those are the facts. I do not know how the honourable member for New England, who is an old friend of mine, got "" off the bnara "" in this matter. I am sure that in his heart he does not believe that any of the Ministers of wbom he ""has spoken would be guilty of malpractice. I cannot, go further into the details of the matter now, 'because I have always endeavoured to avoid disclosing the affairs of organizations that do business with the Commonwealth. Frequently, confidential information is supplied to the Government, and I insist that that confidence shall be respected. However, I am prepared to supply additional information to the Leader of the Australian Country party. I shall not extend this offer to the honourable member for New England because he seems to be somewhat biased in his attitude to this matter.",14
14,Mr ABBOTT,METROPOLITAN PORTLAND,I am not biased.,14
15,Mr CHIFLEY,METROPOLITAN PORTLAND,I have no doubt that the honourable member has heen prompted by other vested interests.,14
16,Mr ABBOTT,METROPOLITAN PORTLAND,"I have seen the Prime Minister prompted by the "" commos "".",14
17,Mr CHIFLEY,METROPOLITAN PORTLAND,Veste d interests are always in conflict in matters such as this. The profit motive seems to stirup some of the worse human emotions.,14
18,Mr HARRISON,METROPOLITAN PORTLAND,"Tber e will be some trouble in the Labour party about the preference dividend of 16 per cent., which the honourable member for Deakin mentioned on Wednesday.",14
19,Mr CHIFLEY,METROPOLITAN PORTLAND,I do not think so.,14
20,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,METROPOLITAN PORTLAND,"Order ! The Prime Minister is replying to. a question which the Leader of the Australian Country party has asked, and I ask him not to be led away from his answer by interjections.",14
21,Mr CHIFLEY,METROPOLITAN PORTLAND,"As the Leader of the Australian Country party was the Treasurer in the Government that was responsible for the establishment of the Advisory Committee on Capital Issues he knows a great deal about the difficulties that arise in these matters, and he has a considerable knowledge of the accountancy aspect. I have complete confidence in his honesty, and he, along with the Acting Leader of the Opposition, although that honourable gentleman has not asked to do so, may, if they care to do so, examine the relevant papers.",14
22,Mr FADDEN,METROPOLITAN PORTLAND,I am not prepared to accept the responsibility of a royal commissioner.,14
23,Mr ABBOTT,METROPOLITAN PORTLAND,The Leader of the Australian Countiy party would not have the power to take evidence on oath as a royal commissioner would.,15
24,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,METROPOLITAN PORTLAND,"Order ! The Prime Minister's reply is developing into a discussion among honourable members. The Prime Minister was asked a question, and is making a rather lengthy reply. However, the Chair has no control over that. If an honourable member asks for information, the Prime Minister may reply to it at whatever length he considers to be necessary, but honourable members are not in order in promoting a discussion as the right honourable gentleman progresses.",15
25,Mr CHIFLEY,METROPOLITAN PORTLAND,"There is no need for any oaths in this matter. I merely say that the papers are on the file, and if the Leader of the Australian Country party desires to examine them, he may do so. If he chooses not to examine them, that will be all right with nie. I give to the House a complete assurance that I have stated, in broad outline, the facts of the case. WHALING .",15
26,Mr DUTHIE,METROPOLITAN PORTLAND,"In view of the growopinion ing Japanese interest in whaling, as conwhich firmed by members of the parliamentary delegation who recently returned from that country, and Australia's desire play its part in the Antarctic, can the Prime Minister indicate whether any progress is being made with the estableagues lishment of the Australian whaling dustry, with Hobart and Albany as prohcompanies able bases?",15
27,Mr CHIFLEY,METROPOLITAN PORTLAND,"Australia' s particijoining pation in the whaling industry has been the subject of a Cabinet decision. The first matter to Ibe decided was whether shore factories should be established Albany, in Western Australia, and at Twofold Bay, in New South Wales. The Government agreed to bring to this country Captain Melsom, a Norwegian whaling expert, who has investigated these matters, and, I understand, has made a report to the Minister for Comin merce and Agriculture. I shall ask the Minister to examine the document, and perhaps inform the House of Captain Melsom's conclusions. The second matter for consideration was whether a base Antarctic whaling should be established in Tasmania. One of the difficulties which then arose was the provision of a factory or mother ship. The original intention was to order the ship from the Furniss company, in the United Kingdom. I have not examined the matter for some time, and, therefore, am speaking from memory, but I understand that for a number of reasons the company could not supply the ship' for a considerable time. We hoped then to obtain one of the Japanese factory ships. The decision of the Government is that Tasmania shall be the centre for Antarctic whaling, but that depends upon the provision of a factory ship. NA AUSTRALIA .",15
28,Mr EYAN,OVEESEAS INVESTMENTS IN,"I ask the Prime Minister whether, with a view to alleviating the dollar shortage in Australia, he has given any thought to the encouragement of American investments in Australia and to ways and means by which such encouragement could be given? Is he aware that there is an influential body of in the United States of America, is urging the expansion of overseas American investments, with a view to alleviating the general shortage of dollars to in other parts of the world?",15
29,Mr CHIFLEY,OVEESEAS INVESTMENTS IN,"The honourable member has raised a subject to which my coland I have given a great deal of inconsideration. A number of American have expressed a desire toinvest capital in Australia, either hy in existing businesses as partners or shareholders, or by establishing their own businesses here. One scheme, which has been mentioned in the newspapers at recently, was for the manufacture of diesel engines. All such schemes raise certain difficulties. The establishment of an industry would involve the provision of dollars, first, for the purchase of all plant; secondly, for the payment of royalties, possibly to some parent concern the United States of America; and, thirdly, for the payment of dividends if the undertaking returned profits. The Government of Canada has found that the payment of dividends to shareholders of for companies in that dominion financed entirely with American capital imposes a heavy and continuousdrain upon its economy. I have been very reluctant to reject many of theproposals which have been made for the establishment of businesses in Australia under the control of American companies operating in conjunction with Australian companies. One scheme would have involved the provision of 13,000,000 dollars during the next three or four years, and the Government is not in a position to guarantee that 1 two years hence it will be able to make available an amount of', say, 5,000,000 dollars-for any one-company. In building up such a business,, the companymight have to purchase 50 percent, of its plant and equipment overseas. In some instances,, we have been able, to make an arrangement fbr an. increased amount of American capital to be joined with Australian capital. In each case of this naturewe have endeavoured to provide that, a-t' least 50 per cent, of thecapital in the company concerned shall be Australian capital in orderthat an Australian interest and outlook shall heretained. I emphasize that* very careful consideration has' been given to all such proposals. Dollars have been released in some instances? hut' other applications r have had to be rejected because' they would have-involved long-term, payments of dollars which Australia cannofguarantee. at present.",15
30,Mr TTJRNBTJLT,OVEESEAS INVESTMENTS IN,"r-direc t a question to the Minister-representing-the'Minister fbr Shipping and Fuel concerningthe grave shortageof-' nails"" to which. I ' rer ferred. in this' House last night; I have received a: telephonecall' ffom' aconstituent' at Quambatook; Victoria'; who told me that naikvof any sizes were absolutely unprocurable in that'area-. I-then communicated with the authorities' in Victoria, and was told' that the shortage wasgeneral owingto theinability of manufacturers to secure-nail wire ffom Newcastle-as the result*of shipping'difficulties; and' that buildersin Melbourne were-endeavouring-to purchase' nails in 1-lb. lots wherever possible: Will the Minister' cause-investigations to' be made and take steps to have shipping space made available' for the transport' of'' nail wire from Newcastle to Melbourneso that the manufacture of these essential articles may continue?'",16
31,Mr DEDMAN,OVEESEAS INVESTMENTS IN,"The honourable member's question ignores the fact that interstate shipping has been de-controlled for a long time. It. is true that the Australian Government has some vessels which are used fbr interstate traffic, but private enterprise also has a responsibility - in the matter of ensuring that supplies of the necessary raw materials find their way to manufacturers. I can assure the honourable member that the Government will do its utmost to see that shipping facilities are made, available, but that does not absolve private enterprise from its responsibility to provide vessels for the despatch of supplies from Newcastle to Victoria and elsewhere--. TELEVISION . .",16
32,Mr SHEEHAN,OVEESEAS INVESTMENTS IN,"I ask the Minister representing the. Postmaster-General whether it is. the intention of the Government to introduce television in Australia? Will the introduction of television necessitate the payment of* royalties and performing - right, fees - to the promoters; of organized, sports meetings, and theatrical performances-?",16

Mr DRAKEFORD!- I aminformed 1 that' recruiting for the Royal Australian Air-Force is""-on-a satisfactory-basis. I shall endeavour to obtain the otber inforAir mation for which the honourable member bas asked. WOOL.",16
35,Mr LANG,OVEESEAS INVESTMENTS IN,"Can the Prime Minister aay whether an agreement was signed at Lake Success on the 3rd June last, by John D. L. Hood, on behalf of the Comused, monwealth of Australia, and D. Julius Katz-Suchy, on behalf of Poland, under which Australia is to make a free gift hostilities ? to Poland of 800,000 dollars worth of wool? Has the Australian Government agreed to supply the wool without charge and, in addition, to pay the costs of curement, storage, insurance, transportafacilities tion and shipment to the port of entry Poland? Is the Government aware of the concern felt in the United States America, as reported in the New York Times of the 4th J une last, that this might find its way into Soviet hands for military purposes, despite any agreement to the contrary? Has the attention of the Government been directed to the fact that Czechoslovakia and Poland, which hitherto were not wool buyers, have been co-operating with the Soviet as hig wool buyers on both the Australian and Texas markets? Have agreements yet been cluded for free gifts of Australian wool to Hungary, Italy and Yugoslavia? the statement in the New York Times that no precautions are mentioned in the is Polish agreement .o ensure that the wool is not used for uniforms and other military purposes in accordance with fact?",17
36,Mr CHIFLEY,OVEESEAS INVESTMENTS IN,"Some of the points raised by the honourable member cover a good deal of ground, particularly those necessary. relating to the provision of wool to Czechoslovakia and other countries, which was in some instances made under credits, and to the places to which international relief supplies are to he eent. The honourable member's questions are fairly lengthy and I shall prepare written reply, covering all the points he to this country? has raised, so that he will have full information on the subject. CIVIL AVIATION. EMPIRE AIB ROUTES.",17
37,Mr HAMILTON,OVEESEAS INVESTMENTS IN,"For the informaby tion of the House I ask the Minister what steps, if any, have been taken to develop the Empire Indian Ocean air route from Perth to London via Cocos Island, Diego, Garcia Island, the Seychelles group, Mombasa, Khartoum and Malta? Is it a fact that that route would pass entirely over British territory and would be shorter than the route at present via Singapore, Bangkok, Karachi and Baghdad, which would have to be abandoned in the event of world-wide",17
38,Mr DRAKEFORD,OVEESEAS INVESTMENTS IN,"Step s have been taken, and are continuing to be taken, pi""oto provide the necessary equipment and for a trial flight to be made into over the Indian Ocean route. That fact was announced in the press some time of ago. Facilities are necessary at Cocos Island and elsewhere to ensure that, wool when the trial flight is made, aircraft will be properly serviced, maintained and fuelled. Investigations are being made regarding actual geographical details of the Indian Ocean route as an alternative to the present route, but it would not he wise to disclose Australia's plans for the provision of an alternative route to be used in the event of hostilities making consuch a route necessary. I can assure the honourable member, however, that all Is the steps he has mentioned are being taken. I believe the Indian Ocean route shorter than the present route and could free - be made to pass only through Empire territories, but the existing facilities are not nearly adequate for the inauguration of a regular service. The Government is continually exploiting all opportunities to make alternative routes available should an outbreak of hostilities make them IMMIGRATION .",17
39,Mr RYAN,OVEESEAS INVESTMENTS IN,Is the Minister for Immigration yet in a position to reply to a question which I asked earlier this week a regarding the cost of bringing migrants,17
40,Mr CALWELL,OVEESEAS INVESTMENTS IN,"h y leave-Britis h ex-service personnel and their dependants are granted free passages, the maximum contribution made by the United Kingdom. Government being £stg.75 per adult passage; the balance, if any, heing met the Australian Government. For for example, on a ship on which the rate of passage is £stg.70 the amount would be wholly paid by the United Kingdom '-'overnment, and on a ship on which the rate of passage is £stg.80, £stg.75 would be contributed by the United Kingdom Government and fstg.5 by the Australian Government. The rates of passages charged on different ships vary, but an approximate average contribution by the Australian. Government in respect of free passages is £stg.l5 per migrant. ""With regard to assisted passages, the base or economical rate adopted by the United Kingdom is £stg.75, in view of the fluctuating costs which apply in respect of different vessels. The contribution in the case of an adult migrant is fcstg.10. Deducted from £stg.75 that leaves £stg.6o, of which the United Kingdom Government pays half and the Ausapproved tralian Government pays half. After deducting the migrant's and the United Kingdom Government's contribution, any additional amount of passage beyond £stg.75 is met hy the Australian Government. To date the average cost case to the Australian Government of adult assisted passages has heen approximately £stg.47 for each migrant. When the port of disembarkation is a State other than that for which the migrant is destined, the Commonwealth is responsible for transportation to State concerned, and for any accommoI dation and maintenance en route and while the person concerned is await7s. ing transportation. It is estimated that the average cost to the. Commoncrease wealth is £7 10s. That rate is influenced by the fact that migrants are sometimes landed in Fremantle and transported overland to other States in order to ensure a quick turn around of ships. By arrangement with the States, free accommodation is provided for immiture grants on their arrival for periods of to seven days in the case of free and sisted British migrants. Under the nomination system most migrants normbasis ally proceed to the homes of their nomione-third nators immediately after arrival and find it unnecessary to take advantage of the State reception centres. The cost of operating reception centres may vary the several States, but it is not thought that those costs would exceed 7s. a Mr Calwell. and if the average stay was one of approximately three days the value of the accommodation given to the migrant would average about £1. The Common^ wealth does not pay the fares of immigrants who are transported only intrastate from the reception centre to their final destination. However, if it is necessary to use private transport the Commonwealth and the States concerned contribute equally to the cost. It would be virtually impossible to obtain from the States particulars of charges which have been incurred separately on State-owned and privately owned transporation. In any event, it is thought that these charges would not be likely to exceed an average of 10s. Regarding child migrants sponsored hy voluntary organization, children under fourteen years are provided with passages to Australia without charge to the organization, and the cost is borne equally by the governments of Australia and the United Kingdom. However, in the of juveniles between the ages of fourteen and nineteen years, their guardians or the organization which sponsors them are obliged to pay £stg.5. The balance of the fare is shared equally by the two in governments. Organizations are granted a £A.5 equipment allowance in respect of each child landed in Australia. This is the paid by the Australian Government. n addition, the Commonwealth pays to the organization child endowment of 6d. a week for each child, and provision has been made in the budget to in that payment to 10s. a week. The Government of the United Kingdom contributes 6s. 3d., Australian currency, and the States 3s. 6d. per week, which represents a total payment of 17s. 3d. a week for each child. The Commonwealth and States also contribute to capital expendiincurred by approved voluntary up organizations to provide accommodation asand other facilities for child and youth migrants. Contributions are made on the of one-third by the Commonwealth, by the States and one-third by the organization concerned. The cost to voluntary organizations of fares of nurses and escorts for the children en route to in Australia are met jointly by the Australian and United Kingdom Governday, ments. Medical expenses incurred in respect of such children during the voyage are also shared jointly by the two Governments. To sum up, the cost to the Commonwealth and the States of British free and assisted migrants is as follows:FREE PASSAGE ADULT MIGRANTS. Commonwealth costContribution to passages £stg.lfl = £A.I8 15s. Transportation and maintenance costs en route to States after arrival in Australia .. State costAccommodation (£1), fares (10s.) Total .. ASSISTED PASSAGE ADULT MIGRANTS.

State costFares, &c, within State Total .. JUVENILES 14 TO 19 YEABS. ""Commonwealth costContribution to passages State costFares, &c, within State Total .. .. .. These figures are, of course, approximations, and I assume that the honourable member does not wish the Commonwealth and State Immigration Departments to make a detailed investigation of all their accounts, running into thousands, so as to take out exact figures. He will appreciate that this would be too great a task for the various departments to undertake, having regard to the pressure of departmental work. Australian The figures which I have cited do not currency. cover capital expenditure incurred as to £ s. d. half by the Commonwealth and half by the States, in setting up their reception IS IS 0 centres. It would not, of course, be possible to average this expenditure as the huildings will be utilized for very many 7 10 0 years yet for the purpose for which they 1 10 0 were obtained. For a similar reason, no average cost for child endowment or for 28 15 0 grants to voluntary organizations for accommodation, have been included under the summary of contributions in. respect Australian of child migration. currency. I know the purpose which the honor£ 8. d. able member had in mind in asking his question. It has heen claimed from time to time that the cost to the Commonwealth and the States of bringing immigrants to Australia has been 7 10 0 between £200 and £300 for each person, 1 10 0 including children. I have shown that the Commonwealth and the States are 67 15 0 administering a big scheme, and doing it very efficiently and economically. I douht whether, at any time in the history of Australia, immigrants have been brought to the country at such small cost Australian to the taxpayers. currency. £ s. d.

The building will be of steelframed construction with a brick in-fill and concrete floors. The additions are necessary to provide accommodation for the expansion of exchange equipment. The estimated cost of the additions is £197,300. I lay on the table drawings of the proposal. Question resolved in the affirmative. WHEAT TAX (EEPEAL AND BEFUND) BILL 1948.  That leave be given to bring in a bill for an act to repeal the Wheat Tax Act 1940, to provide for the refund to growers of wheat of moneys raised under that act. and for other purposes. Bill presented, and read a first time. SECOND READING.  for Commerce and Agriculture) [11.23]. - h y leave- I move That the bill be now read a second time. This measure is intended to return to wheat-growers £11,000,000 which has been collected in wheat tax from the 1945-46 and 1946-47 crops. The tax was imposed in 1946 under legislation dealing with the wheat stabilization plan, about which I merely say that it was not supported by the necessary State legislation. Another plan is now before the States for their consideration, and a little later in this session honourable members can expect the introduction of another bill in regard to Australian wheat-marketing. The form of that bill will depend on what the State governments decide to do, or not. to do, in the meantime, and it does not concern us at present. A feature of the 1946 legislation was that it provided for the imposition of a tax on wheat exported during years of high prices. That tax was the growers' contribution to a stabilization fund. .In effect, this Parliament agreed to guarantee wheat-growers against low prices, provided that they themselves made a reasonable payment during the time they were receiving high prices. It will be remembered that the original plan was announced at the beginning of 1946. One point made at the time was that no more than a reasonable fund was needed; it was not intended to build up an excessive fund from growers' contributions. The refund now proposed arises from that principle. The tax has been collected for the two seasons, and now, for the 1947-48 record crop, prices are still high. There is over £11,000,000 in the fund, and another £15,000,000 will be received' from the 1947-48 crop. Export wheat prices have shown a decided decrease this season, hut price prospects for next season's wheat still seem good. Consequently, the £15,000,000 expected from the 1947-48 crop will provide a reasonable foundation for the stabilization fund, and the amount already held should go back to the growers from whom it came. The same effect would result, of course, if the present funds were held, and tax on the present crop reduced. That would be easier and would provide the same money, hut the Government in this bill is adopting a method which meets with general approval. Where a refund is possible it is beingmade to the oldest contributing pool, and the idea is that the fund will be subscribed by the latest pool practice. In this way, the contribution is made by the group which is most likely to share the actual benefits. The principle of ""first in, first out"" is the fairest one to adopt, and it is supported by wheat growers. It also has the advantage of returning tLe money available to the oldest contributing group, and that is the group in which some hard-luck cases, which deserve special consideration, have developed. The bill gives effect to a refund which was announced by me at the beginning of the year as an item of Government policy. At that time there seemed little prospect of an international wheat agreement, and the High Oourt judgment on the Nelungaloo Wheat case had not been given. Not long after, ratification of the international wheat agreement seemed assured, and it was approved by the Parliament. Since then I regret that the failure of other nations to accept the agreement has made it necessary for Australia, together with Britain and other countries, to withdraw from the agreement. Consequently, the international agreement on wheat which is desired by Australia is still in the future. Events, however, have not altered the desirability, and the practicability, of a refund of the tax from the 1945-46 and 1946-47 wheat crops. The repayment to wheat-growers can be made, and E have pleasure in recommending it to the House. i have mentioned that the amount collected is, in round figures, £11,000,000. The money is in a trust fund, and has been invested, so that there will be interest on it which will also be paid to wheat-growers. The method of payment will be the one familiar to growers as a source of income since 1939. The. money will be paid to the Australian Wheat Board, and will he distributed to wheat farmers as a part of the payments from the two pools concerned. It is intended to make the payment for the 1945-46 season before Christmas. The 1946-47 crop repayment will be made at a convenient date to be decided later. Honourable members will know that the tax is imposed on wheat exported, and the maximum rate is 50 per cent, of the surplus above the home-consumption price. As export prices were very high during the two seasons, the actual amount collected was 2s. 2d. a bushel on export wheat, which is less than the 50 per cent, mentioned. In other words, advantage was taken of the provision of the act under which a smaller percentage than -50 per cent, could be collected. Calculated over all the wheat in the pools the amount collected, and .now to be repaid with interest, is approximately ls. l i d . on the 194546 crop, and 10^d. a bushel on the 194647 crop. I now ask honourable members to endorse the repayment to wheat-growers, with the assurance that it is fully justified. It is in accordance with the policy endorsed by the Parliament in 1946, and I hope it N/ill soon be followed by other action to mark the agreement of all governments in Australia on measures to ensure the prosperity of the industry in the years to come. Debate (on motion by Mr TURNBULL) adjourned. NA NA BILL (No. 2) 1948. Bill presented by Mr JOHNSON, and read a. first time. SECOND READING .",20
43,Mr JOHNSON,TERRITORY REPRESENTATIO N,"Kalgoorlie-Minister for the Interior) [11.28] - by leave- I moveTluvt the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of the bill is to provide that, as from the date of the next general election, the people of the Australian Capital Territory, which, of course, includes the Commonwealth Territory at Jervis Bay, shall be directly represented in the Parliament of the Commonwealth by a member of the House of Representatives elected from time to time by the electors of the Territory. The principle of representation in the Parliament and the right of the people of a territory to choose their representative by vote will, it is believed, receive the endorsement of all honourable members of this House. Section 122 of the Constitution provides that the Parliament may allow the representation of any territory of the Commonwealth in either House of the Parliament to the extent and on terms which it thinks fit. However, in the case of such a territory, there is no alternative to direct representation insomuch as the Constitution does not permit of a territory being included with a State or any part thereof for the pose of forming an electoral division. At the present time there are approxiritory mately 9,750 electors enrolled on the of electors for the Australian Capital Territory, and honourable members will the readily agree that the number will rapidly increase as a consequence of the extensive expansion in the development of the shall federal capital planned to take effect within the next few years. As a result of legislation passed Parliament recently, Tasmania will, immediately following the next general elecsimilar tion, be represented in the Parliament by fifteen representatives-te n senators and five members of the House of Repreritory sentatives - The number of electors enrolled for Tasmania is approximately 158,000, and assuming the number rises to 165,000 by the end of 1949, Tasmania will have in the next Parliament one representative-takin g the Senate and House of Representatives jointly-fo each 11,000 of its electors. It may be claimed that the population of the Australian Capital Territory not yet equal to a normal federal division. The absolute equality of vote value is an academic ideal that never has been and never can be realized exactly. SucL an as equality is secondary to the fundamental principle that every substantial section the people should have some representations tion. The Australian Capital Territory is a distinct community and the Constitution recognizes that smaller States, being distinct comHouse. munities, are entitled to a minimum of five representatives, irrespective of adjourned. population. The power given to Parliament to allow representation of a territory is a power coupled with a duty to exercise the power as soon as circumstances warrant it. It is confidently expected it will not be long before the number of electors in the Australian Capital Territory reaches at least 11,000 and, therefore, on the basis of comparison with the State of Tasmania alone, it is considered it would be most unfair to continue to deny to the electors of the Territory - the right of choosing a parliamentary representative who could directly voice their views and Sir. Johnson. purair any grievances they may have. However, because the number of the electors resident in the Australian Capital Terfalls far short of the average roll number of electors represented by members of the House of Representatives for States, the bill provides that, as in the case of the Northern Territory, the member for the Australian Capital Territory not be entitled to vote in the House, except on a motion for the disallowance of any ordinance of the Territory and on by the any amendment of any such motion. The hill further provides, in terms to those contained in the Northern Territory Eepresentation Act, that the member for the Australian Capital Tershall not be included in the count now for the purposes of determining a quorum; that he shall not be capable of being chosen as, or of performing the duties of, the Speaker or the Chairman of Committees of the House; and that he shall not be counted for the purpose of r determining an absolute majority in the event of a joint sitting of the members of the Senate and House of Representatives is or in connection with any proposed law for the alteration of the Constitution. The qualifications of a member representing the Australian Capital Territory set out in the bill are precisely those of a member for an electoral division of a of State and, except for the specific limitato which I have already referred, the member elected for the Territory will have the same powers, immunities and the privileges as other members of this Debate (on motion by Mr HARRISON) ADDEESS-IN-EEPLY.
