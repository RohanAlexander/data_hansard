3,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"I have no desire to prejudice the inquiry which the Assistant Minister for Defence states is proceeding in regard to the trouble among returning munition workers on board the Bahia Castillo, but I desire to ask the honourable gentleman whether he will pay particular attention to the demand that is being made for a civil rather than a military inquiry into the position that .has arisen, and as to the removal of the armed guard from th is vessel ?

13,Mr FENTON,WIVES OF GERMAN INTERNEES,"In connection with the proclamation of Peace, it was decided that clemency should be extended to members of the Australian Imperial Force undergoing terms of imprisonment; but the benefit of this act of clemency cannot be secured by such men now imprisoned on the other side until their return to Australia.

[480-2 ] TRADE MARKS BILL. SECOND READING. Mr GS00M (Darling Downs-Minister for ""Works and Railways) [11.16] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. This is a smiall Bill of a few clauses to amend certain sections of the Trade Marks o r Act 1905-1912. The first clause is an amendment of section 18 of the principal which deals with the question of the registration of trade marks, and provides that the Registrar may refuse an application to register trade marks which conth tain such expressions as "" Trade Mark, "" r "" Registered,"" "" Copyright,"" or any representation of the K in g, the Queen, or any The member of the Royal Family, or of the Royal Crown, or any representation of but the Royal Arms, or of the Coat of Arms of the Commonwealth or any State. It is to intended by clause 2 to amend this section by providing that the Registrar may Any word or mark which is declared by the Governor General by proclamation to be for the purposes of this section a prohibited word or mark, or any word or mark so nearly resembling any such word or mark as to be likely to The Governor General will b« empowered to proclaim certain words as prohibited add words, and when they are so declared, to - the Registrar may refuse to allow them to be registered in connection with a trade mark. For example, it ' is considered deany sirable to protect the use of the word The Governor General may proclaim the word "" An z a c "" and other words of a similar character to be prohibited, and thereupon they may not be registered in any trade mark. The clause is in harcnony with what has already been done under the ""War Precautions regulaClause 3 is really in substance an adapof section 9 1 A of the Patents Act. It is proposed to insert a new section as follows:100A. Where any person claiming to be the of a trade mark, by circulars, ador otherwise, threatens any other person with any legal proceedings or liability respect of any alleged infringement of the mark, any person aggrieved thereby may bring an action against him, and may obtain injunction against the continuance of such threats, and may recover such damages (if any) as he"" has sustained thereby if the alleged infringement to which the threats related was not in fact an infringement of any legal rights of the person making the threats: Provided that this section shall not apply if the person making the threats with due diligence commences and prosecutes an action for infringement of his trade mark. This new section will apply where one person is using a trade mark, and another who has really no valid right to the use of it threatens him with legal action if he does not abstain from exercising what is his own right. The provision is already in operation in connection with the Patents Act. Clause 4 repeals section 113 of the principal Act, and proposes to insert anotheT in its stead. Section 113 provides that no person shall, without the authority of the K in g , or of some member - of the Royal Family, or of the GovernoTGeneral, or of the Governor of a State, or of some Department of the Government of the Commonwealth or a State, assume OT use in connection with any trade, business, calling, or profession the Royal Arms or the Anns of the Commonwealth, or A i m s so nearly resembling the Royal Arms or the Arms of the Commonwealth as to be likely to deceive in such a manner as to be likely to lead other persons to believe that he is carrying on his trade, business, calling, or profession by or under such authority. Unfortunately, it is rather difficult to enforce this section, ancl it is proposed to amend it in two ways. At present, the provision could be interpreted to mean that a State Governor or a State Department could give permission to any person to make use of the Commonwealth Coat of Arms, and it is proposed to take .away that right, and stipulate that the Commonwealth Coat of Arms shall only be used under Commonwealth authority. It is also difficult to establish the concluding words of the sectionin such a manner as to be likely to lead other persons to believe that he is carrying on his trade, business, calling, or profession by or under such authority. It is considered much more satisfactory to have a straight-out prohibition of use of coats of arms, and tliese words are to be omitted. The amended section w i then read as follows:113.(1.) No person shall, without the rity of the King, or of some member of the Royal Family, or of the Governor General, Mr Groom. of the Governor of a State, or of some Department of the Government of the Commonwealth or of a State (proof whereof shall lie upon the person accused), assume or use in connection with any trade, business, calling, or profession the Royal Arms or Arms so nearly resembling the Royal Arms as to be likely to deceive. (2) No person shall, without the authority of the King, or of some member of the Royal Family, or of the Governor General, or of some Department of the Government of the Commonwealth (proof whereof shall lie upon the person accused), assume or use in connection with any trade, business, calling, or profession the Arms of the Commonwealth or Arms so nearly resembling the Arms of the Commonwealth as to be likely to deceive. ' Penalty: Twenty pounds. I think' that the amendments of the Act, including the provision to allow the prohibition of the use of the word "" ANZAC,"" will appeal .to honourable members.",23
35,Mr TUDOR,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,"Y a r r a ) [11.24] - I know that the word "" An z a c "" is made use of by many people; b ut whether it is in defiance of the law or. not, I do not know.",24
36,Mr GROOM,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,In every case brought under notice action has been taken.,24
37,Mr TUDOR,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,"In many places of business battalion colours are advertised, as is also the fact that the proprietors of businesses have been members of the Australian Imperial Force. It may be a case in which only one of the partners has been a member of the Australian I m perial Force, while the greater portion of the capital employed in the business may have been furnished by a partner who has not been a member of that Force. The prohibition against the use of the word "" ANZAC "" may not go far enough. Steps should be taken to prevent any f r a u d in this direction.. There is another matter which has been brought under my notice by a member of the New South Wales State Parliament who has recently been to the United States of America. In nearly every country in the world the words "" L if e Savers "" have been registered, as applying to a certain confection, but the registration of these words is refused in Australia. There is no doubt that most persons, particularly Americans, indulge in extravagant claims as to the healing or the curative properties of the goods they offer for sale, but, as a matter of fact, l l "" lif e saving"" is a phrase usually applied to cases of drowning. This confection is got up in a form representing authoa miniature life-buoy. The point I wish or to make is .whether the Registrar of Trade Marks adopts a different standard from that which is adopted in other countries. It seems to me that no valid objection can be raised to the registration of a term which is permitted in other places. I would like to know whether this Bill will affect those persons who advertise that the goods they offer for sale have marvellous properties. I know that this is a matter which is properly covered by the Commerce Act-at one time the Trade and Customs Department deemed it necessary to completely revise that Act, for the purpose of dealing with these extravagant claims-bu t I was wondering whether the Bill before us would cover such cases. I do not wish to anticipate what the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr. Finlayson) proposes to say; but in regard to the prohibition of the use of coats-ofweaving arrns, I wish to call attention to the that I have seen the Commonwealth Ooatof-Arms on a pamphlet which was sent to every member of this Parliament.",24
38,Mr GROOM,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,Was it a registered trade mark?,25
39,Mr TUDOR,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,- I do not think it was. Therefore a person would not be allowed to use it ?,25
40,Mr GROOM,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,Not as a trade mark.,25
41,Mr TUDOR,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,"Would he be allowed touse it. other than: as a trade mark? What is the difference? Mr Rodier sent to every honourable member a pamphlet regarding rabbit destruction, and it bore the Royal Coat-of-Arms. Apparently a person may not use the Royal Coat-ofAxms as a trade mark, but he may use it for anything else.'",25
42,Mr GROOM,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,W& s it used by Rodier in connection with a trade or business ?,25
43,Mr TUDOR,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,"No . We see every day on the carts of butchers and fishmongers the Coat-of-Arms and the words "" Under the patronage of His Excellency the Governor."" Will this Bill prohibit the use of the Royal Coat-of-Arms in those circumstances ? I rose merely to indicate two or three respects in which the existing might be further tightened up.",25
44,Mr FENTON,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,"Maribyrnong) [11.32]. - The returned soldiers conducting the hand-woven tweed industry in Victoria and some of the other States have named their product "" ANZAC tweed."" I presume that they, too, will be prohibited from using the word "" ANZAC.""",25
45,Mr GROOM,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,This Bill deals only with applications for registered trade marks; No person will be allowed to register a prohibited word or mark.,25
46,Mr FENTON,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,Suppos e a person already possesses that word or mark?,25
47,Mr GROOM,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,"Nobod y possesses the word "" ANZAC "" as a registered trade mark at present. Its use is prohibited both here and in the United Kingdom, and the Government of the United States of America also are taking steps to prohibit the use of the word.",25
48,Mr FENTON,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,What difference does the application for registration make?,25
49,Mr GROOM,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,The registration of any word or mark gives the person registering it a proprietary right in it.,25
50,Mr FENTON,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,"If the returned soldiers who are engaged in the hand^ of cloth desire to advertise their fact products by using the word ""ANZAC"" without registering it, will they be allowed to do so?",25
51,Mr GROOM,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,No ; the WarPrecautions regulation still applies.,25
52,Mr FENTON,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,I suppose that any word similar in spelling or pronounciation could be used?,25
53,Mr GROOM,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,"We also prohibit the use of "" any word or mark so nearly resembling such word or mark as to be likely to deceive.""",25
54,Mr MAXWELL,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,"No imitation of the name ""ANZAC"" would be of use to anybody.",25
55,Mr FENTON,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,"Because of the sentiment attaching ito the word ""ANZAC,"" there is a certain advertising value in any word or words closely resembling it.",25
56,Mr GROOM,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,"If the resemblance were so close as to be likely to deceive anybody, the use of the word would be prohibited.",25
57,Mr FENTON,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,"Tw o or three, years ago the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Kelly) brought under the notice of the House the German trade mark ""Aspirin "". I have never been able to see the need for objecting to the use of that word law by Australian manufacturers. It was contended that the use of the word would keep alive the enemy interest in that commodity, and that, after the war, the Germans would again enter intofull possession of the trade. But in Victoria one chemist has been for a number of years,, even when Aspirin had ful l sway in the market, manufacturing a drug quite equal in quality to that made by the Germans. It is called ""Aspro,"" but purchasers know very well that it just the same as "" As p i r in . "" I 'again ask the Minister whether Bill would deprive returned soldiers the right to use the word "" ANZAC"" in order to advertise their hand-woven tweeds ?",25
58,Mr GROOM,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,"If the use of the word "" An z a c "" were prohibited, neither they nor anybody else would be allowed to gister it or any word so closely resembling it as to be likely to deceive. Bill deals only with trade marks. have no power under t h ^ measure to deal Millen). with advertisements in which unregistered trade marks are employed.",26
59,Mr FENTON,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,"I understand that anybody used the word "" An z a c "" as an advertisement without registering i a trade mark, the Government would "" have to take proceedings under some other Act or regulation. The returned soldiers engaged in the hand-weaving of shall be content. tweeds have been using the word "" An z a c "" for advertising purposes, and they are the only persons who have righ t to use it .",26
60,Mr MCDONALD,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,"Kennedy) [11.37]. I draw the attention of the Minister (M Groom) to clause 4, which provides that members of the Royal Family may mark, authorize the use of the Royal Coat of Arms. If the wording is not altered, Bill will give that authority to the Kaiser and his descendants, because they are members of the Royal Family. the Bill is in Committee, I shall move amendment to definitely exclude the Kaiser and his descendants. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee: Clause 1 agreed to. Clause 2Section 18 of the principal Act is amended by adding at the end thereof the following paragraph:""or (h) Any word or mark which is dethat monopoly. clared by the Governor General by proclamation to be for the purposes of this section a prohibited word or mark, or any word or mark so nearly resembling any such word or mark as to be likely to deceive."" Section proposed to be amendedSubject to the regulations, the Registrar may refuse to register any trade mark which contains any of the following words or matthe ters . . .",26
61,Dr MALONEY,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,"Melbourne) [11.40]. - I hope that only returned soldiers will is be permitted to use the word "" ANZAC."" I speak feelingly on this matter, because the I know that the "" ANZAC "" tweed inof dustry has not been given a fair chance. The returned soldiers engaged in it were prohibited from using certain colours on the edge line, which would have indicated to every tailor and purchaser of the tweed that it was of good quality, and was not remade from shoddy. .1 again assert that shoddy yarn was supplied to those reB u t this turned soldiers notwithstanding the denial We of the Minister for Repatriation (Senator I produced samples in this House, and I showed them to the Minister in the presence of a' witness; he could not deny that they had if come from the Government mills. If the Minister in'charge of the Bill will t as assure me that the use of the word An z a c "" will be permitted only to returned soldiers, and industries in connection with which, they are engaged, I",26
62,Mr GROOM,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,"Darling Downs-Minister a for Works and Railways) [11.41] - This Bill deals only with what can or cannot be a registered trade mark, and the intenr . tion is to prevent persons getting, by registration, a monopoly of any word or the use of which, as a trade mark, is regarded as objectionable from a public the point of view, such as "" ANZAC.""",26
63,Dr MALONEY,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,"Is it intended to retain the word for the use of returned soldiers ? When Mr GROOM - The intention of the an Bill is to prevent any persons, even returned soldiers, getting a monopoly of the word "" An z a c . "" Its ""use is to be prohibited as a registered trade mark. A trade mark is in the nature of a monopoly. By registering a particular word as a trade mark, a person gets a peculiar property in it , and it becomes his own distinctive mark which other persons can be prevented from using. The object of the clause is to prevent anybody getting Clause agreed to. Clause 3 agreed to.

69,Mr MCDONALD,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,We saw that definition a moment or two ago.,27
70,Mr GROOM,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,"What the honourable member saw was probably in Halsbury, dealing with a different matter.

83,Mr FINLAYSON,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,"Brisbane) [11.48]. I desire to put one view in support of the amendment. It is a well-known historical fact that if the war did not i m mediately arise out of a family dispute in connection with the British Royal Family, the Kaiser Will i a m of Germany has never failed for one moment to assert his right to be. the reigning monarch of the BritisH Empire, on the ground that he is the descendent of the eldest child of Queen Victoria. Although we have no doubt in our mind as to the lack of any power on the part of Will i a m Hohenzollern to rank as a member of the British Royal Family, he asserts that claim, and we in Australia have perfect justification for specifying in our laws that he is not a descendant, and has no such right. I hope that an assertion to that effect will be made in this and every other Bill . The last British election was fought on the CTy, "" Hang the Kaiser,"" and now those concerned are at their wits end to know how even to try him . And he is to be tried not as an individual, but as a monarchas the sovereign of Germany. He stands in the relation of cousin to our present honored King, and .there is no doubt in the mind of the reigning House, at any rate, as to his claim to be the rightful monarch of the British Empire. We .should assert ourselves in Australia, and exhibit OUT devoted loyalty to the Throne and Empire by repudiating at all times such a claim on the part of William of Germany.",27
84,Mr FOWLER,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,"Perth) [11.50] - If the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr. MCDonald) wishes to safeguard this measure in the way he suggests, he must expand his proposal very considerably. There have been other inter-marriages among Royal .Families ito such an extent that they are really all one family more or less connected.",28
85,Mr MCDONALD,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,There are special reasons in the present case.,28
86,Mr FOWLER,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,"I quite agree that there, are - special reasons today for this suggestion; but there may be other reasons tomorrow in regard to some other remote connection of the Royal Family. I take it that the phrase "" Royal Family "" indicates precisely the immediate family of the reigning Sovereign, and does not include any one who has not direct allegiance to the Crown of iGreat Britain?",28
87,Mr FENTON,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,"Suppos e the present heirs were to die out, - and the legal heirs did not happen to 'have direct allegiance ? - Mr FOWLER - We need not look forward to such an improbability.",28

89,Mr FOWLER,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,"The honourable member has made a very useful suggestion. To me those words appear quite superfluous, and it would simplify l i e matter if they were withdrawn.

90,Mr FINLAYSON,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,"Brisbane) [11.58]. - I move That after the word ""deceive,"" line 14, the following words be inserted:-""o r the Union Jack, or any ensign or standard of the United Kingdom, or any adaptation of the Union Jack or any such ensign or standard. On several occasions I have called attention to what I 'consider .to be the unfair, unreasonable, and undesirable use that is made of our national emblems in the shape of flags and standards. On the 16th July, 1915, I put a question on the subject to the then Prime Minister (Mr. Fisher), and on the 14th March, 1917, - a similar question to his successor (Mr. Hughes), and both informed me that the matter would receive attention.' On the 20th September, 1918, the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt) answered some questions which I addressed to him on the subject. My questions were as follow:In view of the replies given to the questions of the honourable member for Brisbane by Mr . Fisher as Prime Minister, on the 16th July, 1915, and by Mr Hughes as Prime Minister, on the 14th March, 1917-that the practice of usinjsr the national flag and national emblems for trade and advertising purposes would be investigated- "" 1. Whether any definite action has been taken by the Government in .the matter ? 2. Has the attention of the Minister been called to - the fact that the following trade advertisements, amongst others, are at present being published, in which the national flag and emblems are used: - Lippett' s Wines, Foster's Lager, Johnnie Walker Whisky, John B u l l Oats, FluxiteJ 3. Does the Government propose to put a stop to this? To this the Acting. Prime Minister repliedThe answer is that the matter was fully sidered by the Prime Minister, but it was found impracticable to frame any legislation or regulation to prevent the use by traders advertisements. suggesting loyalty and zeal for the Allied cause. Whatever virtue that reply may have had at the time, the reason for it has gone. No particular virtue attaches now to loyalty or zeal for the Allied cause as displayed by the use of these emblems, because the war is over. Section 19 of the Trade MarksAct 1905 prohibits the registration of any trade mark which containsa representation of the Royal Arms, or of the national flag of the United Kingdom, or of the flag of the Commonwealth, or of the national arms of the United Kingdom, or of the. arms or seal of the Commonwealth or any State. That provision is evidently a dead letter. I do not profess to be an enthusiastic advocate of national emblems, but I recognise that they stand for a great deal in our national life, and are worth somethin?. To some people they appeal very strongly, standing for very high ideals and putting into symbolic form onr pride as members of the British Empire. It is very obnoxious to me to see advertisements of all sorts using the Union Jack, the Royal Standard, the Royal Coat of Arms, the Commonwealth Flag, and the Australian Coat of Arms in order to push the sale of goods. Hoardings all over the country are placarded with these things. Newspaper advertisements nourish them freely. The only difference is that, in the newspapers, there is an absence of colour, whereas on the hoardings they appear in the gayest of colourings.",28
91,Mr WEST,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,They make a lot of work for the artists.,29
92,Mr FINLAYSON,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,"My amendment will make no difference to the work given to the artists. I feel strongly that the sense of the community is against the present display of these emblems for trade purposes, by which our sense of proportion and reasonableness and the fitness of things is offended. They tend to lessen the regard and respect which we all more or less feel is due to our national emblems, and which some of us gladly and readily accord 'to them. In the question: I p ut to the Acting Prime Minister last year I quoted liippett's wines, which, display on all their, advertisements the Union Jack and the conAustralian Flag crossed. Foster's Lager has an enormous representation,, clear, of correct, and explicit, of the Commonwealth registered Coat of Arms, our heraldic emblem. Johnnie Walker whisky regularly uses the flag: The advertisement of John B u l l oats is to be seen everywhere with the Union Jack as its distinctive feature. Fluxite alsouses it , and in the Herald' the other day I came across a most obnoxious use of the Union Jack, together with a reference to the Italian occupation of Fiume, as an a d vertisement for gin. The advertisement is obnoxious from the point of view of Italy , our respected and honourable ally, aud obnoxious al?o because of its use of the Union Jack. Advertisements of this kind are all over the country. Their objectionable features are patent to any one who - cares to take notice of them. If honourable members, when travelling in trainsor trams, will watch the hoardings as. I have been doing lately, they will be amazed at the enormous number of goods that are advertised under cover of the flag and other national emblems. This practice is purely an exploitation of symbols which ought to be held to some extent sacred. They are used now for purposes of personal aggrandisement and cash results, in order to parade the "" loyalty and zeal "" of the advertisers, to use the phrase of the Acting Prime Minister,, or to cover up any suspicion that the goods are not of local or British origin. In the streets one can see over shop, doors and in shop windows all sorts of advertisements of that kind, which are not there to, exhibit any genuine affection, or regard, or respect for these emblems, but purely for the purpose of attracting business, and for ulterior and sordid motives. I do not know whether this is the right place to insert a provision in the law against that kind of thing, but it is the only place that offers any opportunity for it so far as I have been able to see. I move this amendment now in relation to the Union Jack, or any ensign or standard of the United Kingdom. Later on I propose to move for the application of the same prohibition to the use of the emblems and seals of the Commonwealth - Mr GROOM (Darling Downs-Minister for Works and Railways) [12.9] - I .cannot see my way to accept the amendment. Th© object of the Bill is to amend the Trade Marks Act, which deals with the question of the registration of trade marks. The effect of registration in general is to give the individual a proprietary - right in a particular for m of trade mark. Section IS of the Act of 1905-1912 empowers the Registrar to refuse to register a trade mark containing "" any representation of the Royal Arms, or Royal Crests, or arms or crests so nearly resembling them as to be likely to lead to mistake, or of the Royal Crowns, or of the British National flags."" They cannot be the subject of a trade mark. The same thing applies to ""any representation of the arms, flag, or seal of the Commonwealth, or of any State, or any representation of the arms of any foreign State or country."" Those are not allowed to be made the subjects of a particular monopoly. But, according to Halsbury's Laws of England, "" the Union Jack may be flown on land by every citizen of the Empire, as well as on Government buildings."" The use of the flag is the right not only of the Government of the nation, but of every citizen of the British Empire. The honourable member seeks to prohibit the use of the flag i h connection with business. I must confess I sympathize with a good deal that he says, and that when I see certain deleterious articles taking cover - under the Union Jack I feel very much as he does. We must, however, look at the wider aspect of the question. The honourable member seeks to do something which is more than a mere matter of ithe law relating to trade marks. It relates to the carrying on of businesses, occupations, in dustries, or callings throughout the length and breadth of the Commonwealth.",29
93,Mr TUDOR,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,Is it not a fact that certain persons have the right to use these emblems on their bills or advertisements 1,30
94,Mr GROOM,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,"I do not know of any. I made inquiries regarding one particular firm which claimed some right to a coat-of-arms. I found that they had never registered it in Australia. The Registrar will not allow the registration of any of these emblems, so that no person can obtain a proprietary right in the use of a coatof-arms or a flag. Under the Constituti&n we have power to deal with trade marks, but trade and commerce is an entirely different matter. We are limited under the Constitution there, although we have unlimited power to deal with trade marks, as laid down by the Court in the Brewery Employees Case, 6 C.L.R., 49. The honourable member desires to prohibit the use of these flags in business as a general policy on the ground that they are used for moneymaking purposes. It is fair and legitimate to encourage in the community a sense of patriotism in regard to articles made in Australia. I cannot see anything wrong in that, nor can I see anything wrong in a business man flying the Union Jack over his business premises, but the honourable member's amendment would not allow that flag to be used in connection with any trade, business, or calling. I am not inclined to believe that it would be a proper thing to prohibit the use of the Union Jack in connection with any business, calling, or profession. It would be an anomaly to prohibit the use of the Australian flag in that way, and at the same time to allow the United States flag or the Erench flag to be used in connection with a business by way of appeal to the people. If our flag were prohibited, we could not have competition. There would have to be a general prohibition, or otherwise our own people would be p ut at a disadvantage by being unable to use' our flag for the enoouragement of our own trade and commerce, the fostering of our own industries, and the promotion of a national sentiment for the consumption of our own goods. I frankly admit, although I want to see Australian goods used and consumed throughout Australia, that I am not much in sympathy with the use and consumption of the specific articles which the honourable member mentioned.",30
95,Mr FINLAYSON,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,I made no discrimination in regard to the articles.,30
96,Mr GROOM,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,"No ; but the honourable member quoted certain articles regarding which I know he has very strong opinions. I thought, in what I said, that I was paying a tribute to the honourable member's just advocacy of reform. Looking at the subject as a whole, I cannot see my way to accept the amendment.",30
97,Mr FINLAYSON,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,"Brisbane) [12.15]. The strength of my case is proved by the weakness of the Minister's reply. Let me briefly point out where I think his case absolutely fails. The honourable gentleman said that every citizen is entitled to fly the Union Jack. That is not denied; nor is it my proposal to limit that right. There is, however, a great difference between a citizen flying the flag and using it as part of a trade advertisement. The Minister (Mr Groom) points out that the Bill provides that the Royal Arms shall not be used in connection with any trade, business, or calling. That is exactly the limitation I wish to apply to the use of the flag. It is foolish and futile to argue that because a citizen flies the Union Jack over his business premises he is using it in connection with his business, trade, or calling. A doctor, for instance, flies the Union Jack over his chambers or residence, not as an advertisement, but with a perfectly legitimate and proper desire to exhibit his loyalty on a particular occasion. My amendment does not propose to interfere with anything of that kind. The Minister's contention that the right of every citizen to fly the flag is unlimited is recognised in my amendment, which conforms to the principle laid down in this clause, that no person shall have the right, without the authority of the King or other authority set out, to display or use the Royal Arms in connection with any trade, business, calling, or profession. That is a proper and reasonable limitation, which should be extended to the flying of the flag. There are some business places which exhibit the Royal Arms by Royal Warrant.",30
98,Mr MCDONALD,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,Bot h the Age the Argus display the Royal Arms on their title page.,31
99,Mr FINLAYSON,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,"Quite so. The reasonable interpretation of this clause is that the Royal Arms shall not be used in connection with a trade, business, or profession as an attempt to advertise. I am merely asking the Committee in this case to subject the use of the Union Jack, and in a later case the Australian flag, to the same limitation. All that the amendment provides is that neither the Union Jack nor any representation of the standards of the United Kingndom shall be used to assist in advertising any business, or identifying it with the flag. It is the association of the flag with a business advertisement to which I object.",31
100,Mr FOWLER,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,"Perth) [12.20]-Hav ing listened carefully to the objection raised by the Minister in charge of the Bill (Mr Groom), I am still of opinion that there is no good reason why the amendment should not be accepted. The Minister suggests that the use of the Australian flag in connection with the advertising of Australian productions is quite unobjectionable. My desire is that Australian productions shall be as well advertised as possible, but the fact that goods are of Australian origin can be manifested other than by putting our flag in close association with an advertisement relating to them. If everybody adopted that method of advertising their goods, it would come to be somewhat ridiculous. Apart from that point, there is good reason why wo should have a little reverence and respect for such emblems as the Union Jack and the Australian flag. We are beginning to understand their importance and value, in the conception that they give to the rising generation, of the country and the Empire to which they belong. We have the flag raised in our school grounds for the children to salute, and it is indicated to them that they should treat the flag, not as some fetish, but as representing that for which it undoubtedly stands. Many a time, during the war, when passing through our railway stations, my indignation was roused at the sight of the glorious Union Jack, no doubt perfectly drawn and magnificently coloured, but draped over something with which it ought not to be associated. I have known cases in which and people who were justly suspected of disloyalty during the war hastened to make an indication of loyalty in connection with some of their goods by plastering them with loyal emblems of this kind. In order that our children may have a proper conception of the honour that is due to these emblems for what they indicate, we ought to prevent the miscellaneous and degrading use which is being made of them in connection with the ordinary methods of trade advertising.",31
101,Mr FENTON,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,"Maribyrnong) [12.25]. - I urge the Minister (Mr Groom) to accept the amendment. The burden of his reply to the honourable member for Brisbane (MT.

There is no reason why they should not use ment) be so inserted-put . .the map of Australia instead .of the Ausmittee divided. tralian flag, to indicate ithat their goods are made in this .country..

Is it to be denied the right to use that emblem 1",32
104,Mr GROOM,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,"It is not a .trade or ness, but a patriotic association. Mr Fenton. - That is so. I see difference between the use of the Royal A r m s and the use of the Union Jack or the Australian flag in these ways. The great bulk of the people regard these emblems as something to cherish and adthere mire, because of all they represent. The 'boys and girls in our State schools - the flag when it is run aloft, and have Australian sentimentf or it . On their way to and from school, however, they may see in a bottle-gatherer's truck all sorts of bottles labelled with the Ausgard tralian flag or the Union Jack. are given temperance lessons at school, highest respeet yet they may see the Australian flag on beer bottles. The use of the flag in nexion with various trade advertisements is calculated to lower the sentiment - attaching to it .

That after the word ""-deceive,"" line 24, the words ""or any ensign or flag of the Combusimonwealth of Australia, or any adaptation thereof,"" be inserted. no If honourable members approve of the provision in the Bill which stipulates that the Australian coat-of-.arms shall not be used in connection with any business, trade, calling, or profession, why should be any objection to the prohibition of the use of the Australian flag in the salute same category ? The argument used by an the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) is very apposite-that it is impossible to keep active in the minds of the rising generation a respect .and ref o r national emblems if , while, on They the one hand, they are held up to the - and regard, on the other ""hand, and in juxtaposition, they ane to be confound employed in a humiliating and degrading way. Section 19 of the Act provides that no trade mark shall be registered containing representations of the Royal Arms or of the national flag of the that United Kingdom, or of the flag of the to 'Commonwealth, .and so forth , and section 113 is much wider in its scope, inasmuch as it prohibits the use of coats-of-arms in connection with any 'business. And this is whene the weakness of the argument of the Minister (Mr Groom) is displayed, for all that he claims in support of the present provisions of the measure can be equally advanced in support of the prohibition of the use of the national flag in any business, trade, profession, or calling. To me, the Australian flag is the best in the world.",32
106,Mr BAMFORD,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,"Does the honourable member turn down the red flag? Mr FINLAYSON,-That is in a different category. I am' speaking tional flags. The red flag is not a nat&omal flag. The mere fact that the Australian national flag embodies Union Jack, .and is symbolic of the Fedewas ration, invests it in our minds with sacredness. Every honourable member who voted against the last amendment clared that he had no objection to the of the Union Jack as a cover bottle, a wrapper for soap, or packets of starch, or anything under the sun. We carry the Union Jack to the top of the flag-pole, and regard it as someUnion. thing demanding our utmost loyalty and devotion, and yet we permit it to be used anywhere and by any pany one for most degrading, humiliating, and despicable purposes. No limit placed upon the use of the Union Jack by any citizen; 'but I now ask that limit should be placed upon the use of the Australian flag.

We could readily prohibit the use of it in business, same timefix;a time limit for the use of the Union Jack in connection with any business. We have already provided the use of the Royal Coat-of-Arms shall be prohibited. In future the Melbourne newsthat papers wall be prevented from having British coat of arms on their front pages.

This is making an entirely mischievous and unfair use of a purely technical certificate as an advertisement to their prospective customers of the purity of their whisky. If there is any reason at all to be urged for the prohibitions which the Minister (Mr . Groom) has already accepted as part of the Bill in regard to coats-of-arms-if there is any justification for the prohibition, as a trade mark, of any duplication of coats-of-arms, flags, emblems, and portraits of sovereigns, surely there is much stronger reason in the case of a Customs seal, which, so far as I can discover, gives no guarantee of p u r it y or otherwise. I do not know whether any other firm uses Customs certificates in a similar way or for a similar purpose. For all I know they may be used for starch, blue, soap, or kerosene; but I pin the Minister down to this concrete illustration of the objections I am offering to their use in an effort to secure business. Such a use of public documents seems to me to carry its own condemnation, because the public are not so much concerned about the relations between the manufacturers of products and the Customs Department as they are about the purity of the article supplied. The purity of an article is not based on a Customs certificate unless the Customs analyst makes a specific inquiry and issues a guarantee, or otherwise, of purity.",34
126,Mr TTJDOB,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,The certificates should not be used in this way without authority.,35
127,Mr FINLAYSON,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,"That is the whole point of the objection. Advertisers have no right to use these seals and certificates for ulterior purposes-for advertising their products; otherwise what is to hinder any firm demanding that their goods shall be analyzed, and using the certificates for the purpose of misleading the public? There is another thing to which I take exception. Under the present restricted Commonwealth powers, articles can be introduced, and are being introduced, into this country with certain reservations in order to protect the public against the purchase of articles that are not according to label. But immediately such goods are admitted through the Customs, they may be put in circulation in this country with any label, or with any admixture, that the importing firm may choose to adopt. The Customs Department deals with the importation into Australia, but after the goods are imported the Customs label is valueless, and the Commonwealth has no authority t'o protect the public against admixtures or the misuse of Customs certificates. Foreign matter may be introduced into goods that is quite destructive of the protection the Customs proposes to give. I hope the Minister will recognise that, so far as this whisky is concerned, there is no reason why the public should not be protected. The protection of the public is, or ought to be, our main consideration in regard to trade marks and the purity of articles supplied under trade marks and certificates. I have not had an opportunity to consult with the Minister as to his views, and I should be glad to know whether he thinks protection can be extended to the public in the way I suggest.",35
128,Mr GROOM,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,"Darling Downs-Minister for Works and Railways) [2.25] - There are difficulties in what the honourable member (Mr Finlayson) proposes to do. We are dealing in this amending Bill with trade marks, and the desire, of course, is to confine the operations of the measure to the law relating to trade marks. Now, however, the honourable member is bringing in another general 'branch of substantive law-that is, the use of certificates, seals, and stamps, which is outside the general scope of trade marks legislation. He is really putting up a case for the regulation of the use of stamps, certificates, seals, and so for th by the Customs Department in the administration of its various branches; and it is rather in a measure dealing with that administration that such an amendment should be inserted. The object of a Trade Marks Bill is, generally speaking, to lay down the conditions under which a person may acquire the right to a trade mark, and to prescribe the law by which that proprietary Tight may be preserved. In the circumstances, I cannot accept the amendment. A Government certificate or seal is quite a different thing from an ordinary trade mark. A trade mark is, generally, some distinctive mark applied to the goods, and a certificate is not that. These certificates are used by the Department in connection with different articles on which they are required to certify as to quarlity. In the Spirits Act of 1905-7, for instance, it is provided: (1) An officer may at the request of the distiller or blender of any spirits give a certificate in the prescribed form certifying that the spirits are "" Pure Australian standard brandy "" or ""Australian blended brandy,"" or ""Australian standard malt whisky,"" or ""Australian blended whisky,' or "" Australian standard rum,"" as the case requires. (2) When an officer has given a certificate that any spirits are "" pure Australian standard brandy,"" or ""Australian blended brandy,"" or ""Australian standard malt whisky,"" or ""Australian blended whisky,"" or ""Australian standard rum,"" he may, at the request of the owner of the spirits, mark or cause to be marked, the description of the spirits on the cask or vessel containing them,, together with a prescribed stamp or seal, or, if the spirits are in bottles, place a label or seal the prescribed manner. Tne law requires tliese certificates to be used by the Department for the protection of the public, and the advertisement to which reference has been made is an advertisement of the provisions required by law. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor), who was Minister for Trade and Customs for some time, must be quite familiar with the procedure.",35
129,Mr TUDOH,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,"I am in favour of the amendment, so as to stop firms doing what has been described.",36
130,Mr GROOM,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,"Does the honourable member wish to repeal the provisions of the Spirits Act? - Mr TUDOR - I do not wish to repeal the provisions of the Spirits Act, but I do not desire advertisers to beable to use the Government stamp as a guarantee.",36
131,Mr GROOM,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,The very object of the Act is to secure pure spirits in the protection of the public interest.,36
132,Mr TUDOR,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,Spirit s cannot be sold - unless they are pure.,36
133,Mr GROOM,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,"But a guarantee to the public is desired. I do not wish to raise any technical objection, but the amendment ought to be made in' some other measure.",36
134,Mr TUDOR,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,"Are you going to bring in legislation subsequently, in which it will be included?.",36
135,Mr GROOM,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,I did not say so. The proper place to deal with this matter is the Spirits Act. If the honourable member objects to the certificates being granted,36
136,Mr FOTLAYSON,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,That amendment.,36
137,Mr GROOM,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,That is the effect of. it . Mr EisxAYSOsr - It does not affect the certificates in the slightest degree. simply says they shall not use those certificates for advertising purposes.,36
138,Mr GROOM,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,The Tradte Marks Act is not the proper place to insert a law relating to advertising.,36
139,Mr TUDOR,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,"Wheneve r any amendj ment is proposed, it is somehow never right to put it into the particular Bill which the Minister has before us.",36
140,Mr GROOM,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,"That is not correct. I did not take that attitude with regard to an amendment put forward by the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Finlayson) this morning. If the law requires thereon in that, before an article is put on the market, a certificate of a particular kind must be obtained, what is wrong with the man advertising the fact that he has that certificate when he is selling his goods? When we make a provision to safeguard the public health, and issue certain certificates, surely the man who sells the goods is entitled to the benefit accruing to him if he fulfils the prescribed conditions?",36
141,Mr TUDOR,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,"Yarra) [2.34] - The British Stamp Act provides that patent medicines sola for Is. shall bear a l ^ d . duty stamp, and those .sold for higher prices up to 2s. 6d., a 3d. duty stamp. On those stamps the following words are distinctly printed, "" This stamp implies no Government guarantee.""",36
142,Mr GREENB,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,But ours does.,36
143,Mr TUDOR,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,"Firm s who advertise that they have received a Government guarantee lead the public to believe that 1 the stuff sold by other people is not pure. It should be remembered that, if they comply with the Spirits Act, the whole of the goods have to be pure. It was found in England that the Government duty stamp was used by patent medicine proprietors to delude the public into the belief that their nostrums were guaranteed by the Government. That is shown by the report of a recent British Commission on patent medicines. On page 95 of the. report on Secret Remedies, presented ta this Parliament in 1912, it is stated that in England, in the year 1908, no fewer than 33,037,202. patent medicines bore 1-Jd. duty stamps, and the price paid by the public fox those preparations, at is not my Is. and upwards,, was £1,858,000. I do not say that they were all worthless, but it certainly wasfound that, through the Government applying an Inland Revenue It duty stamp to them, the proprietors conveyed to the public the impression that there was a Government guarantee attached to them. In our Spirits Act there is a provision that the spirits must be two years old before they are sold. They must be aged in the wood for that time. Mr Lloyd George, in the House of Commons, said that the provision in our Act was a good one. The Government certificate showing that the spirits have been kept in the wood fortwoyears is, however, no guarantee of quality or purity. The amendment of the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Finlayson) commends itself to me, because we can and should give no guarantee.",36
144,Mr MASSYGREENE,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,"But we do. not put the guarantee on unless the spirit had been in the wood for two years. - Mr TUDOR - A man might come forward with some patent pills, composed of soap and other ingredients, each of which was pure of its kind, but the Government could not give a guarantee that those pills would have no h a r m f u l effects. I trust the amendment will be carried, so that these people will be unable to employ a Government guarantee, which was never intended, when the Spirits Act was passed, to be used in that way, for private advertising purposes.",37
145,Mr MASSYGREENE,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,We cannot amend the Spirits Act in a Trade Marks Bill - move,37
146,Mr TUDOR,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,I am quite aware of that.,37
147,Mr GROOM,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,"What you want to enact is, in effect, that no matter what certificate is issued under the provisions of an Act of Parliament, it shall not be used for advertising purposes?",37
148,Mr TUDOR,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,"That would be fair . Spirits receiving the certificate may be afterwards bottled by some other firm, who could not p r in t the certificate on the bottles'.",37
149,Mr GROOM,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,"If the law entitles a man to get a certificate of purity for his article, surely he is entitled to let his customers know that..",37
150,Mr TUDOR,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,"If the spirits went out in bulk from that particular firm, and the duty was paid on them, the Customs Department would, have no further control over them. An y person bottling, them afterwards could not attach the same label or certificate of purity to them, although they were exactly the same spirits.

151,Mr MASSYGREENE,LAN D AN D INCOME TA X,"Bichmond-Minister for Tradeand Customs) [2.46] - I That this Bill be now read a second time. The consideration of this measure should not engage the attention of the House for many minutes. It is very simple, and purports to deal 'only with damage to lighthouses and marine marks. It provides that any person who damages or destroys any marine mark or lighthouse shall be liable to pay the Commonwealth the cost of repairing or replacing the lighthouse or marine mark, unless he can pTove that the damage or destruction was not caused through w i l f u l negligence, misconduct, or want of skill. Where such damage is the result of accident, and not due to negligence on the part of the person controlling the navigation of the vessel causing, the damage, then the damage is not payable by the owner of the ship. It is. also provided that notice of the damage is to be given within fortyeight hours to the Collector of Customs at the nearest port by the person causing it . The penalty for failure to report the occurrence is £ 1 0 0 . amendment) The Commonwealth Government have The Com- recently placed around 'the coast in the vicinity of the Northern Territory a large 8- number of floating buoys, and if any of . . 2 0 these buoys are damaged or destroyed it is essential that the matter should be im12 mediately reported so that steps may be AYES. taken at once to repair or' replace them. It. is becoming the practice of the masters of a number of luggers trading along the north coast of Australia, when the wind falls, and the tide is running in a direction opposite to that which they wish to take, to tie up to one of these buoys. Sometimes a buoy is thus carried away. It is most essential that if a buoy is dragged fro m its moorings or damaged in any way, the fact should be immediately reported, so that the danger to navigation caused thereby may be remedied at the earliest possible moment. These are the only matters with which the Bill deals. It has already passed through another place, and I hope that honourable members will consent to its passage as speedily as Possible, so that it may quickly become law. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time, reported from Committee without amendment, and, on suspension of Standing Orders, passed through its remaining stages. NA INDUSTRY BILL . SECOND READING . Debate resumed from 20th August (vide page 11748), on motion by Mr . GROOMThat this Bill be now read a second time. Upon which Mr TUDOR had moved by way of amendment That the following words be inserted after the word ""That"":-""befor e introducing a Bill to establish a Bureau of Science and Industry, the Government should have furnished the House with an estimate of the approximate cost per annum of such an institution; and on the question of butter control. should have also made preliminary arrangeCommonwealth ments with the State Governments to avoid duplicating the existing State Bureaux or work at present carried on by them.""",37
152,Mr RODGERS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Wannon) [2.52] When this Bill was last before the we had the benefit of a concentrated destaff bate upon it but the time which' has since elapsed, and the return to Australia of the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), is practically the designer of the Institute, will somewhat alter, I hope, the future trend of the discussion. Honourable members on all sides of House, whether they are ardent supand porters of this measure or not, regret death of that eminent man. Dr Gellatly, who, as the Prime Minister has anter nounced, had, as Director, set his heart on the work of this Institute, and whose loss is indeed a very serious one the Institute at its advent as well as the nation. I was hopeful that upon the resumption of this debate we might have had a contribution to it from the Prime Minister himself. The right honourable gentleman could enlighten the House and the country as to what really is the scheme to be undertaken by what I might describe as those three harnessing Departments-the Board of Trade, the Department of Commerce""and Industry, and the Institute of Science and Industry. Can the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Groom) say whether the Prime Minister proposes to speak?",38
153,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,I do not know.,38
154,Mr RODGERS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I hope that he in tends to do so, because in every political party and every Legislature, as well as on the part of the general public, there is today an absolute conviction that we must discontinue the duplication of political effort. The superimposing of Department on Department is something which the country will no longer tolerate. When speaking to this motion on a previous occasion I said I had hoped that the Government would be able to tell us that it was bringing forward a pre-determined plan of co-operation between the Commonwealth and the States, each governmental agency having defined the scope of its operations so that one would not be walking upon the heels of the other in relation to every subject to be dealt with by the Institute. We have had a sharp conflict quite recently between the Commonwealth and the States The seeks to place a veto on and to exercise a limited form of control over the Commonwealth's entire output of butter. The State of Victoria has had in operation for many years its own DeHouse partment, with its own machinery and of experts and directors, with herdtesting branches, and, in fact, all the most modern devices, to put the dairying who industry on a good footing. The control of the sale of the surplus butter of the States is something to which the Commonwealth' aspires, and there is a sharp the division of opinion between the Federal State Governments on that point. I the was hopeful that since the adjournment of the debate on this measure the Miniswould have 'had an opportunity to confer with the State Ministers and Departments of Agriculture with the object to of ascertaining whether or not definite to fields of operation can be arranged. It is no pleasure to me to' play the part of critic.",38
155,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"As each particular in vestigation is taken up arrangements will be made. I have already explained the lines on which, that course is to be followed.",39
156,Mr RODGERS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,I know that the Minister in introducing the Bill outlined what he thought were the desirable lines of co-operation.,39
157,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,In a second speech' I in dicated the actual lines on which we are now working. I referred to the action we were taking in regard to the eradication of the prickly pear and other pests.,39
158,Mr RODGERS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I have before me the "" Programme of Works of the United States of America Department of A g r i culture,"" which in a clear and definite statement covers everything pertaining to the agricultural world. In the United States of America nothing is left to chance.",39
159,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,The honourable member realizes that that is the programme of a Department that has been in existence for very many years.,39
160,Mr RODGERS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Yes ; but I propose to show how the United States of America Department sets to work in a keen, business way. Instead of giving the directors of the Department a roving commission to inquire into everything, from the cause of a lump on an elephanPs knee to the best means of dealing with the prickly pear, it deals specifically in its programme with every one of the diseases common to the animal and plant life of the country. First of all , we have set out in the programme each disease, its origin, its investigation, and the cost of investigation. The Department is limited each' year to a definite expenditure and a defined field of organization. It has a settled business policy, as clear and distinct as that of any business enterprise in this city. From one end to the other it follows business lines. The object of my remarks is not to disparage in the slightest degree the value of scientific research or demonstration, or education resulting from, that investigation. I will not have it put in my lips by the Department, or by any Minister, that I desire to impede or restrict investigation. What I ask is that, as the question of finance is the most serious factor confronting us today, there should be some limitation in regard to the financial provision for scientific investigation, and that the two fields of operation-Commonwealth - and States-shoul d be distinctly defined, in order to avoid duplication of expenditure and duplication of staffs. We should not have State directors and Commonwealth directors, State supervisors and Commonwealth supervisors, or State demonstrators and experts as well as Commonwealth demonstrators and experts. In other words, we ought not to have two big staffs investigating the same subjects.  able member to talk in this way when he proposes to vote for the Bill .",39
161,Mr RODGERS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I suppose that the honourable member will do exactly the same.  the Bill , because I regard it as a proposal to rob the taxpayers.",39
162,Mr RODGERS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I am hopeful that the effect of my remarks will be to prevent the Ministry giving a blank cheque to a Board of Directors. Of course, a Minister will be in ultimate control, but he will not be an expert in every branch in which scientific research may be carried on, and will not feel that he is able to say that this or that expenditure is not justified. Therefore, the whole of this work of investigation will be controlled by an outside body of men, who, while possibly they may be gentlemen of the keenest intellects, will more than likely be quite unaccustomed to the expenditure of public money. I do not say that they will be unbusiness-like; I would not so designate professors in a young community; but, at the same time, I contend that we are not likely to get.the best financial results from the expenditure of public money when the full con* trol rests with a body of men with professorial minds. The object of my remarks, which may be resented by the authors of the Bill , is that we should set out upon this undertaking on more definite business-like lines. The linking up of science and industry with the everyday affairs of the country is a most desirable object; but, at a time like this, when the burden of finance is pressing so heavily, it is m y clear duty to see that we do not employ two people to perform one job. Personally, I am not very keen upon the Talue that Australia will derive in the early stages of the proposed Insti tute from the application of science to secondary industries, in. regard to which we are still an infant nation. The facturing world is comprised of very astute people, who are keen in watching for the invention of mechanical devices to cheapen their output, while in adopting new methods of manufacturing or marketing, they are ten times .as keen university professors would be. I not a tittle of faith that aaiy public partment can in this respect take the place of captains of industry. I have faith in .any professorial mind, or any individual in a State Department, having that keen sharp edge which the captain of industry displays, because the iatter is a man who, by contact with the incesyears, sant competition of the whole world, is population. thoroughly trained in the application of modern scientific methods to business. There is an immense field for scientific - investigation and research and for the practical application of science. I Australia, for a quarter of a century past, we have been applying artito ficial devices to the growing of cereals, and the manurial system has achieved wonderful results; but the application scientific methods .to the growing herbs and grasses has not yet been atwithout tempted, except in a few isolated cases, where wonderful results have been tained. Australia 'has not yet tackled problem .of doubling the grass supply. remember laying down in this House doctrine of  MT. RODGERS - Yes , where one grew before. I am just as keen a believer in it today. The United States of America depends upon the agriAfiteT cultural effort of the nation for carrying of her great flocks and herds. - On the other hand, Australia depends entirely upon nature. We are fortunate in having a small population to susinto tain, .and a wonderful climate; but devastation exists in Queensland and New South Wales at the present time as the result of a total reliance upon nature. I know from my own experience, and is from some of the large pastoral firms, that .there are grand old families in either State just on the verge of ruin. We have no Department of Animal Husa bandry attached to any State Agriculfor tural Department. It is quite a new field of operations for Australia. At the basis of such' a Department is stock feeding I am hopeful that, as the outcome of the manuacquisition of Nauru Island and other discoveries now being tested, we shall be able to produce in Australia a cheap manurial treatment for our grasses. It would mean a new era for our wetter and - coastal areas. For a quarter of a cenas tury we have been able to apply have manurial treatment to the growth of Decereals, and now the time haa come when people, instead of reaching out all over no the map for new areas, should set to work to fertilize the existing grasses and plant additional grasses, in this way giving the country a carrying capacity that would enable it, in good years or in bad to support ten times its present",39
163,Mr LYNCH,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Werriwa) [3.10] As a primary producer, I feel confident that the efforts of the Government .to establish an Institute of Science and In n dustry have not been put forward before fchey were required. We may differ as the constitution of the proposed body, but, having consideration for the needs of our people and our country, we canof not afford to remain idle and allow the of old systems and standards to continue making, at least, some '.attempt at .progress. I am in sympathy with obmuch that the honourable member for the Wannon (Mr Rodgers) has said about I the problem of making two blades of the grass grow where formerly only one flourished.  same problem in regard to wheat.",40
164,Mr LYNCH,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"We have had to face similar problems in other directions. thirty years' experience on the the land, I have come to the conclusionstarting with no capital-yo u can only take out of the soil in proportion to the amount of labour and capital you put it, sensibly directed. The greatest hardship to which farmers and graziers are subjected arises from the fact that, so far, they have not been able to take full advantage of their opportunities. There .great need for an Institute such as that proposed, not only for the purpose of pointing the guiding finger of science to better processes and systems and to higher standard of .education, but also the purpose of bringing forcibly home - to us the necessities of our position. To the latter my attention 'has been drawn by - a publication issued by Mr Richardson, the Director .of Agriculture in Victoria. He gives a very interesting comparison between the State of Kansas and the State of Victoria, and points to a moral we cannot possibly avoid. He shows that a real comparison may be made 'between the two States:- Kansas.

The climate of western Kansas is even drier and more uncertain than that of north-western Vicimmense toria. Yet Kansas produces, approximately, six times as much wheat, several hundred times more maize, five times as much oats, three times as much hay, and raises 1,500,000 acres of dry-land crops-suc h as grain sorghums-as well as being far ahead in live-stock, save sheep. Every bushel per added to Victoria's wheat yield would mean at least £500,000 increase in annual income. We cannot ignore those facts. While other countries are not producing as much as ultimately they will do, yet have estabor lished means and methods by which the generations of farmers, as they each other, will be infinitely better fitted by education and other aids to produce more, are we, because of a cry economy, to refuse to give effect to means and methods which will enable us to do what those other countries have done, and even to surpass reliable their efforts ? . It is our proud that Australian soldiers and workfrom men, and even statesmen, are second none in the Empire, and aTe we to lag behind for ever in the matter of tion - and scientific training ?

165,Mr ELEMING,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,Our natural facilities for production are second to none in any part of the world.,41
166,Mr LYNCH,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"That is so.

Those who go upon the land today must operate smaller areas, educaand they must have those advantages with, which can be given only by higher .dethe velopmental systems 'being placed within their reach. The Government are to be commended for this forward movement, and no cry for economy and retrenchment ought to be allowed to deprive us of the benefits which would come to us from the initiation ancl teaching of methods of in creased production.",41
167,Mr RODGERS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,Is not the member merely generalizing on that point? The States are already undertaking investigations.,42

171,Mr RODGERS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,It is the things that the practical men have discovered that have enriched Australia.,42
172,Mr LYNCH,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"We are forever treated to the old argument about what the practical man has done. I willingl y admit that it is the rough miner who discovers the diamond, but it is the capable lapidary who, by cutting and polishing, displays the gem in all its beauty. The greatest disadvantage of majority of country towns and districts throughout Australia is the lack of an adequate water supply. In that respect we have progressed no further than the aboriginal with his water hole. the hole is dry, we are without a water supply.",42
173,Mr FLEMING,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,Did ever an aboriginal sink an artesian bore?,42
174,Mr LYNCH,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"It is true that huge schemes for artesian boring are being launched in New South Wales, and I hope that they will prove a practical success, but with other schemes they in volve the expenditure of millions of pounds, and the question arises as to whether these works should be carried out and maintained at the cost of the National Government, or by municipal enterprise. The water must be found, and when honourable members realise that with a 24-inch rainfal l sufficient water falls in twelve months on 60 acres to provide an adequate supply of water for a population of 3,000, but that science has not yet developed a means of conserving that supply, they will realise how great is the scope for research and inquiry, even in that field. We have a thousand and one problems to solve in regard to honourable the discovery and mining of minerals, and processes for the development of our primary and secondary industries. We must tackle those tasks. All the resources that the best brains and intelligence in Australia can produce to help us to realise our economic destiny ought to be fostered. The Government did not bring forward this proposal for the establishment of an Institute of Science and Industry merely for the purpose of finding, as some persons hint, f at jobs for certain individuals. They are alive to the necessities of the position created by the war. They are anxious to get out of the old r u t . We have the alternative of getting out or going under. I see nothing in this scheme to prevent full co-operation with the States.",42
175,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"On the contrary, the Bill is specially drafted to secure such cooperation.  submerge the States.",42
176,Mr LYNCH,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"And it is not the object of the Labour party to wipe the State authorities out of existence ?  member know that? the Mr LYNCH - I have not much authority for my statement; I have only the words uttered by honourable members opposite on the public platform. v The only real obstacle I encounWhen tered in my effort to become an independent land user was the fact that I was hampered by my own ignorance of up-to-date methods and conditions by which I could improve the revenue producing capacity of my holding. Every man upon the land is hampered in much the same way. There are difficulties to be contended with in respect of which n'o help is afforded in any way. We are required to experiment on our own to a large extent, and whilst no man in this House is more sensible than I am of what hae been achieved by the practical man, yet I realise that, after all, science is, in its highest expression, the channel by which truth can be best expressed in practice, and that, without its finger pointing the way, much of our effort is misdirected, and therefore wasted. Whilst this measure has been own. attacked, and doubtless will be attacked, because it opens up a new avenue of expenditure, I say that such expendino ture is warranted, and even though fifty failures were to result from the investiof gations, the country would be more than repaid for all its disbursements by one success. Above all, what we cannot afford to do' at this stage is to sit still, without attempting to improve the old methods that will serve us no longer.",42
177,Mr FOWLER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Perth) [3.30] - The consideration that weighs most with at the present time in regard to a quesdispense tion of this kind is that of ways and means. This country is undoubtedly i need of many things, but one of the most crying of all is economy in Federal ministration; and there is very considerof able ground to be covered in connection with work of this kind. The financial position of Australia will be a very carious one for some years to come; and in this connection. there can be no justification whatever for launching out into new methods of exancl penditure unless we can see a compeni sating return. There is a great deal of talk about the advantages of science applied to production, and no one here will dispute those advantages. We all anxious to see the most scientific up-to-date methods applied to production generally throughout Australia. We find that, not only in Australia, but throughhave out the world, people are more and more turning their minds to the utilization brain power, where previously brute force and "" rule-of-thumb "" existed. But we that knowledge. must be careful that, in our desire further scientific production, we are merely imitating other countries in feeble and ineffective manner. We Australia can spend a very considerable in those colleges. amount of money on a Department of this kind, which may only be following up work that is being done in other parts of the world. When I say "" f o l l o w up,"" I mean practically following in footsteps of those who have already made discoveries. In the United States America magnificent work is undoubtedly being done in connection with the applisome cation of science to industry, particularly rural industry. A great deal of that work can be of immediate advantage to this country, and, indeed, has already had been steadily declining. been of considerable benefit. The ditions in some parts of the United States of America very closely resemble our",43
178,Mr FLEMI NG,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,The soil does not.,43
179,Mr FOWLER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I should say there is very material difference between the soil of some portions of the United States America, and the soil of Australia. If we have the same geological conditions, we have pretty well the same soil, modified, perhaps, to some extent, by local conditions. But my point is that, generally speaking, a considerable amount of the work in the United States of America is of immediate advantage to a country me like Australia; and, therefore, we may with scientific investigation which is being better done in that counn try than we can possibly do it here. I am speaking now of the amount of money adand energy that can be applied, and also the probability that in the United States of America there is a greater field of ability, though I do not for a moment prewish to disparage the Australian intellect There is a good deal of misconception misapplied argument in this House n regard to scientific production, and we have had two instances of that this afteras noon. The honourable member for Werri wa (Mr Lynch) and the honourable memare ber for Wannon (Mr Rodgers) both and spoke' of the advantage of applying science to rural industry; but they missed the point that, as a matter of fact, we already all the scientific knowledge that is required to make a tremendous of advance in rural production. Our real trouble is that our people will not apply The agricultural colto leges are undoubtedly doing good work; not and we are very far behind in regard a to the attention that ought to be given in to agricultural production and training In this country it is not a matter of discovering or of making scientific advance, but of applying the scientific knowi ng ledge which is the common - property of the the world. Take the matter of grasses. There is undoubtedly great necessity for of the improvement of our pastures, which have been grossly neglected. I remember years ago, in the Western District, talking to a squatter with a very fine run, who was lamenting the fact that for years the production and quality of his grass This he concould not understand, and I said to him, "" I suppose you send a considerable quantity of wool and mutton from this tion every year?"" and he replied in the affirmative. "" That means,"" I said, '' taking much out of the ground; how much are you putting back into the ground ?"" He agreed that it meant taking much out of the ground, but he stared at my suggestion about putting something back again. The idea had never occurred to him that the sheep were extracting fro m the ground something that it was his duty to replace in some shape or form,, and that he could not expect to continue to be successful unless he book some steps in that direction. In Great Britain , the artificial of pastures is one of the most important factors in rural production. It may surprise many honourable members to learn the amount of money an up-to-date farmer in that country will spend in enriching grass pastures; There is nothing required in Australia im the way of discovery in regard to that kind of work. The scientific needs and necessities of pastures have been known for many years; and it is only a matter of getting the people to apply the knowledge, and this Department of Science and Industry will not be successful in that. It is going to embark on a considerable amount of work of a scientific nature, but it is not going to do what we require, namely, educate the people up to the advantage and necessity of applying to production the scientific knowledge that is already the common property of the world. Those of us who look on this proposed Department as superfluous are regarded as being opponents of scientific ' production in Australia. It will take us many years here to reach the methods that are already being applied regularly in other parts of the world in regard to production. This is work that falls to the different States rather than to the Commonwealth, and it is work which undoubtedly some of the States are trying to do, but, in many instances, have failed lamentably.",43
180,Mr RODGERS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,Some people are doing such work privately.,44
181,Mr FOWLER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"No doubt, there are wise and capable men in Australia who spend themselves and their money in proving what can be done in this direction. The pretentious scheme we are considering will not help forward this class of work very much. Such a Department may make scientific discoveries, but those discoveries can be utilized only sta- when the common sense of the people has been properly educated to appreciate them. I say, without hesitation, that I could find the Government a dozen ways in which this minimum annual expenditure of £50, OCX}' could be utilized to more advantage in production. If we were to devote £50,000 to the improvement of the country postal services, there would be more increased production than we are going to realise from an equal annual expenditure on a Science and Industry Bureau in balf-a-dozen years. While we have demands for expenditure in these other directions of comparatively small feeding amounts, we have no right to spend money on such a scheme as is now before us. If we desire theoretical research, let us seek for it straight out ; let us subsidize the various universities where we can get scientific research equal to any in the world. As it is-, we are to have something that is neither scientific nor practical, and which w i ll create friction and duplication rather than efficiency. If we desire practical work in regard to scientific production, is it not a fact that the States are doing such work today ? Each works in its own particular sphere, taking note of its particular requirements, and employing the most capable men. We are often told about the pricklypear problem in Queensland, on which the people of that State have had their minds employed for some time. A great many people seem to imagine that by the application of science to some of those troubles in Australia, there is meant some kind of magic wand which has only to be waved to clear away all difficulties. We cannot expect the prickly pear, or any other pest, to be made to disappear in that way; but what we may expect is some method of profitably utilizing the pear. Such a method is already known, for the prickly pear could be so profitably utilized today as to be converted from a pest into a means of enrichment to the State.",44
182,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,What do you suggest?,44
183,Mr FOWLER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I understand, for in stance, that it can be utilized profitably in the production of industrial alcohol; and if the Government would only take the steps urged on a Federal Government many years ago by myself and others, to facilitate such production, it would prove of considerable benefit to Queensland.",44
184,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,You realise the great danger of the spread of the prickly pear over all the lands of the State?,44
185,Mr FOWLER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"There may be that danger, but if it is .made profitable to utilize the prickly pear in - the way suggested, people might as well 'grow the pear as 'something which does not give such a good return. I know the prickly pear is a serious pest in - Queensland, but, according to m y understanding of - the position, it has already been demonstrated that it may be utilized for the production of industrial 'alcohol.",45
186,Mr GROOM,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"On a commercial basis? MT . FOWLER - Yes . I am speaking purely from a practical point of view, I hope; it would be no use talking of utilizing the pear on any otiher basis. If that be so, JL suggest that, instead of curring a minimum expenditure of £50,000 a year on a Bureau of Science and Industry we offer a ibonus for the production <of industrial alcohol throughout Australia, at the same time releasing the industry from the restrictions that now hamper it . Then, probably, we should find the prickly pear regarded, not as a curse, but as a blessing.  Queensland.",45
187,Mr FOWLER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I know the honourable member and his friends regard such a - suggestibn as requiring a.considerable'amount of 'imaginative power, but these ""things have happened before today. The honourable member should give the Queensland 'Government the t i p to do this kind of work, and probably it - would 'be done. I come now to the one iclaim that is being made for this Department, that it will co-ordinate the work <of the various States. ""Co-ordination"" is a blessed and a useful word, and we hear it very often now. It sounds somewhat imposing, but it sometimes means very little. I could quite understand a bureau of a limited character doing some little good work in co-ordinating scientific production in the various States, but it requires the paradjourned. ticular man 'that we do not seem to have got up to the present time. I am vented by the sad death of the late head of the Department from saying much in that direction, but it has alwa,ys been a great surprise to me that one of the most capable and practical scientific men in the Commonwealth has been lef t - out of the composition of the Council of the Institute. I am referring to Mr Wilkinson, of the 'Commonwealth Laboratory, a man of the most remarkable gifts, of high scientific attainments, and of a thoroughly Balvia Castillo. practical nature as well. His work has been of considerable value to Australia in the ^past, iand none the less valuable because it has not been advertised as it should have been. I have known him for many years in connection with my work as ;a - member of Parliament, and can assure ithe House that we have not ,a more valuable official in the whole of the Commonwealth Service.",45
188,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"On one occasion some material which, I think, was ambergris, .was. found here, and 'he was the only man in Australia who could analyze it .",45
189,Mr FO WLER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Y e t his name does not appear on the Council of the Commonwealth Institute of Science aud Industry. It is one of the most emphatic condemnai n - tions possible of the whole scheme that such a gentleman is not taking a prominent part in the work. I have asked what is precisely meant by the term ""co-ordinating the work, "" and I can get no satisfaction. If a scientist in Queensland is doing certain work, and another in Western Australia doing work of a different kind, what is the necessity of co-ordinating them ? It is not an advantage to coordinate their work if they are engaged on different problems. If they are working o n the same problem there is no advasntape in a third person coming in between, talking now to the one and now to the other, and perhaps distracting the attention of both. If these gentlemen find it to their mutual advantage to co-ordinate .their work-and scientists of the proner frame of mind are never jealous of letting each other know what they are doing-it is better for them to-co-ordinate direct without the intervention of at h i r d party. As I look at this proposal carefully and impartially-and I had intended to support it at the outset-it seems to me that it is"" a superfluity and a luxury, and as at the present time we cannot afford luxuries I feel it my duty to vote against it .  ADJOURNMENT. preCONDITIONS ON TRANSPORTS: MUNITIO N NA "" BAHIA CASTILLO "" - WAR ""SERVICE HMS : PURCHASE OF HOUSES-SUP PLY OF POTASH : CARGO FROM GERMANY . Motio n (by Mr GROOM) proposed - That the House do now adjourn.",45
190,Mr BURCHELL,WORKERS AND ARMED GUARD ON,"Fremantle) [3.50]. - I desire to ventilate the question of the treatment of munition workers on the On Wednesday I asked the Assistant Minister for Defence (Mr . Wise) if he was in a position to make a statement, and the honourable member replied that as the inquiries then being made had not been completed he was not in a position to say what was being done. The House did not sit yesterday. According to advices from Western Australia the munition workers are not prepared to return to the ship and continue their journey in her to their destination. They complained about the arrangements on board the vessel before they left Plymouth, and a special investigation was ordered by the Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce). They say that, although they were promised that certain alterations would be made, the promise was not carried out. Further trouble was experienced at Durban, and, I believe, a special investigation was made by the officer in charge of another transport who happened to be in Durban at the time, and was asked by the Government of the Dominion of South Africa to investigate the complaints. Two days after leaving Durban there was trouble between the munition workers and the crew. The captain returned to Durban, where, at his request, a military guard was placed on board. I believe that in South Africa the promise was made to the munition workers of a full investigation on arrival in Australia. The vessel arrived at Fremantle a day or two ago, and I understand that an inquiry Board was constituted, and an inquiry held. The-Board was composed of gentlemen of the highest repute. They were Captain Burford, of the District Naval Staff of Western Australia; Captain Collins, representing the Military Department of Western Australia; Mr Collier, the Leader of the State Opposition; Dr Williams, the Port Health Officer; and a representative of the agents of the steamer. That was a very fair Court to establish, but I have not seen its decisions. The 600 men and women are still waiting in Western Australia for some means of transport to the East, and the fact that there have been so many complaints justifies the most careful investigation and inquiry. I do not know whether there is anything in those complaints or not, but when men and women refuse to proceed further on a steamer' it looks as if there must be some grounds for their action. I rose particularly to ask the Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook) whether he is in a position to make a statement to the House. At - present the Mr BurclieU. Commonwealth is bearing the cost of maintaining these people, some in an old school-house in Fremantle, and others in the military reserve at Karrakatta. The position has to be faced, and we must take some action to get these people across here.",45
191,Mr CHANTEB,WORKERS AND ARMED GUARD ON,Why did they refuse to go to Albany?,46
192,Mr BURCHELL,WORKERS AND ARMED GUARD ON,"They object to a military guard being placed over them. I am at a great disadvantage in dealing with this question, because I do not know all the facts. I am not going to criticise the members of the Australian Imperial Force unless I know all sides of the matter. I want the Minister to tell us what he knows, and he can do so much more conveniently on this motion than he could in reply to a formal question. There ought to be a special inquiry, and the Government would be well advised to appoint an independent tribunal with very wide powers.",46
193,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WORKERS AND ARMED GUARD ON,Here ?,46
194,Mr BURCHELL,WORKERS AND ARMED GUARD ON,Yes .,46
195,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WORKERS AND ARMED GUARD ON,"The trouble is that they are over there, and will not come.",46
196,Mr BURCHELL,WORKERS AND ARMED GUARD ON,"I would not care if the inquiry was held over there. The Government might arrange with the State Government for a Judge of the State Supreme Court to make the investigation. One of the demands of the munition workers is that a public investigation shall be made. If they are courting publicity, and if the position of the Department is quite sound, the Department ought not to object. The Returned Soldiers Association in Western Australia have asked me to see that they are represented on any Board of inquiry, because they wish to be in a position to protect the interests of the men who were placed on the boat at Durban as a military guard.",46
197,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WORKERS AND ARMED GUARD ON,"Hear , hear! And they are quite entitled to it, too.",46
198,Mr BURCHELL,WORKERS AND ARMED GUARD ON,"It is a perfectly fair request for the association to make, and whether the inquiry is held in Western Australia or in Melbourne, the association, as such, should have a direct representative on the Board.",46
199,Mr MATHEWS,WORKERS AND ARMED GUARD ON,The Returned Soldiers Association have never worried very much about the treatment of the soldiers on the ships.,46
200,Mr BURCHELL,WORKERS AND ARMED GUARD ON,"I do not know that that statement is justified. Although I am a member of the association I am not in a position to answer for all their acts of administration or maladministrat i o n ; but I bave always supported the honourable member when he has raised in this House the question of the treatment of returned soldiers. The Port Lyttleton case is one instance. I do not want to be misunderstood regarding my attitude towards the members of the Australian I m perial Force who were detailed to act as a guard on the Bahia Castillo. have every right to continue their voyage to their home ports. They were not responsible in any way for the trouble which occurred between the munition workers and the staff of the ship; but a full in quiry should be inaugurated by the Government without delay either in Western Australia or in Melbourne. We should have some absolutely unbiased, unprejudiced verdict with respect to this matter. Can the Minister tell the House what is being done in connection with this particular trouble?",46
201,Mr MATHEWS,WORKERS AND ARMED GUARD ON,"Melbourne Ports) [4.1],-The whole trouble that has occurred on the troopship Bahia Castillo rests at the door of the Government. They have never seriously investigated the reports as to the bad treatment of soldiers and munition workers on transports. The naval and military authorities in no case will admit having made a mistake. Where a mistake has been made, they practically say, "" We must let it go."" While the men returning to Australia on some transports have received not good, but fair, treatment, others have been not only badly fed, but underfed. No attempt has been made to get at the bottom of complaints of this kind. The men returning on a transport on which the food supply has been bad or insufficient, landed at different ports, and scatter all over the Commonwealth, with the result that no complete inquiry is ever made. It is only because the owners and agents of these vessels have been allowed to men as they please-becaus e of the in - boats. efficiency of officers commanding troops on board transports-that this trouble conhave tinues. In many cases the officer comwould manding is an excellent fighter and honourable man, but he has no proper idea of effectively catering for the wants of his men on board ship.",47
202,Mr BUBCHELL,WORKERS AND ARMED GUARD ON,A man would not at the head of affairs if he had no adobtain ministrative capacity.,47
203,Mr MATHEWS,WORKERS AND ARMED GUARD ON,"Then I shall say that the administrative capacity of many of these officers is not that which should be required of officers commanding troops on board a transport. I wish to be as ships. sympathetic as possible in dealing with such officers, because in three cases where there was serious cause for complaint as to the food supplied the men on board our transports the officers commanding were brave and gallant soldiers. For these positions, only those who are specially capable of looking after the men They should be selected. Recently I referred to the action taken by the officer commanding troops on a transport, who, on learning that the men were not receiving their full supply of meat, directed that the acting-quartermaster should attend at the butcher's shop and see each man's allowance weighed out. The acting quartermaster shortly afterwards reported that the butcher had chased him out of his quarters with a knife. The officer commanding then appointed as actingquartermaster the champion boxer on board ship, and ten minutes later was advised that a new butcher was required. Honourable members must realise that 600 men would not have left the Bahia Castillo at Fremantle unless there was some reasonable cause for complaint. Those in charge of the ship-the ship's agents and others-mus t be in some way responsible for the trouble. Trouble often occurs between the passengers and officers of a ship, and I am well aware of the difficulties that sometimes arise between troops on board ship and the ship's officers. On three distinct occasions, as a youngster, I travelled with troops on board ship, and in each instance trouble occurred between the officers and crew ancl the soldiers. - Mr YATES - The trouble nearly alare ways relates to the food supply.",47

The supply of these extras has been stopped. If the rates paid for transports are not regarded by ship-owners as sufficient, the Government should lay down a flat rate according to the cost of rationing the I have received today a letter from the Sydney branch of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, stating that 100 of its members were on board the Bahia Castillo. The members of that society can command a fair wage in all parts of the world, and are therefore accustomed to good living conditions. If they were supplied with bad food on board ship, it was only natural that they should kick over the traces. I repeat that it is impossible to imagine that 600 men would have left this ship at Eremantle unless there was good reason for doing so. Naturally, members of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers would expect civilized conditions to prevail on board. The determination of what are civilized conditions would not be left to them, and it certainly should not be left to the owners or'agents of the. ship. Ship-owners are out to make money, even if , in order to do so, it is necessary to underfeed or badly feed those on board. A week has elapsed since the trouble took place in connection with the Bahia Castillo, and the Government have not yet told us what they are going to do. Sir J""6SEPH COOK - What would the honourable member do?",47
207,Mr YATES,WORKERS AND ARMED GUARD ON,I would have taken off the armed guard and have allowed the men to come home as humans.,48
208,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WORKERS AND ARMED GUARD ON,-The armed guard consists of returned soldiers-member s of the Australian Imperial Eorce.,48
209,Mr FINXAYSOJT,WORKERS AND ARMED GUARD ON,That does not justify their conduct.,48
210,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WORKERS AND ARMED GUARD ON,What conduct is alleged against them? Soldiers have rights as well as the munition workers.,48
211,Mr MATHEWS,WORKERS AND ARMED GUARD ON,"Troubl e of this kind has occurred, not only on transports carrying munition workers, but on ships bringing our soldiers home. I admit that the armed guard have rights as .well as their brother munition workers. The guard on a troopship, however,, is changed every day. The Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook) knows that they are disciplined as a guard, and they would arrest any man who came through for drunkenness, although they may have been arrested a month before for the same crime. Surely the Government could have altered the conditions which induced the people to leave the ship at Eremantle. The Minister is asking what I would do. I would have a full inquiry by a civil authority into all the circumstances. Up to the present, the Government have encouraged actions of this kind, because they have not taken matters into their own hands and dealt with trouble effectively. If the shipping companies which bring these men out Six JOSEPH COOK - May I suggest that this is not a naval or military inquiry only, because there were also appointed to it the Health Officer for the Port, also Mr Collier and Mr Carter, both civil men.",48

There is no doubt about the Somali case and men , being jailed for stopping trouble and ventilating it. The Government must accept responsibility for these troubles, which are likely to take place on other ships; but, fortunately, we have not very many more men to return to Australia. Nobody will ever make me believe that 600 people would leave a ship without good reason.",48
217,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,WORKERS AND ARMED GUARD ON,"Illawarra) [4.14] - I want again to direct the attention of the Minister representing the Minister for Repatriation to the failure of the Government to keep their promises to those returned soldiers who wish to buy homes already, erected. Almost every mail brings complaints that soldiers have been induced by promises of the Government, made not only in speeches, but in the press, and circulated on the boats as they are returning to Australia, that returned soldiers would be assisted to purchase homes for themselves. On the strength of these promises, a number of men have made arrangements with owners of properties, and have undertaken certain financial responsibilities, but they can get no satisfaction from the Department. I brought the matter before the House some months ago-; bu'li we have no information beyond the fact that the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank is taking up an attitude entirely different from the attitude of the Government a."" outlined in their policy. Apart altogether from architectural schemes for the building of new towns and industrial centres, the practical thing to he done now is to assist soldiers who are here, and married, to get homes for themselves. These houses are available to them. They are being sold on the market every day, and a question of Government policy, as to future building, should not be allowed to interfere with the extension of assistance to men in these circumstances. It is nearly time this House had a definite Ministerial statement as to what promises, made over and over again, are not being kept. have in mind one particular case; that of a young friend of mine, who made application to the Department about four months ago. He came back to a wife and child, and naturally wanted to get a home of his own as quickly as possible. On the strength of promises made by the Government, he arranged with the owner of a house to buy the property, and, although he only wanted £150, he could get no assistance from the Homes Department so he had to make other arrangements. I have no doubt that other honourable members have similar cases. This matter is urgent. Returned soldiers who desire to buy homes already'built should, I think, have precedence. The erection of new homes with a flourish of trumpets and brass bands is, no doubt, very interesttown, ing, but it is not doing this job. The mediate work is to assist men who have made engagements for the purchase of homes already built. This phase of the business ought to be taken away from the Commonwealth Bank altogether, and dealt with separately by the man who is paid to deal with it. The arrangement with the Commonwealth Bank is not part of the repatriation scheme as put before honourable members, and it is apparent to me that a most serious blunder was made in the selection of a man to control the War Service Homes Department. Whatever that man's qualifications as a builddr may be, as an organizer of this big scheme he is an absolute failure, because he has been in office for many months now, and these cases are still not dealt with. The matter is serious. We are breaking our promises to our soldiers, and the sooner the matter receives the attention it deserves the better it will be for all concerned.",48
218,Mr FINLAYSON,WORKERS AND ARMED GUARD ON,"Brisbane) [4.19] We had hopes that, after the agitation caused by disclosures as to conditions on some troopships, complaints along that line would have been obviated; but it is most unfortunate that so late in the day, and after all the experience chat has been gained, there should have been any complaint in connection with the Bahia Castillo. I am not going to traverse the ground covered by the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Burchell); but I point out that, on the very day the ship was to leave Plymouth, the munition workers refused to sail unless their I grievances were remedied. Throughout the voyage the trouble seems to have continued. A few days ago, I received from the chairman of the Committee a lettergram, which I published in the Melbourne press, making distinct charges.",49
219,Mr BUBCHELL,WORKERS AND ARMED GUARD ON,Who is he?,49
220,Mr FINLAYSON,WORKERS AND ARMED GUARD ON,"Mr Saunders, chairman of the Committee. In his lettergram to me from Fremantle, dated 22nd September, he statesAn armed guard, despite the strong appeal of men, women, and children, with rifles and ammunition, forcibly ejected men from the Sleeping quarters Complaints genuine. Food beggars description. Crew obstreperous and undisciplined. Repeated brawls occurred. A steward is in hospital, and a fireman in prison, at Capeas a result of fracas. One of the ship's imofiicers and several of the crew deserted at Durban. Officer and guard were intoxicated during the voyage, inviting passengers to fight in the presence of acquiescing officers. I can quite understand how difficult it is for the Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook) to make a definite statement, in view of the lack of first-hand knowledge; hut I am particularly anxious to raise the question, in order to see that, whoever was responsible, be it a military or naval officer in London, on the ship, or in Australia, any inquiry held should be of such a nature as to, sheet home to that officer once and for all the responsibility for his neglect of duty which has brought about such a regrettable and unfortunate state of affairs. I have no doubt, as to the sympathy of the Ministry for the people who have been placed in this position. When the munition workers found it necessary to leave the vessel at Fremantle, they showed that their complaints must be thoroughly well founded. The information they have supplied, which is all we have to go on, is of such a character as to demand that any inquiry to be held shall be free and without any' suspicion of bias or domination by military or naval officers, and such as to insure that its results will be acceptable to the public. Whether it is acceptable or not to the munition workers is, so far as I am concerned, a secondary consideration. I hope that the result of the inquiry will go a long way towards preventing a recurrence of these painful episodes. The honourable member for Adelaide (Mr. Yates) was anxious to say something in regard to his experience on the Somali, but he had to catch the train for Adelaide. He has told us in the House, and privately, that a file of soldiers with guns loaded with ball cartridge was waiting on the wharf when that vessel reached Adelaide. We all admit that discipline must be maintained; but there is a method of carrying it out which is effective and reasonable, and there is another method which is not only i r r i tating, but also unnecessary. I hope that as a result of the inquiry asked for_ a Court will be constituted which will give absolute satisfaction to the public, and assure them that the best is being done, not only to investigate these particular complaints, but also to protect returned soldiers and munition workers on other troopships.",49
221,Mr FENTON,WORKERS AND ARMED GUARD ON,"Maribyrnong) [4.25] I wish to supplement the remarks of the honourable member for Illawarra (Mr. Lamond). Returned soldiers in the Maribyrnong electorate are in danger of - losing their homes through the sale of the houses they are now occupying. One man has to make other arrangements before the end of this month, but, so far, has received no reply to his application, has been before the Repatriation Department for weeks past. Unless he receives a favourable reply he will lose an opportunity of getting a home at a reasonable price. These delays are dangerous, and the men are beginning to believe that, after all, the repatriation scheme is not to have the good effect it was originally intended to have. If the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank is to be blamed for the delay, it is time he appointed more officers. I notice that he has opened a new office inCollins-street, Melbourne, to deal with soldiers' homes. I hope that this step will lead to more expedition. I can assure the Ministry that the complaints of the men are serious and are becoming all too frequent. The men are becoming disheartened, beeause they feel that the opportunity to secure suitable homes is gradually slipping through their fingers, owing to the departmental delays. The supply of potash for Australia is a most serious matter. One of the.Commonwealth line of steamers is now on its way to Australia from Rotterdam with a full load of potash, but there is an embargo on the landing of goods in Australia - containing more than 5 per cent, of the product of an enemy country. I cannot understand how one of the Commonwealth line of steamers should be engaged in this class .of work, unless she was specially sent to Rotterdam to bring this cargo to Australia. There is a good deal of misapprehension here, and I hope it will be removed before the vessel arrives. A supply of potash is essential for our agriculturists, and as soon as this boat arrives I hope that its cargo will be distributed, and put into use.",50
222,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WORKERS AND ARMED GUARD ON,Without troubling much about where it comes from?,50
223,Mr FENTON,WORKERS AND ARMED GUARD ON,"German y is the only country from which we can obtain supplies of potash. I understand that under the Peace Treaty France will be in control of considerable potash areas that formerly belonged to the Germans. That will be a very good thing indeed; but even if the cargo to which I have referred does come from the centre of Germany, I hope it will be landed as expeditiously as possible, seeing that there are no supplies of potash here.",50
224,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WORKERS AND ARMED GUARD ON,"Parramatta-Min ister for the Navy) [4.28] - I regret the trouble that has taken place on board a which transport at Fremantle. Perhaps I may give a few of the facts, so that honourable members may know what has taken place. There appears to have been what I was goiug to call the usual complaints about food and accommodation before the ship arrived at Capetown, and as I have had an experience of life on board a troopship, perhaps I may have a few words to say on this point. There is a tendency, not only among the men, but also among the officers and all sections aboard a troopship to regard it in the same light and judge it by the same standards as an ordinary passenger liner. That often leads to trouble. On the troopship by which T returned to Australia. I persuaded the officers to allow the troops to parade the saloon deck while the saloon passengers were having breakfast. The troops have not much room for exercise, and I thought it fair that while we were having breakfast they should be allowed to parade our deck, where they would be in no one's way. They paraded our deck on this one morning. Next morning an officer told me he would object to that kind of thing occurring again.",50
225,Mr BURCHELL,WORKERS AND ARMED GUARD ON,"An officer of the Australian Imperial Force? Sir JOSEPH COOK: - No ; an I m perial officer. I asked what was wrong with it, and he said, "" There is little enough space now for the first class passengers."" We forget that the first objective of such a vessel is to get the troops out to Australia as fast as possible and land them as healthy as possible, and not to give people all the habiliments of a first class passage. I pointed out, was a secondary consideration. These troop ships differ in many ways from the ordinary liner, and that may sometimes be the cause of some of the troubles that occur. In the case under discussion the complaints were made before the vessel arrived at the Gape. They were investigated, so far as that could be done, and the reply we got from the Cape was that, in conjunction with an Australian staff officer, one of our own men, at Durban, the vessel had been inspected and found in every way satisfactory. The only reasonable complaint was the condition of the potatoes. I may say that on the boat by which I returned the potatoes were not good on all occasions. It was the latter end of the year, and the potatoes would not all keep in good condition until new potatoes were procurable. That kind of thing happens at Home. Complaints reached me when I was in London, in consequence of which I visited one of our hospitals. The complaints were about the fish and potatoes.",51
226,Mr B URCHELL,WORKERS AND ARMED GUARD ON,At Southall.,51
227,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WORKERS AND ARMED GUARD ON,"Yes . I went down there and told the doctor in charge of the complaints that were reaching He said, "" I know. There are two things wrong: The fish and the potatoes."" He then proceeded to show me the papers, in which he had already recommended the prosecution of a man who had supplied bad fish. He had received two consignments of bad fish from this contractor for supplies. It was of no use to blame the officer in charge of the hospital. Ha was as much annoyed about it as any one else, and took steps to remedy the complaint as far as possible. We may get bad fish and bad potatoes occasionally at home, but I am afraid that we do not make the same allowance for public institutions as we make in connection with our own families. I am not saying - that in justification of this kind of thing, but only to suggest that these matters should be considered reasonably. The complaint of the munition workers Avas investigated at Durban, and it was found that there was nothing serious in it, and what little faults there were were rectified, and the steamer sailed. After she had sailed, she came back to port. The ship's crew refused to proceed any further on the voyage unless an armed guard was put on board. That, It seems that the munition workers had shown a threatening attitude; their conduct was reported as mutinous, and so the vessel came back to port. The naval authorities in South Africa had to put on a guard of seventy-four men, including four officers. These men, I understand, were taken from another boat that was on the way out to Australia. They were returning soldiers of the Australian Imperial Force. They were put on board the Bahia Castillo, and then the row began about the guard. Hp to Durban, the complaint was about the food, and after leaving Durban it was about the guard, and so it continued until the vessel arrived at Fremantle, when the munition workers declined to go any further with the ship unless the guard was removed.",51
228,Mr FENTON,WORKERS AND ARMED GUARD ON,".When the honourable gentleman speaks of the ""ship's company,"" does he refer to the crew and ofiiieers of the vessel?",51
229,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WORKERS AND ARMED GUARD ON,Yes ; to the captain and crew of the vessel.,51
230,Mr FENTON,WORKERS AND ARMED GUARD ON,They refused to proceed without the guard?,51
231,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WORKERS AND ARMED GUARD ON,"Yes ; they refused to bring the ship any further unless me. they had the armed guard, so threatening was the attitude of these munition workers. These are the facts as Telated to us. On arrival at Fremantle, it seems that these people went ashore and would not proceed with the vessel any further. Arrangements were made for an inquiry to be held there hy a Board, consisting of Captain Burford, Captain Collins; Mr. Collier, M.L.A., Leader of the Labour Opposition in the Western Australian Parliament; Dr Williams; and Mr. Carter, representing the agents of the vessel. The Board endeavoured to obtain evidence from the passengers, but the passengers declined, by a unanimous vote, to have anything to do with a Board of that kind, and demanded that their evidence should be taken on oath in open court, with the public present. So the ship's crew, refusing to sail without the guard, and the ship's passengers refusing to sail with the guard, the passengers had. perforce to be left behind, and there the matter stands at present.",51
232,Mr BURCHELL,WORKERS AND ARMED GUARD ON,Did the ship come on?,52
233,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WORKERS AND ARMED GUARD ON,"The ship went back for them, but still they could not be induced to go on board.",52
234,Mr BURCHELL,WORKERS AND ARMED GUARD ON,Did she go back to Fremantle?,52
235,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WORKERS AND ARMED GUARD ON,"No , to Albany. The passengers will not come on by that ship. That is the, plain English of it. They have struck, and will not come by that ship.",52
236,Mr BURCHELL,WORKERS AND ARMED GUARD ON,And they are being maintained at the Government expense?,52
237,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WORKERS AND ARMED GUARD ON,That is so.,52
238,Mr FENTON,WORKERS AND ARMED GUARD ON,Will means be provided for the passengers to go down to Albany to board the ship?,52
239,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WORKERS AND ARMED GUARD ON,"Yes , every provision is made for that, but they will not go on board the ship. Although the munition workers would not give evidence before the Board to which I refer, there was an investigation, and, as a result, the report we get is that the accommodation on board the ship is ample, the cooking arrangements were for 2,000 people, the sleeping accommodation is ample and to spare, the messing accommodation is provided, not on the living and sleeping decks, but in the saloon, the food scale is ample, and the quality of the food good, with one exception, that the potatoes were not good on one day. The other food was good. Up to Durban, the - complaints were against the cooking, serving, and food; and, after Durban, the presence of the armed guard. I do not think that we should take that armed guard off the vessel to please the munition workers, unless good reason can be shown. The guard consists of returning soldiers of - the Australian Imperial Force, and I think we ought to know why this guard is objected to. The munition workers say that they will come home if there is another guard appointed from amongst themselves.",52
240,Mr FENTON,WORKERS AND ARMED GUARD ON,I suppose that they feel that practically they are coming home under arrest.,52
241,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WORKERS AND ARMED GUARD ON,"Hel d down and captive by returning soldiers of the Australian Imperial Force! It seems to me that this is a revolt, not against the authorities, but a revolt against the ""digger.""  gentleman> know anything about the man who is leading the munition workers?",52
242,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WORKERS AND ARMED GUARD ON,"I understand that his name is Saunders, and I am told that this is not the first time he has led a revolt of this kind.  thing about him also.",52
243,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WORKERS AND ARMED GUARD ON,"That is what I have heard. It is not a difficult thing tp lead a revolt on board a ship. When people have nothing else to do but think about their troubles, it is a very easy matter for one or two men to induce them to make trouble. At the same time. I wish to say that the facts in this matter ought to be investigated, and, so far as I am concerned, there shall be a full investigation of it .  gentleman going to do with the munition workers if they will not return?",52
244,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WORKERS AND ARMED GUARD ON,I have stated the position. Has any honourable member a suggestion to make ?  should go to Western Australia and investigate the matter for himself.,52
245,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WORKERS AND ARMED GUARD ON,-Will - the honourable member accompany me t ,52
246,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WORKERS AND ARMED GUARD ON,"The munition workers say that they will travel if seventy-fouT ""-diggers "" are turned off the - boat, and I repeat that I shall wamit a very substantial reason before I shall agree to - that condition. - Question resolved in the .affirmative. Souse adjourned at 4.41 p.m.",52
