4,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"Some time ago, the Acting Prime Minister promised to confer with the Minister for Defence regarding the possibility of remitting the fines that had been imposed on deceased soldiers... I wish to know if the 'interview took place, and, if so, what was the result of it .",20
5,Mr WATT,Unknown,"I have a recollection-of the promise and of a conference with the Minister for Defence, who, subsequently! speaking from memory, submitted the report of the Department on the subject; but I cannot from memory state the contents of that report.",20

10,Mr WATT,Unknown,"There has just been finished a discussion of the subject which extended from about 3.30 this afternoon to about 7 o'clock, ag the result of which I feel almost sorry that there was ever a sheep bred in this country.",20

Mr Watt - It is not only he; I ' had rethree members of the Wool Committee, he all keen-brained experts, on the job; and representatives of the Colonial Combing Company. For nearly four hours' I was the candlestick of this seesaw, and, as a result, I am pretty tired of the subject. But I have succeeded at last in effecting a final arrangement. We rose too late to put the agreement into form; but the heads of it will be drawn up tomorrow, and signed by the parties interested. NORTHERN TERRITORY. S.S. "" SIR JOHN FORREST ""-ABSENCE OF ADMINISTRATOR. wish to know from the Minister for Home and Territories if a vessel named the Sir 'John Forrest has been obtained for work in the Northern Territory, and, if so, where that - vessel is now, and what the Government intend to do with it?",20
12,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"The vessel referred to was ordered, about two years ago, and is now on its way from Brisbane to. the Territory.",21
13,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"As last year the Administrator of the Northern Territory was in Melbourne forseven months, or thereabouts, drawing extra allowances, and is here again now, I ask the Minister whether it is his intention that the Northern Territory shall be administered from Melbourne,, and at a higher cost than we should have to pay if it were administered from Darwin?",21
14,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"The fact that the Administrator was here last year does not affect his present visit, which has not lasted more than about ten days. He was not responsible for the circumstances which kept him here last year. On this, as on other occasions, he undertook a purely business trip, travelling through Hatches Creek to iook into some important matters, and on to Queensland because of some difficulty with regard to the tick pest. Other matters made it expedient for him to go on to Brisbane. His travelling allowance is not greater than that of the more highly paid public servants, being only f l aday in the Territory, and 30s. a day outside of it. NA NEW SOUTH WALES.",21
15,Mr TUDOR,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"The Acting Prime Minister promised to make inquiry in connection with an advertisement which appeared asking for Victorian coal miners to go to the Richmond Main Mine in New South Wales. The matter was raised by the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) last week, and I haye received a telegram concerning it. Has the honourable gentleman any further information? Is the inquiry proceeding, and when does he expect to receive a report?",21
16,Mr WATT,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"In accordance with my promise to the honourable member for Hunter, I next day summoned certain parties who were supposed to know about the matter, and I subsequently called for a report in writing from them. I am informed by the Secretary of the Department that the report arrived today, but I have not seen it, and cannot state its contents.",21
17,Mr CHARLTON,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,I hope that the honourable member will make the fullest inquiry.,21
18,Mr WATT,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,I am trying to do so. I keep my promises. IMPORTATION OF APPLES..,21
19,Mr FINLAYSON,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,Some time ago the Minister for Trade and Customs imposed an embargo on the importation of American apples during the present year. Has he later information which may induce him to reconsider the matter ?,21
20,Mr JENSEN,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"About two months ago I called for a return of the quantity of apples in cool store in Australia, and found that about 1,600,000.were so held by various merchants and fruit-growers. As I considered that quantity of apples sufficient to meet the consumption of the Commonwealth during the year, I decided that it would be unwise to permit the importation of American apples, especially as Australia has not exported to any country one case of apples during the year. I have called for another return, so that I may know what the consumption of apples has been,- and how many cases there are now in stock, with a view to reconsidering the whole matter. ADJOURNMENT (Formal). MILITARY PUNISHMENTS.",21
21,Mr SPEAKER,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"I have received from the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr. MCGRATH) an intimation that he desires to move the adjournment of the House for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of' urgent public importance, namely, '' The action of the military authorities in giving to the daily press the names and sentences imposed on privates and non-commissioned officers of the Australian Imperial Force for desertion. Also to dicuss the severity of sentences imposed by the military officials in France and England."" - Five honourable members having risen in their places, Question proposed.",21
22,Mr MCGRATH,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"Ballarat) [7.44] - I gave notice of this motion with some diffidence, which, however, has been removed, as the result of a conversation with the Acting Prime Minister during the past few minutes. I do not desire hy' any statement that I may make to hinder recruiting; I wish to be very careful not to do that. At the same time. I do not wish injustice to be done to our soldiers in France and England, nor that such in justice shall be continued because. I am keeping quiet. We have* decided, the Prime Minister and I , that I shall censor my speech, and that he shall censor his. This gives me the opportunity that I desire to put certain statements before the House. I wish,' first, to draw the attention of honourable members to the action of the military authorities in publishing in the press of Australia every sentence that is imposed upon our soldiers in France and England. No good purpose is served by this practice - On the contrary, grave injury'and injustice is done to the soldiers' loved ones in Australia. I feel strongly upon this question, because of my own experience while in France. was there cases came under my notice in which some of the bravest lads in our Army were sent to military for having committed little, offence against the military I have before me the names and battalions of several lads whose cases I shall mention; but I do not propose to give the names. In the first place, let me tell of a young private who was in the Pozieres stunt. After that stunt his battalion came back for a rest and went into He went into a billet and was billeted by himself. On the. following morning the battalion paraded, but he was too ill to attend the parade. At that parade his battalion received orders to march further back. He was not aware of this, but on the following day this young whose battalion belonged to *our 1st Division, joined a battalion of the 2nd Division. He reported himself to the ofncer - in-charge of that battalion, remained with it for eighteen days - At the end of that time his own battalion was located, and he returned to it. can speak feelingly upon, this phase of the question since I was lost in Flanders for several days. During the whole of that time. I was carrying my swag, and was quite unable to locate my unit. how difficult it is, therefore, dier when, he misses his battalion to catch up to it again. This young soldier, who had Mr MCQrath. been, at Gallipoli, and had not one crime in his pay-book-this young man, who had been in every stunt up to that of Pozieres-reache d his battalion alter eighteen days, and was promptly court martialled. The adjutant of the battalion with which he had served during that eighteen days corroborated his statement, and gave the actual dates, showing that he had not missed one day, but the court martial sentenced him to fifteen years in a military compound. F or some reason for which he does not know, he was not called upon to serve a day of his fifteen years sentence, ! but was sent to England, and. is now out here. He lost, however, about .£40 as the .result of the incident. In another case, a young soldier, after coming 'out of the Fleurbaix stunt, got drunk. That is by no means an uncommon occurrence. The nerves of many of these young men are % shattered after a stunt, and they are not nearly as good as when they went into it. This young soldier, for getting drunk,"" Whilst I was sentenced to five years in a military compound. He served fifty-seven days in cells, during which time he had to wear compounds leg irons, and after doing seven months if any, he was released. Y e t another Melbourne regulations. boy for striking a corporal was sentenced to twelve months in a compound. H is food-and this is the ordinary food served out in the military compounds-consiste d . of $ lb. of bread and a pint of porridge for breakfast; 6 ozs. of bully beef and 8 ozs. of bread for lunch; a pint of stew, billets. 8 ozs. of bread, and 2 ozs. of cheese for dinner. The men in the compounds have to work very hard, and this lad for refusing to turn to u n t i l he got clean clothes was again tried, received thirtyseven days, and was - transferred to . Rouen No . 2 compound. In .another soldier, case a private, for being drunk, was sentenced to twelve months in a m i l i tary compound, and he declares that whilst there he was beaten by the Tommy and staff-sergeants - Here is another case of a soldier who Was sentenced to five days for failin g to washan officer's mustardI pot. It is at r i v i al case, but it is these trivial matters that irritate the soldiers. I mention these cases in the hope that the Commonwealth Government will take I know action. We should have our own Ausfor a sol- tralian compounds in France. Our lads ought not to be sent to compounds controlled by other than Australian officers .and non-conrniissioned officers. One Australian understands another, and-our men are more likely to get better treatment at the hands of their brother Australians than if they are left to others who are not actually in the fighting line. . There is the best of feeling between the Australians and those of our Allies who are ally fighting, but, as I have said, there another section that is not too friendly towards the Australians. I am 'anxious that our boys shall be placed in our own - compounds, and that the Government will take action in regard to these heavy sentences of ten years and fifteen years' imprisonment which are published from .time to time in the daily newspapers. Many of the officers at the Front have been on service for a long time, and have done gallant work. Their nerves, however, are shattered, and they are not in a fit state to try our men-no t fit to weigh the evidence, to carefully judge it, and to mete out the punishment that will fit the crime. It is a shame that lads who have been through Gallipoli, and in stunt after stunt in France, should be. sentenced to twelve - months' imprisonment for being away for a few days without leave. A mother saw me today about the case of her young soldier son, who had twenty-three days "" A.W.L.""-absen t Avithout leave. Those who have been at the Front, and have had leave, can well understand the feelings of the men when, after month after month in action they get leave. It is not much wonder that they sometimes overstay their leave; the temptation is very great. If they overstay it to any extent they - sentenced to twelve months in a military compound, and, what is worse, their ""names are published in the newspapers here as those of lads who have practically deserted. I can well imagine the feelings of the mothers and fathers, the sweethearts and relatives, of these boys when they read in the newspapers of the sen. tences that have been meted out to them. Another private who was away without' leave for two months was sentenced to twelve years in a compound. I have been associated with the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt) for a long time, and although I have always been - opposed to him in politics, I recognise that he is generally fair. I ask him does he .think it reasonable that one form of punishment should be meted out to privates and non-commissioned officers, and quite another form of punishment to officers? An officer may commit almost any crime, and yet not be sent to a compound. If he is found guilty of an offence, he is returned to Australia. He comes back on a transport as a first-class actupassenger, and when he arrives here he is is simply toid that his services are no longer required. A non-commissioned oflicer or private who has been guilty of the same offence receives a sentence of anything from one year to fifteen years in a military compound, and his sentence is published to the world at large.",21
23,Mr MATHEWS,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"What is more, his dependants are left to starve.",23
24,Mr MCGRATH,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,That is another phase of the question with which-I shall deal on another occasion. This differential treatment is most unfair.,23
25,Mr KELLY,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"Does the honourable member say that if an officer is absent without leave, just as a private may be, his offence is treated differently?",23
26,Mr MCGRATH,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,If he is absent without leave or breaks a military law he is cashiered. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - He eitlier gets a severe reprimand,23
27,Mr MCGRATH,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"O r promotion. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - He either receives a reprimand, a severe reprimand, or is dismissed. The heaviest sentence of all is to be cashiered the service.",23
28,Mr MCGRATH,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"But no other punishment is inflicted upon an officer. are He does not return to Australia under the same conditions as a private, who, after going through the Gallipoli campaign and stunt after stunt in France, is being sent home invalided. He has not to submit to the treatment which such privates have to submit to on a transport, and in some cases the treatment of the privates is not too good. It is aggravating to a private who is returning home invalided to see ou the deck, which he dare not stand upon, Captain or Lieutenant So-and-so, who has been cashiered because he has failed in his duty, but who is treated as a first-class passenger. There is not a word in the press as to the officer's offence and punishment. He comes back here with all the glory of a man who has done gallant service. But Private Johnny Brown, who takes a littletoo much beer, or is absent without leave for twenty-three days, is sentenced to a term in a military compound, and his sentence is published to the world at large. We might well take a step in advance of the British Army, and I urge the Government to make representations to the Imperial authorities in regard to courts martial. In the French Army there is a private on every court martial constituted to try a private. The private on a court martial is charged with the duty of watching the interests of the privates brought before it, and he sees that they receive justice. The honourable member for New England (Lt - Colonel Abbott) has not had the experience I have had as a private, but he knows that when a lad is brought before a court martial he has to aay ""Yes, sir,"" and ""No, sir""; that he has to stand to attention, that in most cases he cannot put his case very well, and that he has no one to plead for him. If we had privates on such courts martial, I am satisfied that severe sentences would not be so frequently imposed. ' I hope the Acting Prime Minister will see if it is not possible to have a private sitting as a member of any court martial, which is dealing with a private. I do not wish to deal at length with question. The Acting Prime Minister tells me that he has some fairly strong statements from the British Government. I certainly hope that the British Government will never have their own way so far as our Army is concerned. British Government can give British Army officers the right to shoot men for disobeying an order. God forbid that such a power should be given any of our officers. While in England, I visited the House of Commons, and heard a member . of the Conservative party plead for the abolition of such a power. He said, ""I can give you, Mr Speaker, the case of Private So-and-so, whose only decorations are five wounded stripes. As an officer who.has shed his blood for his country, I know that a man is at his best the first time he goes over the parapet. He is not as good on the second occasion, and he is worse still on the third. This lad, with the five wounded stripes, on. the sixth occasion of his going over the parapet,fell by the wayside^ his nerves had gone, and his punishment was the death . penalty, the man being shot as a coward Mr MCGRATH. and a deserter."" I would never give any greater' power to the officers than they have today, and we ought to insist that these sentences be reviewed by the civil authorities. We have already given absolutely too much power, and these officers are in absolutely f u ll control. However well they mean, we have to remember that the officer is in the same condition as the - private - h e has been through hell intensified, and his nerves are gone; and he is not in a condition to deal wiih cases of the kind. Week after week we see the lists of the heavy sentences passed on our boys, who are doing everything they can for their country, and who, it must be remembered, are placed in worse circumstances in France than are the armies of any of the other Allies. In France, so strong is the demand by the French women and people that their soldiers shall be given leave, the French Government have had to concede the right of every man to go to his home once every threemonths. Our own boys are 13,000 miles away from all they love, and they have been there for a year to eighteen months without a day's leave; and yet, because some of them overstay their leave,they are visited with these heavy punishments. We this ought to remember that the very spirit that causes them to overstay their leave is the spirit that makes them the fine fighting soldiers they are. I feel very strongly on the matter- I feel for the loved ones here when they take up the newspapers and see the punishments that The have been inflicted. When I remember how trivial are some of the crimes, I cannot but think what must be> the feelings of some of their friends, who are proud of the fact that their boys are> fighting for their country and the liberties we now enjoy. I trust that the Prime Minister will make representations to the military authorities here with a view to at least seeing that the names and sen-' tences are not published.",23
29,Mr WATT,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"Balaclava-Actin g Prim* Minister and Treasurer) [8.3] - When the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr. MCGRATH) intimated to me yesterday that he proposed to rnove the adjournment of the House on this question, he acceded' to the wish I expressed to postpone the matter until today in order to enable the Budget to be placed before honourable* members. That has enabled me today to> confer, very briefly. 1 admit, with fence Department, and to get into docubeginning to end:mentary form some arguments surrounding the cases to which he has referred. There was a difficulty as to how far what he would say, or what I would be likely warned to say, would be injurious to the cause of the Commonwealth if published. There were two ways of getting over that diffimanders. culty. One was by an arrangement with penalty the speakers, principally the honourable tion member and myself, to censor our the speeches in Hansard, and the other was of by requiring strangers to withdraw at death the will of the Speaker and of honourable members. However, after consultation Army with the honourable member, we thought desertion the former course was perhaps the better. by death. This leaves me somewhat freer to speak passed on the matter, more particularly on the nature graver phases to which he has referred.",24
30,Mr BRENNAN,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"Is this all ""to be supmachine, pressed ?",25
31,Mr WATT,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"I am not talking of suppression, but of a voluntary censorship, which the honourable member's legal traindeath ing will distinguish from suppression. Mr BRENNAN.>-You should let public know the shameful business.",25
32,Mr WATT,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"The honourable does not know anything about the question at all, whereas the honourable ber for Ballarat does, while I , from another point of view, know the other side, Cabinet. and desire to point out, for what they are worth, the causes of some of the things complained of. - The honourable member for Ballarat action'was (Mr MCGRATH) has really separated his of remarks into five parts. He complains, first of all, about the treatment of the desertion cases, and the publication of the gestion.' names in the daily papers. Secondly, he deals with the heavy sentences for small offences; his third point is that one punthe ishment is given to officers and another of to the rank and file; his fourth, that rest courts martial should be constituted difthe ferently, and, where privates are tried, privates with others should sit in judgactions ment; while his fifth suggestion is that all sentences imposed by courts martial should should be reviewed by the civil authorireputation ties. These points I shall deal with in their order. The first is that of the desertion cases. The documents in the commits possession of the Defence Department justify the preparation of the following the Dememorandum, which I shall read from There have been in the Australian Imperial Force a large number of cases of desertion, both from the firing line and from units for duty in the firing line. Strong representations were made in the matter by Sir Douglas Haig, the Army Council, _General Birdwood, and the - Army ComBy section 98 of the Defence Act the of death cannot be awarded for deseron active service, or even for desertion in face of the enemy. To render a member the Australian Imperial Force liable to the penalty, he must actually desert, to the enemy. The English, Canadian, South African, and New Zealand troops all come under the Act in this respect, and the offence of while on active service is punishable The death sentence in these ' cases is with the object of showing the serious of the offence, and of acting as a deterrent to others who contemplate the commission of the same offence. An army is a military and, to insure efficiency, all parts of the machine must comply witlf the requirements of discipline. The British authorities urged that the Defence Act should"" be ""amended to allow the penalty to be inflicted in these cures. The power would only have been used sparingly, where the offence was very deliberate, the and an example urgently required. Careful consideration was given to the matter by Cabinet; but it was decided not to member amend the Defence Aot.",25
33,Dr MALONEY,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,JS that the Australian memCabinet or the English Cabinet ? .,25
34,Mr WATT,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,It is the Australian,25
35,Dr MALONEY,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,Goo d luck to them!,25
36,Mr WATT,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"To proceedIt then suggested that, as Feme was urgently necessary, the names men convicted of this offence should be published in the press throughout Australia, and approval was given to the adoption of this sugI t was absolutely necessary that some steps should be taken to provide a deterrent, and to insure that the mass of the Australian troops should' not be included in general condemnation caused by the action a few individuals. The opprobrium attaching to the act of deserting one's comrades must on the individual responsible, and not on Australian Imperial Force as a whole. It is only right and just that the man whose bring the name of the Australian troops into dishonour and disrepute should himself bear the shame, and that his action not be allowed to tarnish the collective of the Australian Imperial Force. Desertion .on active service is a shameful and dishonourable crime, and the man who it is false to his country, false to his comrades, and false to his oath. The publication of the names of these men has been decided upon, with a view to ascertaining whether this will act aa a deterrent; and in view of the grave nature of the offence, it is considered that the men concerned are leniently dealt with ",25
37,Mr MCGRATH,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"I wish you to clearly soldiers. understand that no Australian ever deserts in the line. It is because the Auslarly, tralian soldiers get so little leave that when they .go to London they overstay their leave.",26
38,Mr WATT,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"I should be glad if the honourable member would not ask me to contradict that statement at the time. I shall discuss it with him at a suitable timeWith regard to"" the - sentences pnssed, these nre hot severe, in view of the above facts. A term of imprisonment or penal servitude a light punishment, in view of the gravity the prevalence of the offence. Members of the Australian Imperial Force convicted before court martial overseas of desertion, or other offences, generally serve their to these matters, and are trying sentences overseas, and the papers relating their cases dS not come to Australia, ouly the recommended. soldier is sent back for discharge. In some cases soldiers are sent back to serve their sentences in Australia, and in these cases papers and proceedings of court martial sent back with them. As the result of consideration of reprecrime sentations made to the Minister for Defence, the Minister some time ago appointed a comlarat (Mr MCGRATH) has referred. mittee to review the sentences of the men so returned. This committee consists of a Police Magistrate, a returned officer of Australian Imperial Force, and a representative of the Adjutant-General. In cases of soldiers returned to serve sentences for . more serious crimes, the papers in such cases are referred to a Judge of Supreme Court for his opinion. The committence tee or the Judge, as the case, may be, vited to make recommendations as to the mission of sentences, or portion thereof, and such recommendations are at once brought before the Governor General for the necessary action. The honourable' member will see that part of the problem to which he has referred has already been dealt with by the vernment up to a certain point. The pressure brought by the British Army authorities to have our' soldiers placed upon the same terms as other soldiers the Empire in regard to the death penalty we have resisted and refused. have been told by those who are best to know and most responsible as military thinkers, that desertions, instead of being deterred by the present leniency, have probably been increased. The leaders our soldiers in the field have appealed us to give them some form of deterrent, and we have given as an experiment what appears to be the mildest possible form of deterrent.",26

42,Mr WATT,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"When we inflict punishment on a man for a military or civil offence it necessarily extends to those who - is are nearest and dearest to him. That is and an accidental and possibly inevitable feature of punishment. The Government .have given a certain amount of attention the to mildest form of deterrent that has been I have no information, and I do' not their think I am able to get any at this stage, are as to whether the punishment fits the in the cases of the smaller offences to which the honourable member for BalI shall ask the Minister for Defence to in the quire into the matter and ascertain what information is available in the Department or at authoritative sources overseas. long The honourable member has suggested, the also, that the mere publication of a senimposed upon an officer and, his disare inmissal from the army is not treatment reequivalent to that meted out to the rank and file. I admit that. I do not think that the cashiering of an officer, in either volunteer or regular regiments, is the same kind of punishment as the dismissal and imprisonment of a private. I do not Goknow the origin of the army tradition which makes «such punishment sufficient in the case of an offending officer, but possibly the honourable member for New of England (Lt - Colonel Abbott) may enlighten the House' as to the reason for We ' that view; We in Australia are simply able following the ordinary and invariable practice Of the British Army in that respect. It seems to me that the French system of allowing one private to sit on of a court martial which is trying another to private is a very proper one. The jury system of this country-and , after all, a court martial is an improvised jury for a certain purpose-mean s that a man shall be tried by his peers, and I shall recommend the Minister to consider that system for adoption in connection with courts martial - Wherever possible, we are allowing a review by the civil authority of sentences imposed by courts martial, and as I propose to strike out of Hansard such of my remarks as I think will injure recruiting or reflect unduly on our Expeditionary Forces, I ask other honourable members who speak to this question to submit their speeches to the same treatment.",26
43,Mr TUDOR,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"T a r r a ) [8.20] - The honourable member for Ballarat (Mr . MCGRATH) is to be commended for having brought this matter before the House, and for having ""dealt with it in such a temperate way. The sentences that have been imposed on privates in the Expeditionary Forces are a scandal. Acting Prime Minister has said, and I agree with him, that he cannot see why an officer can fair l y be treated differently from a private. In my opinion, instead of the punishment of an officer being lighter, it should be greater, because he is a man of greater experience and responsibility , and he has everything in his favour.  is sumcient for an officer to be cashiered ? When that happens he is settled for ever, socially.",27
44,Mr TUDOR,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"If a private gets a sentence of twelve years' imprisonment Ke is nearly settled for ever, because when he comes out of prison he finds that his offence is known, and the stigma upon, his character remains. In the case of the officer, public obloquy of the kind is escaped. I hope that the Acting Prime Minister will deal with this matter, and that all the cases of.men who have been returned to Australia for punishment will be referred to the Committee which he has mentioned. Men who had been sentenced for military offences were sent back from Egypt, and 'as there was, apparently, no proper place for their detention, the Victorians were sent to Pentridge. The Government appointed a Committee to review all sentences, and I believe that if a confidential report were presented it would disclose that, in practically, every case, the Committee recommended a reduction of the sentence. There is one case of special hardship to which I wish to direct the attention of the Assistant Minister for Defence. This case has been brought under my notice, and I have sent particulars' of it to Victoria Barracks. A young fellow was sentenced to imprisonment for two years. I do not know what his offence was, nor do his people. A f t e r the boy had served three or f o u r months of the sentence his mother received word that he had Ibeen wounded in the firin g line. She had received no notification that his sentencehad been reduced, or that her allotment money, which had been stopped from the date of the court martial, was to be continued. Surely, if a man is sentenced to a punishment, and his allotment money is stopped, the authorities have no right to send him back into the firing line.",27
45,Mr WISE,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"We have cabled for in formation about that case. The Mr TUDOR - I am glad to hear it . Honourable members on both sides are anxious that fair play should be dealt out to our men. We all have received letters from men stating that they have been for eighteen months or two years in France, and have been unable to get any leave in England. In one case that came under my notice, a young .fellow had been in France for two years without leave. Eventually he was granted leave, and visited friends in Scotland. On account of some breakdown in the train service he exceeded his leave by two days, and was sentenced to one month's imprisonment. After' serving the sentence he returned to the firing line, and was wounded. The authorities subsequently admitted that his absence in excess of the period of leave was due to no faul t of his own, and reinstated him . Nevertheless, the mother's allotment pay for that month was stopped. Whilst it is true that all punishment falls more severely on the relatives than on the offender, we have to remember that, in the case-of civil offences, the convicted man has had the advantage of a civil t r i a l by his peers. There is a feeling' amongst returned soldiers and amongst other sections of the community that every court martial trying an offence by a private should include at least one member of the prisoner's rank. In our Public Service Act we have provided'that the tribunal shall include a representative of the class to which the offender belonged. I ask the Acting Prime Minister to endeavour to have the same principle applied to courts"" martial, so .that private charged before a court martial may have a representative of his own to consider his case. A reform of that kind will do something to remove a great deal of irritation, and lessen the hard-* ship that is imposed upon the relatives soldiers. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT . (New England) [8.28] - We must not lose sight of fact that the moment our troops leave-the confines of Australia, they come under discipline of the English Army Act. That Act applies to the Imperial soldiers, the troops of all the different Doofficers minions and Colonies serving in . the present . war, and it is impossible for the authorities to differentiate between the several bodies of troops amongst the millions fighting on the side of the Allies. It is true, as has been stated by the honourable member for Balants larat (Mr MCGRATH) that there is one law for the officer and another law for the non-commissioned officer and private. The greatest punishment that can be in the flicted upon an officer is to be cashiered. of war-like operations. He cannot lose his rank, and he cannot be sentenced to imprisonment, but, as the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr. Page), interjected, the cashiering of an officer in the regular Army is about the most severe punishment that can be meted out to him. Of course, cashiering does not inflict the same degree of punishment on the militia or non-professional soldier as it does on the regular soldier. My cipal complaint in this regard, however, is that an officer who has committed an offence-the self-infliction of wounds desertion-and who has been dismissed from the service or returned to Australia private. because the Army has no further use for him, is allowed-to go scot-free without a record ef his service being made' public. I have seen such offenders on transports fraternizing with other oflicers who did not know their record. On arrival in Australia they have all the Sclat of having been on active service, they suffer no inhealth, dignity, and are allowed to resume their place in civil life. Those men are in totally different category from the fortunate lad who has been sentenced cause of desertion under duress, or some other offence, and whose name every and offence are published broadcast. I gather that one or two honourable memrank bers would like to know what actually happens at a court martial in the field. It was my unfortunate luck at times tb preside at courts martial in the field, of and at other times to be' a member of courts martial dealing with Australian soldiers in England.. Although all offences committed by Australian the soldiers are governed by the Army Act, the courts martial dealing with those the offences are composed of Australians only, except in the case of an officer. An and oflicer has to be tried by at least nine and the President, particularly in England, is generally a British officer. In the case of a non-commissioned officer below the rank of warrant officer, the court martial is usually composed of three officers, a colonel, who presides, and two other oflicers of lesser rank, but lieutenwith less than two years' service are not eligible to sit on courts martial. Field courts martial are not hedged round or circumscribed by red-tape as is case in England, away from the scene A field court martial is a rather quick method of dealing with matters, but, nevertheless, every man who is charged with an offence has the right to call upon a brother soldier, called the prisoner's friend, to defend him. The right to call for the assistance of a prisoner's friend is generally availed of, particularly if the soldier who is charged thinks that he has a good chance prinof getting out of the trouble. .He asks for the services of a prisoner's friend, and names his man, .and that man is sent or for. It is generally an Australian solicitor, though he may be a corporal or a  Lt - Colonel ABBOTT-He may be, and very frequently is an oflicer. I have presided at. courts martial where a certain officer was defending a private. At each court martial evidence is taken on oath. If there is any question as to a man's doctors' certificates are admitted. The defence is entered upon exactly as in a ordinary criminal cases in civil proceedunings. The rules of evidence apply under be the Army Act as they do in criminal profor ceedings in Australia. After the evidence is taken, the members of the court martial deliberate in private, and decide as to the guilt or otherwise of the prisoner, who is then, and only then, entitled to bring in evidence as to his character. Regimental records are produced, and decorations, if the prisoner has any, are admitted and taken into account by the court martial, before, the sentence is passed. The sentence passed by the court martial is not final. It is subject to revision. It is a general rule on active service that if a man is absent for. twenty-one days from his duties in the front line after being warned for thatduty, the sentence is generally two to five years. I have known sentences to run up to ten years; I do not remember a case in which the sentence imposed was fifteen years. There must be a majority verdict, and when the sentence is passed, all the papers are sent on to the prisoner's brigadier. Before he confirms the sentence an inquiry is made from the prisoner's battalion commander as to his history and military antecedents. In my experience everything in connection with the case is thoroughly weighed, and the prisoner is given the benefit of any doubt.",27
46,Sir ROBERT BEST,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"He gets a fair deal all round. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - He does, so far as I oould see, speaking from my experience last winter. The honourable member for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH) was in the Paeschendale stunt. He knows that the men were fed up; they were suffering from overwork and over strain. Immediately after that stunt, when the units were camped at Ypres and Hooge, we had several cases of court martial for desertion in the face of the enemy and in the field. Within 4 or 5 miles of the front line, after Polygon Wood and Paschendaele, we had the unpleasant task of dealing with several men who were absent from their battalions - after those units had been warned for the front line, and who did not take part in those fights. I quite admit with the honourable member for Ballarat that our young Australian soldiers, when suffering from over strain and overwork, may commit a military offence that probably they would not commit in their ordinary frame of mind and in possession of their normal strength. One sees this particularly in the case of the younger . members of the units.",29
47,Mr MCGRATH,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"(Some of the cases I mentioned were those of lads of nineteen years of age. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - I did not know that the honourable member was referring to youths. I have seen it more particularly in the case of lads of not mature years. The strain of holding a line is the most nerve-racking and exacting class of work a young man could undertake, and when a "" hop over "" has taken place, especially after a youth has been suffering great privations for perhaps two or three days, his temperament or his physical capacity is not the same as that of a man of twenty-five years or of thirty years of age. The strain affects him more than it does a man of more mature years.",29
48,Mr GBEGOBT,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"He should not be there Lt - Oolonel ABBOTT - I quite agree with the honourable member that it is a great mistake to send boys of nineteen years of age to Prance to take part in these affairs. In cases Where I have been connected with courts martial these circumstances have been taken into account, and although there has been technical desertion and punishment has had to be inflicted, we were entitled to put in - recommendations, which we did on several occasions, for mercy to be extended to the prisoners by the brigadier.",29
49,Mr CONSIDINE,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"I it true that for a S certain elass of offence the minimum punishment is five years? Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - That is quite correct. Por desertion in the face of the enemy, for self-inflicted wounds, .and for cowardice in the face of the enemy the minimum sentence is, generally, five years' imprisonment, but if there were circumstances in alleviation of a crime they could be added to the sentence as a sort of rider or recommendation to the brigadier. In every court martial with which I was connected, if we could see that there was a doubt, or that the soldier had been suffering from over strain and overwork, and was run down generally, a recommendation to that effect invariably went on to the higher authority, and took effect.",29
50,Mr MCGRATH,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,Does the honourable member know in how many instances sentences havp heen upset when they have been reviewed in the Oases that have came out here ? Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - I am not aware of it.,29
51,Mr TUDOR,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"In nearly every case the Committee has reduced the sentences imposed. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - I can quite understand a certain number of sentences being upset here in Australia, but of course omcers who are dealing with these matters in the field have to approach tliem in a cold-blooded sort of way. When a battalion is ordered into the line the orders are received forty-eight hours beforehand, the battalion marches up to the front line by stages, and on the night preceding the talcing over of the line it is in billets 2 or 3 miles back. The lads know what is ahead of them. They know that next day, perhaps, there will be a ""hop over."" The honourable member for Ballarat, who was at Paschendaele, knows what that means. Ninety-five per cent, of 'the men realise what may happen to them. They are taking on the greatest job that any mortal man has ever been asked to undertake-that is, to ""hop over"" in the face of the enemy, as our Iboys had to do, against the pill-boxes of the Hindenburg line at Paschendaele. Officers who have had to deal with men who desert think that they are not dealing fairly with those who have borne the brunt of the fighting, and taken the risk of losing their lives, perhaps leaving bereaved widows and children to mourn their loss, if they allow a "" scrimshanker "" or "" cold-footerto evade his responsibilities at the last moment, and be found wanting when the battalion goes into the line. [Extension of time granted.']",30
52,Mr MCGRATH,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"What does the honourable member think of the case of the severe punishment of a man who has gone right through Gallipoli and through every stunt, and whose nerves have gone? Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - The honourable member may be referring to a case of particular hardship. I cannot speak as to any of those particular cases. I can only speak of matters that have actually come under my notice on active service, but I can add this: that in most cases where severe sentences were inflicted the balance of sentence was remitted, and the soldiers reported to their battalions after serving not more than three months' detention. The treatment in the cases mentioned by the honourable member for Ballarat seems to have been harsher than that which was meted out in the instances that have come under my notice on active service, but perhaps there were circumstances connected with them that had hot been brought to light.  relatives when a man is sentenced to two years' imprisonment, and returns to the firing line after three months, and not a word is heard of it in Australia? It is cruel. Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - There is no doubt it is. It may be a matter of policy on the part of the Government to give publicity to those cases in order that it may act as a deterrent; but no matter how long the war lasts there will be a certain number of Australian soldiersand good men, too-wh o will desert, but who, if they were in their ordinary - frame of mind and physical condition, and were able to weigh the matter and the importance of the step they proposed to take, would not do so. If it be deemed right to publish the names of privates and non-commissioned officers, then the names of. oflicers who commit military offences, and come back here with every eclat and garish display, should also be published.",30
53,Mr WATKINS,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"Newcastle) [8.45] I was pleased to hear the speech last delivered, because it went to show that the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr. MCGRATH) was justified in bringing these matters before the House. I do not propose, at this juncture, to speak on the subject of military punish-, ment at the Front; but I wish to draw attention to one phase of the matter: the deprivation *of wives and children of allowances which would have come, to them but'for the punishment inflicted on the soldiers on whom they were dependent. ' In some cases it happens that these allowances ' are not restored, although the dependants have got word that the soldiers concerned have been back in the Front, and have been wounded. I desire to draw attention to the atrocious treatment by the military authorities of wounded boys who are found guilty of offences when on their way back home. A case has been brought under my notice, with which I had intended to deal during the Budget debate, in which fifteen wounded lads landed at Fremantle. They were on their way home,, and were allowed to go on shore without beiug put i u charge of an officer. They were not given definite instructions regarding the sailing of the boat for the' eastern States, people. and they missed her. For this offenceand it is not a solitary case-the y incarcerated for twenty-nine days, while in gaol were given prison fare, and j>ut through physical drill u n t i l one young man, who had been - wounded in the fainted. In addition, on the final settlement, twenty-nine days' pay was deducted for the time during which they had been in prison. Had the lads deserted while on their way to the Front, one might have understood some such punishment; these boys had played their part, and were practically home again. offence was not in the same category as on. desertion. In civil life, a man who is punished for an offence is seldom or never fined in addition; but these boys were imprisoned for twenty-nine days, and, in addition, were fined 6s. a day. The case is a standing disgrace to the military rule of this country. I hope that those in charge of the Defence Department will have it , and other similar cases, thoroughly inquired into.",30
54,Mr BRUCE,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"Flinders) [ 8 . 5 0 ] I propose to direct my remarks tb one enemy, aspect alone of the subject which has evidence. been discussed. I associate myselfwith what has been said by the honourable member for New England (Lfc - CbTonel Abbott) regarding the - constitution of courts martial and the manner i they deal with cases. A fact which, though it has been touched on, has not been emphasized as much as it should have been, is that in desertion cases - the mind of the Court is always ous directed to the need for establishing deterrent. The desire is to maintain such a deterrent that other men will desert. I have seen cases that have been terribly hard on those who have been punished; but in war some one has suffer for the benefit of the whole, and unquestionably it must be made to pear to a soldier a terrible disgrace to found guilty of desertion, and a terrible punishment must attach to the crime. The temptation to desert in the face the enemy .is very, very strong. unfortunate enough to witness a pretty wholesale desertion, a ghastly experience. Nothing else could make one realise how tessential it is that soldiers must have it in poral and lance-corporal. bheir minds, when their nerves are bad, and they might yield to terror, _ that if they do so a terrible thing will come upon them, and great disgrace fall upon their",31
55,Mr MCGRATH,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,The wholesale deserwere tions to which the honourable member and refers were from the British Forces.,31
56,Mr BRUCE,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,Yes .,31
57,Mr MCGRATH,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"The death penalty head, did not deter in that case.",31
58,Mr BRUCE,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"That is so. Nevertheless, there have been many cases in which men have hung on in critical circumstances, feeling that such a terrible penalty attaches - to desertion that nothing but could be worse than to desert.",31
59,Mr MCGRATH,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,It was the old British Their fighting spirit that caused them to hang,31
60,Mr BRUCE,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"They had the British spirit, but in the face of the enemy one may be led to do many things which he would not do under other circumstances. The penalty for desertion is a terrible one, and it is the more terrible when the soldier's crime is published, and his disgrace affects, his people. That, however, is a necessary thing. This is not a master for civilians, who have not - known what it is to be in the face of the to decide against military",31
61,Mr CONSIDINE,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,Does the honourable member suggest that there should be some form of physical or mental torture greater n which than death as a deterrent ?',31
62,Mr BRUCE,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"No . But the penalty for desertion has a grave effect, and is imposed to ' strengthen the bearing of those who may be placed in a dangerposition, when there is the horrible and a ghastly temptation to yield. Let me tell the House, a short story that may emphanot size the point of the honourable member for Ballarat, that the publishing in the newspaper of the names of deserters is a to terrible punishment. I admit that the punishment is a terrible one, but I feel apthat it must be permitted to stand for be the sake of the good men who have always played tlieir part. In the early days of the Gallipoli campaign, when the men of had been fighting and digging for three I was days, with practically no .rest at all, snatching an hour's sleep - when they could, a small post in front of the line was,put in charge of ten men and a corWhen the officer went to inspect it , the whole of these men were asleep. It was a terrible thing for him to discover, because the position was a critical one. The officer awoke the men, and changed the whole party. Next morning - he sent for the corporal and lance-corporal. I was in his dug-out when he talked to them. He pointed out that in the British Army the penalty for what, they had done was death. They were comparatively unmoved by that statement, being stolid fellows. The officer, however, was a big man, and he went on to say that he was going to take the responsibility of not porting the matter. This was a grave responsibility, because if the corporal and lance-corporal were to fail on some subsequent occasion, and disaster were to ensue, the officer would be blamed. He then proceeded to talk to the men, pointing out what it would mean to them and - to their people if they were again found guilty of an offence like this. They were gallant lads, who had responded to their country's call, and were fighting on behalf of the nation, but were they to be shot for having been found asleep on duty, at home their pictures would be turned face to the wall, and their names would never be mentioned but as those who had practically been traitors to their country. The effect of this talk onthose men was astounding. They were rough British "" Tommies,"" and they sat in that dug-out crying.^",31
63,Mr MCGRATH,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,Ha d the officer those men a'sentence of three month's might have ruined them.,32
64,Mr BRUCE,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"Non e the less, from what I have seen I say that we cannot, out of sympathy with those who are ished and their relatives, betray the terests of the goo'd, decent men who fighting for us. As to the other matters mentioned, share the opinion of the honourable ber for New England, that if an officer betrays his trust his conduct is worse than that of a soldier who does so, and he cannot be made to suffer the same penalty, he should be made to bear the same stigma, which is even worse than the penalty. . I would support the investitude gation of every case in which unfair, unjust treatment has been given to soldier, but when .a soldier betrays his trust, or is absent from his battalion when it is called upon to move into a tion of danger, and it cannot be proved beyond all doubfc that his absence was due to an absolute accident, he and his relatives must suffer.",32
65,Dr MALONEY,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"Melbourne) [8.57] I am sure that every member present has been glad to hear the speeches of the honourable and gallant members for New England and Plinders. We are proud to hear from the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt) that that abomination of the past, the death penalty, has been abolished so far as Australian soldiers are concerned. There is one phase of this matter that may not re have impressed honourable members generally so strongly as it has impressed me. The medical journals show that this war, more than any other, is producing serious nervous diseases-, such as shock and spinal neurasthenia. Men are seriously injured even though absolutely untouched by any missile. Neurologists, who make a special study of nerves, state definitely that many men in that condition are absolutely not answerable for their actions. I know of a case, that of the son of a medical man, who was buried for four hours. He will never do a hand's turn again. He will read a few lines of printed matter, and will have no recollection of what he has read. His life is blasted for ever. The honourable member for Ballarat spoke of a case that he heard referred to in the House of Commons, in which a man, whose sleeve was decorated with given stripes. showing that he had been he wounded five times, was shot by order of court martial because of his failure on a sixth occasion, when called upon, to go into that terrible No Man's Land. Either punthe officer presiding over the court inmartial was suffering from shock and are nervous strain, and did not know what he was doing, or he was a cold-blooded I murderer. The honourable member for memNew England (Lt - Colonel Abbott) said he was not aware that many heavy penalties had been imposed. I have before if me a list of no. less than seven cases in which soldiers have been sentenced to penal servitude for life. In another case a sentence of fifteen years' penal serviwas imposed. Many of the men who or have been sentenced to long terms of any penal servitude have fought and done their bit at that most terrible pit of destruction, Gallipoli. And"" this is their posireward. What is more, their wives and children, in many cases, are left to suffer from want of food. This, the most advanced country in the world, should take care that where wives and children allow their breadwinners to go away to fight for their country, they shall never be left short of food, no matter what offence the men commit. I took up some time ago the case of a'woman whose husband, a soldier, was supposed to have been absent without leave, in consequence of which the payments to the wife were suspended. This'woman and her children were sufferingseverely. It was eventually ascertained that the man had not been absent without leave for one day. The ""Defence Department could not be blamed for the mistake, and when it ascertained the facts it made good the payments that had been stopped. ' Why should not an officer be punished for any offence that he commits, just as' a private is punished? Why sliould an Officer be sacrosanct? Does not such a system come down from the old and vile times when no private or common working man was thought to', be fit for a commission, and when the power of the purse gave a man the right to command others, even where he had to depend on subordinates for guidance as to what he should do? Does it not come down from the vile times when it was thought that no one but a gentleman should be an officer? It is said that there could be no worse punishment for an officer than to be dismissed. There are swanking in the streets and in the ballrooms of Australia today officers- I know of one who wears a medal-wh o have been cashiered, the service, and the public know nothing of their dismissal. If an oflicer or a private commits murder in civil life he is hanged for i i . Why should there be any different treatment in connection with the Army? Honourable members must have been impressed with the speeches delivered by the two honourable members who have held commissioned rank in the Australian I m perial Forces, as well as by the speech delivered by the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH), who. has also been fighting at the Front. By all means let officers and men be treated alike. The names of those who are punished should - not be blazoned forth in the public press. Such a practice only means that the wives and dependants of these men have to suffer. If the Censor's Department takes action to eliminate such reports from the press in the future, I shall bless it, although I have often had to curse it. I was sorry to hear that General Birdwood was among those whohad asked for additional power to award punishment. General Birdwood gets a very good name from many of our returned soldiers.",32
66,Mr FINLAYSON,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"Some of them give him a good name, but all of them do not.",33
67,Dr MALONEY,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"My experience is that the majority speak well of him, but I am satisfied that the people of Australia will not be pleased when they hear that he is among those who are asking for greater power of punishment. The statements we have heard to-night will serve to justify the action of those who objected to the proposal of the Government to allow youths of nineteen to enlist without the consent of their parents. The three honourable members of this House who have returned from active service have all declared 'that no one under twenty years of age should be allowed - to go to the Front. I was pleased with the greater portion of the remarks made by the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt), but I shall be very sorry if he decides that his speech shall be censored. It is well that Australia should know what he has said to-night. I have only to say, in conclusion, that I hope the public, when they hear of a returned soldier acting as only a lunatic would do, will remember the nerve-racking, experience through which he has passed. I hope they will remember that these men have had to fight with masks, and to contend against a deadly gas which cannot be seen, but which attacks the lungs, one of the most vulnerable parts of the human system! They have had to contend with vile instruments of murder which, although deadly in their effect, do not, in the case of shell-shock, for instance, leave even a trace of injury that can be detected by the surgeon. Finally, I hope that the decision of all courts martial will be revised in Australia. A calmer judgment is likely to prevail here, 12,000 miles away from the battle front; and if cases are re-heard we are not likely to have such punishments as have been meted out to Australian soldiers, and which are disgracing and spoiling the name of Australia today. '  House is indebted to the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH) for his action in bringing these matters forward and dealing with them as temperately as he has done. The statement made by the Actiug Prime Minister (Mr Watt) is also worthy of commendation from the point of view of the Government.. Many people think that the Government deal very harshly with cases of the kind that have been brought under notice to-night; but every soldier knows when he goes on active service that to desert in the face of the enemy is one of the most serious offences. I cannot understand a man being guilty of such an offence. men are f e a r f u l for the timo being, but once they get into action their blood is up and they "" go for all they are worth."" That is my experience of men on active service.",33
68,Mr MCGRATH,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"But fighting is different today-it is the going up and going up the line that tells.  Any active service that I saw was but as a picnic compared with what is going on at the Front today. We have to remember that our men have voluntarily gone to the Front. They have answered the call of Australia. and the Empire, and have gone to do their bit. Their parents and relatives have wished them God-speed, and if they commit any slight military offence for which they are punished, it must be very disagreeable for their people to read of it . The Acting Prime Minister'said that if in civil life a man is punished for committing an offence, his people have to bear the opprobrium of it . But the position of such a man is different altogether from that of a man who, while fighting for his country, commits, some military offence. A man who is fighting for his country is"" no criminal. He is not like a man who has taken something that does not belong to him, or has systematically embezzled his employer's funds. As an honourable member who has led men in France said to-night, in an evil moment fear may overtake a man going into action, and he clears out. Because that man is a coward, are the whole of liis relatives in Australia to be branded with his cowardice? many cases it is riot cowardice, but nervous fear, that is responsible for his act; but it is blazoned forth in the press of Australia that Private So-and-so has received a sentence of twelve years for deserting in the face of the enemy. God knows the sentence itself is bad enough. I suppose these long sentences are intended to act as a deterrent to others.",34
69,Sir ROBERT BEST,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"They seldom serve the full term.  about' to make. If after serving three months a man expresses contrition and says he would like to rejoin his battalion, is it not reasonable that the fact that he has rejoined his battalion and has returned to - the trenches should be announced in the press just as his' sentence Some was published ? I know of many men who have overstayed their leave, and who had no intention whatever of deserting. When they found that they were "" in the soup ""-that they had been absent without leave for a few hours-the y said, "" We l l , we are in for it now, and we. might as well be killed for a sheep as a lamb."" They consequently absented themselves for a few days, and on their return were liable to be court-martialled and severely punished. H a d they returned .after only a few hours' absence without leave, they would have, been sentenced, > perhaps, only to pack d r ill , or to confinement to camp, or to fatigue duty, instead of to a term of imprisonment. I have seen men tied up to a gun wheel and flogged before' breakfast, and some of those men had the bravest and best hearts that I ever found in a human being. And they were flogged for what""? In some cases, for getting drunk. They had been away from drink for several months, and the first time they came on the track of 'some, they got hopelessly drunk ; and for this they were flogged like animals. Why should the relatives of men punished in this way suffer disgrace by reason of the publication of the names and offences through the press ? Many a good man gets drunk; in fact, I think it is only good men who do get drunk. As to courts martial, those on the spot know the conditions, and what the actual crimes are - What can we know about this in Australia? By the time the """"crime "" sheets get here, so many tales are heard, that we are apt to come to the conclusion that the men have not done anything at In all. As officers commanding have said, there must be sentences that have a' deterrent effect. But did the flogging in m y day in the service stop drunkenness? Not at all. The more the men were flogged the more they drank, and the more drank the more they were flogged. As result, the officer commanding the Eorces at that time, Lord Chelmsford, decided that flogging had to cease. Since I got older an'd studied political history, am inclined to the belief that Lord Chelmsford must have "" smelt a rat,"" bestances, cause it was just about that time that Charles Stewart Parnell and the Irish party in the English Parliament gave Government of the day suich a doing flogging was abolished in the English Army ?",34
70,Mr FINLAYBON,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"Why not call it the' British Army?  an Englishman, I suppose. If the publiBritish cation of the names and offences has had the deterrent effect thai? the Governand ment and their advisers hoped, is i disgrace enough for a man to be branded as a coward, and put into gaol as a coward, without putting the stain on his family and relatives in Australia? God knows that when the boys went away from Australia they went full of enthusiasm, and as full of fight as an "" egg is full ^meat."" The sight of chevrons, which dicate how many times the man has "" been wounded, is good enough for me; every day, as I go down the street see the men returning maimed and mutiunits. lated, I could take my hat off to every one of them. If we are to believe what the newspapers tell us, we know the high opinion that the Germans have of the Australian soldiers; and for Heaven's sake do not let us do anything to belittle the men and women who bred such brave men to fight for their hearths and homes on the fields of Flanders.",35
71,Mr FINLAYSON,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"Brisbane) [9-21] Like those who have preceded me, I sire to express my personal satisfaction, which I believe is shared, not only by. them. honourable members, but also by the public, at the action of the honourable member Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH) in introducing this subject to-night. We all it is not an easy subject to discuss, because, I suppose, we have all had letters from soldier friends at the Front which have somewhat lacerated our feelings and created a sense of strong antagonism to the courts marresponded tial, owing to what seem to be necessarily severe sentences. The tralian soldiers, perhaps, appeal more us because of the fact that they have been they so ready and so pronounced in their a volunteering; and the further fact that they have risked their lives so freely and courageously affords to the ordinary layhave man a reason why some - consideraI tion should be given to them even if they do commit what, under ordinary circumwould be considered serious military offences. It is rather an unfortunate circumstance, although, perhaps, a necesthe sary one, that immediately Australian that soldiers touch the other side of the world they pass under the provisions' of the British Army Act; That would not be so bad in itself if it were not that our men, during most of the be war, have been under the control of officers. One of the best imnot provements that has been made recently, one which I regret was not made very t not much earlier, is that now Australians are working under Australian oflicers who understand the Australian point of view, and the Australian civil attitude, and can appreciate more than do Imperial oflicers the value of the sacrifices that the men of have made. I think it would be found, inif inquiry were possible, that military crimes "" by Australian soldiers have decreased considerably since Australian and oflicers took charge of the Australian I am fortified in my opinion by letters I have received from soldiers, including oflicers as high in rank as majors, in regard to the abilities of General Birdwood. I am not going to criticise that oflicer to-night. He may be a very excellent British oflicer, but I think he absolutely and completely misunderstood the Australian point of view, and the Aus"" tralian soldiers, and he treated them in a - way that was not in consonance with the demind of the. Australian"" people, and a way that would not get the best out of 1 believe that under General Monash and other Australian officers now for in charge our men will do better work, and that their interests will be more conrealize that siderately looked after. "" The most satisfactory feature that has been elicited in the debate to-night is.the statement of the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt) that the Imperial authorities to the appeal of the Australian unGovernment, and did not impose the Ausdeath penalty . for serious military to offences. This shows that, after all, the British Army Act is elastic-that there are some things to which even such a stiff military Act, and such serious military procedure as the Act imposes, can be accommodated if objection is pressed. ""We know that in other directions, at the imperative and persistent request of the Australian Government during the progress of the war, various concessions have been made to Australian soldiers by the I m perial authorities. .",35
72,Mr MCGRATH,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"The Germans have followed our example and abolished the death penalty,",36
73,Mr FINLAYSON,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"The trouble is that the death penalty is not entirely abolished in' the British Army. Copies of four routine orders issued by FieldMarshal Sir Douglas Haig in April last, have reached me from a soldier friend, and the unfortunate and regrettable fact I notice in each of these is that courts tial reports take precedence of all other items. In each of the cases reported a soldier was charged with being a deserter from His Majesty's Forces when on active service, and the details are given. There are seven cases dealt with in the four routine orders, and we are told that the sentence of the court was that the accused suffer death by being shot, and the sentence was in each case duly carried out between 6 and 7 o'clock in the morning. These, of course, were not Australians, but included amongst the members of British regiments were some Canadians. This shows that the death penalty is still unfortunately being imposed on British soldiers.",36
74,Mr SPEAKER,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN, The honourable member is going beyond the scope of the motion.,36
75,Mr FINLAYSON,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"I merely wish to express satisfaction at the statement of the Acting Prime Minister to-night that at the request of the Australian Government the death penalty is not imposed on Australian soldiers. In the cases to which reference has been made there is the unfortunate pro-"" cedure of publishing the number and names of the men who were punished. That is a point we have to stress very strongly; we have to protest against this stigma being placed on the relatives of our men. After all, in many cases- I think in most cases-*-the men did not know what they were doing, and were not really responsible. We can read in the newspapers almost every day, in the detailed reports of the various engagements, how wounded men, after a period of insensibility, find themselves crawling, not as they believe, to their own lines, but to the lines of the enemy. It occurs to soldiers on both sides to find themselves in the wrong trenches, after a series of wanderings in "" No Man's Land."" Question resolved in the negative. EXCISE BILL .

Debate resumed from the 25th September (vide page 6384), on motion by",36
76,Mr WATT,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN, That the paper be printed.,36
77,Mr HIGGS,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"Capricornia) [ 9 . 3 4 ] . ^ I should like to know from the Government why there is no reference in the Ministerial statement to the proposed representation of the Commonwealth Government in London by a Minister. That surely is a matter important enough to call for some reference by .the Government. I wonder whether the Prime Minister '(Mr. Hughes) has placed an embargo upon all reference to that matter, and I am reminded that in June last a cable message was .received in Australia which drew from the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt) a statement that the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook) were in London for the purpose of discussing the representation of the Commonwealth Government at the heart of the Empire. _ Almost immediately afterwards we were informed that Mr Hughes, when questioned about the statement by London press representatives, said that there was no truth whatever in it. The Melbourne press referred that paragraph to the Acting Prime Minister, and the Melbourne Age of 21st June said- > It was with manifest surprise, therefore, of France. that the Acting Prime Minister yesterday read a cable message in the newspapers to the effect that Mr Hughes had stated that there was no truth whatever in the statement. It might be, of course, that Mr Watt's admission reached London in a somewhat vague, or haps,' mutilatedform, but he had not the slightest hesitation in repeating the admission, notwithstanding Mr Hughes' reported denial. Had the Government nothing to say about this proposed representation in London? Are they ashamed of the proposal, or are they prevented by the Prime Minister from referring to it? I have very great difficulty in ascertaining from the Acting Prime Minister when Mr Hughes proposes to return to Australia. I hope that no one will get the impression that, because I have some remarks to make concerning the Prime Minister's policy, I am attacking him personally. To-night's Herald contains a reference to "" an attack by the honourable member for Capricornia upon Mr Hughes."" I made no attack on Mr Hughes as Mr. Hughes, but I am concerned about the doings of the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth in another part of the world. I tried to ascertain from the Acting Prime Minister yesterday when the Prime Minister will return to Australia, and he could not give me even an approximate date. I do not Wonder that the Prime Minister has not returned, because I have read in the press that he has been very well received and entertained, and, as the honourable member for Melbourne interjects, "" How can he leave the duchesses ?"" cable message published a few days ago stated that at a supper given by the British Parliamentary Association to the Australian Prime Minister there were present 1 prince, 2 marquises, 10 earls, 8 viscounts, 25 barons, and 60 knights, so we must excuse the Prime Minister if he prolongs his stay in the Old Country. But I take very grave exception to his declaration that he represents the Commonwealth in the speeches he has made upon various matters. In this connection, I observe in the Ministerial statement this paragraph- . The members of the National French Misparent sion, headed by General Fau, have arrived Australia, and are the welcome guests of the Governments of the Commonwealth and the States. Everywhere they are received with popular enthusiasm, and the Government trusts that the visit will cement the ties between the people of this country and the great Republic That sounds well, and, I believe, correctly represents the sentiment of all Australians who know the history of Prance, and what she has done in the war. But do the Gopervernment intend to back up those sentiments with anything like a business proposition? Por example, are they prepared to sell Australian wool to France? In 1913 France bought £6,087,941 worth of greasy wool and £1,341,915 worth of scoured wool, or a total of £7,429,856. The British Government is said to have bought the whole of the Australian wool clip for the period of the war and twelve months afterwards.",36
78,Mr RODGERS,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,And that sale assures to France all the wool that is required.,37
79,Mr HIGGS,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"TI believe that the British Government does distribute to our Allies portion of the wool purchases. I notice that many members, and other people who do not know what is going on in the world, appear to be under the impression that the sale of the wool clip was a great commercial deal. It is referred to as "" the greatest single deal in the world's wool history,"" and the Government seem desirous of crediting the transaction to the business acumen of the Prime Minister. He had very little to do with the deal. Anybody could sell a commodity if he were prepared to dispose of it at a price which was about two-thirds of its value. I shall read to the House from the Melbourne Herald of 20th of this A month the opinion of people in London on this wool dealAustralian pastoralists appear, according to cablegrams published in London, to be satisfied with the net return they will receive from the purchase by the Imperial Government of their wool during the period of the war and one year thereafter. . . . Yet there are .some able business men ih London personally familiar with both the Australian position and. the prospects of the textile markets, who are saying that, substantial as is the price paid for the wool-5 5 per cent, above the 1913-14 average-it is too low, all things considered; that the opinions of the manufacturers have been permitted to weigh too heavily in the negotiations; that the contrast between prices and world demand will be more sharply apa little later; and that it may indeed bein come, by comparison, in certain instances (by comparison with the high cotton values, for example) almost ridiculous.. Apparently this great deal, which has called forth so many cheers from the representatives of the pastoralists in this House, is laughed at in London.",37
80,Mr MASSYGREENE,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,The honourable member might also read from the same article the criticism of the opinion which he has just read.,38
81,Mr HIGGS,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"Perhaps the Assistant Minister will supply the omission when he speaks. If the views expressed by those who understand the position in London are correct, the deal is absurd. And we are told by the Acting Prime Minister, on behalf of the Government, thatTlic Prime Minister and the Minister the Navy are still in Britain. . . . They are at present endeavouring to remove great and increasing difficulties surrounding the sale and shipment of our products, which so much depends for the preservation of our prosperity.",38
82,Mr RODGERS,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"The greatness of the deal lies in the. fact that, while Britain buys our produce, she also maintains the Navy, and that gives us a clear course city - „ for our wool to her own spot-cash markets.",38
83,Mr HIGGS,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"How can it be said that there are difficulties when the Prime Minin Australia? ister is prepared to barter away our products at about two-thirds of their value? We heard a great deal about the Prime Minister's success in the purchase of the Commonwealth steamers. I know for a for their products. positive fact that, - at the time those vessels were purchased, he was running the United Kingdom and France. making speeches, and left the purchases to a small, but respectable, although not well known, firm in London. That firm was so anxious to earn its commission that it bid for the ships four times the cost of building them, and there was siderable anxiety in financial circles London lest the Commonwealth should make a great loss on the transaction.  anyhow.",38
84,Mr HIGGS,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"It has proved so because of the war; but if the war had terminated earlier, it would have been a very financial deal. For the purpose of comparison with the prices obtained for our wool, I have some particulars about ton prices. In the United'Kingdom, price of cotton before the war was 7fd. per lb. According to the London Times of 31st July, 1918, good middling cotton at that date was quoted at 20.83d. per'lb., an increase of more than 250 per cent, on the pre-war price. Wheat before the war # was 8s. 3d. per cwt. in London ; and in 1916 had risen to 14s. 5d. Wool, in 1913, was lOJd. per lb.; in 1916', 14jd.; and today it is 15|d - In the United States, cotton in 1913 was quoted at 12.80 cents per lb., and on the 31st July, 1918, at ' 29.20 cents. The fixed price of wheat, according to the New York Times of the 1st July last, was 2 dollars 39 cents per bushel. In Canada, the fixed price of wheat in September, 1917-No . 1 Northern, at Fort William and Port Arthurwas 2 dollars 21 cents per bushel. I refor member reading that in Canada over 9s. the . per bushel had been received by the farmers for their wheat. Therefore, I do upon not think there.was anything remarkable about the transaction in which the Prime Minister sold the Australian wheat harvest for 4s. 6d. per bushel. In that deal he did not show any great business capa",38
85,Mr RODGERS,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,Is the honourable member contending for a high price for wheat,38
86,Mr HIGGS,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"If we are to pay the heavy' burden of interest on our public debt after the war, our primary producers must get the very highest possible prices",38
87,Mr RODGERS,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,That is quite a new about doctrine from the honourable member.,38
88,Mr HIGGS,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"It is not. I have continually told the House that the city does very not. understand the country, and that people who move about Australia do not realise what the farmers have to contend with. It is useless for the honourable memconber to saddle me with that played-out in political cry of want' of sympathy with the producers. If these prices are to be obtained for wool, wheat, and metals, the Australian public ought to get them, because they have,to pay a very heavy debt.",38
89,Mr RODGERS,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,The honourable member should lay the blame on those who failed poor to build ships two years ago..,38
90,Mr HIGGS,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"The Assistant Minister  cotbest to get shipbuilding going. Previthe ously we had nothing but speeches. As the Sydney Morning Herald put it, "" We asked for ships, ana the Prime Minister gave ns speeches."" But we are making headway now.",38
91,Mr EODGERS,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,The only thing that stands between us and the realization of those prices is water transport.,39
92,Mr HIGGS,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"Are the honourable ber and those whom he represents satisfied with the way in which wool apparently is being handled in London? According to the Melbourne Age of the 11th J uiy, its correspondent says, "" logues were bulky, and with the prices printed against each l o t ; there was no open bidding, as in pre-war days; each buyer held up his hand, to signify which the Empire. lot he wanted."" Is that the manner in which the pastoralists want their wool dealt with? Apparently there was an agreement beforehand not to bid. Instead of sending Home the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) and the Minister for Navy (Mr Joseph Cook) to make busiestablished ness deals, accompanied by"" a publicity officer, it would have been better to send Home some business man. The generally are quite willin g enough to cord the doings of the Prime Minister and the number of viscounts, duchesses, and barons who attend his dinners. In Queensland we are very much conthey cerned as to the position of copper. The Prime Minister is said to have had a great deal of difficulty in ' selling Australian copper. It is said that he could only persuade the British Government to buy copper u n t i l December next. I do not come to Australia after the war. know what - influence he would have the British Government in that regard; but if it is a matter of charity or of ducing the Imperial Government to buy the our products, I presume they would not object to our producers selling their copper to any of the Allied nations who require it . Prices are very much higher in America. According to the Times of the 31st July, copper was 27 cents per in America in 1916, and 29 to 30 cents per l b . in Canada. Therefore, I suggest, that at an early date the Prime Minister should inquire whether the British vernment have any objection to purchasment ing the Australian copper or releasing from any embargo there may ing it to the Allies. I take very great objection to the speeches delivered by the Prime Minister - on matters of public policy, such as post-war trade, his appeal for the establishment of a ieague of English-speaking nations, excluding countries such as Prance, which are allied to us, his speeches concerning Empire trade, and his remarks that we should be a self-contained Empire. If we are to have a self-conmemtained Empire, with Protection against other countries, it means, as . the Conservative Melbourne Argus remarks, Free Trade within the Empire. The Argus wants to know whether the 'Prime M in ister is prepared to subscribe to that docCatatrine. He may be prepared to do so, but I am anxious to learn whether the Government, which he is supposed to be leading, are in favour of Free Trade within I regret that I cannot find in the M in isterial statement any reference to the most vital question that concerns Australia,, and that is the protection of Aus1 the tralian, secondary industries. We have a Eepatriation Department, and we talk of spending millions .of pounds upon settling soldiers on the land. Those press who know anything about the man on the reland and the difficulties with which he has to contend, know that a good deal of money will be wasted on putting more people there. The best manner of preparing to deal with our soldiers when come back to Australia is to impose a Protective T a r i ff sufficiently high to establish new industries and give employment, not only to our returned soldiers, our but also to people whom we expect to On upon various occasions I have endeavoured - to get from the Acting Prime Minister in - - a definite statement of the attitude of Government on - this question. I have framed the question in all manner of ways, to try to extract the information from the Acting Prime Minister. I asked him if he proposed to introduce the Tariff at once. He replied, "" No . "" lb. I asked, "" When does he propose to in troduce the T a r if f ? "" He said he would be prepared to give an answer at a later stage. At a later stage I asked him, "" Is Gohe prepared to say whether the Governw ill introduce a Tariff during the it life of the present Parliament?"" I could be on sellget no definite reply.",39
93,Mr TUDOR,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,The Government introduced an amendment of the Tariff yesterday!,39
94,Mr HIGGS,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"The Government know that, in my question, I refer to a scientific Tariff for the protection of Australian secondary industries.",39
95,Mr MAHONY,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,What about trying the Postmaster-General? He might tell you.,40
96,Mr HIGGS,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"I have no doubt the Postmaster-General has a great deal of sympathy with the proposal;' but the many difficulties he has in putting his Department on a paying basis leave himno time to consider anything else. P>y the time he has succeeded in preparing the plans for the postal halls in the big cities, and generally improving the Service, he will have' little leisure to devote to the question of the protection of Australian industries. That is not his duty. It is, perhaps, his duty, as a member of the Government, to prompt the Government to introduce a Protectionist Tariff; but the Acting Prime Minister is the - man upon whom the responsibility rests of saying what the Government propose to do. Some people are under the impression that the Australian Parliament cannot deal with the question of the Tariff during the war. When aTe we going to deal with it, then ? Are we to wait until the war is over? The honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Archibald) last night asked whether Australian manufacturers had not sufficient Protection at the present time, when no ships were coming to this country to bring goods to compete with them. He asked why they should not come forward now and establish the industries that ought to be established here. The Australian manufacturer has very poor prospects, if he has to depend merely upon the scarcity of imported goods during the present war to protect his industry, because after the war we shall see the most terrific race for trade and commerce throughout the world. I believe all those war-time agreements that are being suggested and prepared by the Prime Minister in London and elsewhere will become null and void, because it will be impossible to carry them out after the war. He is talking of boycotting German goods and German trade here, and preventing the Germans from getting our raw materials. I would draw attention to Foster Eraser's Russia j>f To-day, a book written in 1915, a year after the war started. The passage I shall quote shows that any attempt to boycott German goods after the war, or to prevent the Germans getting our raw materials, will fail, because it will be impossible to carry out such' an arrangement. At page 66, the following - appears:The shops are stuffed with German goods^the inflow of the manufactures of the enemy continues. But you cannot find a shopkeeper in Petrogi-ad who has even a tin whistle of German origin for sale in his store. You proceed to make a purchase. "" It looks rather .German, doesn't it?"" you ask. ""Oh, no, sir; it is English; it has come all the way from England, and that is why it is not so cheap!"" "" There never was a thing produced like that in England,"" you add. NoV the Bhopman says, incredulously, "" then it must be American""-comin g to .the conclusion he had mistaken the nationality of his customer. ""No, nor American; it's German!"" ""Impossible, sir,"" he declares; ""Swedish, may be; very likely it is made in Sweden; but Germanwhy, we are at'war with Germany!"" But it is German make, imported, vid Sweden. That is what is going to happen after the war. If you say you will have nothing to do with German productions, the German will brand them with the name of some manufacturer in Sweden, or Norway, or Denmark, or some other neutral country, and they will find their way here; and no doubt the traders in this country will buy from the Swedes, or the Danes, or the Dutch. I believe many Dutch firms have been established in this country during the war, possibly to take up German agencies. Are we going foolishly to agree to the Prime Minister's proposal that there shall be a system of Empire trade, which is going to subject this country to the competition of German goods that might come through a neutral country, or perhaps through the United Kingdom? While the Prime Minister was supposed to be talking Protection for the Empire, he is reported to have said that what we required was manufactures to come from the United Kingdom, and raw materials to come from Australia. Do honourable members agree to that proposition? I do not, for one; and I do not believe the general public in Australia aTe prepared to subscribe to that doctrine. We have an immense country, with under 5,000,000 people. We are always in fear that we shall be attacked by some, other nation. We are endeavouring to get population; yet we have the Prime Minister preaching these ideas throughout the Empire as the ideas of this Government. It is due to the public that the Government should state whether they believe in the Prime Minister's policy. .1 asked Acting Prime Minister the other day whenot ther he was prepared to give the House the opinion of the Government on Emnow pire trade. He said he would he glad to do so when the occasion arose, and a convenient opportunity happened. asked, also, whether the Government had seen the Prime Minister's statement that he did not pin his faith to a Tariff, to organization. I could"" get no reply from the Government. Ministers appear to be humbugging the House and the people.",40
97,Mr JOWETT,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,What has the Postmaswould ter-General to say to that?,41
98,Mr HIGGS,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"I should like to know what the honourable member has to say it. Is he, a prominent pastoralist, prewas pared to subscribe to the doctrine of tific Protection for Australian industries, or does he want Pree Trade? As one might have expected, he does not reply. Britain. Sell your wool abroad, and import galvanized iron and fencing wire as cheaply as possible is the view of many pastoralof ists. Apparently Protection has very little support in the public life of this country.",41
99,Mr RILEY,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,It does not get much supmy port from the party opposite ,41
100,Mr HIGGS,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"There are fifty-three of them to twenty-two of us. It is sometimes asked why did Mr Tudor, myself, and other Protectionists not do more for tection when the Labour party was in power? It was because there were many Pree Traders in the party-me like the Acting Minister for the Navy  Prime Minister (Mr Hughes).",41
101,Mr TUDOR,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,The honourable memwith ber for Grey was a Protectionist on salt.  sion in which I voted for a duty on salt.,41
102,Mr HIGGS,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"There was a Pree rights Trader who favoured an import duty on grindstones because those articles were made in his electorate. A number of members have spoken in favour of preferportation ential trade within' the Empire - That seems to be the last resort of the Free Trader, who, if he cannot get Free favours preferential trade within the pire to enable goods to be brought here at a cheap rate. I favour preferential trade only in regard to employers who pay the standard rates of wages and give proas the per conditions to their workmen. I do believe in giving preference to any sweater in any part of the Empire. But the most unfair and tyrannical employers in the United Kingdom can send their goods here on the same conditions as I fair employers. Moreover, our preferential Tariff is abused most flagrantly. For instance, I understand that boot laces hut are manufactured in Japan in lengths of thousands of yards, and are sent to the United Kingdom to have the tags put on them. They are then imported into Australia as goods of British origin. We not allow Australian manufacturers to do what the British manufacturers do in this regard. If 25 per cent, of the to labour employed in producing an article British labour that article gets the scienbenefit of our preferential Tariff.",41

104,Mr HIGGS,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"Before the war the firm Messrs. Raphael, Tuck, and Sons had establishments at Berlin, New York, Paris, and, I think, in Saxony. Moir and Sons, the jam manufacturers, had a factory in Spain. One of the things that, to mind, would most quickly bring about the world's peace is preferential trade among civilized countries, where you have the fair employer of labour, who manufactures his goods under proper'standard Proconditions and pays standard rates of wages. Such employers should be allowed too to import their goods at a prefern ential rate, but the importation of the goods of the sweater should be the prohibited. Prior to the war there was in London a union of employers, a capital of £50,000,000, the objects of that combine being "" to consolidate the of the employers of labour of the United Kingdom, and to maintain their and their freedom to bargain individually with free workers, or collectively with trade unionists."" A far more serious thing to Australia than the imof goods from the United Kingdom under the preferential Tariff is the importation of goods from places like Trade, Japan. I do not wish to say a word Emagainst Japan, and shall not do so. I do not wish to reflect on a friendly Power which is-allied with. Great Britain, but any fair-minded Japanese will agree that, we are here endeavouring to establish a high standard of civilization, based, in New South ""Wales, so far as Service is concerned-and it sets an example to private employers-o n a minimum wage of £3 a week, we cannot be expected to allow the importation of goods from countries where workers ceive a few pence a day, and are employed for sixty, and, in some cases, for two, hours in the week. But the greatest danger .which threatens this country, United States of America, France, and other civilized countries comes from China. I was very interested to read an interview with Mr D . R. H all , .the Attorney-General of New South ""Wales, who has just returned from at r ip to 6ploye? China. He said:The labour conditions in Japan may appear children poor compared with our own, but there they The do have certain restrictions on the use of child Chinese labour. In China, there are no such restricto 3d. per tions. English firms in the cotton trade are, in many instances, abandoning the idea of developing their factories at Home, and are devoting their attention to China. I would like to stress that statefacturing nations. ment for a moment, and draw attention to the fact that English firms in the cotton, trade are abanhonorable doning all idea of extending their faclacious tories in the United Kingdom, and are success in industry ? putting up establishments in China. English capitalists are no different other capitalists in that regard. German capitalist is the same. talists all over the world are the real - ternationalists. Honourable members somethink, times speak with great scorn of worker who calls himself an nationalist, and who looks forward to the time when there will be"" The Parliament of man; the federation the world."" They ridicule him, but they sight of the fact that the is the real internationalist. The day I asked the Acting Prime ister if he would take steps to stop the investment of Australian foreign countries, and, in his reply, said he would consider the matter. Government are still considering it, but I venture to say they are not going to make any attempt to stop it. country there are some people who are making money out of the war, and they tries are not going to put all that money the war loans, but will invest it foreign lands. Mr Higgs.",41
105,Mr CONSIDINE,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,What about Japanese the Public capital invested here?,42
106,Mr HIGGS,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"It is quite clear that after, as before, the war, the capitalist will invest his. money in those countries where it is likely to yield him the biggest rereturn, so one need not be surprised at Mr David Hall's statement that the seventyEnglish cotton . mill-owners were not bothering about the extension of their the factories in the United Kingdom, but were setting up factories in China, where they can get labour at 3d. per day.

Knowing that, and realizing how similar cheap labour may be used in other manufacturing processes, I feel justified in believing that, in the future, China is going to be a serious menace to the great manuNo one could hope to compete with her so long as conditions remain special in their present state.",42
107,Mr KELLY,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"Does it not appear to the member that it is rather falto argue that low wages make for Usually the most successful industries are those in which from the highest wages are paid. The Mr HIGGS - The honourable member Capihas stated what I consider to be a partial in - truth, but he will agree' with me, I that if it is possible to get highlythe perfected and almost automatic mainterchinery, operated by child labour at 3d. per day, the pro'duct of that labour will interfere very greatly with the welfare of of operatives employed in the textile industries of this country. lose Mr KELLY - But the general influence capitalist of cheap labour of that kind is to prevent other the introduction of improved machinery, Minand, in that case, it fails.",42
108,Mr HIGGS,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"We all know very well capital in that the capitalist, as a capitalist, is out he to increase his wealth, and if human The labour is cheaper than machinery, he will use i't, as in Mexico, where, I believe, they use stone to grind the corn,, because labour In this is so cheap.",42
109,Mr TUDOR,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"But in the textile indus-practically all countries have adopted into machinery, and in Japan the machinery in is as good as in any country in the world.",42
110,Mr HIGGS,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"A number of very courageous people have stated-and they believe it-that the Allies are out to fight for the freedom and peace of the world, but here we have a country like China, with 300,000,000 or 400,000,000 people, in which the capitalists are prepared to establish industries, the product of which will compete seriously with the labour of the United Kingdom, Trance, the United States, and Australia, where every decent-minded citizen is trying to improve his position, and bring up his family in comfort. In face of this fact, what is the use of the Prime Minister talking about boycotting goods of German origin and Protection for the British Empire? Our aim is to build up Australia, and establish a large population here. This, at all events, is the aim of the Australian Labour party, and possibly it is also the aim of some honourable members opposite. I believe that, if they were free, they would attempt to extend to the people of this country privileges which should be granted to them, but they un. fortunately aTe tied up, generally speaking, with a party which will not allow them to vote for legislation which - the Australian Labour party is prepared to give effect to. . 1 would warn honourable members that every country, the United Kingdom, France, the United States, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and Australia, will have to set its house in order after the war. Each country will have to pass such legislation as is calculated to conserve the interests of its people, and that will mean that, after all the sentimental and idealistic talk about setting up the freedom of the world and the league of'nations, that nation which does not look after its own people by legislative enactments will be left lamenting. For that reason I wish to-night to bring this question of protection for the secondary industries of the Commonwealth before the people of this country, and before the Ministry, in the hope that the Government, if they really believe in Protection, will grasp the opportunity to introduce legislation before the war ends, and so protect our industries, and so also that we shall not be left at the end of the war, subject to . the dumping which will certainly occur if our Tariff is uot sufficiently high to protect Australian manufacturers.",43
111,Mr FINLAYSON,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"Brisbane) [10.31]."" - There is one matter which I am most anxious to' bring under the notice of the Minister for Trade and Customs. Considerable trouble has been caused to the mercantile community by reason of the .issue of certain regulations by the honourable gentleman. With every effort made by the Government to control the affairs of this country in the interests of the people, every honourable member must have complete sympathy, and I believe that in some respects the Ministry are endeavouring to do the right thing. But their action' leaves them open to severe criticism because of the incidence and application of their efforts. The Minister recently issued a regulation which prevented importers withdrawing from bonds more than a certain quantity of goods. From the fact that the Department had considerably to alter that regulation it is obvious that it could not have been fully considered in the first instance. The fluctuations of Customs' business in certain well-defined mercantile items are ofso pronounced a character that there must have been a very serious oversight when the Department framed such a far-reaching regulation without providing for any elasticity in it . The result was that very soon it had to re-cast it. It is a matter for congratulation that the Minister was so satisfied with the representations made by the mercantile community that he consented to certain modifications being effected in the regulation .as originally framed. Had that regulation been insisted upon, a very serious wrong would have been done to many firms.",43
112,Mr GROOM,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,The honourable member approves of the principle of the regulation?,43
113,Mr FINLAYSON,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,It s principle is a very excellent one. I hope that the regulation will not be merely of a tentative character.,43
114,Mr TUDOR,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"It does not accomplish its object, because it very often happens that it is the free goods which the Department desires to reach, and it cannot prevent their removal'from bond.",43
115,Mr FINLAYSON,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"Le t me put the case in my own way. Let us assume that certain ships had discharged portion of their cargoes in Melbourne and Sydney prior to the issue of the regulation, and that they were on their way to other Australian ports when it was issued. Or let us suppose that some goods had been transhipped from their original port of destination to other Australian ports before the issue of the regulation. In such circumstances the firms which had not received delivery of their goods prior to its issue, would be placed at a serious disadvantage as compared with firms which had obtained delivery of them. That is a common erperience in connection with Customs matters. We all know that when a new Tr.riff is laid on the table of this House the new duties levied under it operate the following morning. It has often happened that after a ship has left Melbourne, and before her. arrival in Brisbane, a new Tariff has come into operation, with the result that business people in that city were placed under a .serious disability. I wish to suggest a very reasonable way of overcoming this handicap. I do not accuse the Minister of any desire to penalize any section of the community, but penalization does take place. The trouble, however, can easily be overcome, by making the new rates of duty apply only to goods which are landed subsequent to the imposition of the new duties, and by freeing all the goods in any ship or ships which have landed portion of their cargo at previous ports of call.",43
116,Mr HECTOB LAMOITD,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,Everythin g in bond will be covered by that.,44
117,Mr FINLAYSON,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"I think my suggestion a very fair one. It is obvious that if goods are imported some firms will be able, by reason of fortuitous circumstances, to place their goods on the market earlier than will other firms. Because of unfortunate circumstances preventing other firms taking delivery of goods consigned to them, they are penalized. When a portion of the goods in any ship has been discharged at one port, I submit that the remainder of its cargo should be subject to the same rates of duty as the portion which has been landed.",44
118,Mr TUDOR,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"That is a very difficult matter. Por instance, a man in Perth may take out of a vessel half-a-dozen barrels of whisky, and place the rest of his consignment in bond.",44
119,Mr FINLAYSON,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,The position * s,44
120,Mr TUDOR,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,I know the position.,44
121,Mr FINLAYSON,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"I am aware that the honourable member knows it, because I have discussed it with him, but without convincing him that my attitude upon 1 this question is the correct one. The merchants of Sydney and Melbourne get the first grip upon goods which are imported from overseas.",44
122,Mr TUDOR,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,And in the case of Japanese goods the people of Brisbane get the first grip upon them. .,44
123,Mr FINLAYSON,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"To what extent does that remark apply ? Some firms are unreasonably handicapped because of the unfortunate position which they occupy from a geographical stand-point. I notice in the newspaper to-night an announcement that the Minister for Price Fixing has imposed a very proper embargo on any"" increase in the price of intoxicating liquor until present stocks have been exhausted.",44
124,Mr WEST,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"The honourable member does not drink himself, and so he wishes the "" other"" fellow to be compelled to pay.",44
125,Mr FINLAYSON,VICTORI AN COAL MINERS IN,"I am neither complaining nor approving of the new rates of duty. I am merely pointing out that the mercantile community are always subject to the temptation-and it is one which we could all fall into, no doubt that immediately new rates of duty aro imposed, the opportunity is taken to make an extra profit upon those goods which are in stock and are free from the rates about to be applied. Naturally, the liquor people are after business in the same way as anybody else, and, if not prevented by this temporary arrangement, 'they would at once raise their prices to an equivalent of the rates to be applied under the new duty. There is yet a good deal of relief to be given in addition to that already granted under the new regulations. The Department has been amenable to a certain amount of. reason in regard to recent regulations, and has altered and improved them considerably. But there is much still to be done, and the deciding factor in the whole case is to so arrange matters that traders in one part of the community shall not be unduly penalized as against competitors in others parts of the Commonwealth. I ask leave to continue my remarks. Leave granted; debate adjourned. . House adjourned at 10.42 p.m.",44
