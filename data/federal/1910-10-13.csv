1,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I wish to know from the Acting Prime Minister whether he will take for Government business the time now allowed on Thursdays for the discussion of the business of private members? Thursday is generally a wasted day under the present arrangement, but it should be the best day in the week for getting work done.",14
2,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,Is the honourable member in order in introducing argument?,14
3,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member is not in order in using argument.,14
4,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"In view of the stage of the session which has now been reached, I hope that the Acting Prime Ministerwill give consideration to this matter.",14
5,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"The best answer I can give to the honourable member is to take this opportunity to give notice that on Tuesday I shall move that, during the remainder of the session, unless otherwise ordered, Government business take precedence of general business.",14
6,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,Does the honourable gentleman intend to depart from the promise of die Prime Minister that members will be given an opportunity to discuss the private business on the paper?,14
7,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"So far as may be possible, an opportunity will be given for the discussion of business on the notice-paper in the names of private members.

8,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"Wit h the permission of the House, I should like to make a short statement.",14
9,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Is it the pleasure of honourable members that the Postmaster General have permission to make n statement ? Honorable MEMBERS - Hear , hear.",14
10,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"Instructions , have been issued today to all Deputy Postmasters General that, from and including today, the postage stamps now issued in the various States are to be valid for the prepayment of postage at all post-offices in the Commonwealth, so that from this date letters can be posted in any State prepaid by the stamps' of any other State, and State boundaries therefore no longer exist so far as postagestamps are concerned. Members will understand, of course, that this does not affect the rates of postage, which must ot necessity be continued pending legislation. As a slight memento of the occasion, I have issued instructions that every member of the Federal Parliament shall have a complete set of Australian stamps presented to him.  of the 6th October, in a paragraph headed, ""Experience in Adelaide: Calls reduced, Subscribers - increased,"" that the introduction of the toll system has resulted there in a reduction in the number of calls, and that in Melbourne it has had a bad effect on the number of new subscribers connected during September. I wish to know if that statement is correct? Is it borne out by the official figures, or has.the Age information not in the possession of the Postmaster-General ?",14
11,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"Havin g seen the statement that the number of subscribers had decreased by reason of the introduction of the toll system, I caused inquiries to be made, and ascertained that in September of last year there were 159 applications for telephones in Victoria, and the new lines actually connected were 182 j in September of this year the number of applications was 194, and the new subscribers actually connected 220. It is possible that the Age may have information not at my disposal, but I think that the information furnished by my officers is correct, and ments of the Age are wrong.",15
12,Mr LIVINGSTON,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Postmaster-General whether the Victorian applications for telephones during the month of September, to which he refers, were wholly new applications, or in part old applications carried forward from the previous year, as in other States?",15
13,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Thes e were the new applications in the month of September. DEFENCE DEPARTMENT. NAVAL UNIT ACCOMMODATION - BOY SCOUTS-MR . JOHN OSME-CADETS COMMANDING OFFICERS.,15
14,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,I wish to know from the Minister representing the Minister of Defence if the Victorian Government has provided accommodation for the Yarra and Parramatta i,15
15,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I have had a conversation with the Minister of Defence on the subject. He informs me that only in Victoria and Oueensland has the Commonwealth Defence Department the necessary shops and establishment of men to enable it to undertake the refitting of the destroyers. The berthing accommodation at Williamstown, hitherto allowed the Defence Department by the State authorities, has been encroached upon to such an ex1 tent that Captain Cresswell has reported that there is not sufficient room at our disposal to carry out the work. A communication has now been addressed to the Premier of Victoria, asking him to place suit-' able accommodation, that is - available at Williamstown, at the disposal of the Defence Department, for the purpose indicated.",15
16,Mr FULLER,Unknown,Hav e full inquiries been made regarding the accommodation at Sydney? Can the Minister say whether there is or is not sufficient accommodation there?,15
17,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"The Minister has carefully considered the reply which I have just made known to the House. It is proposed to put together the third destroyer in Sydney; but at Brisbane and Melbourne the Defence Department has staffs specially skilled in the work of re-fitting, and it is considered that these two places offer superior advantages.",15
18,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"What is the special work to be done in connection with the vessels referred to, and what facilities exist at Melbourne and Brisbane that are wantthat the State- ing in Sydney ?",15
19,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,I ask the honourable gentleman to give notice of the question.,15
20,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Has the Department considered the future of the boy scouts? Is it intended to give, them a grant, as has been done in New Zealand, or to merge them into the Defence Forces?",15
21,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"As the honourable gentleman was good enough to inform me of his intention to ask this question, I have been able to obtain from the. Minister the following reply1. The training of Junior and Senior Cadets is rendered universal by .the Defence Act, with the object of carrying out in successive stages the training of boys to take, their place in the Citizen Forces of Australia. it is necessary that the organization should be strictly territorial, and based on the requirements of military efficiency. 2. It is not proposed in any way to interfere with voluntary work of the character performed by the Boy Scouts. Those of them who are within the ages prescribed for military training must, of course, comply with the law, and be trained uniformly ; but there is nothing to prevent their still belonging to voluntary associations and practising with such at times not devoted to military training. 3. The large expenditure on the statutory training, and the many urgent calls upon the purse of the Commonwealth for the creation of reserves of war-like material and initiation of factories for arms and equipment, preclude consideration at the present time of any monetary grant to voluntary organizations outside the present scheme advised by Lord Kitchener.",15
22,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"An Australian soldier named John Orme, who served in the South African War, complains of unfair treatment at the hands of the Imperial War Office. His grievances have been summarized in a pamphlet, which has been circulated amongst honourable members. Will the Minister representing the Minister of Defence ask that inquiry be made into the matter, and, if Mr Orme's statements are substantiated, will the Minister ask the War Office to do him justice?",16
23,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I shall have pleasure in bringing the case under the notice of Ihe Minister.  representing the Minister of Defence what is the intention of the Department with regard to cadets who are outside the areas proclaimed ? In my constituency there are many cadets outside the areas proclaimed, and I want to know if it is intended to disband them. Every one in the constituency is in a bit of a quandary at present as to what is going to happen.",16
24,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"This is a question of which I should like the honourable member to give notice, so that I mav ascertain the Minister's intention. The'effect of the proclamation will be that no recruiting will take place within the exempt areas at present.  but as to the intention with regard to the existing cadets.",16
25,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I ask my honourable friend to give notice of a question as to what will happen to existing cadets in such areas.  senting the Minister of Defence, upon notice I. Does Military Regulation No. 79 provide that officers appointed to command corps hold such appointment for five years? a. How many officers have been retired under such regulation? 3How long has the CO . Victorian Rifles held that position? 4How long was he C.O. Senior Cadet Corps? 5Is not the one corps practically a continuation of the other in that the Victorian Rifles officers and men were taken from the Senior Ladets ?",16
26,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"The replies to the honourable member's questions are as follow :1. Yes, but the Regulation in question applies to the Military Forces only, and does not apply to Cadet Corps. 2. The Regulation came into force on the ist March, 1904 (the date on which the Commonwealth Defence Act 1903 was proclaimed!, consequently no period of command would terminate, under the Regulation, until 28th February, 1909. Since that date fifteen Commanding .Officers have been transferred to the Unattached List, or retired on termination of their periods of command. 3. The Victorian Rifles were formed on the 27th November, 10,06, and the present Commanding Officer has been in command of the Corps since that date. 4. From ist November, 1901, to 26th November, 1906. 5. It is understood that the Victorian Rifles on formation were recruited chiefly from the Victorian Senior Cadet Battalion. The Victorian Rifles, however, is a unit of the Military Forces, subject to the same regulations as other units of the Citizen Forces, and as such is distinct and separate from the Cadet Force. FEDERAL CAPITAL. MODEL OF SITE--MOLONGL O RIVERLOCALITY MAP.",16
27,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"Has the Minister of Home Affairs given attention to the advisability of having a model made on a like Scale to that of the map now hanging in the chamber, showing the contour of the Federal Capital site? Mr KING O'MALLEY - I believe that a model was prepared, and if it is in good condition I shall cause it to be exhibited in the Queen's Hall. If it is unsuitable, I shall have a new one made.",16
28,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"I wish to know how the river on the map referred to compares with the Mississippi? Is it drawn to scale, and what is its width ancl depth? Could destroyers of the river class float on it, and for how far is it navigable? Mr KING O'MALLEY - The Molonglo is not equal to the Mississippi, there being only one river in the world, the Amazon, which is so large, but in many respects it is superior to the Yarra.",16
29,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Will the Minister have the contour map of the Federal Capital site distributed amongst honourable members as soon as possible, and will he have inserted in a convenient corner of it a locality map showing the position of the railway between Queanbeyan and Goulburn and between Queanbeyan and Yass, and showing also the Murrumbidgee and Cotter Rivers, so that honourable member's may know the relative positions on the contour map with those places ? I can assure the Minister that in the absence of a locality map, it is difficult for those .who are not intimately acquainted with the country to know the relative position of places within the territory. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I shall see that it is done immediately. There is no question that a man ought"" to be able to stand off and see where he is going.",16
30,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Will the Minister also see that the position of the proposed Federal harbour is depicted on the map ? Mr KING O'MALLEY - I shall have pleasure in suggesting what the honourable member has asked. NA SECOND READING.,17
31,Mr FOWLER,E XPATRIATION REGULATIO N,"Perth) [11.50] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. In submitting this measure, I shall content myself with stating a few facts which I think will prove that it should be enacted. The White Australia principle is one to which we are all proud to give our arjhesion. We are also proud of the fact that this Parliament was called into existence for the particular purpose of crystallizing the opinion of the people with regard to White Australia legislation. We carried out the duty as well as was possible in the circumstances, but it remained for us to discover in the course of time certain defects in our legislation, and one of these I intend to draw the attention of the House to very briefly. So far as lay in our power we have preserved the purity of the citizenship of Australia within our borders. laid down the principle that only people of the white race shall have the full rights and privileges of Australian citizenship. But we have not followed up the principle as we should have done. It is a very remarkable discovery to me that people, especially young persons, can and are being deprived of their rights as citizens in a way for which the law at present affords no remedy. I have a concrete illustration to put before the House. It is the case of a little Australian girl who has been taken out of Australia by a native of India, and, as far as I can see at present, permanently deprived of her rights of Australian citizenship. In addition to that, she has been apostasizecT. to Mabonupedanism, and is going to be brought up in that faith. Whilst I do not wish to accuse those who are responsible for so training the little girl, of any deliberate intention to be cruel to her, or of improper dealing with her, still those who understand anything about the customs, habits, and ideas of the people of India, will realise that the fate in store for her is something which Australians cannot contemplate with equanimity. I do not know whether there are many more cases of that description, but it is within the bounds of possibility that such cases have happened, and that many more will happen. It is for the purpose of preventing the occurrence of such' cases that I ask the House to pass this measure with as little delay as possible.' BILL. I have, of course, sought to find a precedent in the laws of the Mother Country. While there is a great mass of legislation in connection with the protection of children from unfair treatment, I am unable to find any particular legislation which would deal with such a case as the one I am putting before the House. English law is very definite in its protection of children from actual cruelty'. But I am not able to say in connection with the case I cited that there has been any positive cruelty according to the ordinary interpretation of the word. As regards minors who are possessed of property in England, the Court of Chancery was expressly constituted in order to take charge of their interests. The laws and regulations by which the Court carries out its duties are very specific in regard to the rights of its wards. One condition which is rigorously observed by the Court is that no ward shall be removed from its jurisdiction unless with its consent. Putting together the existing English laws with regard to the prevention of positive We have cruelty to children and the precaution taken by the Court of Chancery against the removal of its wards from its jurisdiction, I think I can fairly claim a precedent for my measure, even in English law. I want to preserve for all White Australians their rights as citizens of this country. I think"" that, even where parents fail in their duty to their children .in this respect, we ought not io allow the ordinary accepted rights and powers of parents over children to stand in our way. Parents certainly are the guardians of their children, and have a very considerable power indeed. But the law always puts an end to that power at the point where ill-treatrnent or injustice is meted out to a child. And with regard to the position I am now indicating, I contend that no greater injustice can be perpetrated on a little white child than that it should be taken into a heathen country and there taught in a religion other than the one which it was born to and would have been brought up in had it been allowed to remain in its native country. And when we contemplate the fate of such a child, especially that of a little girl, in view of the life of women in India, surely we need not hesitate in placing my proposed measure on the statute-book at the earliest possible moment. I have also introduced into the measure protection for the aboriginal natives of Australia. I desire to forbid the taking of an aboriginal native out of Australia for any reason whatever. I remember in the old days, in Western Australia, having heard it stated more than once that aboriginal natives of the north-west were decoyed on board pearling vessels, ancl frequently marooned on the shores on the southern parts of Asia, after they had served the purpose of those who had taken them away. I have no proof that such has taken place; I .have only the talk of those who claimed to have some knowledge of the facts. At the present time, however, there is no protection against aboriginal natives being taken out of the country, and they may be practically kidnapped.",17
32,Mr HEDGES,E XPATRIATION REGULATIO N,Would permission to take .a native out of Australia not have to be obtained from the Protector of Aborigines?,18
33,Mr FOWLER,E XPATRIATION REGULATIO N,"I do not think that would be necessary. If any person brought a native on to a ship about to leave Australia, there is no law to prevent that native being taken away. Permission may or may not have been obtained from the Protector of Aborigines, but it is hardly likely that that trouble would taken; and, at any rate, whether there permission or not, it is our duty to vent these poor people being expatriated, and perhaps left destitute in a country foreign to them in every respect.",18
34,Mr LIVINGSTON,E XPATRIATION REGULATIO N,I do not think many natives have been taken away against will.,18
35,Mr FOWLER,E XPATRIATION REGULATIO N,"I do not think there have been, but the conditions they were going to may have been misrepresented to them. I remember, as a boy, going into one of the shows or exhibitions popular at fair time in the country towns of the Old Country, and finding there an aboriginal native of Australia who performed certain antics, and thus earned money for his employer, or, as I believe now, his master. What became of him I know not, but it is hardly likely that he, having served the purpose of those who had the poor creature on exhibition, trouble would be taken to return him to his native land. At any rate, I am only proposing to do now for the aboriginal native of Australia what has already been done for the native of Papua. It may surprise honourable members to know that under an Ordinance of Papua it is apenal offence to take a native out of the country; but we here, representing the people of Australia, and having duties to perform in regard to aborigines, have neglected, up to the present time, to preserve to them those rights of domicile which are given to the natives of Papua. I have to thank the head of the Attorney-General's Department, Dr Garran, and his subordinates, for the assistance they have so willingly rendered in drafting this Bill in consonance with the Constitution, and with a view to making it as effective as possible. All through I have endeavoured to meet the circumstances as nearly as possible, with proper regard to justice and fair play. I do not think that I have gone any further than I am f u l ly warranted in going, at any rate, no further than I believe the people of Australia will expect this Parliament to go in the protection of their children. Returning to the case of the little girl, 1 may explain that it is over a year ago since a Western Australian, travelling in the northern parts of India, sent a communibe cation to the Perth Sunday Times, in which is he stated that considerable comment had prebeen provoked by the appearance in the district where he then was, of a native of India, having in his charge a little white girl. No one there had the right to question this man authoritatively, but he gave some of those who asked a questheir tion or two, to understand that he was the stepfather, and was taking the child from Australia to his friends in the northern part of India in order that she 4530 should be brought up amongst his shall people. The editor of the Sunday Times communicated with me, and also publows : lished a lengthy protest against such a thing being tolerated by Australian law. ] made inquiries, and discovered to my astonishment that there is no power to prevent an alien from taking a white child out of the country. I had expected that the Department of External Affairs would take some action in a case of the kind, but 1 found that,, having no law behind it, the Department naturally hesitated about doing anything. In order to make perment fectly sure of my ground, I took an early opportunity of visiting the home of the Government of the Punjab, No. 244. , . J ™ ; mother and the alleged stepfather in this 10th State of Victoria. I might say that the Indian had by this time returned, and found him with his wife on his farm in the northern part of the State. desire to accuse either of those people of a deliberate intention to act unfairly, properly, or cruelly towards the little child; on the contrary, I incline to the belief that they think they are doing the best for her. The Hindoo, at any rate, has that opinion, and he has imbued the mother with the same idea. The alleged stepfather seems to be a fairly superior sort of manj and, from all I can gather, he treated the child very affectionately, ancl his attitude was responded to with affection on her part. That was observed by that the officers of the Department of External AiTairs when the Hindoo called at the office in order to obtain the necessary papers to enable him to return to Ausbrother tralia.. As regards the mother, while is to a very considerable extent dominated by the powerful personality of her husband, she feels, I am certain, that what and is being done, and is proposed to be done, children is really for the good of the child. regret that I am unable to adopt that view, and I contend that where there is date, such a distorted vision, as this case shows, of what are the duties of parents, right for the Legislature to interfere. my visit to the parents, I caused inquiries tag to' be made in India through the DepartMardan, ment of External Affairs, with a view to discovering the circumstances under which fpicion the child was living. The request information was promptly acceded to the Indian authorities; and the Department of External Affairs received a report, a copy of which was supplied to me. I Ur.

She is living in the house of Galub Khan, caste Malvar, who is an agricultural adourer and of Nawab Khan. Nawab Khan imported her about August, 1908, and himself returned she to Australia three months ago. In the same house is a native wife of Nawab Khan.

It is rather ungrammatical, but I will read it as it has been forwarded to me. As honourable members will see, it is a written authority given by the wife to her alleged husband with regard to the taking of the child out of the countryMy husband, Nawab Khnn, is going home to his own country, and I (his wife) wishes my little daughter. Leontene Adell Hocking to go with him. 1I have turned to my husband's religion (Islam), and I also wish my . little ter to follow the same, which she cannot do in this country, and I will soon be going home to his country myself; but she is just at the right age to be taught our religion, and that is the full reason I want him to go and take her with him. We have a farm in the country, and we cannot both go at once. Whoever reads this letter will see it is my greatest wish to send my little girl with him and nobody must stop him. I have given my husband her birth certificate to take with him, and if anybody wishes he will show them. [True copy.] S. MURPHY, Registrar, Home Department. There is one portion of the report from India which demands some further attention. It is the statement "" in the same house is the native wife of Nawab Khan."" I thought it was somewhat singular that this man, having a. native wife in India, should come to this country and marry a white woman without let or hindrance. I inquired from the Secretary to the Crown Law Department, State of Victoria, as to whether there was any official record of the marriage between Nawab Khan and the mother of this little girl. I may add that the State authorities have given me very willing assistance in going into this matter, and I wish to mention particularly the names of Mr Callaway, the permanent head of the Chief Secretary's Department of this State, and Mr Anderson, the Secretary of the Crown Law Department. Writing to me on the 24th August, Mr. Anderson saysDEAR SIR, Tn continuation of my note of the 16th inst., I am desired by the Minister lo inform you that he has caused a search to be made in the office of the Government Statist, but no record can be traced of anv marriage contracted in this State by Noab or Nawab Khan, who is alleged to be married to the mother of the white girl Leontene Adell, mentioned by you. In the absence of strict proof that a valid marriage has taken place and that his lawful wife was living at the time he (Nawab Khan) went through the form of marriage with the woman referred to in this State (which does not appear to have happened), it will be seen that a prosecution for bigamy could not succeed. Yours faithfully, W. R. ANDERSON. I suggested that the mail had committed bigamy in marrying a white woman whilst having a native wife alive in India. As there was no record of such a marriage, and as I knew that this woman regarded herself, and passed herself, as the wife of Nawab Khan, I suggested to the Underdaugh- Secretary, Mr Callaway, that perhaps the woman herself could throw some light on the subject. He wrote to me as follows :Chief Secretary's Office, Victoria. Sth September, igio. DEAR SIR, With reference to previous correspondence on the subject of the case of Noab Khan, of Leitchville, who is alleged to have taken a white child to India and returned without her, I have to forward herewith, for your information, a copy of a recent report received from the police officer at Cohuna in connection with the case. I am, & c , Yours faithfully, (Sgd.) LILLIE KHAN. W. A. CALLAWAY, Under Secretary. The report is as followsStation, North-West Police District, 6th . September, 1910. Report of Mounted Constable Docking, 5032, relative to alleged marriage of Mrs KhanI have to report that I interviewed this woman and she stated she was married to Noab Khan according to the rites of the Mahommedau religion, on the 6th January, IQO6, by Mever Abdullah, at 60 Cardiganstreet, Carlton. There were two witnesses present at the ceremony, one of them bein* Marmdeem Tellie, Exhibition-street, shirt manufacturer. She has no marriage lines or any documentary evidence of the marriage. . . . . .1 Noab Khan has now sold his farm to the Closer Settlement Board, and will be giving up possession in March, after which he and the woman intend leaving for India. Having received this letter and its enclosure, I asked the Victorian Crown Law Department whether this was a case of bigamy. Evidently there is some doubt about the matter. ' The Secretary of the Department statesI think whatever ceremony was performed by M. Abdullah had no validity unless Abdullah represented himself as a minister of religion and cither of the parties to the marriage bond fide believed that he was a minister of religion (vide section 17, Act 1166). I made these inquiries regarding the validity of the alleged marriage, in order to ascertain the position in which Nawab Khan stood towards this little white child. If the alleged marriage is not lawful, be is not the stepf ather of the child; and, I think, it is a monstrous state of affairs that an alien can come into Australia, leaving a native wife behind him in his own land, and contract an alleged marriage with a white woman, and that there should be difficulty as to whether he is punishable or not. At any rate,-in the present uncertain state of the law, I cannot ascertain definitely whether Nawab Khan is the legal custodian of the little girl. I intend to follow up the matter somewhat further. ' I think everybody will admit that the position is very unsatisfactory. I have had the utmost difficulty, and experienced much surprise and disgust in arriving at anything like an understanding of the law as it applies to such a case as this. As far as any offence against the child is concerned, the Secretary to the Crown Law Department intimates to me that the law, as nearly as it applies to such a case, is as followsWhoever shall unlawfully take or cause to be taken any unmarried girl being under the age of sixteen years out of the possession and against the will of her father or mother or of any other person having the lawful care or charge of her shall be guilty of a misdemeanor; and being convicted thereof shall be liable at the discretion of the Court to be imprisoned for any term not exceeding two years. (Act 1079, section 52.) The comment of the Secretary is as followsThe position, therefore, is that if the mother chose to appoint Naob Khan as the guardian of her child she had full power to do so. But even if she did not formally appoint him her guardian, it is clear from paragraphs 1 and 2 that Naob Khan committed no crime so far as the State of Victoria is concerned in taking the child to another country if the mother was a consenting party. That is the case. I have brought it to a point at which I must leave it for the present; but I think I have given enough evidence to justify the proposals I put forward in this Bill. Here we have an astounding state of affairs. In spite of our regard for the White Australia principle, in spite of the steps we have taken, as we imagined, to safeguard that principle, a native of India, leaving a native wife behind him, comes to this country and takes up with a white woman who has already had a child by a white man. He goes through a form of marriage with this woman:-a form of marriage celebrated by a co-religionist, a Mahommedan-and then, having assumed the position of husband to the woman and stepfather to the child, takes the child out of Australia to his own country, expatriates Mr Fowler. her permanently, apostasizes her, and assumes control of her future. All this is done apparently without the man incurring any great danger from the law. I think these facts prove, in the first place, that a measure of this kind is urgently required to protect white children born in this country from such a fate; and, in the second place, the relationship set up between this man and the mother of the child emphasizes the necessity for the Federal Parliament taking up, at the earliest possible moment, the whole question of the marriage laws and putting them upon a uniform and more satisfactory basis than they are at present. I do not wish to detain the House any longer. There is very little to explain with regard to the broad provisions of themeasure. Having stated what I think is afair case to justify it, I now leave it,, with full confidence, in the hands of the House.",18
36,Mr BATCHELOR,E XPATRIATION REGULATIO N,"Boothby-Minister of External Affairs) [11.30] - The honourable member for Perth is to be commended for the action he has taken in this matter, and for following up so assiduously Ihe case of the removal of a white child from Australia. The honourable member has been at pains to ascertain the conditionsunder which the little girl was taken away by a coloured alien, and the circumstancesof her life in India. He was extremely anxious to cause her return to die Commonwealth, and I think the House will agree that it would be much better for the 1 child to be brought back and reared amongst people of her own race. There are many difficulties associated with the case, the initial difficulty being that of removing a child from the guardianship of its mother. It is a matter over which this Parliament has no control. The mother in this case is properly the legal guardian, and unless it could be shown that she was a woman of dissolute or drunken habits, unfit to take care of the child, we could not take her from her. Mv. FOWLER - There is no such imputation in this case.",21
37,Mr BATCHELOR,E XPATRIATION REGULATIO N,"No . We have every reason to believe that the mother is kind to the girl, and is fit to control her. Inquiry shows that she deliberately chose, without any pressure, so far as can be ascertained, to have her child brought up as a Mahommedan. She has accepted the faith of her husband, and desires that her child shall also adopt it. She declares that she is bringing up the child under her husband's charge, and she objects to any outside interference. At the request of the honourable member for Perth, the Department of External Affairs communicated with the authorities in India to ascertain whether the child was being properly treated, and received in reply the letter which the honourable member has read to the House. I desire to make from that letter the following short quotation:The child has been taught Hindustani by a European woman, now living in the neighbouring village of Kahdir Khan. The woman is reported to be the daughter of a bandmaster at Mardan, and to have run away from her home several years ago, and married a' tum-tum driver, and become a Mohammedan. There is no suspicion that the child Leon Adell is ill-treated, but her education is being entirely neglected, and the people with whom she is living belong to a low social order, and are very poor. The statement that the girl is living with people of low social order, who are very poor, does not in itself disclose a sufficient ground for a request for her expatriation, more especially as we have the written declaration of the mother that she desires that she shall be brought up in India. The Department of External Affairs endeavoured to induce the mother to have the child returned to Australia, and the Secretary in the following letter intimated to her its willingness to pay the costMadam - In consequence of the interest taken in the circumstances of your child, Leon Adell, the Government recently caused inquiries to be made in India, and have now ascertained that she is living in the house of Gulab Khan, a brother of your husband. The report states that while there is no suspicion that the child is ill-treated, her education is being entirely neglected, ancl the people with whom she is living belong to a low social order, and are very poor. The reference is to inquiries made from the motherIt was understood, when inquiries were made in September last that you intended shortly going to India yourself with a view to living there permanently. In the event of your having altered that intention I am instructed to inform you of the above facts in case you might like to have the child brought back to this country. Should you desire to do so and require any assistance from the Government, I shall be pleased if you will communicate with me. To this communication no reply was received. In response to inquiries made by the Department, the woman had stated that she intended shortly to leave for India, and that with that object in view she proposed to dispose of the farm. The farm has since been sold to the Closer Settlement Board for £ 1 0 ios. per acre, and since it comprised 320 acres it is reasonable to assume that the circumstances of the mother are not such that the child should be kept in poor social surroundings.",21
38,Mr FOWLER,E XPATRIATION REGULATIO N,Was there not a considerable mortgage on the property?,22
39,Mr BATCHELOR,E XPATRIATION REGULATIO N,"I do not know to what extent that may be true, but allowing for the ordinary margin of security on which loans are granted on mortgage, it is reasonable to assume that the mother would have at least ,£500 or j£6oo, and a woman possessing that amount of money .in India would not be considered to be in poor circumstances.",22
40,Mr FOWLER,E XPATRIATION REGULATIO N,I do not say that the child is being ill-treated.,22
41,Mr BATCHELOR,E XPATRIATION REGULATIO N,"Quite so. I simply desire that honourable members shall understand the exact position. The honourable member will admit that, not only my own Department, but the Government generally, have been ""ready to help him in this matter.",22

44,Mr BATCHELOR,E XPATRIATION REGULATIO N,"I was about to refer to that point. The woman has stated that she intends to join her husband in India, and the point that I wish to emphasize is that this Bill would not apply to a case where a mother, being the lawful guardian of her child, had removed it to a foreign country.",22
45,Mr FOWLER,E XPATRIATION REGULATIO N,I think it would.,22
46,Mr BATCHELOR,E XPATRIATION REGULATIO N,"I disagree with the honourable member. Clause 3 deals withWhoever, not being of any European race, takes any child under the age of sixteen years out of Australia. The mother in this case is a European.",22

There would have to be a reasonable presumption that the child was going to be ill-treated, or to be brought up under conditions detrimental to its interests. It would be a difficult matter for the Minister to determine whether a mother had properly taken her child from Australia to live in a foreign country. In almost cases, if the mother were of good reputation the Minister would have to consent a matter of course to the removal of child.",22

49,Mr BATCHELOR,E XPATRIATION REGULATIO N,"I do not think is. But we must not forget that thousands of European women are living with their children in India, and that it would absurd to say that they should not have their children with them.",23

53,Mr BATCHELOR,E XPATRIATION REGULATIO N,"I recognise that that is so. I was merely replying to the statement of the honourable member for Hindmarsh that the lot of a European woman in India is not a good one. Everywholly thing must depend upon the circumstances, in which she is living there. I may say once that I intend to help the honourable member for Perth to have placed on the statute-book at the earliest possible moment a measure somewhat on the lines of that from Australia. now before us. Cases have been brought under the notice of the Department which are infinitely worse than that now under the Indian law. discussion. They relate to the removal of Australian children, and their employment in foreign countries under the most undeAs sirable conditions.

It was alleged that he had treated some of the children disgracefully. But, so far, we have no power to prevent such a person from taking children away",23

69,Mr BATCHELOR,E XPATRIATION REGULATIO N,"That is so. The statements have appeared in the press, but there may have been evidence in rebuttal which is not before me, and I should like to be perfectly fair. I need not harrow the feelings of honourable members by reading further extracts dealing with this case. From the letters of some of the children to their parents here, it is clear that they were cruelly and wrongfully treated. Another case of Ihe kind was brought under the notice of the Department only quite recently, and this has reference to the treatment of the children in another Liliputian Opera Company. A letter was received from the Consul-General at Manilla, referring to the treatment of a boy, named Neil I Connelly. This boy is eleven years of age, and his parents reside in Melbourne. He applied to the Consul for assistance, stating that he had been a member of Liddiard's Liliputian Opera Company, now touring the Philippine Islands, and that, although his contract was only for eighteen months, he had been detained for Court held two years, and, in consequence of this ancl of bad treatment, he had run away from, leav- the company. The Consul writesMr Liddiard and his company are in Mindanao, and will be there for another month or so. Connelly's story has been confirmed by a  boat on which the Liliputian Opera Company travelled from Manilla to Mindanao. This gentleman gives me a very unsatisfactory account of the manner in which the children are treated by Mr Lidrliard - They apparently get of only two meals a day, the first at 11 and the second at 5, and have to reheaTSe every morning for some three hours before they get anything to eat. They get practically no schooling, and some of them can barely read or write the simplest English words. find out These are Australian children.  ceastleman say how many are involved in this",24
70,Mr BATCHELOR,E XPATRIATION REGULATIO N,"The number is where not given. The Consul writes furtherMoreover it appears to me extremely reprehensible on Mr Liddiard's part to take these children to military camps and out of the way places in such a rough country as Mindanao, where they must necessarily be subjected to such as children should not undergo, because she without very good reason. I deem it my duty to bring the above to Your notice, and trust that your LordTt is ship will approve of my action. Of course the money for the return passage was refunded at once. In cases of alleged ill-treatment of Australians in any foreign country, the British Consul, if he considers the case one in which he can help by paying the necessary fares for the return of the injured people to Australia, adopts that course, and sends on the account to the Commonwealth. Of course, we are always very pleased to meet it. We are really very greatly indebted to the kindness of British and other Consuls in out of the way places, who look after white children of Australians, who may have been badly treated, as were the children in the cases to which I have specially referred. Honourable members will admit that the cases I have quoted show the urgent necessity for legislation. We need some power to control the emigration of children under contract. Only last week, I forwarded a request to the Attorney-General's Department, for the preparation of a Bill for submission to this House to deal with these matters. In that measure we shall take power to deal with such cases as the honourable member for Perth has brought under notice, incorporating, if not the words of the Bill, the same idea. In the circumstances I ask the honourable member to agree to withdraw his Bill, because his obiect will be achieved.",24

Such a case as the honourable member has referred to may never occur again. To deal with the other cases legislation is urgent and imperative.,25

82,Mr BATCHELOR,E XPATRIATION REGULATIO N,"I think the honourable member would be well advised in withdrawing his Bill, and accepting my assurance that, at the earliest possible moment, I shall introduce a Bill dealing with the subject, and will endeavour to have it put through.

85,Sir JOHN QUICK,E XPATRIATION REGULATIO N,"Bendigo) [11.59]. e honourable member for Perth is entitled to our thanks for having brought the case to which he has referred under the notice of the House. He has very properly suggested that Commonwealth legislation should be passed to deal with such matters. Certainly the facts which he has narrated regarding the expatriation of a white girl from Australia, and her introduction to India in charge of an Indian, are sufficient to shock one's conscience, and show the necessity of doing something to prevent the repetition of such an outrage. It can hardly be said that the Indian in question had any legal rights - per se, or through the alleged marriage. According to the facts which the honourable member has stated, the marriage was a mere mock marriage, and not a true one. It gave the Indian no parental rights over the child, and the only suggestion is that he may have acquired parental rights by delegation from the woman alleged to have been his wife. .No doubt, at common law a mother or father has the right of control over the - children, and can consent to their exportation or transportation. At the same time, : it is the right of the Government of a country even to interfere with parental rights, if necessary, for the protection of achild, ""if it is found that those rights are abused - or exercised in a manner prejudicial to the 'interests of the child. I entertain no - doubt that, whatever may be the parental rights according to the law of the various 'States, it would be within the competence and province of the Commonwealth to interfere with the exercise of such rights for the deportation or expatriation of - children from the Commonwealth, if in the - opinion of the Government such was being - done contrary to good conscience, equity, and the true interests of the children. Tn this case it is quite possible that the mother - of the girl may have been coerced by her alleged husband into consenting to the taking away of the child.",25
86,Mr FOWLER,E XPATRIATION REGULATIO N,I believe she is largely dominated by her husband.,26
87,Sir JOHN QUICK,E XPATRIATION REGULATIO N,"No doubt she 'signed the alleged consent under the dominating influence of her alleged husband. In such a case it would be the duty and right of the Government to interfere, and, if necessary, to cancel such alleged con-sent to the deportation of the child be-vond the limits of the Commonwealth and its natural home. Under the power given 'by the Constitution to the Federal Parliament to regulate emigration as well as immigration, we have a perfect right to interfere to prevent the deportation of any resi-dent of the Commonwealth, whether of age or under age, in circumstances where interference may be deemed fit and justifiable. Such power can be exercised even to the extent of taking away or curtailing the rights of parents. A law can be passed on the lines indicated by the Minister, or by this Bill , vesting in the Minister or some public official the right either to apply to the High Court for an order prohibiting, or to interfere directly to prohibit, the taking away of a child, or of any person - of immature age, or suffering from some - mental infirmity or deficiency, beyond the limits of the Commonwealth.",26
88,Mr FOWLER,E XPATRIATION REGULATIO N,Hav e we the power to prevent even the temporary taking away of a child from Australia?,26
89,Sir JOHN QUICK,E XPATRIATION REGULATIO N,"I think the power to control emigration would be sufficient to permit of the passing of laws interfering even with parents taking away their children in circumstances in which that may be deemed advisable or according to the exercise of some Ministerial or judicial authority. 'No doubt, as has already been suggested, such a power would have to be exercised with great caution. It would not be wise to pass any drastic law interfering generally with parental rights, but it certainly would be wise to pass a law vesting in some officer, judicial or Ministerial, the power to investigate and examine cases of the contemplated deportation of children.",26

91,Sir JOHN QUICK,E XPATRIATION REGULATIO N,"Particularl y to Asiatic countries. No doubt the power should be exercised judiciously and cautiously j but the case mentioned by the honourable member for Perth shows that parents may be coerced or be induced to improvidently consent to the deportation of their children to countries where the conditions of life are alien to those of the place of origin of the children. It is the duty and right of the Commonwealth fo interfere"" h\ such cases if necessary. As pointed out by the Minister, however, the honourable member for Perth's Bill is limited to preventing non-Europeans from taking away children, and to the specific case to which the honourable member has properly called attention. It may be a special case which may not very frequently occur, and it is to be hoped that it will not. But the Minister has drawn attention to a number of other cases that should properly be dealt with in any proposed legislation relating to the deportation or emigration of children under what are known as contractural conditions. I presume that the children composing those Liliputian operatic companies were originally taken out of the Commonwealth by and with the consent of the parents.",26

97,Sir JOHN QUICK,E XPATRIATION REGULATIO N,"The Minister is also to be complimented on the sympathetic manner in which he has dealt with the problem, properly introduced by the honor-. able member for Perth. I think if he takes the whole of the facts and circumstances into consideration and deals with them in a comprehensive manner, to prevent the deportation or emigration of children, not only in the circumstances mentioned by the honourable member for Perth, but also under contract in the instances which he himself has specified, a good service will be done. circumstances the honourable member for Perth might well accept the advice and assurance of the Minister and withdraw the Bill.  satisfied that there will be a general feeling of pained surprise in the minds of the people when the facts as they have been disclosed here this morning are made known to the country. I am very pleased at the action of the honourable member for Perth in citing a specific case and going so fully into the matter, and am also glad to be able to congratulate the Ministry upon their determination to legislate to meet that case and others that have been mentioned. That twenty-four children should be taken away in one company and badly, even harshly, treated in various places, and in another company an indefinite number of children should also be taken away from Australia, certainly shocks my imagination. The Ministry may feel assured that they will have the whole of the people of the Commonwealth behind them in their desire and determination to so legislate that these things cannot be in the future. I have risen principally to tell the Ministry that they need have no fear of opposition to such a measure. I am satisfied that there will be no delay or objection on the part of any member of the Opposition to putting a Bill of that sort through al! its stages. Of course, as has been well said, such a measure will have to be very carefully drafted, but as soon as it is drafted it has only to be introduced to be carried and become law without delay. The people of Australia are loyal to their own. We do not want to see our children demoralized in any way, and one of the worse possible things that could be allowed to exist under the laws of our land is that children should be taken away from our shores under conditions so detrimental to their physical, moral, and religious welfare.

NA (DEPORTATION OF CRIMINALS) - BILL. SECOND READING.",27
99,Mr FOWLER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Perth) [12.13] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. I understand that the Government are perfectly willing to assist me to put this measure through. The existing law with regard to the deportation of criminals is very imperfect. The section applying to the matter in the Immigration Restriction Act 1901-8 runs as follows :Any person who is not a British subject either natural born or naturalized under a law of the United Kingdom or of the Commonwealth or of a State and who is convicted of any crime of violence against the person shall be liable upon the expiration of any term of imprisonment imposed on him there for' to be required to pass the dictation test, and if he fails to do so shall be deemed to be a prohibited immigrant and shall be deported from the Commonwealth pursuant to any order of the Minister. It will be observed that the only crimes for which deportation is provided under the Act are crimes of violence against the person. We all know that there are many other crimes just as objectionable. Indeed, there are many which are even worse in the interests of the community than those regarding which deportation is specified by the existing law. sired to meet those cases by framing a small measure, which would extend the powers of the Commonwealth in the matter of the deportation of criminals. The result of my efforts in that direction is now before the House in the form of this Bill. But after the measure had been framed, I discovered, somewhat to my surprise, that we are even behind the laws of Great Britain in this respect. In 1905 an Aliens Act was passed by the British Parliament which empowers the Secretary of State to expel any alien from the United Kingdom on conviction practically of any crime. The portion of the Act which deals with this matter is sub-section 1 of section 3, which readsThe Secretary of State may, if he thinks fit, make an order (in this Act referred to as an expulsion order) requiring an alien to leave the United Kingdom within a time fixed by the order, and thereafter to remain out of the United Kingdom(a) if it is certified to him by any Court (including a Court of summary jurisdiction) that the alien has been convicted by that Court of any felony or misdemeanour or other offence for the Court has power to impose imprisonment without the option of a fine. Seeing that this legislation was enacted in the United Kingdom so recently as 1905,'I think I am perfectly justified in asking this Parliament to place our law in regard to the deportation of criminals upon an equality with that of the Old Land. In order to achieve that object, I propose at a later stage to move to amend clause 2 of the Bill by inserting after the Word '' offence'' the words ""or on summary conviction of any offence for which the Court has power to impose imprisonment without the option of a fine."" That amendment would have the effect of bringing the provisions of the Bill into uniformity with the legislation which has been enacted in England in regard to aliens and their deportation. Nobody can accuse us of being extreme if we go no further than that. In order to bring the measure into conformity with the Commonwealth law as regards those matters, I propose, in clause 2, to make an elector's right the proof of citizenship. That, I contend, is undoubtedly the criterion of citizenship in Australia. The Bill is aimed at persons who are not competent to become electors .under the Commonwealth I de- law-in other words, at aliens generally. Any European who can obtain naturalization papers, but who has not resided in Australia sufficiently long to secure them, if convicted of any offence under this Bill, being an alien, will be liable to be deported.",27

107,Mr FOWLER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"The clause, when amended, will provide for the deportation from the Commonwealth of any person who is not an elector, or is not qualified to become an elector, who came to Australia as an immigrant, and who is afterwards convicted of an offence for which the Court has power to impose imprisonment without the option of a fine. It will then be harmony with existing British legislation on the subject. I feel sure that we need have no hesitation in going thus far in the matter of deporting from Australia criminals who have no right to be here, who in the best of circumstances are here only under toleration, and whose presence must certainly be undesirable when crimes are committed by them. The country ought not to tolerate their presence any longer than is necessary to make arrangements for their deportation.",29
108,Mr GLYNN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Angas) [12.25] - I have only just glanced at this Bill, and while I sympathize with the motives of the honourable member for Perth, and agree with him that, as far as possible, we ought to prevent the immigration of the criminal class and provide for their deportation, if they do come here, I question whether we ought to go to the length of British legislation in regard to the matter. 1905 the Imperial Parliament, acting upon a fear that alien immigration-especiall y the immigration of anarchists-migh t lead to unfortunate results if it were not checked, enacted die legislation to which our attention has been directed. Some of the weekly newspapers described it as "" panic "" legislation.",29
109,Mr FOWLER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,It was introduced by the Conservatives.,29
110,Mr GLYNN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"That circumstance does not make it right. Very often the Conservatives pick up the unconsidered trifles' of the Liberals. I recollect that in 1905 there was a general desire in the Old Country to limit the so-called invasion of aliens who, having left the Continent perhaps for reasons which affected their relations to the State, would be out of sympathy with the principles which guide domestic government at Home. The Imperial Parliament thought that the best way to get at these persons was to provide for their deportation when they committed crimes of violence. But if we are to apply such legislation to all cases in which men are summarily convicted, it will mean that a man who is proved guilty of insulting behaviour in the streets, or who has been convicted! of conduct calculated to provoke a breachi of the peace- I am citing the words of the South Australian Act-ma y be deported if he be an immigrant who has not a certificate of naturalization. Ought he to bedeported in such circumstances? Is the fact that he is possessed of criminal inin stincts more injurious to the State becausehe is an immigrant than it would be if hewere not? However commendable may be the motives of the honourable member for Perth, I am afraid that he wishes us to go too far when we come to consider that the evil which he wishes to remedy is notone of very great magnitude.

111,Mr FULLER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"We should have a quorum, [Quorum formed.]",29
112,Mr FENTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Maribyrnong.) [12.33],I think that honourable members are unanimous that the Northern Territory should be"" taken over by the Commonwealth, there being a division of opinion only as to the"" route which should be followed by the railway to connect the Territory with South Australia. For my own part, I intend to vote for the agreement arrived at between' the late Government and the Government ofSouth Australia, which has been embodied in the schedule of the Bill . I find from a perusal of the documents which have been placed before us, and the informative articles which have been publishedfrom time to time, that the Territory is a very important part of Australia, and I believe that with railway communication and proper administration it will become a very valuable asset, though it may be some years before it will return a profit on the expenditure. Its transference to the Commonwealth, and development under the control of this Parliament, will lend importance to it, and will enable it to progress by leaps .and bounds. Even intelligent members of the community think that the Territory is a huge waste, wbereas it possesses a very fine river system, ships of the largest class being able to navigate the Victoria River for a distance of 50 miles from the mouth, and - on the banks of that river there are at least 100,000 square miles of splendid agricultural and pastoral country.",29
113,Mr FOWLER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Is there no bar?,30
114,Mr FENTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I do not know. understand that the approaches to all these Tivers are exceptional. Probably some dredging may be required to remove sand bars.,30
115,Mr SINCLAIR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Expert s are often biased.,30
116,Mr FENTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"A man risking his reputation on matters of this sort by publishing statements for circulation broadcast throughout the Commonwealth would place himself in a foolish position if his opinions were erroneous. I know that sometimes experts are asked to support proposals which will not stand fair investigation, but I do not think that such opinions as are then called for would be given in regard to a big matter like this. Another river, the der, runs 100 miles inland, and through a large extent of rich plains and valleys and 'forest land. Mr David Lindsay, who has - done a great deal of exploration, particularly in Central Australia, is one on whose opinion we can rely, and he says that land on each side of this river is destined to carry a large agricultural population. Vessels having a draught of 14 feet could navigate the Roper River for a distance of 90 miles, the Adelaide for 80 miles, and the Daly for 60 miles. Not only are these rivers and others navigable, but they lend themselves to irrigation projects. Evidently the Northern Territory is a fertile region which can 'be populated by a sturdy yeomanry.  country inland.",30
117,Mr FENTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I believe so. I do not intend to go much into detail, because discussion is unnecessary when the general Opinion is that a certain course of action should be taken. As to the route to 'be followed by the railway, I think that it would be a pity to deviate the line to the east, and thus to neglect a large part of the central area, where there are mineral resources. I understand that gold, silver, and copper lodes have been found, but that, . owing to the difficulties of access and the impossibility of getting supplies, nothing has been done to work them. The mineral wealth and good water supply of the MacDonnell Range country make it advisable for the Commonwealth to give it close consideration. It has been pointed out that the Territory lies within the tropics, and therefore will not be easy to settle with white people. I have long held the opinion that the Britisher can live in any climate if he will only diet himself correctly. Were I I going into an exceptionally hot climate, T should not, like many Englishmen, indulge in bull-beef and beer, my experience being that you must be careful about your food in the tropics. That Englishmen can live well in tropical climates is shown by the. experience of the President of the Board! of Trade, who, for a number of years, f o l lowed the profession of engineer in Egypt. Those who do not pay regard to diet in hot climates die, or have to return to their owncountry. India was once regarded as a dangerous place for white men, but now Europeans live there in comfort, and enjoy good health, because they pay attention to their food. In a pamphlet which has come into my possession, I find it stated that the Goy- line from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek would meet all requirements, as it would traverse the shortest route, and for its whole distance pass through country that can be economically and profitably occupied, while there are no engineering difficulties. I understand that there are three belts of auriferous country which it would traverse, splendid water, and a considerable quantity of timber suitable for sleepers. The writer saysI t is only 1,638 miles from sea to sea, of which 575 miles are already constructed. It can be built without adding one penny to the debt of the Commonwealth. I do not know whether the writer has evolved some scheme whereby the line can be constructed without costing one pennj to the Commonwealth. The Government Geologist saysThousands of miles of this country are highly mineralized and gold bearing. Only recently good gold-bearing reefs have the only water supply there. been discovered to the north-west of the MACDonnell Ranges, whilst in Western Australia they are travelling farther farther in an easterly direction, and covering fresh belts of good gold-bearing country. Both these indications' suggest that the central part of Australia, one might say, has not been prospected all, will afford to the miner of the future a splendid field for profitable operations. All these arguments go to show that the acquisition of the Northern Territory fine national project. I think that in structing the railway through the centre the best route will be taken. The compiler of Territoria goes on to sayFrom Oodnadatta to the northern boundary of South Australia is 120 miles. This is the region, with an annual rainfall of 5 inches, and sons. yet it is fair stock country right_ away to the West Australian boundary, and ibo miles east to the sandhills. A few miles off the route to the eastward are found the wonderful nest of springs, called Dalhousie- a group of springs nestling in a Hollow surrounded by low hills. Here we find hot springs, cold springs, and intermittent springs, all fresh drinkable waterssome with fish, some without-a n inexhaustible supply for all purposes, including irrigation. Some are on top of mounds, some are on level ground. I do not propose to make extensive quotations, but simply, in a very few words, to support the measure. I find that the map which is exhibited in the chamber was merely drawn for the purpose of indicating the route of the railways, the railway systems of the States, and a river here and there. If it were taken as a criterion of what Australia is like it would deceive persons very much indeed. It certainly gives a fair idea as to what the continent is like, but as regards the river system, the lake system, the mountain system, and other things, it is sadly deficient.",30
118,Mr SINCLAIR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,It is not drawn to scale.,31
119,Mr FENTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That may be so, and I am not quarrelling with the draughtsman. I understand that it is practically a copy of a map, which was brought in hurriedly during a discussion last session. The map I hold in my hand presents a very different picture. It is studded with lakes, creeks, and rivers, in parts which, according to the large map, appear to be almost desert country. While one need not traverse the whole length of the Territory to point out its many advantages, this map discloses that it is well watered. In my opinion water which is found on the surface is not I could quote cases to show where, by boring operations, splendid water has been discovered. and It is quite likely that the water in many disof the rivers and streams which flow from the MACDonnell Ranges, and other parts in the centre of the Territory, falls in some which, part of Queensland, but finds its way at there by subterranean passages. It is kept under the surface of the earth, perhaps, by underlying clay deposits, and only has a chance to find an exit in some is a part of the Northern Territory, and to conbe the source of some of the rivers. The Territory is 565 miles wide, by 900 miles long; it has a frontage of 1,200 miles to the ocean, and contains an area of 335,000,000 acres. Its population numbers driest 1,110 Europeans, and 2,056 coloured per",31
120,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The white population has increased and the coloured population has decreased. The total population is now 3,004.",31
121,Mr FENTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It is time that there was a decrease in the coloured population. On the grounds of morality alone, it will be wise for the Commonwealth to acquire the Territory. I believe that, owing to the customs of the people, a mongrel race is growing up, which is not a credit to Australia. From that point of view it will be very wise to have control of the country.",31
122,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,It contains half-caste Chinese and aborigines.,31
123,Mr FENTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The population contains even a greater mixture than that. Indeed, it is hard to tell the colour and the breeds of some of the people. That is very undesirable. Seeing that we have a White Australia policy, we ought to keep the country free from a mongrel race of that type. I find from this pamphlet that the Territory contains splendid deposits of gold, silver, copper, wolfram, ancl many other minerals which might be mentioned It has been proved beyond the shadow of a doubt by pastoralists and others that vast areas are admirably adapted to agriculture and pastoral pursuits. In view of that fact, and of the mineral wealth which' it contains, it is very desirable that the Territory should be taken over by the Commonwealth. I trust that there will be no hitch to prevent the transfer of this splenunless did piece of country as speedily as sible. I anticipate that, under Federal authority and management in the matter of railway and other developments, it will become one of the best parts of Australia. I have very much pleasure in supporting the second reading of the Bill , which hope will pass without amendment.  the last occasion, I voted for the second reading of this Bill , and from what I of the disposition of honourable I think it is likely to be carried without a division on this occasion. I intend refer to some of the important matters Ministry last year? which appear to be involved in the consideration of the agreement. I listened very attentively to the introductory speech of the Minister of External Affairs, and to the views expressed by the Leader of vantages the Opposition yesterday. The latter discussed the question from the broad of its own. national aspect, and seemed to be inclined to waive every minor consideration. Up to a certain point, I am quite in agreement with him. that it was a wise and proper attitude to take. At the same time, I lieve that what is wise in regard to every private transaction is certainly necessary as to very important public transactions. No person ever dreams of going into a venture half informed. But this Parliawe ment is asked to go into a venture which is simply colossal from the point of expenditures which are certain, and expentend ditures which must of necessity be incurred, but with which we are not confronted present.",31
124,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Still , it cannot be greater than that which confronts the people of South Australia now.  only thing which appears to be positive that the State is seeking to drive a bargain with the Commonwealth which is somewhat hard and severe.",32
125,Mr SINCLAIR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The South Australians say that they do not want to part with the Territory.  the situation is that the South Australians do not want to part with the Territory, but if they do so they are insisting upon conditions which are hardly fair to the Commonwealth. In the Ministerial statement not a word was said as to it is proposed to settle the Territory. cannot hope to get a very large number persons to come to the Territory and we are prepared to offer very special posinducements. Before we sanction such a vast expenditure as is involved in the measure, it is incumbent upon us, as the custodians of the public purse to obtain more . information as to wliat the Government propose to do. As regards land tenure, we 1I have some inkling that the intention of the Government party at present is wholly in favour of the leasehold system. Surely we. are entitled to know if the whole of the know Northern Territory is to be settled under members, leasehold conditions.  to ber get that information from the Deakin  know whether Socialistic principles are to prevail aitirely in the Territory. It has been frequently stated here that one of the 'adin passing this measure is that the Federal Government will have a Territory That will be very anomalous. If the phrase, "" A Territory of its o w n , "" meanj anything at all it means that as regards the Northern Territory we shall be a sort of glorified State Government as well . beas a Federal Government, with power to tax the other portions of Australia in order to bolster up and develop a particular area. If .settlement does take place, and big the Territory is developed, as I am sure all hope it may be, the time will come when a demand will be made for the grant view of of some sort of constitution. I conthat the Government ought to outline to some extent their intentions in regard at to land tenure, the conditions which are to be evolved as the inducements to perany sons to settle, and other matters. I am' inclined to think that it will be a difficult matter indeed to get persons to permanently settle in this area while there are available in other States very much richer lands is with more congenial climatic conditions.",32
126,Unknown,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.30 p.m.  was about to express the opinion that if we are to have permanent settlement in the of Northern Territory we must offer some special inducements; and the only inducement likely to be effective is something in the shape of a bonus on the various products of the soil. We are entitled to know what is in the mind of the Government in how regard to the permanent development of We this immense possession. The matter has of been before Parliament in the shape of settle the agreement for over three years; and in that time the Government must surely have considered, to some extent, the questions of land tenure, the inducements to be offered to settlers, and other matters to which I have already referred. Then, when we take over the Territory, what position will the people be in who are already settled there, and who, we hope, will settle there in the future? Will they become Federal voters, with power to send representatives to this Parliament to vote moneys which are paid in the form of taxation by the people of the other States in order to benefit the Northern Territory, or, seeing that the Territory forms part of the Commonwealth property, will they be debarred from any share in elections ? This strikes me. as a very important question, which, of course, also applies to the residents in the Federal Capital area. At any rate, it is a matter for serious consideration; and before we finally accept this agreement we ought to know the intentions of the Government.. We have good reason to complain, as a Parliament, of the nature of the information placed before us, as well as of the scanty amount.",32

That is not a very satisfactory statement from a Minister.  surely does not expect every Minister to. be an explorer?

There is= certainly a good deal of "" puffing or extravagant language,"" in Territoria: the picture is painted in such rosy colours as to represent the Northern Territory as a veritable Paradise on earth.

Undoubtof edly there can be no effective defence of Australia until our population has been mulat least tenfold, and the transfer of mountains the Northern Territory to the Commonwealth has been strongly urged from the 'defence point of view. At page 9 of the report presented to the House by the honland orable member for Darling Downs, when construction. Minister of External Affairs, the following - extract is given from a report by Majoropinion - General J. Bevan EdwardsNo general defence of Australia can be taken unless its distant parts are connected the more populous Colonies in the south and east of the continent. If an enemy was lished in either Western Australia or at Port Darwin, you would be powerless to act against him. Their isolation is therefore a menace the rest of Australia The interests of the whole continent therefore demand that railways to connect Port Darwin and Western Australia with the other Colonies should be as soon as possible. I am not a military expert, but this is deliberate conclusion of one who is: I ture to think, however, that in writing this report Major-General Edwards had not fully considered what Australian conditions really are. If we constructed this through Central Australia, and failed for considerable period to largely settle Northern Territory, the railway, instead of strengthening our defence, would weaken We should have provided for our possible enemies a back road into our populated territory. In support of this contention coming let me point to an illustration afforded by there. the Russo-Japanese war. Russia had constructed a railway across Siberia to Port Arthur, and as long as she could Port Arthur that railway was a valuable asset to her. But as the war developed Russians were driven back, and the line came a most valuable asset to Japan, enthe abling her to convey her troops into the terior of Manchuria.  regard to every invasion.  all countries are not alike. As long as have so much good land available in other parts of Australia, where the climatic ditions are most, favourable, we shall succeed in largely settling the Northern Territory.",34
144,Mr FENTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member's contention is an argument against the Augusta to Port Darwin. railway to Portland. It might be said that that is a good port, which an enemy would choose as a landing place.  conviction that a line constructed . through the Northern Territory, while we have there only a sparse population, would, in the event of war with an Eastern nation, be source of weakness rather than of strength. - ^ , ^  is that settlement has followed railway  in regard to the construction of a line through the centre.of the Territory, I underrecognise that undoubtedly such a railway with will ultimately be constructed, and that the estabNorthern Territory must have railway connection with other parts of Australia if it is to be developed. I strongly favour for to the time being the cheapest and most exthe peditious connection- a line coupling up the Northern Territory with the Queensland made railway system. There is one very cogent reason in support of such a line. The the climatic conditions of the Northern Terriventory are analogous to those of northern Queensland, which is already being settled, and such a railway as I have suggested would be an inducement to those who have line become accustomed to tropical conditions a in Queensland to go further west and octhe cupy the Northern Territory.",35

The development of Northern Territory is more likely to be inbrought about by people from Queensland, who have become accustomed to semi-tropical conditions, than by people from other parts of the world. Railway connection with Queensland could be made many years earlier than could a line from Oodnawe datta to Pine Creek. It would tend to settle the Territory more quickly than conwould any other line, and from a defence not point of view would have the advantage of bringing the Northern Territory into as close contact with several of the State capitals as would a railway from Port There are 90,000,000 acres held under pastoral lease in the Northern Territory, and the Minister has told us that the rentals amount to the enormous sum of 2s. 6d. per square mile. In other words, a lease of 21 acres is secured for i d . The honourable gentleman urged that there were very stringent a stocking conditions in connection with these leases, and that by enforcing them we could compel die leases to be relinquished so that the land would be speedily brought under Federal control. It is just as that the House should know what those stringent conditions are. Fortunately formation on the subject is to be found the report presented to the House by the honourable member for Darling Downs. page 17 of that report we have the statetake to carry out their scheme. ment that leaseholders are requiredTo slock within three years, and keep with sheep, at least five head, or with cattle, least one head, per mile. These are the stringent stocking conditions, and it is idle for the Minister to suggest that if we insisted upon their observance the land under lease would soon f all our possession. Such conditions are simply ridiculous. We should not be prepared take over portion of the railway system South Australia until we are ready to conafter sider the advisableness of federalizing the railways of the States. Why should a railI way in one State be run at the expense, and under the management, of the Federament tion, while the railways of the remaining States are constructed at the expense of those States? It seems to me to be a step which in the wrong direction, and, in view of the £ fact that we are required to treat all States alike, I question whether it is within our Constitutional powers. I hold it to be a cardinal principle that that which we prepared to do for one State we should lie prepared to do for all. It is well known that all the other States have their sure. own railway systems, which, in some cases, are very complete. They have been built at the expense of the States, but this* agreeof many of the nations of Europe. ment binds us to take over from South Australia a big responsibility relating a railway within her own borders.",35

We are titled to learn from the Minister in charge of this Bill , before we accept the agreehave ment, the conditions under which the vernment hope to settle the Northern Tertells ritory. He should tell us whether they propose to create freeholds, and how they hope to induce people to occupy the Terripanions, tory; also whether they propose to give settlers voting powers under the Constitution. These, and other important matwell ters, which will leadily suggest themselves to the minds of honourable members, should inbe dealt with by the Minister. We ought into know exactly what it is hoped to accomplish, and to have some idea of the time At which the Government think it will No time is specified for the construcstocked tion of the line, which is to bridge at the gap between the two existing railways. From what has taken place with regard to the Federal Capital and other matters, I feel satisfied that no sooner is an agreement containing an implied condition that into something shall be done adopted, than a demand is made for its almost immediate to completion. I am sure such a demand will of emanate from South Australia very scon this agreement is ratified. As a member representing an important constituency, claim that my constituents, through me, are entitled to be informed by the Governas to the conditions obtaining in, and the prospects of,- the Territory before we finally commit ourselves to an expenditure the Minister has stated at 1 0 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 ; but which, I venture to say, will ultimately be nearer £15,000,000, taking into account the expenses incidental to are the future settlement of the Territory.",36
147,Mr OZAN NE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Corio) [3.2] - It is with pleasure that I rise to speak to this meaThe fact which impresses me most is the enormous territory that is being offered to us, a territory greater than that It comprises an extensive country, 560 miles to wide by 900 miles long, with an area of 523,620 square miles, of which 426,320 square miles lie within the tropical zone. Its sea frontage is 1,240 miles, and this is with spacious harbors, and the mouths of a number of very large rivers. The most important river in the Territory the Victoria, which empties itself into .the Indian Ocean, near the Western Australian coast. The economic value of rivers to a country as commercial highways is very and in the Northern Territory we have ena number. It has not been my good fortune to visit that part 0? Australia, but I a friend there who has taken up some Go300 square miles. He is a Victorian, and me that this new country is absolutely the finest in Australia. He travelled from Bourke, in New South Wales, with two comright through Southern Queensland and the Territory, and has now decided to take up on lease the great tract of country of which I spoke. The Victoria River, at its mouth, is 26 miles wide. It is navigable by our largest steamers for a distance of 50 miles, and for vessels drawing 3 feet for a further 60 miles. This river will be the means of transport for some of the most valuable land in the Territory.",36
148,Mr HEDGES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Does the honourable member know that there is a fall of about 1,000 feet in the river in 80 or 90 miles ?",37
149,Mr OZANNE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I know that it is navigable. The Goyder, another fine river, is also navigable for some 60 miles, and is capable of opening up an extent of fully 100 miles of country. David Lindsay, speaking of the Goyder, saysThis river is destined at some future date to carry a large agricultural population, and will be the most important outlet for eastern Arnheim Land. Then we have the Roper, the MCArthur, the Adelaide, the Daly, and many other rivers, all of which are navigable. Of course, in some of them the draught of vessels must be very light, but our largest steamers could navigate, for a certain disstance, several of the bigger rivers.",37
150,Mr HIGGS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Can the honourable member say whether the land is taken up along those rivers?,37
151,Mr OZANNE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It is not. Two very large leases along the Roper fell in lately. They comprise good pastoral land which has been reserved for pastoral purposes. Port Darwin, as a harbour, is second to none in Australia. It is considered to be one of the finest in the world.",37
152,Mr SCULLIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Is it equal to Sydney Harbor ?,37
153,Mr OZANNE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Undoubtedl y it is.,37
154,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,It has twice depth of Sydney Harbor.,37
155,Mr OZANNE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It has a depth of from 4 .to 15 fathoms. Of course, the rise and fall of the tide e  ought to be a painter.",37
156,Mr OZANNE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I hear these ""Little Australians "" interjecting, but I stand here as a Nationalist holding that it is absolutely necessary to take over the Territory. Before supporting the measure, one wants to know something about the conditions of the country. I happen to follow the occupation of a farmer. We were told from the Opposition benches recently that no man on this side of the House is interested in the land. I happen to be interested in the land, and before taking over this tract of country one wants to know that it is worth taking over. In the Territory the following areas have been taken up:-Are a held under lease in 1908, 1.29,628^ square miles; in 1909, 108,2441 square miles, showing a decrease of 21,384 square miles. That is accounted for by the fact that two leaseholds on the Roper River have been forfeited, and have been reserved for pastoralists. The area held under permit in 1908 was 33,848 square miles. In 1909 this had increased to 45,379 square miles, or an increase of 11,531 square miles. The leases surrendered or forfeited in 1908 comprised 6,194 square miles, and in 1909 21,384 square miles, or an increase of 15,190 square miles. Permits expired comprised 6,064 square miles in 1908, and 2,060 square miles in 1909, or a decrease of 4,004 square miles. Permits applied for in 1908 were 8,423 square miles, and in 1909 14,936^ square miles, or an increase of 6,513! square miles. The rents received from all this great extent of councountry did not reach a very large sum. They totalled, in 1908, £8,329 12s. 9d., and in 1909, £8,895 S-, or an increase IC| of £565 17s. 3d. The reason why more of this land has not been taken up is the suspension of the granting of land tenures. Although that, to a great extent, has been justifiable, it has at the same time checked the pastoralists from taking up a great extent of country. I hope that when the Federal Government takes control of the Territory and opens up the country with a proper railway system, the population will go ahead by leaps and bounds. To men who are asked to go on the land and work it to the best advantage, the matter the of transport means a great deal. In my district, great numbers of farmers are found congregated in different localities, simply because in those parts good roads are provided, and better facilities are obtained for the transport of produce. In the Northern Territory, we have the Pine Creek railway running several hundred miles south, and then there is the Port Augusta to Oodnadatta railway coming north for some 688 miles, but in between there is a great stretch of country, mostly in the temperate zone, the southern . part of which has no means of transport whatever. The Northern Territory is a kingdom in itself, yet the population is only a little over 3,000 souls. The only redeeming feature _ about the population is that the Asiatics have decreased by 152, whilst the Europeans have increased by 193. It has tbeen said, and to a certain extent rightly, that the country is unsuitable for Europeans. Corporal C. Power, a police officer of nine years' experience in different parts of the Territory, has made the following statements- . Any steady robust European can work all the year. Does not know whether he could compete with Asiatics. Has seen Europeans wellsinking, mining, fencing, & c , on both high and low-lying lands. They are more subject to fever on the low than the high country. Mr C. J. Dash wood, formerly Government Resident in the Northern Territory, statesThe climate around Port Darwin is not particularly unhealthy for the male sex, but it is not very healthy for women and children. These are points on which people differ, but if we can improve the surroundings and give settlers better means of transport, while introducing proper sanitary conditions, I have no doubt that Europeans could live there happily and comfortably. Another important consideration is the rainfall of the country. parts of Victoria, especially the Werribee district, we have had a rainfall as low as 16 inches, but that has been sufficient to insure us fair crops. In the Territory, over 6,300 square miles of country have a rainf all of less than 10 inches, while 2113,430 square miles have a rainfall of from 16 to 20 inches, 96,790 square miles a rainfall of from"" 20 to 30 inches, 120,600 square miles a rainfall of from 30 to 40 inches, and 86,500 square miles a rainfall exceeding 40 inches. Therefore, all that is needed is proper conservation to make droughts of little consequence. The country between Port Augusta and Oodnadatta has been described as a desert, but I found that, although in places the land is thickly covered with stones, and there is .much diorite rock, over two-thirds of it , if there were water, would be as fine as any in Australia. At Beresford, the Government have made a reservoir, which at the time of my visit was filled to overflowing. Four miles from Oodnadatta I saw a Chinaman's garden, the proprietor of which has conserved in the bed of the creek enough water to last him until next April should no rain f all until then. He was growing lucerne, lettuce, peas, and all the vegetables required in the district.",37
157,Mr LAIRD SMITH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Is he family ?,38
158,Mr OZANNE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"He is married to an aboriginal woman, and is helping to increase the mongrel races referred to by the honourable member for Maribyrnong. Although my lucerne in Victoria had not commenced to grow, that at Oodnadatta was 3 feet high at the time of my visit, showing what could be done by irrigation. In general conversation, I picked up all the information that I could, and learnt that round about the MACDonnell Ranges is some of the finest country in Australia. The rainfall in the coastal districts of the Northern Territory is very great. During thirty-two years it has averaged 62 inches; the largest f all for any year being 81.72 inches, and the lowest 42.44 inches. Unlike Victoria, where every climate may be experienced in a week, the Northern Territory has only its wet season, from October to April, and its dry season, from May to September. The heat is not excessive, the maximum day temperature in the dry season being 89 degrees, and the minimum night temperature 56, while in the wet season the maximum day temperature is 96, In and the minimum night temperature 65. It would be necessary to instruct agriculturists going there in the proper treatment of tropical crops. Experts have reported that there are great facilities for the grow- . ing of both lowland and upland rice. To show what can be done by the aid of artesian water, I would instance the date plantations at Hergott Springs and Lake Harry. At the latter place there are about 2,000 palms, planted 50 to the acre, and irri gated from a bore. From thirty-five trees 2,000 lbs. of dates were obtained, and the manager told me that the f r u it sold in Adelaide at 6d. a lb. I ate some of the dates, and found them remarkably good. Geologists declare that there is very richmineral country in the Northern Territory, but, because of the dearness of transit, not much mining has been done there. In 1909, the value of the gold won was £34>9° > and of the tin £ 3 7 , 4 9 6 . Very 2 little copper has been obtained during 1909, owing to the low price of the metal, and the same remark applies to wolfram. When it costs from £3 to £5 a ton to transport ore to the battery, a very rich yield is necessary to give a profit. With railway communication, the difficulties of transport will be reduced. There are great possibilities for pastoralists in the Northern Territory. A rearing a few years back an attempt was made to establish a trade with the East, but, unfortunately, a consignment of cattle sent to the Philippines were infected with pleura. Proper inspection, and the guarantee that the cattle sent away are free from disease, is essential to the success of the meat export industry. In 1907 there were 360,000 head of cattle in the Territory, while on the 30th December, 1908, Victoria Downs station had 76,540 head, and those branded during the year numbered 17,298 head. The cattle sold, however, numbered only 6,000 head. This was due to the cost and difficulty of transit. Dr Holtze, the Director of the Adelaide Botanical Gardens, and formerly Curator of the Palmerston Gardens, says that there is quite enough suitable land in the northern part of the Territory to make it prosperous. He says that there is land suited for tropical products all along the sea coast, and on the banks of the rivers, and that within 80 miles of the coast there is an area of 80,000 square miles, or upwards of 51,000,000 acres, capable of supporting hundreds of thousands of persons with its produce. Victoria, it may be remembered, supports over 1,000,000 persons on an area of 56,000,000 acres. Farmers there could engage in the cultivation of rice, tobacco, maize, Indian corn, cassava, cotton, and many other tilings. Some of the bore water is mineralized, but some of it is quite fresh, and fish have been found in a number of springs. South Australia took over the Northern Territory in 1863, since when she has built the Adelaide to Oodnadatta railway, which has a length of 688 miles, at a cost of £2,242,000, and the Port Darwin to Pine Creek railway, at a cost of £1,266,000. On the Oodnadatta line is a splendid piece of engineering work, the Angebuckina bridge, which is 1,900 feet long, and cost something like £60,000. As doubts have been expressed as to the condition of the permanent-way, let me say that, although I travelled over it at express speed, the easy running of the train was in marked contrast to the violent oscillation of the Adelaide-Melbourne express. sleepers appeared to be in perfect order, and the railway is one of the finest and smoothest that I have had the pleasure of travelling on.",38
159,Mr ARCHIBALD,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Train s run over line at a rate exceeding 40 miles an hour.,39
160,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It shows that the line is properly laid, ancl in good condition.",39
161,Mr OZANNE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"South Australia tackled a very big problem when it took over the Territory in 1863, and has endeavoured !o the utmost to cope with the responsibilities of the position. Large sums of money were spent in prospecting votes, and on surveying and exploring parties; and South Australia has to be congratulated most heartily on the fact that she tried to keep, and has succeeded in keeping, this great Territory white. Had the example of another State been followed and black labour introduced, there might have been some financial gain, and probably it would not have been necessary to ask the Commonwealth to take over the administration now. To her everlasting glory, however, South Australia, as I say, has kept this vast part of Australia white. Furthermore, while other States pursued the policy of alienating as much land as possible, South Australia, out of a total acreage of 353,000,000 acres, has parted with only 473,809 acres. There are at present under pastoral lease 99,000,000 acres, with a currency of from twenty-five to forty years, and provision is made for resumption on giving two years' notice and paying compensation. It is proposed by South Australia that the Commonwealth shall assume all the liabilities in respect of the Territory, taking into account the cost of the line projected in order to connect with the Pine Creek line, and ultimately to form a transcontinental line from Adelaide to Port Darwin. The yearly deficit on the Northern Territory is at present £164,398; the sinking fund 011 the railway from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta is £77,694; and the interest, at 3J per cent., on £4,500,000, the estimated cost.of the railway from Port Darwin to Pine Creek, represents £157,500. The Commonwealth will thus, under the agreement, haye to meet a total loss of £399,592. The public debt on 30th June, 1909, amounted to £2,718,939; the deficit on advance account to £779,734; the cost of the Port Augusta to Oodnadatta railway was £2,242,342; and the estimated cost of the railway from Pine Creek to Port Augusta is £4,500,000- a total of The £10,241,015. On the total acreage of the Territory, this works out at an average of 7d. per acre; and, in view of the facts we have before us, we may conclude that the Commonwealth is getting a great barthe gain. Of course, against the £10,241,015, there are assets. So far as the loans are concerned, they will only be taken up as they mature; £8,000,000 is represented by railways, and the balance by lighthouses, wharfs, and developmental works. One or two honourable members have objected to the Commonwealth paying for the construction of the Port Augusta to Oodnadatta railway. From personal servation, I can say that that railway not built for any advantage that it might give to South Australia, because, at the various railway stations, there are not townwealth ships, but, as a rule, only two or three houses. The idea of building this railway was to open up the Northern Territory, particularly the country around the Maclike Donnell Ranges; and, under the circumstructed stances, it is the duty of the Commonwealth to assume the responsibility for the diture. I differ from the Minister, much as I believe we ought to take expert advice, with a view of running the proposed line through the best possible country that can be found. Such a policy would be' in the interests of the State of Australia, because, apart from its importance from a defence point of view, the line would be used as a means of tapping the wealth of the country; and the more Australia. good country the line runs through the more wealth there will be directed to Augusta and to Adelaide. I have sire to see the railway carried outside Northern Territory; but it would be in my opinion, to draw a hard-and-fast as to the route. If land to the east or west found to be of greater value, then the line should be slightly deviated in that direconly tion. In time to come it will be necesin sary, as elsewhere, to build railways t'o Commonwealth. other centres; but that is not a matter for consideration now. The honourable memhonorable ber for Echuca said that any man engaged in a private transaction would look ahead in order to see whether it would result benefit to himself. Well, I have looked nhead, and I see great possibilities in the Northern Territory. Port Darmission, win is as near to the eastern States as Adelaide. The East we know is awakenmay ing, and this great unpopulated territory is practically the gate of Australia. is absolutely essential that the Govern the ment should take the control of this of the continent in the interests of the tection of the whole. The dark races, which increase at a great rate, and now number hundreds of millions, must at cast a hungry eye on this great tract country, which offers so much attraction to them by reason of its climatic conditions. It is essential that there should be extenpart sive settlement by white people in the inmonsoonal terests of the whole of the Commonwealth. more If the Commonwealth take the Territory over, it will be our own country, which we can govern by our own laws, untramobmelled by any interference from State was legislation. If our laws are of such a character as to involve ruin to the country, all the blame will lie with the Common; but, of course, if the - States had power to interfere, as they have in many matters now, we might, to save ourselves, put the blame on them. I should to see the transcontinental railway conas soon as possible, because, in the event of foreign invasion, it will be expennecessary to have quick transport. As inasto the intervening space, I suggest to the Government that, instead of sticking to the old system of railways, they should consider the advisableness of adopting the mono-rail invention, which is now South within the realm of practicability.",39

On his own adhis information is second hand; is but, in view of the fact that the Territory be taken under the control of the Commonwealth, one hesitates to find fault It with declarations as to the possibilities of country it contains. The honourable part member for Corio gave a particularly atprotractive account of the climatic conditions. I do not propose to back my opinion against his, but it is just as well, perhaps, that the times report of the Commonwealth Meteorologist of is available. That gentleman saysDuring the six months (slimmer) the conditions are moist and humid, and for the most trying, owing to the persistent indraft of winds from the equatorial seas. During the remainder of the year conditions are endurable, for, although temperatures are warm,- the dry prevailing S.E. trade winds from the interior and Western Queensland render l i fe enjoyable, and at times possibly exhilarating. I do not think that is very encouraging.",40
165,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The Government Meteorologist is speaking of the very worse part of the Territory.,41
166,Mr SINCLAIR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,It would appear that the only exhilarating breeze comes from Queensland.,41
167,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The honourable member would not condemn Queensland because of the climate of Cairns?,41
168,Mr SINCLAIR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The climate of Cairns is good. I do not intend to oppose the second reading of the Bill j but, in Committee, I shall have something to say in regard to certain clauses. It is advisable that we should know what is the responsibility we are taking over. seven years the South Australian Government have been trying to develop this Territory; and in 1895 Royal Commission was appointed to inquire into the reason of the failure. Its report is included in the memorandum drawn up by the ex-Minister of External Affairs, who was very friendly towards the movement. In regard to the reasons for failure, we have this statement in the memorandumWhat causes have led to these results? Have the measures been inadequate, or their execution faulty? Does the country not justify the glowing accounts which its enthusiastic admirers have so freely circulated? After nearly forty years had been spent attempting to develop the Territory, State Government were furnished by a Royal Commission appointed in 1895 with a report giving the following general reasons for the failure of their efforts(a) Most of the township blocks and agricultural lands within 40 miles of Palmerston were bought from the Government in the first instance by speculators, who demanded excessive rents or prohibitive prices from those who were willing to utilize them. In other words, the Territory has been landlocked. We have '-here the same old cry in regard to the necessity of bursting up large estatesib) The sale of land orders before the land had been surveyed. I find it difficult to understand how' this could have contributed to the failure develop the Territory. I think that sales before survey did much to develop New South Wales(c) Government lands could only be taken up after survey at 7s. 6d. per acre and heavy survey fees, and that all applications had to be sent to Adelaide, involving a delay of from six to twelve months. Seven shillings and sixpence per acre deesnot strike one as being a very high pricefor good land. If one of the reasons for the failure to develop the Territory was the delay caused by having to send applications for land to Adelaide, will there not be still greater delay if applications have to be dealt with at the Seat of Government? I do not know whether the Government intend to administer the Territory from theSeat of Government or-elsewhere, but this is a matter on which we should have someinformation. The report continues[e) The failure to complete the survey within, five years, according to agreement with the landorder holders, which involved the Government in numerous litigations and expenses, amountisgto over ^73,000, and generally overloading thecolony with expenses improperly charged by For forty- the South Australian Government. It appears that the South Australian Government granted land orders and were not a in a position within five years to survey the lots which had been purchased(/) Discontinuance of railway at Pine Creek. That, no doubt, is a legitimate excuse, for we must recognise that railways, or some other means of communication, are essentiaf to the development of every country(g) The failure of the Government to recognise in its management of the Northern Territory the distinctly tropical character of the greater portion of the country. I emphasize the word "" tropical ""(h) The absence of a bold and vigorous Government policy in the administration of the colony. in The reasons for failures in connection withi the mining are given as follows(a) Mismanagement, inexperience, extravagance, and the erection of obsolete and other unsuitable machinery. (4) High wages demanded by European miners, which led to the Government being induced to import Chinese labourers. tc) Insufficiency of capital to develop properties. (d) Lax administration of the law in regard to working conditions. . (e) Distance from large centres of popula-* tion. (/) Inaccessibility and consequent expense 0/ transport."" (g) Permitting the Chinese to engage in mining pursuits and hold mining; leases. With regard to the pastoral failures, the to reasons are thus summarized(a) Speculative gambling in leases. (i) Too large leases for lessees to comply with the stocking conditions. (c) Insufficient capital of lessees, who were too frequently only the nominees of banks and mortgage companies, which charged high rates of interest. (d) Heavy initial expenses; depredations by aborigines. I do not know what remedy the Minister of External Affairs proposes for future depredations.",41

As to the decline in the price of stock and wool, that is a disadvanably tage under which the whole of Australia has that. had to labour.

(i) Bad management, extravagance, and incompetency. (c) The absence of suitable labour. (d) Want of confidence in the industry on the part of capitalists who were unwilling to invest.

190,Mr CHANTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I am approaching this matter without bias, and, I hope, from a national view-point only, irrespective of State interests.",43
191,Mr SINCLAIR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Did I mention the question of route?,43
192,Mr CHANTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I understood the honourable member to say that he would \ote for the second reading of the Bill, but that if in Committee it was insisted that the line should go through the Territory, and nowhere else, he would reserve to himself the right to vote against the final passage of the measure. If I have misunderstood the honourable member, I beg his pardon. This matter ought to be approached with an absolute forgetfulness, if possible, of what State one belongs to. It should be regarded from two points of view only ; first, that it is absolutely essential to get railway communication with Port Darwin in the most direct manner, and as rapidly as possible, for the purpose of defending the whole Continent; and, secondly, that it is necessary to develop the Territory. No one will have the temerity to deny the necessity of rapidly making provision for the defence of Australia. One has only to look at the map to see how ridiculous some of the suggested schemes are. I take it that the object of South Australia, in building the railway, was to develop the Territory. She incurred a large debt by constructing a line from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta, and another from Port Darwin to Pine Creek. On the last occasion that this matter was discussed in the last Parliament, parochialism was just as rampant as it is today. The honourable member for Parkes, on that occasion, made some extraordinary statements about the line from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta. Some of them have been refuted today, and I shall not refer further to them, except to say that the honourable member's assertion that it was absolutely unsafe to travel over the line at a greater speed than 15 miles an hour is absurd. I The have demonstrated that to my own satisfaction by travelling over the line at 40 miles an hour, and can say, without hesitation, that I never travelled on a smoother line. A great many statements have also been made about the Territory itself, and the country between Port Augusta and Oodnadatta. It is useless for any honourable member to take up the time of the House by making statements which cannot be verified, regarding matters of this kind. I have been connected with land all my life, in pastoral and agricultural pursuits. I know what land is, and what it is capable of bearing. It is quite true that, on a great part of the land traversed by the line which it is proposed to take over, no grass is growing, but some of the best grazing and fattening country in Australia is not grass, but bush country, and on the land in question any amount of bluebush, saltbush, and other edible plants are growing. Part of that country is also one of the finest grounds that I know of in Australia for the breeding of horses. I have not had the opportunity of traversing the country between Oodnadatta and Pine Creek, but I have conversed with a number of men who have been in that territory, and particularly with men who have been to the MACDonnell Ranges for mining purposes. They have no interests to serve, and are not even resident in South Australia, but they have told me, and I know them to be veracious, that the Northern Territory contains some of the finest pastoral and agricultural country to be found in the whole Continent. That statement has great weight with me, comproper ing as it does from men upon whose word I place much reliance. We are asked why the mining industry does not go ahead there. A number of honourable members who went to Oodnadatta saw the means of transport afforded'. The South Australian Government, for financial reasons, had to cial burden. stop the line at that point, and there is a considerable distance intervening between it and the MACDonnell Ranges. The mines require special classes of machinery, but the only means of transport is by camel. If a line of railway were put through from Oodnadatta to the MACDonnell Ranges the tive suggestion. most up-to-date machinery could be carried to the mines, and I am credibly informed that the ranges would be peopled by hunand dreds of miners who would get a sible, really good living there. I have also conversed with members - who visited the Northern Territory at the other end. I did not accompany the party, and, therefore, could not form any conclusions for myself. I admit that opinions are very divided as to the value of the country there, but the House has to consider whefrom ther it is wise, in the interests of Australand, lia, to allow the Territory to be occupied and controlled by any other power than the Commonwealth. I think not. South Australia is to be congratulated on at least keeping it free from an influx of coloured races. The agreement simply asks that the money that has been expended on the two lines of railway should be repaid to South Australian Government, and that the Commonwealth should take over the burden of the interest and annual loss, the developThe ment of the Territory probably converting that loss into a gain.",43
193,Mr R EDWARDS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"And also build long railway. If that were left out, I think we should be unanimous in taking over Territory.",44
194,Mr CHANTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"In view of all the threats of invasion that we hear, if the railway is left out of the agreement we might as well drop the whole matter. The line should be built to connect north and south, in order to convey our defenders to the hand. vulnerable point of the Commonwealth quickly as possible. At the time the procurry posal was initiated, the Sydney and Brisfrom the boundary of the Territory. bane interests began to move. They proshould duced from the pen of Mr Alexander Wilto son, whom I know personally, a railway scheme, and indicated that, unless that scheme were accepted, all the forces of those interests centred in Brisbane and Sydney would oppose the taking over of the Territory. If , however, Mr Wilson's suggestion were carried out, every one of the members who support it, as is evidenced by the speech of one Queensland member today, would be prepared to take over the Territory, even with twice its present finan",44
195,Mr CHANTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member for Moreton. I do not wish to attribute motives, but let me compare the line proposed in the agreement with die alternaThe first would travel from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek, via Alice Springs, Barrow Creek, Tennant's Creek, Daly Waters in as direct a line as poswith only the necessary deviation to get through the MACDonnell Ranges. I am told by a gentleman representing South Australia, and I believe him, that the grade to get through the ranges would be one in eighty. That ought to present no engineering difficulty. The proposal of those opposed to the agreement is to run the line Pine Creek to Camooweal, in Queensand thence to Cork, Thargomindah, Torowangie, Broken Hill, and Mildura. Let me test the patriotism of a number of those who have spoken by asking whether it would not be wiser to build the direct line between Pine Creek and Oodnadatta, and let the States assist the development of Australia, and also of their own country, the by making a few connexions ? In that way we should have two strings to our bow, if the necessity arose for defending Australia. Queensland and New South Wales Governments could, by arrangement, build a line of railway connecting Bourke and Cunnamulla, a distance of about 100 miles. a Cunnamulla is already connected with Charleville. The next connection necessary the would be between Charleville and Longreach, a distance, I should suppose, of about 150 miles. ",44
196,Mr CHANTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I am going only by the scale on the map that I hold in my From Longreach to Cloncurry as would be about a similar distance. Clonis only a comparatively short distance I judge the distance from Cloncurry Tennant's Creek to be about 250 miles. 4556 Northern Territory [REPRESENTATIVES.] The Commonwealth could assist the development of the Territory and the defence cf Australia by building a connection from Tennant's Creek to the border, and the. State of Queensland could connect from that point to Cloncurry.  Pine Creek line?",44
197,Mr CHANTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It is a narrow gauge line. I hope to see the gauge difficulty settled by the Commonwealth getting control of the railways of Australia, and introducing uniformity. Western Australia - seems to be forgotten in the proposal under - consideration. It is intended to connect Kalgoorlie with Port Augusta, and we need the aid of Western Australia for the defence of the continent; but if the central line were diverted to the east, troops travelling from Perth to Port Darwin would have to take a very roundabout route.  - think that the enemy will let us pick our battle-ground ?",45
198,Mr CHANTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Naturall y the enemy will attack us where we are weakest, and at present Port Darwin seems to be the likeliest spot for an attack. We must, therefore, strengthen it with fortifications, and provide railway communication from the various centres of population. The sooner the Commonwealth takes control of the Territory, the better it will be in the interests of the whole people. South Australia could not be expected to burden herself by the construction of a transcontinental line for the defence of the Commonwealth. In my opinion, the agreement entered into by a former Government is a fair one. It has now been before Parliament on several occasions, and I trust that this Bill to ratify it will become law as soon as possible. The present and future interests of Australia make it necessary that we should obtain control of the Northern Territory at the earliest moment.",45
199,Mr FINLAYSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Brisbane) [4.20] I cannot allow this important measure to pass without having something to say about the proposals before us, though I should have preferred to hear the views of others before continuing the discussion. I must preface my remarks with an appreciation of the indebtedness of Australia to the State of South Australia for its courageous action in taking over the Northern Territory in 1863, and preventing its occupation by coloured races. No praise can be too extravagant to apply to the action of Acceptance Bill (No. 2). the State in that regard. Unfortunately her forty-seven years of administration have been an admitted failure. Although o v e r £5>ooo,ooo has been spent in the Territory during that period, development has been very slow, and there is an annual loss of nearly £250,000. One of the worse features of the matter is that the population is decreasing. South Australia, in 1880, had a population of 276,393, and in 1907, a population of 392,664, while the population of the Northern Territory in 1881 was 3,435, consisting of 670 Europeans and 2,765 coloured persons, and in 1909, twenty years later, the population was 3,014. This is a saddening state of affairs, though, fortunately, the figures show that the European population has increased by 1,274, while the coloured population has decreased by 1,740. According to the memorandum on the Northern Territory, issued in July, 1909, by the honourable member for Darling Downs, who was then Minister of External AffairsThe net result of the land legislation is seen in the table showing the areas over which the Crown, either temporarily or permanently, has parted with control, but although the pastoral industry has in parts been well established, the population returns show that the country is still practically uninhabited. The Government Resident, in his report for 1.909, says that we are faced with a grave responsibility by reason of the ever-increasing number of half-castes. In 1895 a Royal Commission, appointed from South Australia, summarized the opinions of witnesses regarding the causes of the unsatisfactory condition of the Territory in the following wordsThe failure of the Government to recognise in its management of the Northern Territory the distinctly tropical character of the greater portion of the country. The absence of a bold and vigorous Government policy in the administration of the Colony. The non-success of mining was said to be due toMismanagement, inexperience, extravagance, and the erection of obsolete and other unsuitable machinery. Lax administration of the law in regard to working conditions. The pastoral industry did not prosper because ofSpeculative gambling in leases. Too large leases for lessees to comply with the stocking conditions. The absence of ' near or suitable markets for the stock. The want of permanent water in many districts. The failure of agriculture was attributed stone toThe survey and subsequent cultivation of land unsuitable for agriculture entailing a loss to those engaged in the industry. Bad management, extravagance, and incompetency. I have no desire to find fault with the administration of South Australia. Indeed, when one looks at the map, and sees the immense distance between Adelaide and its settled districts and the Northern Territory, with no other communication than that provided by steamers, one cannot wonder at the result. Although South Austtalia has borne the burden of administration bravely for many years, it is thought the time has come when the whole Commonwealth should take it over. It has been stated that the expenditure, which it is proposed that we shall take over, amounts to only 7Jd. per acre, which seems a ridiculous price to pay for the land, but in view of some of the reports upon the country, the price might well be extravagant. I am not so much concerned about the bargain that is being offered to us. It is not only the cost now that has to be considered. We have to face the fact that not only is there a heavy loss on the administration at present, but that the expenditure to which we are asked to commit ourselves means an increasing lossone which no one has been able, or has attempted, yet to calculate. As to the character of the country, I shall content myself with reference to a map issued under the direction of the Minister for the Territory, Mr O'Loughlin, and prepared by the Government Geologist, Mr Brown. This map divides the Territory according to the character of the lands into pastoral, good pastoral, and first class pastoral country. As to pastoral country, we are toldPastoral country well watered, good soil, rivers and creeks; tropical vegetation and coarse grass, good feed after burning; subject to tropical rainfall (54 inches Port Darwin, and 19 inches Daly Waters, for 1905); parts metalbearing and probably coal-bearing. Approximate area-158,00 0 square miles. I do not know very much about the pastoral business, and its technical details ; but I know that if grass is good only after burning, it is coarse, rank, and practically of no use when not burned.",45
200,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,That is a matter of not having sufficient stock.,46
201,Mr FINLAYSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The good pastoral country is thus described:Good pastoral country, often rich volcanic soil, well grassed; basalt', sandstone, and limehills, wide plains, and river flats; wellwatered ; subject to intermittent tropical rains. Approximate area-34,30 0 square miles. Of the first-class pastoral country, we are toldFirst-class pastoral country, open, wellgrassed, rich soil, possibly agriculture; subject to intermittent tropical rains. Approximate area-29,00 0 square miles. That is what is know n as the Barkla-y tableland.",46
202,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,No ; it is the Victoria Downs country.,46
203,Mr FINLAYSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I am not responsible for the statements made in this document. That land is, I believe, really first class country, and is admitted to be so by all experts. We are further toldPatches of g'ood country for pastoral purposes, chiefly along creeks and rivers; patches of spinifex scrub and sand hills; uncertain rainfall; parts metal-bearing. Approximate area-148,00 0 square miles. Honourable members will see that that is the part which will be traversed by the proposed transcontinental lineSpinifex scrub and sand-hill country, witli patches of inferior pastoral country; badly watered and uncertain rainfall ; parts metalbearing. Approximate area-162,10 0 square miles. ' That is all I propose to say in regard to trie character of the country. I should be quite prepared to vote for the second reading but for the unfortunate conditions that are attached to the Bill. Honourable members seem to be practically unanimous that it is our urgent duty to take over this Territory, but there is one point of difference which is so absolutely important that, unless it is removed, I shall be prepared to vote against the Bill at every stage ",46
204,Mr SCULLIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Is it more important than the taking over of the Territory?,46
205,Mr FINLAYSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I think so. What along I propose is to show the absolute absence of any necessity for this proposed railway - to show, not only its ihopportuneness^ but its uselessness. The difficulty of the situation is much intensified by the attitude of the Minister of External AffairsWhatever obstacles there were when the measure was previously before the House are increased now by his attitude of "" the agreement as it stands, or nothing."" If there were any indication on the part of the honourable gentleman that in Committee he would be prepared to accept suggestions, or permit some departure from the uncompromising conditions laid down, the Bill might very well be allowed to pass. the second reading, when we could join forces,- and endeavour to make it a good, useful measure.",46
206,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It is an agreement tween two parties, one having accepted i through its Parliament.",47
207,Mr FINLAYSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Yesterday , we had the Leader of the Opposition telling us that this same agreement was interpreted in one way when previously before the House, and is now being interpreted in quite a different way. I confess myself unable to underto-day stand the position of the Leader of the Opposition, who is prepared to - accept the Bill , although not because he thinks conditions are right, for he regards them as tions. wrong.",47
208,Mr SCULLIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,He helped to,47
209,Mr FINLAYSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"And apparently he objects to them because he did help make them; and, as I say, I cannot underAsiatic stand his attitude. If we are asked to swallow the agreement whole, we - excused from accepting the Bill . If I have to be tied down to "" Yes "" or "" No , I must say "" No , "" even if the result be loss of the measure. And if the measure be lost, then all the responsibility for continuation of the present state of affairs must rest on the South Australian ParliaBoer ment. Personally, I should refuse to acpress cept any responsibility so long as the South Australian Government presented simply the two alternatives-accep t the agreement as a whole, or reject it . The honourable member for Riverina told us that the necessity for this transcontinental way was primarily for defence, and secondly for development. As former, I think I am going to strike rather an unusual note. I may say at once that the argument as to the necessity for this Tailway for defence purposes seems to altogether unreasonable, unnecessary, wide of the mark. I ami not at all alarmed at what we are told about the dangers invasion via the Northern Territory. If there is any danger of invasion by way the Northern Territory, there is equal tion. danger of invasion in any other part of northern Australia. No part of northern Australia is in any way protected from vasion. Port Darwin, if any place, would ""be best able to repel an invasion, if one were attempted, because there we have some settlement. We have been told that the Asiatic hordes to the north of Australia are fearful and menacing; and I have no wish to minimize our risk in that direction, because it is a danger to Australia to be in such close proximity to those overflowing countries. At the same time. I am not afraid of invasion. It will be beadmitted, I think, that the whole of the t northern coast is open to invasion equally with the Northern Territory-that there is no more danger in the Territory than anywhere else. Therefore, if this line has to be built for defence purposes, it has to accomplish a certain object in regard to defence. There is no power in the world that has facilities to land a sufficient force in any part of Australia, or, if a force were landed, to keep up the line of the communication with their base of opera",47
210,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Coul d not Japan do make them. so with her present fleet?,47
211,Mr FINLAYSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Japan , I should to say, would be the least able of all the forces to do so at the present time.",47
212,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Sh e could land her may be forces here in three weeks.,47
213,Mr FINLAYSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"An enemy must be "" able not only to land a sufficient force, but the to maintain that force here-to find food, clothing, and munitionsof war, and keep the up an unfailing line of communication. AVe can well remember, in the case of the war, how it was admitted by the of the world that no other nation than the British could have carried on operations at such a distance, and that Britain was enabled to do so, only by reason of the enormous shipping tonnage at her disposal.",47
214,Mr FENTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Look at the difference in railthe distances!,47
215,Mr FINLAYSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Distanc e is only a to the comparatively small matter when we remember the fact that there is no Asiatic nation with anything like the transport facilities necessary. No nation in the world me could land from 10,000 to 50,000 men in and any part of the Northern Territory, and there make them self-supporting; and, of as I have said, all supplies would have to come from their base of operations, thus of necessitating a clear line of communica",47
216,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,An Asiatic enemy would find all the conditions to which he inis accustomed in his own country.,47
217,Mr FINLAYSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"But an enemy would not be able to stay sufficiently long to grow the necessary food. The proposed transcontinental railway would afford the most roundabout means of reaching an invading force in the Northern Territory. If the advantages of such a railway were believed by an enemy to be. as great as some. honourable members appear to think they would be, then, in the event of its construction, the invaders would simply divert their scheme, and land at some point where we had no such railway communication.",47
218,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Por t Darwin is the only port in northern Australia at which a considerable force could be landed.,48
219,Mr FINLAYSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"An invading army could be landed in the Gulf of Carpentaria, or at certain points along the northern and north-west coast of Western Australia. We have nothing at Port Darwin to repel an invading force.",48
220,Mr FENTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Does the honourable member pit his opinion against that of Lord Kitchener ?,48
221,Mr FINLAYSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I think that I shall be able to fire Lord Kitchener's opinion very effectively at the honourable member. I have always been impressed with the belief that it is very easy to land an invading force in a foreign country, but most difficult to maintain one there, or to withdraw it. Very soon after an invading force hacl landed in Northern Australia, the British naval power would cut o(f its line of communication, and we should have it entirely at our mercy.",48
222,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The British naval power is in the North Sea.,48
223,Mr FINLAYSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"And also in the Pacific. In any event, why are we proposing to expend. £2,000,000 on an Australian navy unless that navy is to be available to cut off an enemy's line of communication when it has succeeded in effecting a landing on our shores ? If the Minister of External Affairs were directing the expansion of Japan, and in that capacity seeking a foothold for an army in Australia, he would be the last to suggest that the invasion should be made at an unoccupied point. It is only reasonable to assume that an invading force would strike at Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, or one of the other State capitals. No enemy would think of landing an invading force 1,000 miles distant from a centre of population. would aim a blow at one of our large centres. Is it reasonable to assume that an invading force would be landed at a point from which it would have to march 1,000 miles with a view of striking at one of our large centres and of capturing the strongest place that we held? No invading force would lie likely to land in the northern part of Australia with that object in view. The only danger is that an enemy might land, and become permanently located there, because of our difficulties in sending up an army to dislodge him. On this point, let me make a quotation from the report presented by Lord KitchenerI would also mention that railway construction has, while developing the country, resulted in lines that would appear to be more favourable to an enemy - invading Australia than to the defence of the country.",48
224,Mr LAIRD SMITH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,That is a reference to the break of gauge.,48
225,Mr FINLAYSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I am coming to that. Different gauges in, most of the States isolate each system, and the* want of systematic interior connection makes the present lines running inland of little use for defence, though possibly of considerable value to an enemy who would have temporary command of the sea. In one of his speeches here, Lord Kitchener advised the people to decide upon a definite railway policy for Australia.",48
226,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,And transcontinental railways north and south ?,48
227,Mr FINLAYSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"He did not even suggest such a foolish scheme. He urged that we should proceed immediately to develop an Australian railway policy, and to form a railway council of war. He emphasized the point that we should decide upon a standard gauge; that we should link up our State railway systems, and have our railways so controlled that we should be able to rapidly concentrate our forces and aim an effective blow at any point on the coast. It seems to me that for defence purposes we should have railways constructed, so to speak, in a semicircle, running at an irregular distance from the coast, and linking up the lines stretching inland. In this way we should have at the termini of our present systems railways that would not only provide facilities for the people, but be of material assistance for defence purposes. They would greatly facilitate the work of dislodging an invading force at any point. Our coastal regions will necessarily be for all time the It most populous parts of Australia, and if we have an army it must be drawn from the populous centres. Unless we have reasonable railway facilities to convey, that army from those populous centres to any likely point of attack, our scheme of defence must fail. We need to link up our existing railway systems and make them feeders of one grand Federal railway scheme that will enable us to command any and every point. Before we adopt a railway policy of any kind we must determine the question of a standard gauge. Some years ago a conference of State Railway Commissioners unanimember mously agreed upon a standard gauge of 4 f t . 8J in . , yet we are asked today to ritory line? accept a proposal that means, according to the estimates submitted, the building line over 1,000 miles in length on a gauge that is declared to be unsuitable and incontinental line? effective.",48
228,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,We have not fixed upon any gauge.,49
229,Mr FINLAYSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"But all the estithree-fourths mates in regard to the cost of this transtouch with it . continental railway are based upon - a 3 f t . 6 in. gauge. I trust that before the Federal Government tie themselves to any particular railway policy we shall determine the gauge to be adopted, and that by means of a conference or a committee of experts we shall enter upon a bold national policy of railway construction that will have as first and most essential purpose the giving of reasonable and suitable defence facilities. The present proposal to construct a transone continental railway connecting Adelaide with Port Darwin does not come within that ideal. Before we could entrain troops at Port Augusta we should have to draw them fields. from Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney, or favour Brisbane, and we should then be faced with the difficulty of carrying them across a great stretch of country to Port Darwin. All up by a railway. who have given any attention to the question agree that the future population Australia will be chiefly concentrated along the eastern coast-line. The trend of population is very largely eastwards from Adelaide and thence towards the north, and that concentration of population will become more marked in the future. Whatever proposals we may have for our defence, we must not forget that the forces we hope to put into the field at Port Darstages win to repel this largely imaginary invasion must be drawn from the centres of populatheir tion, and that the proposed transcontinental them. railway could not help us much in that spect. If they were drawn from Melbourne we should have first of all the difficulty the break of gauge at Port Augusta. I they were drawn from Sydney there would foe the break of gauge at Albury, and again on the South Australian side; whilst if they were drawn from Brisbane there would be those districts. three breaks of gauge to overcome. If are in search of the longest possible route Port Darwin for our forces we shall tainly build the proposed transcontinental railwa>",49
230,Mr TUDOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Does not the honourable think that other State railways would be linked up with the Nordiern Ter,49
231,Mr FINLAYSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Who can imagine of a that ""New South Wales would build railways to link up her system with the trans",49
232,Mr TUDOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Sydne y will soon be linked up with Broken Hill , and if Sydney, Adelaide and Melbourne are connected with the transcontinental line, we shall have of our population in close",49
233,Mr FINLAYSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"If a line were carried from Port Augusta to Broken Hill , thence towards Cunnamulla, and finally to Port Darwin, the present railway systems could be linked up with it. The development of the Northern Territory must be considered - in connection with the proposed its transcontinental line, and that development must relate to its mineral, pastoral, and agricultural possibilities. We are told that reason why we should spend £5,000,000-and that is a very conservative estimate-o n the building of this line, is that it would develop extensive mining Of all the arguments advanced in of building this transcontinental line that surely is the most foolish. No valuable mining field in Australia today was opened",49
234,Mr FENTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,What about the Coolof gardie and Kalgoorlie fields?,49
235,Mr FINLAYSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The principal mining centres in Australia had proved their value before a railway readied them.,49
236,Mr ARCHIBALD,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Broke n Hill had not.,49
237,Mr FINLAYSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Every piece of mineral country has been developed by railway communication, but in their initial our mining fields were not associated with railway construction. They had proved stability long before a railway touched Some of the gold-fields that have rebeen opened up, including some of the most precious and valuable mineral counof try in Australia, have had to stagger along f under very serious disadvantages through want of railways, and we are only beginning to find out now how necessary and useful it is to extend railway facilities to But honourable members we must not overlook the fact that mining has to never yet permanently settled any country. cerAny part of the country that depends solely upon mining is always in more or less danger of losing its population. There are plenty of places in Queensland which ""Were originally mining centres, but as the .""mineral value decreased the agricultural prospects came to vhe front, and develop.ment took place in that way. pure ancl simple neither develops a country nor permanently, settles a population on it. That is naturally so, because mining - must in time work itself out of existence, - although, of course, the richer and wider the field the longer the process takes. Dotted all over Australia can be found numbers of places which were at one time - mining fields, carrying hundreds or thousands of people, but which now carry only a handful, or in some cases none at all. ' It is obvious that mining interests fhem*selves would not justify the building of a mile of railway anywhere, unless there ""is something behind them, or a guarantee ""that the field is wide and rich enough to - return a reasonable income for the expense ""involved. Mining, therefore, on its own account is by no means a tangible or satisfactory reason for building this transcontinental railway. The next consideration is the pastoral interest, ancl it must ""tnitted that the Northern Territory offers very wide and valuable prospects for pastoral occupation. It may be generally accepted that whatever hope we may have - of usefully occupying the lands available in the Territory is based on pastoral occupation. The major portion of the count r y is suitable for that only. to the statistics furnished by Mr Brown, the South Australian Government Geologist, there are thousands of square miles of pastoral country of more or less good - quality in the Territory. It has been already stated in the debate that we have in the centre of Australia possibly an ideal place for horse-breeding- a country where horses might be able to roam for many hundreds of miles - From the very fact of the' poor character of the country, and of the horses being compelled to scratch, as it were, for a living, we should be able to raise a very valuable and hardy breed there. You will always get better horses, and, in fact, better animals generally where they have to go to some trouble to get their living. same thing applies to the human animal. A man who has to work hard for his (living, to scratch and plot and plan, and think carefully of whatever he does is the man that develops well, physically and mentally, whereas the man brought up in the lap of luxury, who has neither to plan nor to work, is the effeminate sample of human animal that we occasionally see. There are hundreds of miles of country in the centre of Australia where, owing to the Mining poor character of the land, we could produce a breed of horse most suitable for any work requiring endurance.",49
238,Mr FENTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,He would be a very attenuated animal by the time the honourable member had finished with him.,50
239,Mr FINLAYSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"So far from that being true, the honourable member would find if he took a trip to Shetland or Norway, or even down to Port Melbourne or Williamstown, to interview the officers on the Terra Nova, that the short, thick-set enduring ponies are got, not from warm, but from cold countries, where they have absolutely to starve for their living. However paradoxical that may sound, it is true. It is the very fact that these ponies are starving all the time that makes them so hardy and enduring, ancl able to assimilate their food when they'do get it . Possibly, if a few more of the members of the House were be adto keep up the active life we previously led, instead of the rather lazy, life that we are compelled to live now, we might be more vigorous mentally as well as physically. Pastoral occupation is by no means synonymous with population, and no .railway can be built for pastoral purposes only. We are particularly asked to According take the Territory over in order to populate it, and no railway yet made for purely pastoral purposes has ever paid for axle grease. In Queensland railways were run out into the pastoral country in years gone by through the influence of the squatters. They never paid until a new method of populating the country was devised. They were a continual loss to the State, and if the proposed transcontinental railway is to be built for pastoral purposes it will mean building a line that we know will be a yearly increasing burden, saddling us continually with a heavy deficit.",50
240,Mr FENTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member is depreciating the property that he intends to take over. The Mr FINLAYSON - I am giving my idea of the country, derived not from personal knowledge, but from the information supplied to me by the South Australian Government Geologist. If his statements regarding_ the character of the country are wrong, then I suppose that my arguments based on them are also wrong. The third phase of development that would justify the building of a railway is closer settlement, which is an' urgent necessity in Australia. In spite of all the statements made by honourable members opposite, either in the House or through the press, I say. emphatically, as a member of the Labour party, that I should welcome any scheme of immigration that would settle the people of the older countries on the lands of Australia, and put those lands to profitable . use. We are not opposed to immigration, but are prepared to give a hearty and cordial support to any reasonable scheme that means the opening up of the lands. Closer settlement will, of necessity, extend from the coast inland. The idea suggested by the building of the transcontinental railway is that we are going to settle the Northern Territory from the centre outwards. As a matter of defence, it is necessary to settle the population of Australia along the sea-coast; indeed, the only closer settlement possible in Australia is in those districts. Our worse difficulty lies in the fact that the most valuable agricultural lands, which have easy access to the sea, are locked up; and men desiring to go in for agricultural pursuits have to go any distance from 100 to 500 miles out into the back country, where they are handicapped by having to draw their supplies long distances and pay extravagant railway freights before their produce can reach the markets. The extent of the agricultural development of Australia will depend on the possibility of finding markets for produce. I am sure that the Federal Parliament will not follow the foolish policy adopted in New South Wales of centralizing all the trade of the State into one port. I believe we are willing, to let the trade of the country find an outlet at its natural ports. It is, therefore, our business to see that easy access to the sea is provided for the men carrying on agriculture in the interior. But does any honourable member know of agriculture in the form of closer settlement that is being carried on at a very great distance from the coast? ",50
241,Mr FINLAYSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That is the very outside distance. Looking at the map of Australia we see that the agricultural lation, generally speaking, occupies simply a thin margin around the coastline.",51
242,Mr ARCHIBALD,NORTHERN TERRITORY,That only proves want more population.,51
243,Mr FINLAYSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It proves that whatever population we may have in the of closer settlement in the Northern Terrisettlement. tory will of necessity be located near the coastline of the Territory. The agricultural population of Australia, as I have said, is settled along the coast, which is where we need population for defence purposes.",51
244,Mr OZANNE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Our best land is not near the coast.,51
245,Mr FINLAYSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The land near the coast is more suitable for agriculture than that further inland, not merely because of the character of the soil, but because it is easy of access, and has cheap means of transport. At a distance varying from 100 to 400 miles from the coast, are to be found rich river flats and valuable agricultural areas, on which close settlement is possible. If settlement increases in the Northern Territory, it will be situated chiefly in the coastal districts. It is not likely, however, while extensive areas are available in other parts of the continent in reasonable proximity to markets and centres of population, that many persons will isolate themselves in the Northern Territory. People will not bury themselves in the wilderness when they can get land in settled districts close to market. Probably there will not be much settlement in the Northern Territory for many years to come.",51
246,Mr ARCHIBALD,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Would the honourable member be surprised to find 500,000 persons settled there fifteen years hence?",51
247,Mr FINLAYSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I should be exceedingly gratified. But, during the last forty-seven years, the population of the Northern Territory has decreased, and I do not see that the transfer of the administration from South Australia to the Commonwealth will make much difference in the immediate future.",51
248,Mr ARCHIBALD,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"If Queensland were governed from Perth, it would be as badly off as is the Northern Territory now.",51
249,Mr FINLAYSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The Northern Territory, if governed from Melbourne, would not be much better off than if governed from Adelaide. Before men take up land, they consider, not only the possibilities of popuobtaining produce from it, but the means for marketing that produce. What means is there for marketing produce grown in the we Northern Territory ? Nothing could bemore absurd than to assume that the construction of the proposed transcontinental way railway line will tend to produce close",51
250,Mr LAIRD SMITH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Then why are railways stretching out into the interior of Queensland ?,52
251,Mr FINLAYSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The one district in the Northern Territory suitable for close settlement is the Barklay tableland.,52
252,Mr ARCHIBALD,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The honourable member says that because the district is near to the Queensland border.,52
253,Mr FINLAYSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I have always made it a practice to believe the best of others, even when they differed from me, and the honourable gentleman's insinuation is unworthy of him. The natural outlet of the produce from the Barklay district would be by the water-courses which run into the Gulf of Carpentaria, on which small steamers or lighters could carry it down to the larger vessels, which now trade from there to the eastern coast of Australia. Furthermore, the Queensland Government contemplate making a railway from Cloncurry to Camooweal, which will tap the Barklay tableland. The proposed transcontinental railway would not serve that district at all. Settlers on the tableland would not send their produce 200 . or 300 miles in preference to sending it 100 or 150 miles. Naturally, they would select the cheapest, easiest, and speediest means of transport. The Queensland Government is today more alive to the possibilities of the northern parts of Australia than that of South Australia seems to be. Produce grown on the Barklay tableland would either find an outlet by way of Camooweal, VVinton, and Longreach, to Rockhampton, or go north to the Gulf of Carpentaria. The history of our railway construction is the history of attempts to divert trade from its proper channels, and in the case of New South Wales the result has been the aggrandisement of Sydney at the expense of the State. I hope that the policy of the past in this connection will not be continued in the future. I object to the Commonwealth Government undertaking a spasmodic or partial railway policy. Before we construct railways, we must know what is to be done. I do not understand what right the Constitution gives us to struct railways in State territory without State authority, but, in any case, difficulty is likely to arise where Commonwealth and State railways are in the same district.",52
254,Mr BAMFORD,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"All difficulties of that Seine! will be settled by the passing Bill. the Mr FINLAYSON - I am not an enthusiast for the federalization of the railways, because, while it might have great possibilities, it would have serious disadvantages. It would be a good thing to have a uniform gauge, and the freest intercourse between the States; but it is questionable whether the time is ripe for the federalization of the railways. The passing of the Bill, however, will commit us to a partial railway policy, and no Commonwealth railway policy is commendable which will not be national and comprehensive. While I am opposed to heavy loan expenditure for some purposes, I would welcome the borrowing of money for the development of the country by railway construction. Nothing tends more to progress than the providing of railway communication. Although no time is specified in the Bill for the construction of the proposed transcontinental line, we should be expected, if the agreement were ratified, to make it within a reasonable time. It is estimated that the line would cost about £5,000,000, but we shall have to provide also for rolling-stock, and meet an annual loss of £250,000 on the administration of the Territory, together with the loss on the existing line from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta and on the line that has to be made. At a very low estimate, this would mean an annual deficit of £500,000. We must pause before committing ourselves to such an arrangement. The expenditure of the Commonwealth is increasing by leaps and bounds, and one of the arguments used against Federation is that it is increasing the cost of government enormously. Our revenue is' expanding, but our expenditure is also increasing very rapidly; and yet it is coolly proposed, on the invitation of South Australia, to load ourselves with another £500,000 of expenditure per annum in order to make up a deficit. I think I have established the fact that there is no hope of any return from this railway in the near future in the way of providing revenue towards the deficit, or towards the repayment of the original loan.",52
255,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The burden will be con- no mOre than South Australia is carrying now.,52
256,Mr FINLAYSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,And it is because South Australia finds the burden too heavy that she is trying to shift it.,52
257,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The honourable member says that it is unreasonable to ask the of my Commonwealth to carry the burden; but South Australia is now carrying it.,52
258,Mr FINLAYSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"South Australia is only carrying the burdenof the administration of theTerritory, and the loss on the railway. I am heartily in favour of immediately relieving South Australia of this burden; indeed, I go further, and say that, if South Australia .will name its price for the Northern Territory, I am prepared to stretch a good deal to that end, and thus afford the Federal Government an opportunity to develop the Territory. That, however, is a very different proposition to asking the Commonwealth to undertake an expenditure which is estimated at £10,000,000, but which, I am prepared to say, will reach £15,000,000 to £20,000,000. There is no hope that, during the next fifty years, this railway will yield any reasonable amount towards the working expenses.",53
259,Mr MATHEWS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"We have only to develop the gold-fields in the MACDonnell Ranges,and the line will pay at once.",53
260,Mr FINLAYSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"H a d the honourable member heard my argument, he would have been satisfied that no railway solely for mining or pastoral purposes has ever paid; the only railways that pay, or are reasonably likely to. pay, are those constructed to encourage closer settlement.",53
261,Mr MATHEWS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,How about Kalgoorlie? There is no agriculture .there.,53
262,Mr FINLAYSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"All the mining fields of Australia had proved their value before they were touched by railways. No doubt the railways assisted the development of gold-fields, but mining of itself is not sufficient reason for railway construction, because it offers no guarantee for permanent settlement.",53
263,Mr MATHEWS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,On e instance to the contrary is Kalgoorlie.,53
264,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,And what of Broken Hill?,53
265,Mr FINLAYSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I have talked much longer than 1 expected; and I shall close with a word or two in regard to our national policy. I am well aware that honourable members will heavily discount my attitude, because I am a Queerislander; but I am prepared to be misunderstood and misjudged, and told that I am prejudiced. At any rate, I have the approval of my own conscience. If I have one regret in regard to the map exhibited on the wall of this chamber, it is that itshows the boundaries of the States. It seemsincreasingly difficult to divest ourselves of our particular interests in our particular States, but it s increasingly necessary that ; we should forget that we belong to' thisState or the other, and that we should approach a question of such tremendous importance as that now before us in a national spirit. Whatever other honourable members may say in regard to my position, I am trying honestly and fairly to look at this question fromanational aspect. For that reason, I could have wished that all theboundary marks of the States had been ob=literated from the map; and I commend toMinisters and others who may have to sub-. mit maps to this Chamber not to encourageState ideas in this way. It would be a greater advantage if we could obliterate from our mind the fact that there are divisions between the States. The Senate may be justified in taking another view; but in this Chamber we ought to forget for the time that we come from the north, .the south, the east, or the west. It is because I feel that we are not yet ready for aFederal or national railway policy that I hesitate by my vote to commit the Federal Government to the building of a transcontinental line; and the more so because the agreement not only commits us to the building of the railway with all its disadvantages, but also the taking over of an existing railway in South; Australia. What the position will be when the Federal .Government owns and controls a railway in a State I do not quite know; indeed, I do not think that the question has ever yet been discussed. I do not think, however, that it would be conducive to satisfactory working for the Federal Government to run a railway in a State, because that must of necessity lead to competition. According to the agreement, we are bound to take over the railway from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta, and carry goods and passengers at present rates. We are thus absolutely tying our hands for an indefinite time, so that we shall be able to develop this line only in the way that South Australia chooses to permit us. In my opinion, South Australia is trying to drive too hard a bargain. If my South Australian friends would realise that there is a national question behind all this, they would' reserve to themselves the right to run their own railways, and would not be willing tohand over their line to the Federal Government. To do so is altogether anticipating, the policy of the Federal Government, whatever that policy may be; and it is necessary now to go very carefully. I am just as anxious to conserve the interests of South Australia as I am to conserve the interests of any other State; and I am not favourable to the idea of the control of even this piece of line being handed over to the Commonwealth.",53
266,Mr FENTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I can hear the honourable member's crocodile tears falling!,54
267,Mr FINLAYSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"As I said before, I am quite prepared to be misunderstood and misjudged. I cannot see that the proposals before us will conduce to that Federal and fraternal spirit which we are all so anxious to develop. We should encourage each State to develop its own territory as far as possible consistent with the rights and privileges of other States. I suggest that our South Australian friends should, if possible, abandon their "" stand and deliver "" attitude, and should allow the route of the railway, which is the only question dividing the House, to be determined by experts. Whether the line goes east or west-straigh t through the Northern Territory or diverging into .Queensland, or even Western Australia that is a much more reasonable proposition than the one now before us. But we are asked to take "" the Bill, the whole Bill, and nothing but the Bill ""-it is not a double-barrelled gun, but a six-chamber revolver, fully loaded. If the South Australian Government are, indeed, Nationalists-and I am willing to give them every credit in this connexionthey will allow the Federal Government to decide, through their own experts, after a full knowledge of the facts, what is the best route. We have to face the fact that there has been no survey of the route, and that this is an absolutely unknown territory, so far as railway construction is concerned. I have proved, more or less effectively, that the railway line suggested will not be useful for defence, and will not assist mining or pastoral occupation, and least of all will it assist closer settlement.",54
268,Mr LAIRD SMITH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Denison) [5.43]. - It has not been my good fortune to visit the Northern Territory; but I have sought information in the best way open to me on this great and important question. One of the best authorities I know is Professor Baldwin Spencer, whom I had the privilege of hearing lecture on the subject of the Northern Territory. The lecturer, who had a cinematograph which vividly represented the portions of the country he had visited, said that the Territory consisted of excellent pastoral and agricultural land, and was fit for a white population. I am indebted, not only to Professor Baldwin [162] Spencer for information, but also to the Lone Hand, the Sydney Mail, the Review of Reviews and, lastly, but not least, the Melbourne Age. It will probably be within the memory of honourable members that a Commissioner from the Melbourne Age accompanied the Federal Parliamentary party which visited the Northern Territory in 1907, and he has supplied information that has proved invaluable to all of us. I read his articles at the time of their publication with great interest, and took care to preserve them. Dealing in the first place with the question of climate, he expressed the opinion that the climatic conditions of the Northern Territory were for the most part excellent, and well suited to a white population. He also stated that there had been discovered in the Territory some very rich mining country, one reef having yielded as big a return as 1.0 ounces to the ton. It was owing to bad management, he declared, that mining companies had failed. Expensive machinery was erected, and large sums were devoted to building elaborate houses for the mining managers, instead of being used in deep sinking and general developmental work. The honourable member for Moreton, the honourable member for Brisbane, and several others have suggested that the Northern Territory is dry and arid. The fact is that it has sixteen excellent rivers, some of which are navigable. I am informed that the Victoria River is navigable for a distance oT about 60 miles by a boat drawing about 10 feet of water. I should like now to draw attention to a statement published by the Age Commissioner in 1907, relative to Victoria Downs, a portion of the Territory outside the area described by the honourable member for Brisbane as comprising the only rich lands to be found there. The Commissioner admitted that he went up north prejudiced against the Territory, but returned a convert to the proposal that the Commonwealth should take it over. Writing of the rich country on the Victoria River known as the Victoria Downs station, he statedAn indication of the value of this property' is shown in the fact that the stock last year .were returned at 60,000 horned cattle. They exported 21,000 during the year, and brandeel 15,000. The stock now on the property is 75,000; therefore, the total increase is 36,000, representing an enormous fortune. That one station was feeding 75,000 head of cattle, and in the year 1907 branded no less than 15,000 head. Here we have information showing the potentialities of the Territory from the point of view of stockraising. The Lakewood basin comprises 200,000 square miles-o r nearly two and a half times the area of Victoria-and the whole of it consists of good pastoral, and some of it of good agricultural country. When the present Leader of the Opposition first advocated the taking over of the Territory, I stood almost alone in Tasmania in support of the proposal. I spoke in its favour at many public meetings, and had to encounter much opposition, due to the fact that the people of my State knew no more of the country than the honourable member for Brisbane apparently knows of it. But after we had educated the people to a true knowledge of its possibilities a change came over the scene, and. on the 13th April last I was returned to this House by an enormous majority pledged to support the transfer. I stated throughout the campaign that if returned I should advocate the taking over of the Territory and also the building of the proposed transcontinental railway, believing that it would tend to the advantage not only of the Northern Territory itself, but of the whole Commonwealth. We are told by a recognised authority that there grow in the Northern Territory 600' plants which could be put to economic uses, and also that portion of the Territory is well suited to the production of cotton. An honourable member has informed the House that the Territory is very' dry, and that in some parts horses would have to scratch for a living. The truth is that there are splendid grasses. There is good grass all the year round in many parts, and the cattle are always in excellent condition. A writer in the Sydney Mail or the Lone Hand- I forget for the moment which-sai d that he had ridden a horse off the grass in the Northern Territory a distance of 70 miles, and an animal fresh off the grass that could carry a man over that journey at one stretch must have been in-good grazing country. Another illustration of the capacity of the country to carry stock is in the fact that herds of buffaloes exist there, and have proved a source of considerable revenue. A resident of Palmerston pays native boys 6d. a head for killing buffaloes, and has made a large fortune by selling the buffalo hides in London at an average of £ 2 each. I am told by a reliable authority that the hides are thence to Russia, where they are tanned, and that the manufactured article is then returned to Australia and sold for bookbinding purposes as the best Russian Mr Laird Smith. leather. Most of the so-called "" best Russian leather "" used for book-binding purposes has come from Australian buffalohides. Leather merchants are crying out for an export duty to encourage the tanning industry, yet the export trade in hides is being encouraged by our failure to take over the Territory.  hides have been exported, yet we cannot exterminate the animals.",54
269,Mr LAIRD SMITH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Her e is a quotation on the pointMr Lawrie is a butcher monopolist at Palmerston, where he resides. He keeps about joo store cattle on the run for butchering purposes, but does not breed cattle. He uses his enormous holding simply for the buffalo running wild there, which he employs black boys to shoot, supplying them with cartridges and paying 6d. per hide, of the average value of 40s. each on the London market. Last year he killed' 800 without causing any sensible diminution in the herds, which breed faster than they can be shot down. These buffaloes exist in so-called arid country where one would imagine, after listening to the honourable member for Brisbane, there is not enough feed for a. goat.",55
270,Mr FINLAYSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,When did I make such a statement?,55
271,Mr LAIRD SMITH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The whole trend of the honourable member's speech was in the direction of showing that the Territory is not worth developing. The honourable member made a "" come-in-out-of-the-rain ' r sort of speech- a speech which would enable him, while supporting the second reading of the Bill, to propose in Committee an amendment that would make it not worth the paper it is printed on. A great deal of emphasis has been laid on the cost of developing the Territory. Doubtless the expenditure will be very great, but can we, as Australians, avoid it? If we leave South Australia to develop the Territory,, will not die people of Australia still be responsible for the debt which it incurs in that way? At no distant date the Commonwealth will take over the debts of the States, and create one funded stock, so-that if South Australia retains possession of the Territory, and develops it by means of a loan policy, we shall eventually have to bear the cost. I suggest to honourable members that we should take over the Territory, bear the first cost of developing it, and be able sent to determine. for ourselves how the money shall be expended. That would be a truly national policy. I speak as a disinterested member, representing the southernmost State of the Commonwealth),, and I regEetted to hear the parochial speeches made by so-called disinterested representativesspeeches which, if this Bill be passed, will do much to retard the progress of the Territory. If the construction of the proposed railway were allowed to remain an open question, we should have in this Parliament a big fight as to the route to be adopted. The honourable member foT Brisbane said that no State would allow the Commonwealth to construct a railway within its borders, but if a line were constructed through the Northern Territory to the Queensland border, the Government of that State would very quickly connect it with its own railway system. The Northern Territory line would thus act as a feeder for the Queensland railway system, and would not be a paying concern, since the most profitable portion of the trade would be secured by the adjoining State. We owe much to South Australia for keeping this Territory white. I am informed that the State Government could have sold it for something like , £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 .",55

He thinks that, because he represents the little State of Tasmania, can indulge in this sort of parochialism, which, if carried into effect, would tend, damage the Commonwealth. But I am of going to take the risk of advocating the transfer of the Territory. I know the people of Tasmania as well as does the honourable member for Franklin, and I think I can safely tell them that I am here, as a Tasmanian, but as an Australian, anxious to make Australia one of the brightest jewels in the British Crown.

280,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The statement is to be found in the correspondence between the Premier of South Australia and the ex-Prime Minister.,56
281,Mr LAIRD SMITH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Why is it that South Australia, although she has held the Northern Territory fog forty-seven years, has been unable to develop it? The real reason is, in my opinion, the fact that the northern line stopped at Oodnadatta instead of being carried on to the MACDonnell where, the authorities tell us, 1,000,000. people could be settled on landthat is ready for occupation, and does not memeven need to be cleared. Had the South Government had sufficient money i.o carry the railway on to the MACDonnell proRanges they would not have been in the in sad plight they are in at present through, stopping the railway at Oodnadatta. Next comes the most important question of the occupation of the Territory, for defence purposes, by a white race. No less an than Lord Northcote stated that the Territory was not the back door, but the sentinel of Australia. That gentleman compare favourably as an expert with the. honourable member for Brisbane, who posed as a military authority this afternoon, stated that it was absolutely essential for us to occupy that great unoccupied Terhe ritory if we wished to make Australia safe. I think I have said sufficient to justify me toin voting, not only for the second reading the Bill, but, in Committee, for every clause that will bring about the taking over of the Territory by the Commonwealth. I shall not vote for the introduction into the measure of a clause that will simply mean not killing it. The South Australian people are not going to fool us, nor are they going to let us fool them. They want us am to take over the Territory in the terms of the agreement submitted to us. If we do not do so they will retain' it and develop it, eventually, at the cost of the Commonwealth, because the day is not far distant when we shall become a great nation, sufficiently strong to fund our debts-a n operation which will be profitable not only to a section, but to the whole oomniunity.",56

' ' Mr MCWILLIAMS - I voted for the proposal oh condition that the people of Australia should decide the issue now, and that the people of Australia for all time should have the right of deciding the same issue.

284,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I shall have a little to say afterwards about the value of the property. If we pass this Bill we shall be committed to building the railway through South Australian territory fromcover to cover. It was stated in this House by the Leader of the Opposition that, in passing the Bill, we had a free hand to carry the railway almost wherever we chose; but there is in the schedule to the Bill a clause which any lawyer, and, indeed, any layman, would sav commits this Parliament irrevocably to building the railway entirely through South Australian territory.",57
285,Mr WH IRVINE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The Attorney General says not.,57
286,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The Crown Law officers of South Australia have reported to their Government that it does. Was there ever an agreement entered into between two Governments regarding which, on so vital ar. issue, the Crown Law officers of the contending parties held such entirely divergent opinions? Speaking from memory, I think the report of the South Australian Crown Law officers was reconsidered before being finally issued. It lays down definitely that, under this Bill, the Commonwealth will be obliged by the contract to construct the railway entirely through South Australia and the Northern Territory. Let me read the clause for the benefit of those honourable members who say they are going to support the Bill, and then support an amendment to carry the ranway outside the Territory, through Queensland. It is as followsThe State in consideration of the covenants and agreements by the Commonwealth herein contained shallAt the time of such surrender authorize by legislation the Commonwealth to do all that is necessary to enable the Commonwealth . to construct or cause to be constructed a railway in South Australia proper from any point on the Port Augusta railway to a point on the northern boundary line of South Australia proper to connect with that part of the Transcontinental Railway to be built in the Northern Territory from Port - Darwin southwards to the northern boundary of South Australia proper. If there is any meaning in the English language, nothing could be plainer than that the railway must be built - wholly in .South Australia and the Northern Terlegritory. It is not fair to ask the Commonwealth to. pledge itself to construct a railway, whether it will pay or not, without a survey having been made, and without the slightest information being placed before us as to the probable extent of the outlay or the necessity for the line. From the earliest days of its settlement the people in the Territory have recognised that the proper outlet for its development is not right through what is called "" the dead heart of Australia,"" ' but rather eastward, into Queensland.",57
287,Mr FENTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"But is there "" a dead heart""?",57
288,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I can give the honourable member a little information regarding that matter. There are members in this House who last session voted' for the Bill, and announced their intention of amending it in order that the line might be deviated through Queensland. - Mr Laird SMITH - South Australia will not accept it. It will kill the Bill.",57
289,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"South Australia is imposing conditions upon the Commonwealth that she ought not to impose. She should be exceedingly thankful to the Commonwealth' for taking over what has proved an exceedingly costly venture to herfrom the start. She has spent three and a half millions of money on it , and she cannot show 1,000 white people in the whole of the Territory as the result of her labour.",57
290,Mr LAIRD SMITH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Sh e has kept the coloured people out.,58
291,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The honourable member's figures are more than 50 per cent. out.,58
292,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"There are not today nearly so many people, either white or coloured, in the Northern Territory as there were twenty years ago.",58
293,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Is that when they were constructing the railway?,58
294,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The whites never constructed the railway. When I hear the '' f u d g e ' ' talked by the honourable member for Denison and others about our owing a debt to South Australia for keeping the Territory white, I reply that South Australia cannot claim credit for that. She spent £ 5 , 0 0 0 , which we are now asked to pay back to her, on importing Cingalese into the Northern Territory to work the mines.",58
295,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,That is quite new me.,58
296,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"If honourable members will take the trouble to turn up the records of South Australia's connection with the Northern Territory, they will find a great deal that will be new to them. South Australia gave the contractor die option 01 constructing the Pine Creek railway with white labour at a certain price, or with coloured labour at another price. Millar Brothers, who had the contract, after attempting for a while to do the work with white labour, sent Mr Sadlier to China, and he brought down hordes of Chinese. The railway, practically from Palmerston down to Pine Creek, was constructed by Chinese labour, and as many of the Chinese as liked to remain in Australia could do so. Thousands of them did remain. The South Australian Parliament has passed Bill after Bill to secure the introduction of coolie labour into the Northern Territory.",58
297,Mr BAMFORD,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Does that affect this question, anyhow?",58
298,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It does to this extent, that amongst the claims put forward on behalf of South Australia is one that we owe her a debt of gratitude for keeping the Territory white. We owe nothing to her on that account, because she never has kept it white. For every white man in the Territory today there are three or four coloured people. When she was building the railway, she deliberately imported coloured labour. There were 3,000 miners employed in the Territory some eighteen years ago between Palmerston and practically Pine Creek, but I venture to say there are not 500 whites employed in the mines there today. According to the records, almost all the agriculture and mining of the Northern Territory is in the hands of Chinese.",58
299,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"There are only 1,400 Chinese in the Territory now. The honourable member should read the report.",58
300,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I have read every report on the Northern Territory on which I could lay my hands, and I commend to honourable members generally the exceedingly valuable collection to be found in the Commonwealth Library and the Petherick collection. They can find there historical documents relating to the Territory dating from the first settlement on Melville Island, and every authority on the South Australian administration up to the timeof Federation. Those documents showto that every proposal emanating in the South Australian Parliament for the settlement of the Territory was based on the employment of coloured labour.",58
301,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The Conservative party, which the honourable member represents, has always advocated the employment of coloured labour.",58

Honourable members will find in the pages of the South Australian Hansard the - statements which I am about to quote. Mr H . J. Barrow said in 1872I f the Northern Territory is to be populated, it will be, to a great extent, by coolie labour. Mr H . A. Parsons, in The Truth about ihe Northern Territory, saidIt is important to remember that from the time of the annexation of the Northern Territory by South Australia until 1883 the opinion of politicians was unanimous as to the necessity, advantages, and wisdom of developing the Territory by means of coloured labour. It is not too much to say that had objection to coloured labour been hinted at, the proposal for the construction of the Pine Creek railway would not have been moved.  considerable experience in the Territory. A pamphlet termed Territoria, laid on the table, of which Messrs. Holtze and Lindsay are joint editors, says that there are millions of acres in the Territory which can be profitably worked by white labour, but Mr Holtze was for fifteen years Curator of the Botanical Gardens at Palmerston, and when he' was leaving to become director of the Botanical Gardens in Adelaide reported to his Government that If the country is to become a great planting country we must have the right class of labour. European labour is out of the question.",58

King, in introducing into the South Australian Parliament the Northern Territorv Immigration Bill, to permit the importation of coolie labour for work in the Territory, saidIt is a well-known fact that, unless we obtain coolie labour, we will never have any plantations.

Mr Quinn said that hethought it was necessary that they should have black labour in the Northern Territory, but the persons who bought land in that part of the country should pay all the expense of getting the labour there. That passage is to be found in the South Australian Hansard.

In his report, he saidThe Northern Territory must have cheap if tropical products are to be grown and with profit in the markets of the world. This is admitted by all who have any special knowledge on the subject. Only tropical products can be grown in the Territory. European labour is not cheap. Therefore, if Europeans could stand the climate, tropical products could not be produced at a profit by them. Therefore, firstly, on the ground that European labour is not cheap, and, secondly, on the ground that Europeans cannot stand the climate, it i's impossible to employ Europeans at tropical production. He went on to advocate the introduction of coolies under indenture. They were to be returned to their homes on the expiration of their engagements.",59

316,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Because the Indian Government protested, and the Royal assent was withheld, on the ground that sufficient protection was not provided for the coolies. The South Australian Government then sent Major Fergusson to India, and the necessary assurances having been given, the Bill was reintroduced in 1882, and became law.",59

320,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The Minister, and the honourable member for Hindmarsh, have stated that effect was never - the Act ; but the records are against that view. Mr G. M . Newland, in his little book on The Northern Territory and its Gold-fields in 1875, reported that fiveman ! sixths of the European labourers having left, Cingalese were imported to work in the mines-that the enormous wages demanded by the Europeans, and the high percentage of them on the sick-list, made coolie labour true position. necessary. Then, referring to the CingaHouse lese who were imported, the same writer had no hesitation in denouncing the majority of them as the "" scum of Singapore."" The importation of Cingalese was an abtialian solute failure, notwithstanding the fact that the Government had spent nearly £ 5 , 0 0 0 there. in bringing them into the Territory. Mr. G. Wyndham Earl, Commissioner of Lands at Point Essington, in his handbook for colonists to the Northern Territory, sidered coolie labour necessary. Mr Newtell land, in a report, saidWhite men whose engagements had expired did not wish to renew them. Some were incapacitated by sickness, other were useless had to be discharged, and the wages, high to legislation, - commence with, became more and more exbassador orbitant.

Men were brought from Melbourne at great failure. £ 4 ios. per week, with free passages, and few, if any, remained. The white miners had been brought from Victoria on free passages, and paid £ 4 ios. tralian per week, which at that time, when the aim of the workers was the "" Three Eights,"" was an exceedingly good wage. None of these white workers, however, newed their engagement; and they all drew. The Rev. Julian Tennison Woods, one Land of the greatest authorities on this question in Australia, lays down abstinence from fat meat and rich food, and, above all, the tice of total abstinence from all stimuplanted lants, as absolutely essential to white men working in the tropics.

Act after Act has been introduced and passed in the South Australian Parliament, but during the  office not an offer for the construction of the line v/as received. The experience of the South Australian Government in connection with the construction of the overof land telegraph line should be a warning to this Parliament. It was estimated that the line would cost £120,000 to construct, but it cost on completion no less than",61
341,Mr BAMFORD,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The man who made that estimate could not have known much about his business.,62
342,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It was made by one of the ablest experts that Australia has ever known. I refer to Mr - afterward s Sir Charles-Todd . The South Australian Government let the southern and northern ends of the line by contract, the central section being carried out as a Government work. No less than three parties failed, however, to construct the northern section, and the Government had ultimately to carry out the work itself. It abandoned Port Darwin, the terminus of this line, and went up the Eoper River, 100 miles inland from Port Darwin, where it commenced operations. I have here a report which throws an interesting light on this magnificent country, which it is said South Australia is foolish to part with. We were told to-night that there is no dead heart of Australia-that all this Territory is magnificent country.",62
343,Mr FENTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I asked the honourable member if there were a dead heart, and he did not reply, because he did not know.",62
344,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I am going to reply by quoting from an official report on the construction of the overland telegraph line, which appears in Mr J. S. Knight's interesting little book on The Northern Territory of South Australia.",62
345,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,-That report was presented over twenty years ago.,62
346,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"At all events, the character of the country has not materially changed since then. Referring to the central section covering a distance of 600 miles, the writer made this statementThis region was so utterly unproductive with regard to. game and other articles of sustenance that every ounce of food required had to be taken with them, and poles had to be carted in some cases over 100 miles. That gives us a fairly good insight into the character of the country. What sort of country is it in which no game can be found over an area 600 miles in length ? ",62
347,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I have taken the statement from an official report. to assure the House that I have obtained all my quotations from South Australian records, or from books written for, or at the instigation of, the South Australian Government. Mr Knight states that the total cost of the line was £ 4 2 0 , 7 2 1 , whereas the estimated cost when the proposal to construct the line was before Parliament was £ 1 2 0 , 0 0 0 . A word now as to South Australia's position. The Government of die State submitted a proposal; to construct the overland line with the cooperation and assistance of the other States. Like some of our cables, it wasto be upon an Australian basis. But the South Australian House of Assembly by seventeen votes to twelve rejected the proposal, and ,'nsisted that South Australia should construct the whole of the line, accept the responsibility, ancl retain control over it .",62
348,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Gros s selfishness !,62
349,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It was either pluck or greed. The contract worked out so badly that South Australia now asks us to shoulder the responsibility, and seeks to impose conditions with which it is not fair to ask us to comply. One of the first petitions presented to the State Government on the Territory being taken over by South Australia, urged that it should also annex the Albert River District, comprising portion of the Gulf country within the State of Queensland, and bordering on the Territory. It was pointed out in this petition that there, were ports within the three degrees which the State was requested to annex, which were essential as an outlet for the Territory. An outlet in that direction, it was asserted, was necessary. In view of the divergence of opinion existing in the House and the country, this statement on the part of the men who had taken up land in the Northern Territory is certainly very interesting. We are told we must take over the railway for defence purposes. I am one of those who think that too much' is made of the bogy of invasion. For centuries the Malays have been landing, ancl have been establishing stations on the r-oasts of Australia. Flinders found them in 1802, and Searcy in his very interesting little book, In Tropical Australia, describes how on different parts of the coast Malay stations were found. It was discovered that the Malays came over at different seasons to obtain trepang, and departed almost immediately. For centuries there has been nothing to stop these people from remaining in the Northern Territory and making I wish homes for themselves there, but they have not done so. There would not be a chance of this Bill passing if it were not for the bogy of invasion. On that point it is well to point out that two-thirds of Western Australia, comprising much better country than does the Northern Territory, is more defenceless today from the stand-point of want of population, than is the Territory itself. Two-thirds of Western Australia stretching towards Wyndham is practically unpeopled. A railway to Port . Darwin would no more help us to prevent the landing of an invading party at Wyndham than would the presence of troops in Melbourne enable us to prevent a landing of a foreign force in northern Queensland. Some people imagine that there is a burning desire on the part of the Japanese to settle in the Northern Territory. The Chinese who went there to build the Pine Creek railway did not remain, and the Chinese population is small compared with what it was.",62
350,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Chines e in the Northern Territory are not allowed to hold land or a mineral lease.,63
351,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Practicall y all the mining in the Northern Territory is carried on by Chinese.  a mineral lease.,63
352,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The latest record that I have been able to obtain-and I con fess that it is two or three years old-give s the numbers of Chinese and white people holding miners' rights in the Northern Territory. That shows that up to that period, at all events, miners' rights were issued to the Chinese, and writers who have recently visited the Territory tell us that the bulk - of the mining there is carried on by the Chinese.",63
353,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"They can hold miners' rights, but cannot take up a mineral lease.",63
354,Mr MCWILLIANS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The cry that this - transcontinental railway is necessary to enable us to prevent the Japanese from effecting a landing on the Northern Territory is one of those silly scares that are occasionally worked up in connection with military matters, and which will land Australia - eventually in very serious trouble.",63
355,Mr BAMFORD,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The honourable member 'has not always held this opinion of the Japanese.,63
356,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I have always held the opinion I have just expressed with regard to Japanese effecting a landing :in the Northern Territory. I opposed this Bill when it was brought in by the late. - Government, of which I was a supporter, just as strongly as I do today. tention is that it does not give the Commonwealth a fair deal. It does not enable us to decide the route of the proposed railway, and it ties down the Commonwealth to a large expenditure in constructing a railway through what is known to be the - opinion. most barren portion of Australia. No matter how barren the reports of our experts may show the country to be, the Commonwealth will be bound, under the terms of this Bill, to construct the line through South Australia and the Northern Territory. No precaution has been taken to protect the Commonwealth in the matter of leaseholds. During the discussion on the Land Tax Assessment Bill, I pointed out that practically the greater portion of the Northern Territory worth holding is today under lease. An area of 103.419,428 acres is held under lease, much of it for forty-two years, and for is. per square mile. We are going to build the railway right through those leaseholds, and enhance their value enormously, but not the slightest precaution is taken to protect the interests of the Commonwealth by saying that any leases resumed shall be taken over at the valuation prior to the construction of the railway.",63
357,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The terms of the lease expressly provide that, in paying compensation for resumption, no public works are to be taken into account.",63
358,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I have given-notice of a clause upon which I intend to test the feeling of the House. If we take over the Territory, and construct the railway at a cost of millions of pounds to the people of Australia, the men holding these enormous areas, locking up the country for forty-two years at a rental of is. per square mile, will have die value of their leases enormously enhanced, andsome provision ought to be made to allow the Commonwealth to resume them, if necessary, at the original valuation.",63
359,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,That is already provided for in the Act under which the leases were taken up.,63
360,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The precaution that we need is not taken. Regarding the railway, there has never before been a proposal made between two Governments where tiiere has been such a difference of opinion between the contracting parties. We are taking not the slightest precaution to prevent our entrance into the High Court immediately we commence the construction, unless we absolutely subscribe to the conMy con- ditions imposed by South Australia. The Attorney-General of the Commonwealth says that under this Bill the Commonwealtii has power to deviate the line outside South Australian territory.",63
361,Mr FULLER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,That is a ridiculous,63
362,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It is the opinion 1hat is going to carry the Bill through this House. 'ihe opinion of the Crown law - officers of South Australia is that we have not that power. In face of that direct conflict of opinion between the legal advisers of the two contracting parties, we are going straight ahead without making the slightest attempt to see which is correct. I believe the South Australian contention is .correct, and it will mean that the House is leg-roped irrevocably to constructing .the railway, no matter what we may find the country to be. If with our eyes open, and in the face of the legal opinion of .South Australia's advisers, we pass the Bill as it stands, we shall be guilty of a dishonourable repudiation if we afterwards try to vary the South Australian contract. Strongly as I am opposed to this condition being imposed in the Bill, disastrous as I believe it will be if carried into effect, nevertheless, so far as I am concerned, if the Bill is passed as it now stands, I shall never be a party to deviating the railway outside of South Australian territory. The national honour of Australia ancl the honour of the Commonwealth. Parliament will be pledged to the agreement. I should not be a party to any attempt to get the Bill through under a sort of false pretence, and then to turn round on South Australia, and deprive her of that which she has publicly claimed as her right, and which she has given us ample time to consider before the passing of the Bill . I have no feeling in this matter beyond what I believe to be the duty of any member when a project of this importance is before us. I have found in my researches tiiat every attempt to settle tropical Australia by white labour has failed. It failed in the mines, on the railway, ancl in the plantations'. My object in putting these facts before the House is that we shall know our exact responsibility in passing this measure. We already have an enormous responsibility in Papua. We have had the control of that Territory for ten years, ancl he would be a bold man who would say that our success has been very great. The result of the control of Papua by the Commonwealth Government does not redound very highly to our credit. I have ou more than one occasion pointed to the extremely lax conditions",64
363,Mr SPEAKER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Order . The honourable member must not discuss that matter.,64
364,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I shall content myself with saying that the enormous responsibility we have taken on in Papua, the Federal Government ancl Parliament: have not been able to successfully shoulder. Our responsibility in that connection should make us seriously pause before we take upon ourselves another enormous burden in this agreement. It is not the payment for the overland railway, or for the overland telegraph line, or the railway to Oodnadatta, or the railway to Pine Creek, that I am afraid to face. It is the enormous problem which will devolve upon us of the future development and settlement of the Territory when we have taken it over. Rather than undertake die construction of the overland railway, which, from all reports, is doomed to failure from its very inception, rather than incur the responsibility of constructing the line willy-nilly, no matter what its prospects of payment may be, or what desert country it may have to pass through, I would prefer the Commonwealth Parliament to assist South Australia to make a fair trial of whether the tropical parts of northern Australia can be successfully settled by white people. South Australia, having that enormous responsibility upon her shoulders, would have a perfect right to say to the-Federal Parliament that the burden was more than any one State should be called upon to carry. If we solve the question of settling the tropical portion of the Northern Territory we shall settle the same problem in regard to northern Queensland ancl the northern portion of Western Australia. Instead of 'the Federal Government pressing on with this Bill, and undertaking the construction of a railway which may cost up to £ 8 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0, it would be infinitely better for us to say to South Australia, "" Leave your railways as they stand at present; make a development from Port Darwin in any direction you like, and we will back you in securing the right class of white labour, ancl see if we cannot solve the greatest of all problems confronting Australia-the settlement of our tropical regions with white people."" With the people in their present temper, and having regard to the temper of practically every member of this House, there is no fear of the Federal Government or Parliament, or the public of Australia, at present consenting to an inferior coloured race being brought into settle any portion of the Continent. We have started out on the lines of a White Australia policy, and the temper of the people is to maintain it . It is the duty, not of one State, but of the whole Commonwealth, to solve the proNew blem involved. It is far better for the Commonwealth to spend anything from £1,000,0 0 0 up to £ 5 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0, if sary, in honestly attempting to solve this great question, than to first squander lions of money on a railway which the great majority of the members of this many House believe will be useless for die purpopulation, pose sought to be achieved, ancl still have to incur afterwards the great responsibility of settlement. Let us take up the great burden that really rests on the National Government and Parliament, of showing, for the first time in the history the world, how to settle a white people a tropical country. The problem is great enough, and will be heavy and costly calling enough for us to undertake on its own was there a market close at hand. merits, without tying ourselves to the conpeople ditions imposed in this contract. I firmly believe that the proper outlet for the of an immigrant vessel. northern portion of the Territory is eastsettlement wards into Queensland. The Queensland Government could carry its railway from constructing the proposed railway, and Cloncurry to Camooweal, as it is either about to do, or will do, in the near future. That would bring the line practically to the border of the Northern Territory, livery report I have been able to read shows that the very best land in the whole of the Territory lies in the north-eastern corner.  member does admit that there are some debtedness good lands there?",64
365,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Of course there which are.,65
366,Mr ARCHIBALD,NORTHERN TERRITORY,What desert ?,65
367,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That is down the centre, where the honourable member which confronts us. wants to carry the railway. We have no right, even from the stand-point of the Territory itself, to saddle it with a railthe way running for .1,600 or 1,800 miles right down to Port Augusta, instead of giving it its natural outlet, wherever that may We have been told that the Northern Terpeople ritory cannot be settled unless the transconall, tinental railway is made. It must membered that there was a settlement at Melville Island, another at Port Essington, a third at Raffles Bay, and one or two others before Palmerston was made the capital. The earliest settlements in Northern Territory were made in the same manner as that at Risden, in Tasmania, and Botany Bay, in New South Wales, being military and penal stations. The people of with which no fault can be found. South Wales and Tasmania, of Victoria and of Queensland, did not wait until railways came to take possession of the necescountry and develop it. If country is good enough, the pioneer is content to commence milwith a bullock-dray. But, although the Northern Territory has been settled for so years, it is today practically without showing that its conditions are very different from those of the southernStates. We have been told that it has no communication with the outer world; but large foreign-going steamers call at Port Darwin thirty-five times every year, and of sometimes more frequently. In the early in days of the Sydney, Hobart, and Port Phillip settlements, tiiere were not steamersfortnightly or every eight days, nor The had to be satisfied with the rare appearance of a hulk, or the still rarer arrival Nevertheless, increased, and the country was: developed. Let it not be thought that, by 1 liquidating the indebtedness of South Australia, we shall solve the Northern Territory problem. Our difficulties are only commencing. My objection to the Bill is that it ties us hand and foot, by imposing the stipulation that we must construct a railway by a particular route, against our better judgment and that of those who know die country. We are asked to take over an inof between £ 3 , 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 and £3,500,000, and to construct a railway may cost anything from £ 6 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 to £ 8 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 01 more. We shall have about the committed ourselves to an expenditure of £.15,000,000 or £ 1 6 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 ' before we in can commence the solution of the problem Therefore, it is the duty of the Government to tell us whether the Commonwealth will have a free hand in construction of the railway. Ministers should promise to so frame the Bill tiiat it will be absolutely clear to this Parliament, be. to that of South Australia, and to the that our hands are not tied. Above Ministers should tell us what they probe repose to do in the way of railway construction, ancl what' means they intend to take for the settlement and development of the Territory when they get possession of it .  the plorable that members who are not favourable to a proposal will stoop to the tactics of the horse-dealer, wbo, wishing to make a bargain, decries in every way the animal The honourable member for Franklin has made speech which, from beginning to end, de-. predated the Northern Territory.

The time will come when sibilities of tropical culture. the Commonwealth must deal witii the problem which confronts it in the north. South Australia does not ask to be a penny more than she has. expended on a Territory, nor would she offer the Territory to any other party than the Commonhe wealth. In offering it to the Commonnot wealth, she is offering it to the people of which her population is a part. The South Australian Parliament would reject withhonout consideration any proposal for the transference of the Territory to any other to party. For many years the State has kept die Territory white, and has refused to parcel it among chartered companies, or to allow its eyes to be picked out by syndiThe late Sir Frederick Holder put Terriit 011 record that the Government of South Australia was offered £10,000,000 by an to English syndicate, when the Honourable is not Thomas Playford was Attorney-General, ; f it would allow the Territory to be a worked with indented labour. At that time, what South Australia was passing through one the worse periods in its history, but, to its credit, it refused the offer. I ask honourable members to consider the position was of the Northern Territory. Port Darwin is within six days' steam of Java, with a population of 30,000,000; not far from China, with a population of 450,000,000 ; and within nine days' steam of Japan, a with a population of 46,000,000. l t is of close to Sumatra, Malacca, Singapore, Borneo, the Philippines, and New Guinea, all places teeming with native races. This a real, and not an imaginary, danger. should now like to say something about the potentialities of the Territory. We here a strip of country 900 miles in the length, and 650 miles wide, with a very him low rainfall on the borders of South Ausdo tralia, where, after all, is the dead heart the continent, increasing to a 1,200 Chair. miles of coast fronting the Indian The rainfall at Katherine, soo miles inland, is 32 inches; at Daly if Waters, 21 inches; Victoria Downs, 22 inches; Boroloola, 26 inches; along by the comQueensland border, 15 to 20 inches; ancl She could at MACDonnell Ranges, a mean average of 11 inches, and in some years 26 inches. Even The Northern Territory may be roughly passed divided into three classes of countrythe tropical, sub-tropical, and temperate. The and 3,200 miles of coast facing the Indian TerOcean is the tropical country; and I shall have something to say presently of the posThe subtropical area consists of 80,000,000 acres, from Katherine River to Powell's Creek paid and Victoria River to Camooweal; and the there is a very fine climate, which, though fairly warm, shows a great difference between winter ancl summer temperature. In this respect, it differs very much from the tropical country on the coast-line, where the average heat is 80 or 90 degrees, with very little difference between the summer and winter readings. Midway we encounter climatic conditions which mark the temperate zone; and here is country equal to any in Victoria. Some of the country south of the MACDonnell Ranges may be regarded perhaps as the poorest portion; but yet there is useful country which has for many years sent some of the best stock to the Adelaide market; and a policeman, who was stationed at Alice Springs for seven years, assured me that when he was out in search of some blacks who had been interfering with some cattle he saw near the Western Australian border some of the best country in the Territory. I should now like to refer to some of the tropical products which are possible in the Northern Territory. Under the supervision of Mr Holtze, who had charge of the Botanic Gardens of the Northern Territory, experimental plots were established. Amongst the products dealt with was sisal hemp, in regard to which all the experiments up to date have been very successful, showing a luxuriant plant, containing a very fine fibre. Australiaimports annually 10,000 tons of binder twine made of sisal hemp, while in the United States there is imported 200,000 tons, at a cost of £8,250,000. The experiments leave very little doubt that in time there could be produced in the Northern Territory sufficient sisal hemp to meet, not only all Australian requirements, but to establish an export trade. The latest reports on this product are given in one of the documents laid before Parliament; and there Mr. Holtze, who is a son of the Mr Holtze who was an officer in the Northern 'Territory, saysIt is too early yet to speak of the results of our fibre-making experiments. I may say, however, that a very fine sample of fibre is being produced, and the results so far show that the leaves grown here contain a larger percentage of fibre than has been obtained in Queensland. A bale of the fibre produced will be exhibited at the forthcoming Chamber of Manufactures Exhibition in Adelaide. In regard to upland rice, he saysSeveral plots were planted last season with the variety of upland rice which was so successf u l l y grown the previous season, and which I propose to distinguish in future under the name of No. 1 White Upland :-No . 1 yielded at the rate of 55 bushels of grain to the acre;  No. 2 plot yielded at the rate of 39 bushels of grain to the acre; No. 3 plot yielded at therate of 30 bushels of grain to the acre. No. 1 plot has received a light dressing of stablemanure, and the above result very plainlv shows, the worked-out condition of the soil in {he garden ancl the necessity for manuring in futureresults. All the plots received the same cultivation, and the natural rainfall was not supplemented in any way. The seed was planted. 24 in. x 20 in. But this was too far apart; too much ground was thus wasted, ""and if planted closer the yield per acre would have been, greater. The average height of the plants was 4 feet, and the yield of straw i i , tons per acre. The straw, after the rice was threshed off, was. converted into chaff for the Government horses. The time that the ground was occupied with the crop was four months, and I believe the., best time for planting is towards the end of December. Then he deals with harvesting machinery,, showing that in Louisiana and Texas, modern appliances do away with the necessity for such cheap labour as is employed in China and India, and that some600,000 acres are there under crop. He goes 011 to sayIt is, therefore, of interest to read the following remarks in an official publication issued by the United States Department of Agriculture :"" The employment of machinery in the rice-fieldsof the south-west, similar to that used in the great wheat-fields of California and the Dakotas, is revolutionizing the methods of cultivation and 1 greatly reducing the cost. The American ricegrower employing higher-priced labour than any other rice-grower of the world, will ultimately be able to market his crop at the least cost and the greatest profit."" Rice straw is worth preserving. As a fodder for stock its value is about equal to good hay. Rice-straw contains 4.72 per cent, crude protein, 32.21 per cent, of carbo-hydrates, and 1.87 per cent. fats. The sweetness and excellent flavour of well-preserved rice-straw adds very materially to its practical feeding value, because slock will consume large quantities of it. Jared G. Smith, special agent in charge Hawaii Experiment Station, writing in the June, 1908, issue of the P h i l if f i ne Agriculture Review, says of rice in Hawaii :- "" Even with the expensive, primitive methods employed, rice cultivation is a very profitable industry."" I should now like to quote Mr Holtze on the subject of the yieldThe yield of rice varies with conditions of soil and climate and methods of cultivation. However, the yield in South-west Louisiana issaid by good authority to range from 28 to 63 bushels per acre. One of Adelaide's largest wholesale houses informed us that they were prepared to pav £19 to ^21 per ton of 2,240 lbs. for dressed 1 Australian-grown rice delivered in Adelaide. With, say, a low average of 25 bushels of 45 lbs. each per acre, and, say £ i $ per ton for undressed rice, or, roughly, £ ton per acre, worth £ 7 ios. per acre, rice culture in Australia should pay with white labour. That is in the tropical countryWheat with the exceedingly good yield of, crossing say, 25 bushels per acre, is only worth, with good prices, ^'5 per acre, and that is seldom attained.",66
370,Sir JOHN QUICK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"What areas are part available for rice-growing?  From Adelaide River, right round to Amheim's Land, are some of the best rice landsin the Territory. Mr Holtze goes on to sayAccording to the Year-took of the American Department of Agriculture for 1908, which is the highest authority of its kind in the world, rice is the twelfth crop in point of value in America. It states there were in America in 1907 627,300 acres under rice cultivation, producing 18,738,000 bushels, valued at»85.8 cents per bushel, or a total farm value of 16,081,000 dollars-ove r three million pounds of English money. The average yield per acre was 29.9 bushels. Of the acreage under cultivation, 310.000 acres were in Louisiana anil 284,000 in Texas. Much more could be said in regard to tropical products; but I have no desire to unduly occupy the time of the House, recognising the desire to close the session. I probably should not have spoken at all, had it not been for the fact that, from die position I occupy, I shall have no opporfirst-class tunity of expressing my views at the Comsheep. mittee stage. Mr Ernest Favenc and Mr L. Crawford have both explored this country; and their opinions are worth range? quoting. Writing of the MCArthur River country, they make the following statementAll this country is quite available and will, no doubt, be thickly populated in the future. After running an almost easterly course for some distance, it comes abruptly on a red sandstone range of great height. AfteT touching this range the river runs nearly north, and, on the north-western bank, is always of a character which would induce to the settlement of sheep. On the eastern-skirtin g the rangeare a few small flats very richly grassed, between the range and the bank of the river. The whole of the valley of the river is here of a character exactly resembling the best downs in the interior. ' We have never seen better or more richly-grassed country in any latitude. The country is admirably adapted for settlement, being level, and supplied with fresh water. Speaking of the value of the river, they savThe MCArthur is, without doubt, a stream, deep under the banks to the extent of at least 30 feet by our own measurement, with little hindrance in the way of islands. The banks are free from mangroves, and country near them is open box forest. could not get down to the actual mouth of the river on account of the deep salt water on both sides, which, of course, stopped us from on horseback. There is no doubt that if no bar exists this will be one of the finest ports in the Gulf district, i.e., the part of the Gulf owned by the South Australian Government, which we can state is certainly the best (as we have seen all the Queensland portion), and, excepting the Batavia River, there is Carpentaria. to equal the MCArthur in the Gulf of In a f u r the r report Mr Ernest Favenc wroteI am now in a position to tell you of the capabilities of the whole country that lies south of your portion of the Gulf const as far as the 19th parallel of latitude. There is no doubt about the value of this country, but at present there is a drawback from the fact cf there being no recognised port in the Gulf portion of the Northern Territory. There is a large tract of territory comprising land of the same nature as the best "" Do w n s"" country in Northern Queensland-in fact, equal to such places as Lansdowne, Terrick Terrick, Northampton, and Portland Downs, which are recognised as the cream of the Barcoo country. This is all tableland country, the main slope starting about l 7 deg. 30 min. S., and running thence almost east and west until reaching the overland telegraph line. Captain B a r k l a y , who has explored all the country, in an article for L if e , wroteFully one-third of the Northern Territory is pastoral country, admirably suited' for Northward from the Jervois Range a great tableland stretches for hundreds of miles. Mr W. . H . IRVINE - Where is that  the map, but it is towards Tennant's Creek.. for cattle, Captain Barklay continues The southern limit is 2,500 feet above the sea; thence it gradually falls until it meets the coastal ranges bordering the Gulf of Carpentaria and the Indian Ocean. Owing lo the elevation above the sea, the climate is perfect, and there seems no reason why agriculture should not flourish, the rainfall gradually increasing over vast plains of rich soil, from about 10 inches in the MACDonnell Range, to 45 inches at Pine Creek and 62 inches at Port Darwin. Hr: divides the Territory as I have divided it to-night into three districts-tropical , subtropical, and temperate. I wish now to make a quotation in reply to the assertion made this evening by the honourable member for Franklin, that the lower portion nf the Territory is destitute of game. grand Mr D. J. Gordon, of the Register, traand velled over all that section of the Territory, and he is recognised throughout Austhe tralia as a capable judge of pastoral and' We agricultural country. Speaking of the charcreeks acter of the Barrow Creek country,, which is between the. MACDonnell Ranges and Tennant's Creek, he saysTo the east of Barrow Creek are the Murray Downs, and in"" this direction we shape our - course for about 40 miles, when Mount Skinner stands out prominently, while stretching away to the right and left is a fine valley well - covered with vegetation of various sorts. The Skinner Creek runs through the Murray Downs, providing a fine supply of water. We camped - that night alongside a waterhole about a mile long, 60 yards wide, and some 18 feet deep. Further on to the eastward is the Spence Creek, - and as we ride along the valley of the Spence we almost forget that we are some 1,300 miles north of Adelaide, and in the very heart of - the Continent. We have seen nothing to equal this valley we are now in. On either bank of --the Spence grow large trees, confusing in their very variety, luxuriant grasses, wild flowers, and delicate ferns. Large snow-white lilies grow - to the water's edge, while the screeching cockatoos and beautifully plumoged birds that fly - overhead all tell us we have come into a new - country. What is to be said now of the statement by the honourable member for Franklin, that there is no bird life there?On our Tight, about a quarter of a mile away, Tunning parallel with the creek, is a high range of hills rising Abruptly and overlooking the valley, with white lime-trees and vegetation growing to the very tops, and flowering creepers overspreading the rocks. The sky, sun, air, and eloquent waters, inspiring mountain-tops, the murmuring and glossy woods, are all evidence that here in this valley nature deals with a bountiful hand. We rode for 35 miles along the Frew, which at the time of our visit was Tunning. Altogether, the country is the best watered and the finest we have yet seen. At places the Frew is almost wide enough and - deep enough to be navigable. I would impress upon honourable members that this report relates to the lower portion of the country running westerly from the route of the proposed railway as shown on the map, and not to the extreme northern part of the TerritoryWhere the Frew head statio""n is situated the river widens out, and there are several splendid sheets of water. It is evident, from the vegetation, that the Frew country has a good rainf all , and as the river contains a variety of fishThe honourable member for Franklin said that there is no game or means of sustenance in this part of the countrysome of them being several pounds in weight, it is pretty good evidence that droughts are unknown. Some of the station hands have caught sufficient fish in the waterhole close by the station-Tootoowa, natives call it-in two hours to last all hands for a week. Birds are very numerous on the Frew. Twenty-five miles below the station we saw a sight to delight in-a moon-lit lake some two miles long; on either bank the typical Australian gum trees towering above the water in majestic splendour, making, with their evening  shadows, a picture full of the sublime and beautiful. The natives have christened the place with a pretty name-Arralooloola . Nature's gifts are plentiful here, and we saw wild ducks, pigeons, emus, and kangaroos, and, no doubt, in the water are fish in abundance. I have here an interesting telegram from Sydney, which appeared in the Argus last week, and has an important bearing on the question of the climatic conditions of the Northern TerritoryProfessor David has received a letter from ' Dr Danes, lecturer in geography to the University of Prague, who was commissioned to investigate the physical geography of limestone countries, especially those in tropical areas. Dr Danes travelled about 6,000 miles in Northern Queensland. He was strongly of opinion that the climate was healthy and the general geographical (Conditions so favourable that the vast region to the north-west of Cloncurry could be successfully peopled by a white race. In the opinion of Dr Danes, two measures should be taken for the amelioration of the present conditions, and as preventives against immediate future dangers :-(1 ) Proper medical sanitary supervision of the alien elements and greatest possible restriction of their evil contact, not only with the aboriginals, but also with the white population itself; and (2) the improvement of the living conditions of the white population within the tropical and sub-tropical parts of Australia, with special regard to houses, food, and water. Three years ago I travelled over portion of the Territory with Mr Speaker and the honourable member for Illawarra. We - rngaged in a riding trip extending over . ten days, and traversed a wide area of country. We rode from the Katherine to Brock's Creek, skirting the Flora Falls, and thence down the Daly River to the Douglas. We passed stream after stream, and saw some of the finest country that one could wish to look upon. The honourable member for Illawarra having travelled, like the honourable member for Cook, on the railway line, from which nothing is to be seen but mineral country, had formed a very bad impression of the Territory, but after this riding tour he candidly informed me, in the presence of others, at the last night's camp-and he repealed the statement at a public meeting at Port Darwin --that in the course of our trip he had seen some of the finest country on which protracted he could wish to clap his eyes. The honourable member for Brisbane said today that the grass was coarse, and had to be as the burnt off.",68
371,Mr FINLAYSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I was quoting one of the honourable member's own authorities.  personal experience. The day before we reached Brock's Creek, on the riding expedition to which I have just referred, we were travelling through grass so high that we could tie it over our horses' withers. On one side of our route there was a fence-the only fence that we saw on the journey-and in the paddock we saw grass growing so high that it looked like a vast wheat field. There was a fine mob of horses in the paddock, and they were in splendid condition. On the following day Mr Bime, the owner of a run, having learned of our approach, sent out a black boy to pick up our party, and the lad guided us to his station. Mr Birne inquired which track we had followed, and asked whether we had seen any horses along the route. I told him of the mob we had seen in the paddock, and he replied, "" All that country is mine."" When I asked him whether he had burnt off the country, he said, "" No, there has not been a fire there since the fence was erected, and that splendid grass is the result of stocking."" He had been living in the district for about seventeen years, and when I asked him how he liked the climate, he replied, "" Look at my wife and my children. Some of the children were born here, and I invite you to say whether they look as if the climate did not agree with them. 1 came from Wagga, but would not change my present home for Wagga or any other part of New South Wales."" I can understand the fascination that this great, rich, lone land has for the explorer. I never travelled over a piece of country that was more fascinating to me. We could not but be impressed by this land of promise, as mile after mile we met with magnificent lagoons, billabongs, or running streams covered with game of every description. In the buffalo country, known as the black jungle, we saw magnificent animals in fine condition feeding on buffalo grass such as is used for lawns in Victoria, and which grows in great abundance. No wonder that it is regarded as a great pity that such grand country should be so little, occupied, with its great resources in land and its abundance of rivers, t do . not think there is any part in the whole of Australia better, watered than is the Northern Territory. A relative of mine has been on that side for the last eight years, and I learn that the wool produced on CruthrieDowns has realized the highest price in the London market. I am sure that where the water is not on the surface an abundance of good semi-artesian water can be got in the limestone country at a [163] depth of 60 feet, over a large tract, right"" through from the Victoria River to Camooweal, and to the south by Tennant's Creek. The time is not far off when it will carry more sheep than Victoria, and South - Australia together now have. I have said that we are not mendicants in this matter. Honourable members think South Australia is trying to press this agreement hard, but the honourable member for Angas told the honest truth yesterday when he spoke of the great difference of opinion there is in South Australia on the matter. Petition after petition is being presented to the South Australian Parliament asking them to go back on the agreement. It allows of a deviation from the centre, say, to the Queensland corner, but further than that I do not know what it does mean,",69
372,Mr FINLAYSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member will not catch us with that.  fluence on the honourable member is so strong that I would not attempt to catch him. We want finality in this matter. Since 1897 we have not leased 1 acre of the Northern Territory except on an annual permit. No man could get a bit of land to put his house upon there tomorrow on' any other terms. We have retarded the development of the Territory so as to leave the Commonwealth free to deal with itin its own way. I grant that a number of pastoral leases, have been let at a very low rental, but I shall be one of the first, when we have to deal with our own' Territory, to help to get at them in another way if we cannot get at them Under the conditions of the lease. Most of those leases can be resumed now on two years' notice, and on payment of compensation for improvements, but the lessees have never had to put any improvements, even a' fence, on them. I trust that honourable members will bring this matter to finality, and I ask them, at any rate, not to discredit the Territory if they do not want to accept it.",70
373,Mr MATHEWS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Melbourne Ports) [9-3S]--On listening to the speeches of several members, it has struck me that this' question is like the other great, .projects that we have lately considered, such as the Federal Capital site and the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway. If we believed all that was said by one section, we might say, "" Oh, happy Australia,."" but if we believed the others, we should exclaim, "" Oh, unhappy Australia."" When one hears one section parading the virtues of the Northern Territory, and another section strongly deriding it, one naturally seeks.'themiddle course, and regards both partiesas guilty of exaggeration. That method-leads one to the conclusion that the Northern Territory, taken as a whole, might be fairly used by the Commonwealth to' the advantage of Australia. While I do riot think that it is all that it is painted by the representatives of South Australia, I am not going to believe the strong condemnations hurled at it by the opponents of the measure. We have got rather into the habit in this House lately, when advocating a measure, of claiming that we are the Nationalists, and branding those who are opposed to us as parochialists. When I hear certain honourable members claimingto be actuated by strong national feelings on this question, I cannot help remembering that on other questions on - which, I entirely disagreed with them they have also made claim to national pretensions. I have never visited the Territory, and have to view this matteT in the light of what I read and what I hear from honourable members ar.d from gentlemen who have traversed portions, if not the whole, of the Territory. I have come 16 the conclusion that it is essential for the Comijionwealth to acquire the Territory in the interests of Australia as a whole. I cannot help paying my meed of praise to the people cf South Australia for keeping it as clean as they have up to the present. In spite of what the honourable member for Franklin says, I believe they could have materially benefited their revenues by getting rid of the Territory .on the land-grant system. It is to their credit that they resisted all attempts in that direction. We know that those gentlemen whom we sometimes call untra-Conservatives are willing to adopt any course in placing their money out, and I feel sure that we could get a company strong enough, if not in England, at any rate, in Europe, if we wanted it, to take the Territory over, as long as it was allowed to develop the country as it thought fit. We cannot help conceding to the people' of South Australia the credit for having, as far as possible, kept the Territory white. While Chinese have been greatly used in opening up the Gountry'and building the railway, yet the Chinese population is decreasing, and the white population, is increasing. Having conceded credit to South Australia on those points, I must admit that the South Australians, as Mr Mathews. a people, are driving as hard a bargain as they can in their own interests. I do not complain of them for doing that, seeing that almost every other State in the Union has done something similar, and has, unfortunately, got what it has asked for. I do not know that South Australia is asking too much. I am quite willing to believe that there is a strong section of politician's in South Australia who woul<3 be only too willing, even now, to breakthe agreement and resort to the land-grant system for the building of a railway to open up the Territory ; but, of course, this Parliament would have a say on the black labour question. I believe that-a majority of the people in South Australia would fight against a landgrant system if this Parliament were so foolish as not to come to some arrangement"" with the State for taking the Territory over. Of course, the old bogy that we have in every State, in the shape of a House of landlords, will be trotted out. Those individuals are always interested in the holding of large 'landed properties in the interests of a few. The whole of the fight has centred in the question of the proper route for the railway to follow; but I do not think there is one man in the House who can give a conclusive opinion on that matter. He would require, firs: of all, a full knowledge of the whole of the Territory; and 1 do not think many men have that. One alternative route that has been suggested by many would not tend to the development of the Northern Territory at all. It would simply be for the development of the eastern States. I do not think a deviation to the east would matter much, because the other section might be placated by going afew hundred miles further west, and touching the eastern boundary of the MACDonnell Ranges; but with regard to' the suggestion to start from Mildura, on the Murray, and carry a line into New South Wales, almost through the centre of Queensland, and then across to Pine Creek, it is, of course, very evident that those who put that forward are doing so with a view to the eastern States benefiting. I could not help thinking that Brisbane interests were actuating the honorabliinembcr for Brisbane in the strong attack he made upon the route through the centre of the Northern Territory. The fact that Tasmania recognises that she has no possible chance of any material benefit from a railway probably explains the sentiments expressed by the honourable member for Franklin this afternoon.",70
374,Mr LAIRD SMITH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Doc s not the honourable member think that it might make a market for our products?,72
375,Mr MATHEWS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It might, but 1 believe that Tasmania will get the least material benefit of ail the States from any railway, whatever route it follows. She can only share in the general national benefit. I am inclined to think that, wherever the railway goes in the Territory, it must be built to develop the Territory, which, it must be remembered, will be Federal property after being acquired by the Commonwealth. Regarding the matter as a layman, I am of opinion that the line should not be taken by way of Hergott and Oodnadatta, but continued north from Tarcoola, and kept to the west of the MacDonnell Ranges, until it gets somewhere near Tanami, where we are told there is gold-bearing country; from there it could proceed north. That would provide for the opening up of country., which is not likely to be touched in the near future by State lines. New South Wales will, of course, push her railways westward, and Queensland will continue to do so. It does not heed much imagination to suppose that the line to Longreach will ultimately be pushed westward to meet the Commonwealth line.  traffic' from the Northern Territory before the Commonwealth line does so.",72
376,Mr MATHEWS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Queenslan d proposes to extend her. railway from Cloncurry to Camooweal, which will develop her"" own country, and attract trade from ""the Northern Territory between Pine Creek and the Roper River and Camooweal, which is the best known portion of the Territory at present. Queenslanders who object to the transcontinental line being taken through the centre of Australia are a little selfish, seeing that their railways will tap the Territory before the Commonwealth line can do .so. In voting for the Bill, I accept' the statement of the honourable member for Ballarat that, when he made the original agreement with representatives of South Australia, it Was decided that the transcontinental line might be deviated to the east or to the west as might be necessary in the interests of Australia. South Australia would have lost nothing had it left it to this Parliament to settle the whole matter, though I do not blame the people of the State for refusing to trust us, seeing that the eastern States endeavour to get all the material benefits of the expenditure of the Federation. The advocacy of the central route by representatives of South Australia, who are all of one mind in this matter, though differing widely in their general politics, is evidence that the people of South Australia desire that the Territory should be transferred to the Commonwealth, and wish. for the material benefit to be obtained by the construction of the transcontinental.railway. I expected that the honourable member for Ballarat would have done more to prove that the original agreement allowed a deviation. Of course, the people of the State may say that that was riot intended, but Mr O'Loughlin's opinion' might be asked, seeing that he took part in the Conference. After serious consideration, I have come to the conclusion that the Northern Territory must be acquired by the Commonwealth for several reasons. In the first place,"" South Australia cannot develop it. I do not think that any nation would make a military landing in the Northern Territory with the object of ultimately securing possession of the continent'.",72
377,Mr JH CATTS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,No army could be got overland,72
378,Mr MATHEWS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"No . Of course, if a landing were made, and trie invaders were not driven out, they would in time establish themselves there, as the African negroes have established themselves in the United States of America, by living there for generation after generation. I do not look upon the proposed railway as of much advantage for the conveyance of troops. The difficulty of'conveying troops over 800 miles of railway was shownin the South African war.",72
379,Dr MALONEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"But during the RussoJapanese war over 1,000,000 men were transported by the Siberian railway.",72
380,Mr MATHEWS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"We must take reasonable precautions.. The eastern nations, and especially Japan, desire to expand. I hope that Japan will confine her efforts to Korea, China, and Formosa. The honourable member for Grey spoke of the' millions of coloured people within a comDaratively short distance of the Northern Territory. It is a wonder that they have not come to Australia already. But western ideas are beginning to spread, and the eastern nations are beginning to follow the example of European nations by trying to' enlarge their territories. As I feel that the only way out of the difficulty with which we are ""faced is for the Commonwealth to take control of the Northern Territory, I shall vote for the Bill. South Australia is, of course, making a good bargain, but she has alienated as little as possible of the Territory, and we shall have no coloured races to drive out when we take possession.",72
381,Sir JOHN QUICK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Bendigo) [9.5s] The question' of taking over the Northern Territory, has been before the people of Australia ever' since the accomplishment of Federation. It. has been the subject of discussion in this House in two sessions. The whole matter has been exhaustively debated on both sides, and one feels irresistibly drawn to the conclusion that the time has come, that the hour has struck, when we must'definitely'decide' whether or not we are' going to take over the Territory on - the terms available to us. It is just as Well that today we have had the case presented from' both sides. The case against the adoption of the agreement has been fairly stated by two honourable members in particular; by the honourable member for Brisbane and the honourable member for Franklin. But I think that after considering their pessimistic utterances and giving due weight to their arguments the case for the Bill must be regarded as overwhelmingly strong. Their speeches have not in any way refuted the strong case presented in support of the agreement by the ex-Minister of External Affairs, the honourable member for Darling Downs; by the present Minister of External Affairs; by the ex-Prime Minister the Leader of the Opposition, by the honourable member for Grey, and by several others. Those speeches, considered together - with the literature which is available to all honourable members, have, in my opinion, made out a strong and convincing case. They have shown, first of all, that the Northern Territory is worth taking over. It is worth fighting .for, and when we acquire it will be worth holding, worth spending money, upon to develop it, and worthy of the consideration of the highest and best statesmanship that Australia can devote to it. The objections that have Been made to some of the terms of the agreement particularly relate to the question of the railwav. But I think .that we ought to give due credit to the negotiators who arrived at the agreement, representing respectively the Commonwealth and the State of South Aus- tralia, for having done their best for th<: interests with which they were charged. It was hardly to be expected that the representatives of South Australia, who had to conduct the negotiations - on behalf of their State, would on the one hand disregard utterly, her interests. Nor could the representatives of the Commonwealth have ignored its interests, or failed to do their best for them. After listening to the explanations given by the Leader of the Opposition-clear , lucid, and straightforward as they were-as to the circumstances in which the agreement was entered into, and the considerations and inducements affecting both sides, one must feel convinced that the very best was done.' It may be' that there is, to some extent, an ambiguity in the agreement. ' I will refer to it later on'. But that ambiguity may be got over by friendly negotiations at a subsequent stage between the two Governments. I think that the Northern Territory, as portrayed on the map hanging in the chamber, is an inheritance which the people of Australia ought to be proud to have an opportunity to participate in . . I am convinced that we should not be doing common justice to the Government and the people of South Australia if we did not give them full credit for the way in which they have so far managed and conducted the affairs of the Territory under trying and ' difficult circumstances, retaining it without seriously hampering it by exces-' sive burdens or unnecessary debts and obligations, and certainly avoiding the dangers to which the honourable member for Grey has referred-danger s which would have accrued from a hostile or coloured population being located there. We take over the Territory free from any such taint, difficulty, or danger. The money borrowed, for which we have to assume responsibility, may not all have-been spent to the very best advantage; but all young communities naturally make financial mistakes. Such mistakes have been made, and will be made again, without necessarily reflecting upon the capacity for self-government of the early pioneering Governments that made them. At any rate, it is obvious that South Australia, with her limited financial resources, has not been able to bring to bear upon the Northern Territory that great power of development and government which will be at the command of the Commonwealth of Australia. Therefore, the Commonwealth is not only justified, but bound, to take it over, and to do so without any further delay. Because delays are, and will be, dangerous. Negotiations for a supplementary agreement in modification of the existing agreement would probably involve a delay of years; and that delay would not in any way free the Commonwealth from any of the difficulties or_ embarrassments which at present confront iF. If this agreement were defeated by a hostile amendment being carried, I entertain no doubt whatever, from what I have heard in this House, and from the manifestations of public opinion in South Australia, of which I have read, that the Legislature and the people of that State will make a fresh start with the Northern Territory, will launch upon fresh enterprises, will probably begin to construct a railway in - a manner, and in the direction, and under - conditions which suit them best, without consulting the Commonwealth. Inevitably the time will come-the time must comewhen the Commonwealth will take over this area of country, either as a Territory or as a new State. If the Territory be incorporated as a new State, probably by that time the railway that we have been talking so much about will be an accomplished fact, and we shall have to take it over without having had a voice in its construction. I should like to point out that the agreement as it stands, with the admitted ambiguity in it, may not prevent the realization or the carrying out of that deviation from the direct route through the MACDonnell Ranges, to which the Leader of the Opposition has referred, and which he said was apparently concurred in by  possibility.",73
382,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Why was not that provided for in the Bill?,74
383,Sir JOHN QUICK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I have said that, unfortunately, there is an ambiguity in the Bill. If , however, the matter were to be determined by paragraph 1, sufi-paragraph b, of the agreement, there would fce no ambiguity. The mandate is not to be found in that portion of the agreement, but in a subsequent portion, which is slightly inconsistent with this paragraph. graph b, which, I would point out, deals with the obligations and powers of the Commonwealth, - readsThe Commonwealth .. shall construct, or cause to be constructed, a railway line from Fort Darwin southwards to a point on the northern boundary of South Australia proper (which Tailway, with the railway from a point on the Sort Augusta railway to connect therewith, is hereinafter referred to as the Transcontinental Railway). If the matter depended upon that paragraph alone, which, it will be observed, the dominating paragraph dealing with the obligations of the Commonwealth, there can be no doubt that it would be within the competence of the Commonwealth to construct a railway in the outer circle, so to speak, indicated by the map hanging on the wall of the chamber.",74
384,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"And go outside the Territory ? Sir JOHN QUICK. Undoubtedly; under the paragraph, because that would be a railwav going southward td ""the boundary of the State of South Australia. There would be nothing to prevent it from go:ng out into the adjacent .portion of Queensland and coming in at the northern bounday of South Australia.",74
385,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That is, under that paragraph ?",74
386,Sir JOHN QUICK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Yes . That is, apparently, the dominating paragraph, and the only one which defines the obligations of the Commonwealth. I am not now endeavouring to give an authoritative legal interpretation of the agreement. That has already been done by authorized officials, namely, by the Attorney-General of South Australia on the one hand, and by the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth on the other hand. I am merely pointing out what may be-the parts of the agreement on which those authorities rely in support of their respective contentions. I have nd doubt that the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth relies on that paragraph in support of his view in favour of a deviation to the eastward, and probably the Attorney-General of South Australia relies on the paragraph which was quoted by the honourable member for Franklin, and' which he described as the recital paragraph. What does paragraph c of clause 2 of the agreement-whic h I shall, for the sake of shortness, call the recital paragraph-refe r to? It does not refer to the powers or the obligations of the Commonwealth, but to something which South Australia has to do. Para- It readsThe State . . . shall . . . at the time of such surrender authorize by legislation the Commonwealth to do all that is necessary to enable the Commonwealth to make surveys', . . . .acquire the necessary lands,- and to construct, or cause to be constructed, a railway in South Australia proper from any point on the"" Port Augusta Tailway to a point on the northern boundary line of South Australia proper to connect with that part of the Transcontinental Railway to be built in the Northern Territory from Fort Darwin southwards to the northern boundary of South Australia proper. . . . is These are not enacting words, but mere recitals' of something apparently thought to :be intended. ""They are hardly - words' of limitation or of command. They are certainly, not words imposing an obligation on the Commonwealth: They are words of description, apparently inserted by the draftsman, and that. was probably where the mistake referred to by the Leader of the Opposition occurred. These are the only words in the whole of the agreement which introduce ambiguity.",74
387,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"But that is clear enough, is it not?",75
388,Sir JOHN QUICK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Yes ; but, as I have said, these are not enacting words, but words apparently of recital or description.",75
389,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,South Australia must permit that?,75
390,Sir JOHN QUICK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Yes , South Australia must permit the Commonwealth to make .surveys in order to carry out the connection from Port'Augusta to the boundary of the State. However, I do not intend to carry this legal argument any further.",75
391,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Does not trie honourable member think that we ought to be clear on the question?,75
392,Sir JOHN QUICK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"We cannot help ourselves. Here is an ambiguity which the Leader of the Opposition has said has crept into the agreement, which escaped the vigilance of the law officers, and which will somehow have to be got over. If the Bill be passed even in its present form, possibly negotiations Can be entered into hereafter by the respective Governments to arrive at an understanding to reconcile and dispose of this ambiguity without resorting to litigation. At any rate, so far as a mandate is imposed on the Commonwealth by the agreement, that is to construct a railway from Port Darwin southwards to the northern boundary of South Australia. If it does that, it will carry out the mandatory portion of the agreement.",75
393,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That is not opinion of South Australia, one of the contracting authorities'.",75
394,Sir JOHN QUICK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I am aware of that, as I stated at' the beginning of my speech. I am not attempting to predict what the High Court might decide.",75
395,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Does not the honourable member think that it' would be better for us to make the agreement clear,75
396,Sir JOHN QUICK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Undoubtedly ; but probably if we inserted an adverse amendis ment it would mean the smashing up of the agreement, and the postponement' of the whole thing for years. While regretting the ambiguity, and regretting that Parliament has not a free hand, I feel forced into accepting the Bill, and making the very best which can _be made of this bargain .with the ambiguity, hoping that at a later stage the two Governments will be able to.arrive at an understanding which will avoid a conflict, and the possibility of an appeal to litigation; at any rate, to come fo an understanding which will prevent any dangerous delay, because, even though the agreement be passed, South Australia, if it could not come to an understanding, could not force the Commonwealth to proceed with the construction, of this railway within any particular limit of time. The Commonwealth will be the master of the situation. It can decide when and in what circumstances the railway is to be started. It seems almost inevitable that the eastern States should show a disposition to have a ""'cut in , "" so to speak, or to tap this transcontinental railway, and make it an avenue directly or indirectly communicating with their own western borders. 'But we ought to realise that the problem is which' railway and which route would best develop the Territory, not which railway or which route would best promote the interests of Victoria, or New South Wales', or Queensland. It is of no use to construct a railway to divert traffic into Queensland for its benefit, or into New South Wales for its benefit, or into Victoria for its benefit, if such diversion would not benefit the Territory. We want-the railway to go. through the principal portions of this country-to be able, to make such deviations as may be necessary to include the best portions of the Territory. The interests even of South Australia should be subordinate to the interests of the Territory In deciding the route of the railway. I suppose that South Australians will admit that. It has been pointed out by the Leader of the Opposition, that the final decision of the the route ought not to be arrived at before an exhaustive inquiry has been made under Commonwealth supervision, and the results of proper exploration's are available. Mr 'HIGGS - The agreement does not say that.",75
397,Sir JOHN QUICK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The agreement leaves the Commonwealth to determine the now? route from Port Darwin south to the northern boundary of South Australia. It quite open to question whether the words of recital in the subsequent part of the agreement dominate its qualifying words. Consequently, I think there is a good deal to .be saicl in support of the opinion which has-been expressed by the Attorney-General. - The question of the route of the rauway must be determined in the interests of the Northern Territory; tut I see that one of the projected lines is intended to cut into Cainooweaj at the parallel on which Townsville is situated, leaving the, Northern ritory * hundred ihiles south of the a e w ocean. That is scarcely a. line calculated to benefit the Territory. It may be a railway which is intended to divert traffic into Queensland, and. if so, it is doubtless one in which Queenslanders feel a kindly interest. But I assume that, in making this big bargain, we ought to consider the interests of Australia. Of what use wouid such a line be for developing the Northern Territory? It would leave the whole question of the railway through 'that Territory still unsettled.",75
398,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,It would drain the western portion «f Queensland at Port Darwin.,76
399,Sir JOHN QUICK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It would still be necessary to construct a railway through the Northern Territory, either to the cast or west of or through the MucDonnell Ranges. I do not consider that'we are bound to take the direct route through those ranges. But the Commonwealth Government, in negotiation with the Government of South Australia, and with its friendly assistance and co-operation, may be trusted to make the ""best 'Surveys to enable us to arrive at a decision upon this question. In conclusion, I believe that if the Bill be passed, there will be a rapid development of colonization and civilization in this big Territory. Recently, I had the honour to introduce to the Minister of External Affairs a gentleman who represents a powerful syndicate, which is prepared to spend no less a sum than ^£250,000 in the development of some of this northern country in the region of Arnheim's Land.",76
400,Mr BATCHET,NORTHERN TERRITORY,OR - Jus t to the Anthony's Lagoon.,76
401,Sir JOHN QUICK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The money is waiting to be invested there. All that is required' is that the company shall be granted security of tenure by the Commonwealth. When that is forthcoming, it is preparedro at once enter upon the expenditure of capital in introducing stock and the necessary labour to carry out their great undertaking. The gentleman in question is a resident of Bendigo, and only recently arrived from London. He is anxious that this Bill should be passed, in order that his negotiations may be completed. Every year's delay of this problem of government means delay in the settlement and colonization of this important part of the Commonwealth. Millions Of money Ter- may be lost as the result of delay. Delay, therefore, is to be deprecated, and any further postponement of this question ought to be opposed by every true friend of the Commonwealth, and by every person who has faith in the prospects and future destiny of the Northern Territory. In commcn with other 'honourable members, I have for years advocated the taking over of that Territory, and the time has arrived when we ought to take it over and do the best that we can with it. Although there is an ambiguity in the agreement, w-j must trust that that ambiguity will be overcome and that we shail obtain a truly national railway, which will not be constructed for the benefit of anv State, hut for the benefit of the Northern Territory itself. 7",76
402,Mr HIGGS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Capricornia) [10.22] - I feel that I cannct allow the second reading of this measure lopass without making a few observations. We appear to have gone somewhat crazy upon the subject of defence. Without doubt, we ought to rlu all that we can to train our citizens to defend our hearths and homes. I have advocated the adoption of that course for a dozen years past, and it was one of tlm argument* which. I used in favour of the establishment of Federation. But since the advent of Federation, we seem to have become abnormally alarmed about our defenceless condition. Any honourable number who desires a transcontinental railway to be constructed anywhere in Australia, usually, pleads that it is necessary for the defence of the country. In my opinion, we have to apprehend no danger at present west of from Japan. That nation has Korea, Manchuria, ""and Formosa to settle; and it is extremely unlikely that a country which has had its hands very full with Russia, aud which still has to pay off a considerable war debt, will attempt an invasion of Australia. It is true that China is awakening; but she is awakening only because the so-called Great Powers of the world have been stirring her up. We shall receive warning from China long before she artempts to attack Australia. That warning will take the form of a notification to all foreigners to quit China. They may expect to be driven but of that country, because they have goaded it into training its citizens as soldiers. Even the British have acted - the part of tyrants by forcing the opium trade upon China. We owe a debt of gratitude to South Australia for the hold' she has kept upon the Northern Territory. I remember reading that in 1898 it was proposed that a very considerable area of land in the Territory should be granted to any syndicate provided they settled there a colony of at least three Japanese to every acre. If that proposal, which was agreed to by the British Government, had been carried into effect, we should long before this have had thousands of Japanese settled in the Northern Territory. The proposal was opposed by the Government of which the Right Honourable Charles Cameron Kingston was the head, and it never reached fruition. But because South Australia has held the Territory for us, and because there is a great wave of national sentiment at present passing over Australia, that is no reason why the people of South Australia should endeavour to exploit that sentiment in order to compel the taxpayers of the Commonwealth to find ^4,000,000 or .£5,000,000 for the construction of a railway which may not pay. I cannot believe that the Minister in charge of this Bill, and other Labour members who are supporting him, and intend to accept the agreement as it stands, are desirous of pressing upon the Commonwealth a huge burden of debt. I am satisfied that not one of these honourable members, if they realized that it would handicap the Labour movement of Australia, would urge the adoption of a proposal which will involve the Commonwealth in a debt of some millions, the interest on which must be met by Commonwealth taxpayers, wherever they may reside.",76
403,Mr ARCHIBALD,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The honourable memmissioner ber thinks that those interested in the Labour movement should never take a' national view.,77
404,Mr HIGGS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"No ; I think that members of the Labour party hold national views. It is because I am afraid that. this proposal will compel the Com-, monwealth to build a railway r Creek southwards to a point on the Port Augusta to Oodnadatta line which would cost so many millions, and that the diffiern culty of finding the money would impede annual permit. the progress of the Labour movement throughout Australia, that I am opposed to it. We shall require to expend a great deal of money when we take over the Northern Territory. I wonder if the honourable members who .propose to take it over under the terms of the agreement have in mind any scheme for its development? What are they going to do with it when they get it?",77

406,Mr HIGGS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,How does the honourable member propose to open - up the country ? Is it by granting large areas to pastoralists at a rental of is. or 2s. 6d. per square mile ? That is all that has been done with the Territory so far.,77
407,Mr ARCHIBALD,NORTHERN TERRITORY,For what reason?,77
408,Mr HIGGS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That is a question which the honourable member should answer. Why is it that, so far, the only means adopted for the development of the Territory has been to grant large areas to pastoralists ? . Let me inform honourable members that I approach this question with an entirely open mind. I have never been in the Northern Territory, butT have read a great deal about it, and I find that the opinions expressed by men who have been there are very contradictory. Some say that the land there is good, and others that it is very poor.",77
409,Mr ARCHIBALD,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Contradictor y opinions are expressed about the land in Queensland, also.",77
410,Mr HIGGS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I have""no-doubt that the honourable member considers that a very pertinent interjection. Let me give him the reply to it. Will he tell me why it is that Mr O'Loughlin, the Minister for Agriculture in South Australia and Comfor Lands in the Northern Territory has, within the last few years, sent his sons to Queensland to get land if the land in the Northern Territory is as good as some persons would have us believe? most The honourable member is silent.",77
411,Mr ARCHIBALD,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I am not silent. That would not be necessary if the country were from Pine opened up by railways.  one could get an acre of land in the NorthTerritory since 1897, except on an",77
412,Mr HIGGS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"If there is good land in 'ihV Northern Territory, why has South Australia not continued the Hue from Oodnadatta to the good country, which we »re told is lo be found theie? '. Mr ARCHIBALD - Because bad times caine along, and then Federation. - Mr HIGGS - Peopl e are leaving South Australia in dozens and going to Queensland, and it is a fact that Mr O'Loughlin has sent his sons to that State to get land. This fact seems to me to confirm the statement that the land in the Northern Territory is not so good as some South Australians say it is. But, even if the land were poor, I should raise no protest against the taking over of the Territory by the Commonwealth. I hold that we should take it over. My objection is to the demand made in the agreement that the Commonwealth shall construct a railway southwards, from Pine Creek to a point on the Port Augusta railway. I claim that ""southwards"" has only one reasonable meaning in this connection, and that is that the line must be taken by the direct route indicated on the map exhibited in the chamber. I was interested yesterday in listening to the honourable member for' Ballarat referring eloquently to the national sentiment, and saying that he thought the Federal Parliament ought to have the power to construct the railway by the best route. The Minister of External Affairs cheered that statement to the echo, as did other South Australian representatives. But the moment the honourable member for Ballarat proposed that there should be an addition to the agreement to say that the Federal Parliament should have the right to take the railway where it pleased, representatives of South Australia said, "" No, you must not alter a comma in the agreement, because, if you co, you will spoil the whole thing, and the Conunonweallh will not be able to get the Territory."" Honourable members must have heard often enough that in our Courts the Judges consider only the wording of the sections of tin Act of Parliament, and take no notice of the speeches which may have been delivered in Parliament in connection with them. It is not to be presumed that, in the event of any dispute as to the route by which this Hue should be constructed, Judges called upon to decide the matter wou:d read the.speeches delivered on this Bill. They would take the words of the agreement, and 1 submit that it is cleat from the wording of the agreement that the line must be constructed southwards, as some of the supporters of the agreement have frankly admitted. It is useless for honourable members supporting this measure to try to persuade Western Australian representatives that the line may be taken towards Western Australia, or Queensland representatives that it may be taken towards Camooweal, because we shall not be able to do that if the agreement is carried. I shall vole to take oveT the Northern Territory, but I shall"" try in Committee to secure for this Parliament the power to construct the railway along the best route, to be decided after u thorough investigation by engineers. I should like honourable members to consider what we are to do with the Northern Territory when we get it. How is it proposed that we should settle it? There is any amount of good country in New South Wales and in Queensland yet to be settled. Mr MCVYi.r.LiAMS - There is a little bit in Western Australia.",78
413,Mr HIGGS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"There is a very great deal of land yet to be settled in Western Australia. We have only to look at ihe map to sec that (he area in Western Australia still unsettled is as large as the Northern Territory itself, and if there is any force in the argument that we are likely to be invaded in tile north, that part of Western Australia is as open to invasion as is the Northern Territory. The only way 10 settle and develop the Territory would be to advance considerable sums of public ir.orrjy to people prepared to live there. Judging by the slow progress made in settlement in Queensland, good as the lands are there, I think that in the Northern Territory we should not only have to advance money for Ihe building of houses, but assist the settlers in getting their produce to market ber docs not object to that?",78
414,Mr HIGGS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I am only pointing out that that is what, in my opinion, we shall have to do, and we shall no: be able to find the money if we spend several millions in constructing a Tailway which may not pay. Honourable members speak of the Northern Territory as being of great value to the Comnionwealth; but there is no doubt, it will eventually have to be handed ovei: to the people who go there to live, and! who will then have placed on them the indebtedness caused by the expenditure on the railway. The South Australians are asking the Commonwealth to recoup them all the money they have borrowed in the past for public works in the Northern Territory, and later on, when the people in the north establish their own local Parliament, which, I hope, will be at the earliest possible time, they will, be asked to take upon themselves the expense previously borne by the whole Commonwealth in opening up the country. .If we are to develop the Territory as it should be developed, there will have to be an agricultural policy, with a Minister of Agriculture; a railway policy, with a Min-ister of Railways; a land policy, with a Minister of Lands; together with a Minister of Education and a Minister of Mines, and so on. The honourable member for Hindmarsh laughs, and thus shows that he cannot have given much thought to the question. Honourable members do not seem to realise the task we are taking upon ourselves, and the terrible expense that will be involved. Of course, if all that is to be done is to take over the Northern Territory and relieve South Australia of her present burden, well and good; but if we desire to settle the country, Departments such as I have indicated must be created.",78
415,Mr ARCHIBALD,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That would fill the place with "" carpet-baggers"" from the start I",79
416,Mr HIGGS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It is the honourable memspirit ber's policy which would fill the place ""carpet-baggers,"" seeing that he proposes to govern the Northern Territory from bourne, and that a lot of officials will required to collect the rents from the pastoralists, who, we are told, are going settle there. Later on we shall find ther .the honourable member or myself right.",79

419,Mr HIGGS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"There is not much in the proposals before us, if we have to wait long. I think I express the national view when -1 say that we should relieve South Australia of her burden; but I also express the national view when I protest against ah agreement which binds us to construct the proposed railway in a certain direction; and in Committee I shall endeavour to carry an amendment in that regard.",79
420,Mr HEDGES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Fremantle) [10.42] I quite agree with the honourable member for Capricornia that this agreement should not be trammelled by a railway stipulation. This question has not been placed before the House in a proper light. A threat is held out that the transcontinental railway to Kalgoorlie will not be approved unless this agreement is entered into. In fact, there are threats all through, seeing that the Commonwealth is told that it will not be allowed to do this, that, or the other unless Parliament agrees to the construction of the Pine Creek to Oodnadatta line. We have had a lot of '-'-'clap-trap "" to the effect that the Northern Territory must be taken over in order that it may be defended ; but, so tar as I understand, agreement or no agreement, the Commonwealth must defend the Northern Territory. In regard to the railway to Kalgoorlie, the South Australians have been the stumbling block from start to finish. Years ago Western Australia offered to construct a railway from the west lo Port Augusta, and pay the interest on the cost of construction ; but South Australia refused thaf offer. If that is not a "" dog-in-the-manger "" I do not know what is ! South Auswith tralia has had this northern line in view for years past; but they must recognise Melthat the distance is greater from Colombo be to Palmerston than from Colombo to Perth. big The mail steamers would have to dodge to many islands in order to get to Palmerwheston, and with a rise and fall in the tide is of about 40 feet, it would never be known whether or not they could get to a jetty. On the other hand,- there is a straight run to Perth, with ample port accommodation, and, that being so, the mail boats would Territory, never go to Palmerston.",79
421,Dr MALONEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Who desires that the sufmail boats should go to Palmerston?,79
422,Mr HEDGES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That is one of the bechief arguments in favour of the proposed and railway. Is it fair that Queensland and Western Australia should be saddled with a portion of the upkeep of this new State, so while South Australia is relieved? What are we going to do with the Territory when we take it over ? South Australia has done its best to open it up during the last thirty years, and has failed. When I went to South Australia thirty years ago I found that the southern portion of the State had been nearly ruined by the efforts of the Government to open up the north. Sons of old settlers had been sent up there to try to make a living, but had either died or had returned impoverished or ruined. Some of the smartest and best men in Australia have endeavoured, without success, to develop the Territory. The failure was ascribed in the first instance to the want of a railway, and a line from Port Darwin to Pine Creek was accordingly constructed. We are told that South Australia is entitled to every credit for having kept the Northern Territory white. She went a strange way about the work of keeping it white. The State Government rejected a tender to construct the Pine Creek line by white labour, and accepted one which made provision for the employment of coloured aliens. The Northern Territory is the only part of Australia where aliens have worked in harness. The Chinese engaged in the construction of the Port Darwin to Pine Creek railway line worked in harness; they wore collars like horses, and dragged trucks from the cuttings to the tips. The country was so bad that as soon as the line was constructed the Chinese left.",79
423,Dr MALONEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Who was the contractor for that line?,80
424,Mr HEDGES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It was built by Messrs. Millar Brothers, who, under their contract, were _ allowed to employ Chinese labour. The Chinese are not the only race who have been in the Northern Territory and have deserted it. As far back as the fifteenth century the northern part of Australia was known as Great Java; , The Portuguese first held it, but could not settle it. In the teenth century the Spaniards sailed through Torres Straits and tried in vain to settle the country. The Dutch likewise failed, and South Australia, having made fruitless efforts to develop the Territory, now asks the Commonwealth to take up the burden. This proposal is all very well from a South Australian point of view, and if I represented that State I should probably be found supporting this Bill just as vigorously as are my South Australian friaids. I should recognise that I was doing my best for the State in trying to induce the Commonwealth to shoulder the burden.  the proposed Western Australian transcon[164]- 2 tinental line. Why attack the Northern Territory ?",80
425,Mr HEDGES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I am speaking in an impersonal sense. The honourable member for Grey knows that some of the cleverest men in Australia have tackled the problem of developing the Northern Territory and have failed. A blunder was committed in the first place in constructing the railway from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta. That line was intended originally not to open up the Northern Territory, .but to rob Queensland of the traffic from the Diamantina and the Cooper. A line was surveyed to the Queensland border. When the railway reached Hergott Springs, however, it could go no further owing to the flooded state of - the country, and even the surveyed route was lost. A route was then chosen towards Oodnadatta. Later on it was found that another blunder had been committed in aiming at the construction of a line over the highest part of Australia. With the exception of the big Dividing Range, there is only one ""pimple"" in Australia which reaches an altitude of 3,000 or 4,000 feet. I refer to the MACDonnell Ranges, and we are asked to put a railway through that country. Pictures are exhibited showing a gap through which a railway could be carried. The largest rocks immediately abutting on this gap are 60 feet high, but they are as nothing compared with the ranges running up as high as 3,000 or 4.000 feet. Would any sensible people try to run a railway over that elevated country when an easier route could be found? The route starts east by north. After reaching Hergott Springs it runs in a westerly direction, and then turns due north. Hacl any more deviations been made a complete circle would have been described. A more devious route could six- not have been chosen had the surveyors been paid for their work by the mile. The route chosen suggests the flight of carrier pigeons; they fly in a circle and )'ou never know where they will take off. We are now asked to take over this railway. Beggars should not be choosers. Surely South Australia should not impose conditions as to the route to be followed, and' attempt to dictate to all Australia? As to the attempt of South Australia to compel the Commonwealth to build the western railway vid Tarcoola, I would point out that the South Australian authorities would not agree to the survey of a line running straight to the west. It was said that it would be unwise from a defence point of view to follow a route too close to the coast, yet at a point a little further west a course was chosen running very close to the coast.",80
426,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Why carry the Western Australian transcontinental line to Kalgoorlie-wh y go so far north?,81
427,Mr HEDGES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"A survey has to be made to the nearest point of population, lt is 'unfair that one State should attempt to impose conditions on the whole Commonwealth as to the terms upon which it shall be allowed to take over "" its Territory,"" as it calls it. We are told that the Northern Territory is a beautiful country in which to reside and work. Last month I was talking to a man who told me that on the second day after his arrival in the Northern Territory the heat was so great that the leather was burnt off his boots. Life in the Territory is no picnic. We are told that a big population is to be brought from the Old Country and settled there. It would be cruelty to settle new arrivals in the Territory. Since people from other parts of Australia have refused to go there, how can we reasonably expect new arrivals from the Old World to settle there? I know of no means of settling that country. We are asked to build a line hundreds of miles long, and terminating at a point where there is a population of only 1,000 white people. If those people could afford to travel up and down that line every day, and pay their fares, it would not earn working expenses. It would never pay to run wool, wheat, or any other product over such a long length of railway.  such products over the proposed Western Australian transcontinental railway?",81
428,Mr HEDGES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"We have a population of over 300,000 in Western Australia, as against a population of only 1,000 in the Northern Territory. The fact that the Territory cannot be developed without a railway is mere "" clap-trap."" How was Western Australia developed without a railway from the east ? We have a growing population there, and yet at present there is no railway joining that State in the east.",81
429,Mr LAIRD SMITH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Wester n Australia was unknown before the discovery of gold.,81
430,Mr HEDGES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The interjections of some honourable members clearly show that they are prepared to vote in the dark, and know nothing about this question. They talk about Western Australia not being discovered until gold was found. Are they aware that it was discovered before Vic-, toria, New South Wales, or Tasmania? New Holland, as it was called, was discovered by the Dutch people before they got as far as Tasmania, and then they found ' Tasmania by accident. Dirk Hartog sailed down the coast of Western Australia in 1616. Had that portion of. Australia which was discovered back in the fifteenth century by the Portuguese been the paradise that we are led to believe today, it would have been settled, and instead of the people now going from the south to the north, they would be coming from the north to settle the southern portion. I hope honourable members will consider seriously what .they are going to saddle the Commonwealth with. There is, perhaps, not much harm in a State being unable to do better than South Australia has done, but it would be a standing disgrace to the Commonwealth if it took the Territory over and could not do better with it than has been done in the past. Other portions of Australia require defending as much as the middle of it. My idea is that if we had the four corners defended, the middle would look after itself. I am certain that nobody is going to interfere with the MACDonnell Ranges, anyway. Even the 'South Australians have not yet had the pluck to build the railway up to them. I do not think they ever made up their minds where that railway was really going to. It reminds me of Jerome K . Jerome's story about the porter telling the stationmaster that there was a strange train in the station. The stationmaster told him to ask where it came from, and he replied, "" I do not think it knows itself; it to run seems a little dotty."" Similarly, this railway is a little dotty. It does not know where it came from or where it is aiming at. If the Commonwealth dares to take over the proposition of running the traffic such as would be required on a line of that length on a rickety 3 f t . 6 in. gauge railway, built as this one has been, it will be the worse enterprise that was ever started in Australia. When we do build a line we shall want a proper gauge and proper rails. Let us have at least 80-lb. rails and decent sleepers, so that we can run the trains at 40 or 50 miles an hour. We should want to get over these long stretches as quickly as possible. This is an ill advised proposal, and it is a shame that it should come before the House when only a few members are present. I warn honourable members representing different parts of Australia that they will regret the day they agreed to take over the Teritory with the proposed conditions attached to it.
