1,Mr REITH,BUSINESS,"On indulgence, Mr Speaker: just to advise honourable members of the expected business for today, we are currently awaiting the formal processes for the Senate message re the Development Allowance Authority Amendment Bill 1996, and that should be here relatively shortly in which case the debate can resume on that matter. Following that, we are also expecting the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No.1) 1996. Both, in fact, have already been dealt with in the Senate, so it is simply a matter of the transmission of the formal documents. In the meantime, the debate on the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill 1996 will continue. From time to time it will be interrupted by those messages from the Senate. We are also proposing that there will be some procedural motions, a special adjournment and leave of absence. The remaining matter, the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) 1996, is before the Senate. Whilst the Labor opposition and the government agree on the policy of the matter, there is no agreement as to expediting the debate in the Senate. We expect the Senate will commence debate on that fairly shortly, and then debate will ensue. As soon as it becomes clear that the debate in the Senate is merely a filibuster and that the Senate will not bring the matter to a resolution in the Senate, it would obviously be no longer a necessity for us to remain sitting. There is the prospect that the Senate will deal with the matter and that it will be brought back into the House-it being a Senate initiated bill. Whilst there is the prospect that that matter can be dealt with, then it is important that the House of Representatives continues to sit. The government believes that the policy embodied in that legislation is a high priority, and we to have that legislation. The unfortunate thing is that it seems to be the intention of some the Senate to filibuster and try to talk so as to prevent the transmission of the bill to the House. The only other matter is that there is another procedural matter on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 1996 (No.2), which should not take long. Lastly, we intend to deal with the messages from the Senate and, effectively, have the natural heritage legislation as the filler in the program. However, once we have dealt with the various messages and the other procedural motions, in the time we are awaiting developments in the Senate on the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996 there would be an opportunity to have a protracted adjournment debate in this House. It was suggested by the Manager of Opposition Business, the member for Hotham (Mr Crean)--credit where credit is due-in a spirit of cooperation which is so evident from this side and, unfortunately, not evident from the other. As we have not had an opportunity to further our discussions on that, we will. If we can come to an agreement about that matter, then it would be an opportunity for debate. I know there are a number of members who wanted to speak on the adjournment during the week, but who missed the opportunity. If we can afford that opportunity, we are working to do so.",13
2,Mr CREAN,BUSINESS,"On indulgence, Mr Speaker: the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) has always been quick to accuse us of filibustering on most items before the House. Can I get some indication as to when he thinks he might arrive at that view in relation to the Senate's deliberations, so that we can work from that and get some idea as to when this place might get up? I think it is in the interests of all that we plan for that. I understand the difficulty that he is in. But if he is of the view that they may be filibustering, at what point is he going to determine that they are?",13
3,Mr SPEAKER,BUSINESS,"I know aircraft bookings are at a premium, so I would be interested in are keen the ministerial amplification.",13
4,Mr REITH,BUSINESS,"I am very pleased that it out the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Crean) should ask me this question without notice. The fact of the matter is that the people who are controlling this are, basically, the Labor Party in the Senate. That is the reason. I cannot tell you. Honestly, it is as simple as this: if the Labor Party in the Senate were prepared to agree with the government in the Senate about the management of the migration bill, I would be able to tell you exactly when we are going home. But your people in the SenateMr Crean-When are you going to make the decision?",13
5,Mr REITH,BUSINESS,"I am not in a position to make the decision, because your party in the Senate refuses to come to any agreement about the processes in the Senate so that the House of Representatives knows when and if this matter is going to come back. That is the situation. Your policy position is that you support this bill, but you are not prepared to lift a finger for the bill to be dealt with orderly or even an agreed process. Quite frankly, it is absolutely ridiculous that we have an obstructionist Senate having the House of Representatives sitting here waiting for a very important policy bill to come back. The Senate is not even prepared to come to some sensible arrangement so people know whether or not they are going to be here until 2 o'clock, 3 o'clock or 4.30. We do know that the Senate's schedule is to",14
6,Mr MELHAM,BUSINESS,It's good to see someone's in control.,14
7,Mr REITH,BUSINESS,"You would be interested to know this, I think. The Senate's schedule is for them to commence their adjournment debate at 3.45. On that basis, we have set our time allotted to complete at 4.30. This is so that if there are any matters remaining from the Senate at the time they go to the adjournment, there is time for the transmission of documents back to the House of Representatives so that we can finish. That is the basis upon which we set the 4.30 time. The truth of the matter is there is a policy of obstruction in the Senate to such an extent that they are not even prepared to give us a reasonable time schedule within which we can organise people's affairs. A lot of people on this sid- and the remaining few on your side have electoral commitments and a range of other commitments and duties which they would like to perform. We are not in a position to give a time. You should not be asking me this question. You should walk over to the side there with the red carpetMr Crean-That side.",14
8,Mr REITH,BUSINESS,"Yes, on that side, and ask your senatorsMr Crean-You don't even know where the other place is!",14
9,Mr REITH,BUSINESS,"I do not ask them for common decency, that would be asking for too much, but they could at least show some common sense and make some reasonable arrangements so people know which flights they are going to catch. NA",14
10,Mr ABBOTT,EUTHANASIA,"Warringah-Parliamentary in an Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Mfairs) (12.08 p.m.)- Mr Speaker, on indulgence, I wish to correct the record on an important matter. The Australian newspaper was good enough this morning to publish an article of mine on the subject of the Northern Territory euthanasia law. I sent them an original version and then I sent them a number of corrections. As ill luck would have it, not all the corrections made it to the final version. The fault was entirely mine for not ensuring that all the corrections went to the right place at the right time. There were various infelicities of style, for which I take full responsibility, but there was one important error-that is, the statement that attempted suicide is still a crime in the Northern Territory. That is not correct. It was a crime punishable by imprisonment for a year; that is no longer the case. The law was changed earlier this year. I thank you, Mr Speaker, for allowing me to correct the record. NA Migration Committee Membership",14
11,Mr SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"I have received advice from the Chief Opposition Whip that he has nominated Mr Martin to be a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration in place of Dr Theophanous. NA AUSTRALIA BILL 1996 Second Reading Debate resumed from 27 June, on motion by Mr Anderson: That the bill be now read a second time.",14
12,Dr LAWRENCE,NATURAL HERITAGE TRUST OF,"I welcome the opportunity, although it is a bit belated now, to speak on the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill 1996. This bill is actually a 2S-page ransom note. In plain English, it says, 'Pass the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill 1996 or the Australian environment will suffer.' That is what it says. It is pure and simple blackmail and this bill, as I said, is the ransom note. The Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) was at it again yesterday at the launch of the state of the environment report when he said that no extra funding for the environment would be available unless Telstra was sold, despite the fact the report laid out in detail where there are deficiencies in the environment today. Very clearly, the subtext of this bill the coalition considers the environment expendable. It is a great shame that the crucial environmental and land management projects that are described in the bill, and are only part of what is required, will clearly not be funded. Some $318 million, as allowed for in the bill, could be well spent on a national vegetation initiative over the next five years and $163 million, as allowed for in the bill, could usefully be committed to the rehabilitation of the Murray-Darling Basin. There is a need, and we agree, for a national land and water resources audit and the government should encourage the further development of a comprehensive national reserve system. The coasts and clean seas initiative is also a worthy pursuit. We on this side of the House do not question the need for such environmental funding at all, in fact our support for these projects is absolute. After all, they are mainly Labor programs and built on existing programs. But, unlike the coalition, we have never placed conditions on their funding. This is a very important point: Labor never held environment funding hostage as this bill does. The Labor Party considers the environment vital and it is vital government expenditure that should now and in the future be funded directly from the consolidated revenue fund. That is the way it should be done. We see no reason at all, and none has been given, to depart from the conventional funding approach. We see no reason to establish a natural heritage trust fund at all. We see no reason for this legislation to be before the parliament. It is common practice before any trust fund is established that its proponents demonstrate, or at least attempt to argue, that alternative arrangements are unsuitable. What is unsuitable about consolidated revenue arrangements? The government has not argued its case because it cannot. The bill is just plain unnecessary. Since coming to office, the Howard government has shown no interest at all in providing national leadership on environment matters. The signals to date indicate that their preferred approach is to remove the environment is that from the Commonwealth's agenda. The coalition does not even want it discussed unless it can be used as a blackmail tool. Again, we saw that yesterday with the release they of a very significant report, and all the minister wants to talk about is the sale of Telstra. The government not only on this issue but also on a whole range of other issues has shown no leadership at all on important environmental matters of national significance. Instead of protecting the environment their record is full of steps taken to roll back environmental protection, and after such a short time too. It seems that Senator Hill is always a couple of decisions behind the Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Parer). Under Senator Hill's stewardship to date, the environmental agenda has been sidelined even before it got a proper hearing. The two classic examples are the proposal to undertake uranium mining in Kakadu and the government's very defensive greenhouse position, and there are many other cases. Senator Parer is not the only government minister who manages to roll Senator Hill on the environment. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) has been successful in toppling Senator Hill on woodchips and in divvying up the responsibilities referred to in this bill. Just to deal briefly with the woodchip issue, Senator Hill has already demonstrated considerable political impotence. He gets rolled by the development ministers regularly and he has shown no commitment at all to progressing the national forest policy. The government's moves to date to disallow the current woodchip export regulations are evidence of the coalition's plans to clearly give up the reins on forest policy, to take no national leadership role, by handing it over to the states and returning to the bad old days of individual export licensing and a no holds barred approach to forest management. Basing decisions, as they are at the moment, on assertions by forest industry groups and ignoring the conservation movement on this question flies in the face of good policy and flies in the face of the 'State of the Environment' report's indication of significant threats to biodiversity from current land clearing and forestry practises. Apparently Senator Hill believes the Commonwealth should exit the field. That is not national leadership; that is a government which is abandoning its responsibilities. It is important, I think, to mention these developments because they set the climate within which the heritage bill is to be debated. For example, the government's attempt to remove export controls on minerals: yes, that was promised during the election campaign. But the environmental consequences were never spelt out, and I doubt whether many in the community understood just what they were. Fortunately we were able to prevent that happening. But that attempt had been made in a very underhand way, without any community debate at all. As I have said, we have also seen moves to increase the volume of woodchips exportedagainst all reasonable scientific advice. Also, we have seen a very defensive negotiating position on greenhouse emissions with talk of jobs in energy intensive industries, without looking at alternative technologies, without looking at the benefits of energy efficiencyvery short-sighted indeed. Of course, we have been alarmed by the apparent decision to abolish the Environment Protection Agency. These things all cast a gloomy cloud over the development of a progressive environment policy. This legislation will apparently be the government's only commitment to the environment-and we will see that it is a very hollow commitment at that. The trust is an empty shell that will never be filled. In some ways, there is very little point in having this legislation before the House. Yet those in the coalition are asking the public to believe that they are born-again greenies. They did that during the election campaign and some members of the public fell for it, much to their regret and chagrin now, I might say. Those in the coalition government complain about being frustrated by the parliament, as if the parliament were some sort of obstacle between them and their wishes. Indeed, they appear to be saying, 'If only parliament would let us sell Telstra, our wonderfully crafted environmental credentials would shine through.' The fact is that the coalition government's record on the environment to date is pathetic, neglectful and dishonest. There are lots of shortcomings too in this legislation. There are significant issues associated with the trust planned to be established by this bill which, I think, need to be clarified, even if there were a source of funding. In particular, the opposition is concerned that, once the parliament has passed the bill to establish this so-called perpetual trust, there is actually no mechanism within the bill for the parliament to scrutinise the trust's operations or to review the program's effectiveness-an extraordinary proposition. The government is effectively removing the parliament's control over an important part of Commonwealth expenditure, and yet we were told that the parliament would be pre-eminent and the executive would take a back seat on some of these questions. But here we see the parliament being removed entirely from scrutiny of very important programs. Also, trust funds notoriously have a number of obvious shortcomings-and I quote from the Commonwealth financial management handbook, which lists: . .. significant legal and accounting problems associated with a fund and the general question of whether or not the trust fund's existence unduly derogated from parliament any control of that expenditure as a significant argument against their establishment. They really must be in exceptional circumstances. After all, trust funds in and of themselves restrict parliamentary scrutiny. It is difficult to see, as I said earlier, how a government which purports to be committed to the supremacy of the parliament over the executive could actually draft a bill which would diminish the parliament's ability to vet expenditure over $400 million a year. The establishment of this trust and its capacity to remove environment funding from the parliamentary and budgetary process should be resisted by this parliament and by all environmentally concerned Australians. The opposition believes that the bill is deficient in this area and in many others. We are also concerned about the composition of the trust's board-and I hope members opposite have actually had a look at this bill; it is very curious indeed. It provides for the board to include only two people: the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. If there is to be a trust, we believe that the limited board should be expanded to include other important stakeholders, particularly from the environment movement. I would wonder too what would happen if there were some deadlock between the ministers; how would you resolve that? Two people deadlocked would be an unhappy prospect for the environment movement if they were not able to resolve the matter, and yet there is no appropriate mechanism in this bill to resolve deadlocks. In addition to reducing the parliament's control over important expenditure, trust funds are also very rigid. As the Commonwealth financial management handbook states: The purpose for which a trust account was established cannot be changed. If at some stage it proves necessary to expand or to modify the purposes of a trust account, the account must be closed, the balance repaid to the Consolidated Revenue Fund and a new trust account established with the modified purposes ... a new appropriation of the CRF would also be required for the payment to the new trust account. So it is not a very flexible vehicle either. The government's claim, therefore, of establishing a perpetual trust is nonsense. It is not possible for the government, or anyone else for that matter, to predict the environmental problems of Australia in the future or, indeed, the priority they should be assigned. The nation's environmental priorities will change in the future. The trust will need to be modified and, consequently, will have to be closed and the balance repaid to consolidated revenue. These requirements indicate the futility of establishing a perpetual environment trust in the way described in this bill. Clearly, the superior approach is to fund environment programs directly from the consolidated revenue fund. We have heard no argument why that should not be done. This is the funding approach clearly favoured by the opposition and, indeed, applying in the past to environment and other funding. One of the things about this bill worth mentioning in passing is that it makes reference to the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1996 as a way of ensuring proper financial accountability of the trust. I might say that that is a bill we have not yet seen. So the parliament is being asked to take on trust that there will be adequate precautions taken, and yet we do not know in what they will consist. We have further technical concerns with this bill, particularly the bill's references to investment in natural capital, as it is called. The government has persistently described a range of programs to be funded in this bill as capital projects. The Australian Bureau of Statistics document Government finance statistics, Australia-concepts, sources and methods 1994-which I think is a reliable source-defines capital transactions as: Payments or receipts for the acquisition. construction or saleand I repeat: acquisition, construction or saleof non-financial assets which are to be used for more than one year in the process of production. All other non-repayable transactions are regarded as current. Using this definition, let us just examine one by one the five projects rderred to in this bill. The national vegetation initiative, you would have to say, is something that is not going to be a one-off capital expenditure in the way described. It is something that will need to go on. In the past it has been funded as a recurrent expenditure and has all the characteristics of normal recurrent expenditure. Similarly, the Murray-Darling Basin initiative is not a oneoff acquisition, construction or sale of a nonfinancial asset. It is basically an ongoing long-term program. The national land and water resource audit is definitely recurrent expenditure and does not have any of the characteristics ascribed to capital. While you might say that the national reserve system, particularly in acquisition, may have some of those features, there are others that do not, particularly the management aspect. And the coast and clean seas ini tiati ve, by anyone else's definition, would be seen as recurrent and not capital expenditure. So despite the coalition's rhetoric, there is no element of this bill which can be simply defined as capital expenditure. You might wonder why they do it. The bill's shonky definition of capital expenditure actually exposes the government's attempts to hide the inherent contradiction between the coalition's privatisation election promise and its environment election promise: and it is an unhappy compromise. The coalition's privatisation policy asserts that 'proceeds of privatisation will not be used to fund recurrent expenditure.' So they just redefine it. They change the meaning of the word. The government clearly faces a dilemma. How can it reconcile its privatisation election promise with its environment election promises? The simple fact is-this bill demonstrates it-that they cannot. The promises are contradictory. So what do they do? They ignore the facts and blindly assert that the projects represent an investment in natural capital. This is clearly blatantly misleading. Not only are they breaking an election promise; they are also prepared to change government accountancy definitions to cover their tracks and hope that the Australian people will be none the wiser. The Telstra environment scam-I think that is the only way you can describe it--exposes the government's intention to use smoke and mirrors accounting tricks to hide their broken promises. It really requires a fantastic leap of faith to accept the proposition, for example, that the national land and water resources audit is capital expenditure. As I have already indicated, the coalition has made a big song and dance about its commitment to the environment. Mind you, it is sounding a bit limp lately. When the smoke clears, this supposed commitment will not have been translated into expanding and strengthening the environment department. Indeed, we are told that sections of the department are likely to be abolished, including the EPA, a very important section. It seems odd that the environment minister will be the minister responsible for preparing and tabling the trust's annual report-that is what this bill tells us-but he will be responsible, it turns out, for less than 20 per cent of the trust's funds. It starts to lose the character of an environment fund. The remaining 80 per cent will be managed by Minister Anderson's department. The only initiative Senator Hill will be responsible for is the national reserve system-less than 20 per cent. It is misleading to refer to the trust as an environment package. In fact, if you look at it closely, it is a land management package with a very small environment componentand that in the face of this baseline data which we now have about the need to repair the Australian environment. A critically important policy area such as the environment clearly requires an ongoing commitment from government for certainty of funding from the consolidated revenue fund. That is our very clear position. Anything short of this exposes a lack of commitment and a desire to downgrade the importance of the environment portfolio. I don't think any other conclusion can be reached. Throughout the election campaign the coalition boasted about its $1 billion environment package-it had a certain ring to itand how it actually doubles Labor's commitments. Senator Kemp, who was the shadow minister at the time, was particularly erroneous in his claims. For instance, on 1 February 1996 on Melbourne radio he said: Our commitment over five years is at least twice the commitment that Labor made. In the same interview he said: What we are saying is that there are, on top the projects that are currently being funded in the environment, on top of those we've announced major new initiatives and those particular ones, those five major ones, are going to be funded through the Natural Heritage Trust, which in turn will be funded from the privatisation of Te1stra. Note, interestingly, that he didn't say 'part privatisation' at that point. Maybe he let something slip. This was then, and is now, an absolute con of the Australian community. The accurate picture of the two parties' environment commitments firstly must incorporate Labor's forward estimates and it must also compare the expenditure over the same period of time, something Senator Kemp was conveniently not doing. The following figures convincingly debunk the coalition's claims that their environment commitment was twice the commitment Labor made. It was something that appealed to the conservation movement. The Labor Party's total commitment to environment and land management programs over the four years 1996-97 to 1999-2000 was indeed $1,588 million. That is what we committed. That funding amount represents Labor's forward estimates of some $609 million plus Labor's land management forward estimates of $509 million plus Labor's land package announced before the election of $470 million. Over the four years this translates into some $397 million per year towards environment and land management programs-responsible promises. The coalition is committed to $1,970 million over four years. That comprises Labor's budgeted environment expenditureafter all, they said they would maintain that of $1,118 million plus the $852 million worth of promises they made during the election campaign. If you work this out, over the four years that translates into some $493 million per year on environment and land management programs. The annual difference, therefore, between the coalition's environment commitment and Labor's environment commitment is $96 million. That is what you ask to sell Telstra for-$8 billion to buy $96 million extra per year. That is a very generous interpretation indeed, because it assumes that the current of all government will actually leave the existing programs and expenditure in place. In my view, the difference will disappear altogether after the budget when the coalition cuts many core environment programs, such as the Environment Protection Agency, and slashes departmental running costs. On the landcare side, we have already seen some cuts which are having effects in regional Australia. I am sure members will be aware of the fact, for instance, that Landcare Tasmania have already been told that they are about to lose 25 per cent of their funding from the Commonwealth government. This would mean the loss of three full-time regional landcare officers, a vegetation adviser, an education officer, a river engineer and parts of the whole farm planning program. You cannot lose 25 per cent of your funds without that sort of effect. In my view, by the time we get to the budget a lot of these funds will already be gone and that $96 million difference will have disappeared. In other words, the increase is a mirage. It will never eventuate in any case because Telstra won't be sold. So we have a promise here that can never be met. Despite their election commitment to match Labor's budgeted funding for the environment on top of the Natural Heritage Trust, Senator Hill-and he has been questioned on thishas actually refused to rule out massive cuts to current environment program expenditure. Indeed, even given their promises we expect to go backwards in the first financial year. That is your promise. When asked in the Senate, Senator Hill basically avoided the question. Is he saying that the expenditure in the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia is sacrosanct-that one little bit-but other environmental programs can be damned? What he is saying is that the only way to guarantee any expenditure on the environment is to sell Telstra, and existing programs will be undermined. The other important difference between Labor and the coalition government is that Labor's expenditure was secure. It was not contingent on the sale of Teistra. Those figures I have just outlined and the certainty of cuts to the environment in the budget clearly debunk the coalition's claims that this is 'the biggest and best environment package in Australia's history'. Senator-elect Bob Brown described it very correctly as 'a modest package'. Indeed, it is a modest package dressed up in trust fund clothes. We simply should not fall for that trick. In reality, it is a funding mirage-it will never eventuate because Telstra will never be sold. The Australian people simply do not want it to be sold and they do not accept that link. The government is also fond of claiming that green groups support the Telstra-environment link. We have had that said here by many ministers. They continually cite the Surfriders Association as a conservation group which supports them. The Surfriders Association may be called a conservation group, but it normally would not attract that description. I do know they have an interest in water quality. The truth is that the list of groups opposing the link is long, and their opposition is very strong, and growing. Take the Friends of the Earth, which put out a media statement on 18 June 1996 when they saw this bill. I will quote from the statement, headed 'Teistra blackmail fails again', at some length because it summarises the community's opposition to the government's plan very succinctly: The release of the Federal Government's National Heritage Trust Bill without funding is another cheap attempt to blackmail the opposition parties into supporting the partial sale of Telstra. Got it in one! They go on to say: This is a shameful and transparent attempt to force people into accepting the government's proposition that to oppose the sale is to oppose funding environment. An extraordinary proposition when you think about itThere are funding options, including diversion of a portion of the Telstra dividend into the Trust Fund. The government is holding the environment to ransom in the hopes of achieving its privatisation agenda. That argument, I think, can be supported. They continue: Friends of the Earth, a national environment organisation, has consistently opposed the cynical deal that would link funding of the Trust Fund with privatisation of a publicly owned asset. Like the majority of the Australian public, we believe that funding for the environment should come from core funding sources. We strongly reject Senator Hill's statement that to oppose the sale means a 'lack of understanding of the environment crisis facing Australia'. We are all in agreement about the depth of the crisis-we disagree on the 'remedy' - we need long term commitment, no short-term deals. It is clear from this that the government's Telstra-environment ruse has been exposed. The green groups are not convinced and the opposition will not be blackmailed into passing this bill, anymore than we will be into agreeing to part-privatisation of Telstra. As I have outlined, the opposition has a number of major concerns with this bill. First, its objective is not to ensure the Australian environment is protected and conserved-that is its last objective. Its objective is to ensure that the Telstra bill is passed by the Senate. It is such a transparent ruse that I do not believe anyone will fall for it. The opposition will certainly not succumb to this blackmail and we, therefore, are going to be moving amendments to remove any reference to Telstra from this bilI. Secondly, the opposition questions the bilI's reference to capital programs, as I have already outlined. The initiatives to be funded by the partial sale of Telstra are simply not capital programs. Reference to these initiatives as capital projects has the potential to set a very unhealthy precedent. The coalition has blurred the capital definitions in the hope of disguising the fact that they are breaking a significant election promise made in their privatisation policy. The opposition will move amendments to remove from the bill any for the mention that these initiatives are capital projects, simply because they are not. Thirdly, as I indicated, the opposition is concerned about the proposed management of the fund. The Natural Heritage Board is not really a 'board' at all; in fact, it is more like a junta. As it stands, this b.ill wou-d hand over the environmental polIcy reins to two ministers and forever eliminate any opportunity for parliamentary scrutiny of their activities. That is the extraordinary outcome. That is unprecedented, undemocratic and just plain wrong. We see the need for the board to .be expanded and to allow grea-er - ommumty input. After all, the community IS aske? to take on many of the projects that are outl1Oed in the bill. Fourthly, the trust's establishment removes environment funding, as I have said, from parliamentary and bud-et processes. - his, in my view, should be resisted by the parlIament and by all environmentally concerned - ust-al­ ians. Why should we not know w-at IS .go1Og on with these very important projects 10 the same way as we do with others? The opposition calls on the minister to ensure that the trust's expenditure is part of the normal budgeting processes, including Senate estimates. I understand that further funds might be put under the control of the trust. We could have the position where eventually all environment and land management programs are outside parliamentary scrutiny. In my view, the trust must be accountable to parliament. It is irresponsible of the government to have drafted a bill which diminishes the role of parliament in this way. To ensure that the parliament maintains some influence over environmental matters, the opposition will amend the bill at least to include a sunset clause. I think this bill has been thrown together by the government for the sole purpose of forcing the parliament's hand on the Telstra sale. The opposition finds this objectionable. Therefore, I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""the House is of the opinion that the Bill should be withdrawn and redrafted to provide, in the interest of certainty, for $1 billion from the Consolidated Revenue Fund to be credited upon enactment to the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Reserve"". With that amendment, the bill might be marginally respectable; without it, it is simply a ransom note-and that is blackmail. Mr Langmore-I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.",15
13,Ms WORTH,NATURAL HERITAGE TRUST OF,"The shadow minister for the environment has, as usual, had many words to say on this subject but few words have made much sense at all. She has claimed that the Australian people do not want us to sell Telstra and do not want the trust fund set up. She seems to have failed to realise that the Australian people voted for us in overwhelming numbers and we have unprecedented numbers of coalition members represented in the parliament. She has made claims that the environment should be funded from general revenue but never. says where this money should come from. Is It her theory that what we leave to our children is not only more debt but also an exploited environment? The coalition's environment package, as outlined before the election and as encapsulated in this bill, outlines a number of major initiatives which will result in significant financial resources being provided to the states, territories and local communities to tackle key environmental problems. Through the proposed Natural Heritage T-s.t of Australia Reserve a maximum of $1 billIon of the proceeds from the part sale of Telstra wi-l be made available for environmental projects throughout the country. In particular,. the government's environmental pack-g.e proVides a number of significant opportumtIes for t-e South Australian government to further Its environmental and conservation programs. It is this potential benefit to the people of South Australia which I wish to address today. The national vegetation initiative is a major revegetation initiative designed to tackle the problems of land and water degradation in Australia. The initiative represents $318 million over a five-year period. In states like South Australia with high levels of desertification this initiative is of particular importance. It is currently estimated that over 50 per cent of Australia's land is now in need of some form of repair. It is also estimated that current community demand for funding to save the bush is five times the level of existing resources. The government's program has a target for revegetation of 250,000 hectares nationally. South Australia already leads the way nationally in controlling broadacre clearance, but there remains much to be done in the way of revegetation. The long-term objective of achieving a rate of revegetation re-establishment exceeding the rate of clearance is strongly supported and South Australia is rapidly approaching this target. Funding through this program will assist groups such as the South Australian Department of the Environment and Natural Resources, the Department of Primary Industries, Landcare--of which one in three farmers are members-Greening Australia and Trees for Life to cooperatively achieve this goal. Commonwealth funding will greatly assist in bolstering existing revegetation programs and the establishment of further revegetation programs in our agricultural regions. The need for direct seeding programs in the mid-north of the state, on Eyre and Yorke Peninsulas and in the Flinders Ranges, could be targets of such funding. The national land and water resources audit, as referred to in this bill, will certainly vide a better understanding of the extent of land and water degradation in South Australia and the gathering of information will greatly assist future strategies and rescue plans. The audit will specifically provide the South Australian government with further detailed information necessary to address the complex issues facing it in the remediation of the Murray-Darling Basin and in the sustainable management of the state's fragile agricultural and rangeland regions. The Murray-Darling 2001 initiative commits half the $300 million in funding for this project. In addition, $13 million have been earmarked for associated environmental programs. This total of $163 million over five years gives very strong support for the project initially proposed by Premier Dean Brown. The project will deliver major benefits in terms of water quality and quantity provided to South Australia from the Murray-Darling river system. As the driest state on the driest continent on earth and as a state which relies on the River Murray for both significant agricultural production and the most of the drinking water for many of its large urban areas, including Adelaide, this project is absolutely essential. In addition to the $150 million provided in the trust for the Murray-Darling 2001 project $13 million, as I have already stated, will be provided to support specific initiatives. These include the expeditious return of water to the environment and the regeneration of native fish populations, including the appropriate management of European carp. The many people from all over the state, including constituents in my own electorate, who enjoy sporting and recreational activities on the Murray will, I'm sure, welcome this initiative. Most South Australians at some stage in their lives have enjoyed the many attractive features of the River Murray and it is time that a serious commitment was made to preserve it for the future. An estimated 15 billion trees have been removed from this area since European settlement. The Murray-Darling Basin also experiences drought level flows three out of proevery four years compared to one year in 20 under natural circumstances. This specific response to the crisis facing the Murray-Darling alone is argument enough for successfully passing this bill. It will be interesting to hear from members on the other side of the House whose electorates cover this region on how this crisis will be better dealt with and how they justify their current opposition to this initiative. I am sure their constituents will also be most keen to hear of their involvement in this debate. South Australia has already made a strong commitment to the Murray-Darling 2001 project through the establishment of a levy on major users of River Murray water. This levy will raise funds from South Australian water users and the local community to fund the board's local programs directly associated with the national project. However, it is clear that without significant Commonwealth financial assistance the states will not be able to achieve the massive turnaround in water quality, salinity and land degradation required to save the Murray. The condition of the coastal and marine environments is linked closely to the condition of catchments and streams discharged into them and this crisis in the marine environment is of great concern to many Australians. Eighty-five per cent of Australia's population live on Australia's coastline. The coasts and clean seas initiative, with a commitment of $100 million over four years, will however greatly assist in tackling the difficult environmental problems facing South Australia's coasts and oceans. Ocean outfalls such as the discharge of secondary treated sewage effluent from Adelaide's treatment works and its subsequent impact on seagrasses may well be addressed. The South Australian Environmental Protection Authority is keen to address this issue but can only do so with Commonwealth assistance. The South Australian government has committed significant funds already towards the environmental upgrading of Adelaide's four major treatment plants which discharge into the ocean. However, there is an urgent need for scientific investigation of the biological and physical processes causing the seagrass to decline. Again, the emphasis on the gathering of information to gauge as accurately as possible the extent of damage is vital. The cost would be in the order of $2 million to $3 million. The upgrading of treatment works will be addressed through this program. The innovative reuse of water could also be addressed. Resourcing nature conservation in South Australia is also a major challenge. The Department of the Environment and Natural Resources in South Australia is responsible for over 20 million hectares of land under the jurisdiction of the National Parks and Wildlife Act. Given the relatively small tax base in South Australia, the management of such a vast area is a financially balanced exercise. I would like to draw the House's attention to the provision of an additional $16 million from the trust over four years, specifically for the endangered species program. This funding will be used for the long-term and continuous listing of endangered species and ecological commumtIes, the implementation of rescue strategies and the encouragement of local communities to become involved in the preservation of endangered species and their immediate environment. The national reserve system initiative is funded to the tune of $80 million over four years and will greatly assist the state government in managing areas of high conservation status, including those in joint Commonwealth, state and community management, such as the bookmark biosphere project. This is a very timely initiative. The state government is soon to release its blueprint for park management and conservation in South Australia. The initiative provides the framework for conserving South Australia's unique natural heritage, including wilderness, wild rivers, wetlands, salt marshes and grasslands. It will also complement other measures to ensure that biological diversity management is in place outside the reserve system, such as on farms, along roads and streams and in urban and coastal areas. Commonwealth assistance is also required in developing priority infrastructure such as roads, fencing, camp grounds, shelters and signage to both maintain the conservation value and to promote eco-tourism opportunities in key parks in South Australia. In particular, Cleland Conservation Park, Flinders Chase National Park, Flinders Ranges National Park and Coorong National Park all require extensive infrastructure assistance. Again, many South Australians, other Australians and overseas tourists have enjoyed what these natural refuges offer. It is now up to us in this parliament to ensure that this enjoyment is made possible for future generations. Feral animal control in the state's northern parks is also essential, given the opportunity presented with the unscheduled release of RCD and its widespread effect upon the rabbit population. For the first time the National Parks and Wildlife Service has the opportunity to realise a pest-free Flinders Ranges National Park. A $16 million national feral animal control strategy will be implemented to reduce damage to the environment and agriCUlture from feral animals. Feral predators will also need to be controlled as their feeding habits adjust to the decline of the traditional diet of rabbits and towards feeding upon vulnerable native species such as yellow-footed rock-wallabies. Adequate funding is required for urgent rabbit, fox, cat and goat eradication programs. In all senses the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill is an impressive piece of legislation. It spans two portfolios-the environment and also primary industries and energy-and will be managed by the Natural Heritage Board, comprising the two relevant ministers. Senator Hill, the Minister for the Environment, said on 18 June: One of the greatest challenges we face as Australpared ians is to preserve our nation's natural environmental capital for the benefit of our children grandchildren. This bill certainly addresses this challenge. Importantly, $300 million will remain in perpetuity in the trust, something that the shadow minister failed to recognise in her speech here today. This amount will be indexed. In the words of the explanatory memorandum accompanying this bill, 'interest earned from the reserve will be returned to the reserve and devoted to a range of environmental and natural resource management projects, and to support the further development of sustainable agriculture.' This provides for a long-term and sustainable guarantee for our environmental future, a funding arrangement which seems to have been lost on the leadership of the opposition parties. I cannot understand why, for example, the Friends of the Earth can come out with comments like 'we need long-term commitment, not short-term political deals' in reference to this bill and the government's approach to the environmental issues. They need only grasp its magnitude. Compared to Labor's 'Our land' environment policy taken to the last election, this bill is unprecedented both in funding size and in its ability to establish obtainable long-term goals. Let me remind the House of the stark differences between the coalition's and Labor's environmental policies in the lead-up to the 2 March election. The comparison highlights the gulf that is emerging between the two major parties on the issue of environmental repair and preservation, coupled with their insincere opposition to the funding of this bill via the partial sale of Telstra. It shows them up as being totally uncommitted to Australia's critical need to address the problems in our natural environment. On rivers and waterways the coalition promised $485 million compared to Labor's $21 million. The coalition promised $163 million on the Murray-Darling compared to Labor's $98 million. The coalition promised $100 million on coastal and clean seas compared to their $53 million. The coalition promised $234 million on revegetation comto their $29 million. We also promised $64 million to stop unsustainable land clearand ing compared to their zero. We promised $270 million on landcare compared to their $188 million. The coalition promised $35 million on feral animal and weed control compared to their $13 million. Finally, the coalition promised $16 million on air pollution measures compared to their zero. We on this side of the House are prepared to deliver on these commitments and have been honest and up-front on how these initiatives can be funded with propriety and how they can be sustained at real levels. One can only wonder where Labor's funding on their 'Our land' environment policy would have come from in the light of the Beazley $8 billion black hole. Given the enormity of the fiscal mess left by Labor, the linking of the partial sale of Telstra with this biIl remains the only feasible alternative to guarantee funding for environmental rescue and protection strategies. The presence and content of this biII in this House and the near-sighted opposition it faces from the opposition parties, particularly those who sit in the other chamber, reveals these dissenting voices as environmental vandals. The Minister for the Environment has made these comments: The opposition parties' refusal to pass the sale of one-third of Telstra to provide the funding base for the Natural Heritage Trust exposes their lack of understanding of the environmental crisis facing Australia . . . It is also a betrayal of the minor parties' natural constituencies who are crying out for action, not just more words, on environmental repair. Australia's environment faces crisis, but before the House today we have the beginnings of an answer. Obstructionists and those who oppose this package will be held accountable by future generations of Australia if this bill proves unpassable or unworkable. We all have a rare chance to ensure the future of our natural environment and cynical, petty politics should be cast aside in favour of a clear perception of what this bill could achieve for Australia. I do refer to the Labor Party's opposition to this bill as cynical, not just in relation to the past deeds of members on the other side of the chamber. The now well documented intentions of the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating, to sell all of Telstra and the Labor Party's record of broken promises when it comes to privatisation are suitably complemented by the hypocrisy of the New South Wales Labor government. Labor in New South Wales currently has plans to establish a $30 million heritage fund by selling the state office block and other Landcom assets. This is exactly the same principle as applies to the financing of the proposals outlined in this bill, yet members on the opposite side of the House expect that their protestations to this bill should be accepted as genuine and sincere. They play a dangerous game of hijacking the preservation of our environment in a desperate attempt to gain political mileage in opposition. My Liberal Party colleague Senator Rod Kemp, who in particular shares my own interests with the ongoing financing of the Murray-Darling 2001 project, has stated that it is time for real action on the environment to match real concern, and I agree with him. I would ask the House to consider the comments made by the National Farmers Federation. The National Farmers Federation considers that the environment-Telstra link makes sound business sense, with the sale of one asset being used to invest in another national asset-our natural resources. NFF believes the government's proposal is fiscally responsible because much needed expenditure on the environment will be funded without a reduction in their services, increased government borrowing or increasing the government deficit. Dr John Cole, Chief Executive Officer of the Environment Management Industry Association of Australia, unequivocally states: Money, not good intentions and high sounding rhetoric, is what is required to protect and improve our environmental resource ... we have the scientific and technological answers, but environmental solutions cost money and the Natural Heritage Trust will provide significant amounts of money for environmental investment. Michael Krockenberger of the Australian Conservation Foundation said this earlier this month: One billion dollars is certainly a very substantial package and it's going to make inroads into helping solve environmental problems. I have outlined the many benefits to the people of Australia and South Australia that can be delivered and sustained by the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill 1996. Once this bill has passed this chamber and is debated in the other place, it will be up to the opposition parties to decide its fate. (Time expired) Debate (on motion by Mr Langmore) adjourned. NA NA 1996 Consideration of Senate Message Message received from the Senate returning the bill and acquainting the House that the Senate has disagreed to the amendments made by the House. Ordered that the message be taken into consideration forthwith. Amendments to which the Senate has disagreedNo. I-Schedule 1, item 28, page 18 (lines 3 to 6), omit the item. No.2-Schedule 1, item 31, page 18 (lines 11 to 15), omit the item. Senate's reason for disagreeing to the amendments of the House of RepresentativesThe tax concession for development of urban roads is an inappropriate use of the it promotes double benefits for developers of road projects.",21
14,Mr COSTELLO,AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL,"I move: That the House insists on its amendments disagreed to by the Senate. Let me make the government's position entirely clear: we will not be agreeing to any amendment to the Development Allowance Authority Amendment Bill 1996 to take away the applicability of infrastructure borrowings for urban roads. Let me say that the reason stated by the Senate for insisting on its amendments is disingenuous in the extreme. It says that the tax concession for the development of urban roads is an inappropriate use of the tax system as it promotes double benefits for developers of road projects. If the real concern were double benefits under the tax system, you would wipe out all infrastructure borrowings, you would not just wipe it out in relation to roads. That principle would apply to other infrastructure which is covered by infrastructure borrowings. That would be a respectable position, but it is not a position which would allow you to segment urban roads only. I remind the House that infrastructure borrowings were introduced as a consequence of the One Nation statement in 1992. It was said that they would be special tax preferred bonds to encourage private companies to build roads-that was first-ports, and electricity generating plants. If they are an inappropriate use of tax in relation to roads, they are also inappropriate in the case of ports, electricity generating plants and all other infrastructure covered. In fact, that is not the reason for the Senate's disagreement. As we know, the reason for the Senate's disagreement is to try to stop the eastern distributor. This bill was actually a bill produced by the Labor Party, introduced into the parliament in September 1995. When we were in opposition we pledged to support it; in government we have brought it back. The effect of the stand taken by the Democrats in the Senate, which the opposition has been apparently prepared to go along with, is that the opposition will defeat its own legislation-legislation it introtax system as duced itself in September. The consequence of this bill not going through is that around 40 projects worth $2.5 billion to the Australian economy will be threatened-in the mining industry, the tourism industry, in the gas, manufacturing, transport and storage industries. That will be one effect. The other consequence of this bill not going through is that infrastructure borrowings will continue to apply to urban roads. They were never closed off, and no legislation will go through to close them off. So the consequence of this will be that the Senate will defeat projects under the development allowance and allow projects to go ahead under infrastructure borrowingsachieving neither of its objectives. When this development allowance bill was introduced by the Labor Party-and we put it back into this parliament in the same form that the Labor Party produced it; we pledged in opposition to support it-it applied only to the development allowance, the accelerated allowance in relation to capital projects. The Democrats in the Senate tacked onto it a proposal that had altogether different subject matter-namely, infrastructure borrowingsand said that they would only allow the development allowance reconfiguration proposal if infrastructure borrowings for urban roads were prevented. That is not our policy. We believe that if infrastructure borrowings have a place, they have a place in relation to all of those projects. We will not accept as a condition the banning of infrastructure borrowings. As a result of the Democrats taking that stand and pulling the opposition along with them in their wake, you will get two failures: infrastructure borrowings will go ahead and the development allowance will stop. I received correspondence this morning from the Business Council of Australia protesting about this. Let us make entirely clear the consequences of this: unless the Senate reconsiders its position-and I believe it may not even come on for reconsideration-this will not go through. (Time expired)",26
15,Mr LATHAM,AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL,"Werriwa) (1.03 p.m.}-The Treasurer (Mr Costello) is barking up the wrong tree, because he has conveniently wiped from his memory the events of Monday. It was the Treasurer who was foolhardy enough in this place on Monday to announce policy concerning the Development Allowance Authority and urban toll ways while at exactly the same time the Senate was considering the initial legislation. So the Treasurer knows full well that if he had waited just 24 hours, if he had waited just one day, this provision would have passed through both houses unamended. This is the same sense of timing by the Treasurer that wrecked the first Premiers Conference of the Howard-Fischer government. He is at it again. This error prone, clumsy, ramshackle government is at it again, showing abuse of parliamentary process, showing nothing but contempt for the House of Representatives and the Senate. The idea of the Treasurer standing up in question time on Monday to announce a change of policy concerning the Development Allowance Authority while at the same timeMr Costello-No, it was always our policy.",26
16,Mr LA THAM,AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL,"A change of federal policy, Treasurer. Mr Costello-It was a change to your policy.",27
17,Mr LATHAM,AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL,"The Labor party on this matter is in the very happy position that everyone else is rushing to legislate our policy. You rushed to bring in the development allowance amendments that we put before the parliament in September of last year. Then the Democrats rushed to introduce the changes to urban tollway tax concessions, which the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) and the member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton) announced in December last year. Everyone else is rushing to introduce our policy-the Liberal Party on the development allowance amendments and the Democrats on urban tollways. So what is the Labor Party supposed to do? We congratulate the Liberal Party for introducing and supporting our policy on the development allowance changes. We support and congratulate the Democrats for introducing and supporting our policy on urban toll ways. We are in the very happy positIOn where everyone else is rushing to introduce our policies, so of course we support both aspects of this legislation. The Treasurer knows these things full well. His only excuse on this matter, his only defence on this matter, is the Downer defence, which is basically to say, 'Because I'm foolish, I'm innocent. Because I was foolish enough to make this announcement in question time on Monday, I am innocent now of any responsibility for holding up the development projects.' He has been fingered as foolhardy after mistiming his announcement on Monday. What sort of tactics meeting was it in the Treasurer's office on Monday morning as they said, 'We always have to say something in question time; we always need to take a dorothy dixer in question time. Let's take one on tax concessions for urban tollways.' Did anyone pull him up and say, 'But, Treasurer, there is legislation before the Senate which concerns the Development Allowance Authority?' Did anyone pull him up and say, 'Treasurer, that announcement on Monday would be foolhardy. It would be a gross piece of mistiming. It would be the same error of judgment which wrecked the Premiers Conference?' The man who wrecked the Premiers Conference is now wrecking the prospect of those development projects going through. I repeat: his only defence is the Downer defencebecause I am foolish I am innocent; because I was foolish enough to make that announcement on Monday to provoke the Democrats into moving their amendment on the government's legislation in the Senate, I now wipe my hands of the damage I have caused to the Australian economy.' The Labor Party is in the business of supporting sound policy. We believe that these changes to the development allowance represent sound policy. We are supporting them. We have supported them in the Senate and we are supporting them in the House. We believe the abolition of tax concessions for urban tollways represents sound policy. We are supporting that sound policy, as we announced in December last year, in the House and the Senate. Yesterday the Treasurer was again foolhardy enough to say to the House that the Labor Party is not doing the right thing on fiscal consolidation. On these tax concessions, we are here to help. We are from the opposition and we are here to help, because we are saving you $75 million on your budget bottom line through the abolition of these tollway tax concessions. We are saving you $75 million by moving to abolishMr Costello-So you are doing it deliberately, are you?",27
18,Mr LATHAM,AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL,"We are here to help. We are from the opposition, and we are here to help your bottom line on the budget. That reflects something that is very important. We are the party of good policy. Mr Costello-You are deliberately knocking off the projects.",28
19,Mr LATHAM,AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL,"We want the roads to go ahead, as EPAC has recommended. As your own National Commission of Audit recommended last Friday, the projects can go ahead in a different form. (Time expired)",28
20,Mr FAHEY,AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL,"The member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) can rant and rave all he likes in this House. It is very clear that he wants to deal with infrastructure borrowings to save his mate in New South Wales from having to face the prospect of another tollway. He is not the slightest bit interested in any of the fiscal consolidation arguments that he might argue about. He is not the slightest bit interested in anything other than not allowing the Premier of New South Wales, who has some 24 per cent acceptance by the business community I note this morning from the BRW report, to face a tollway. He is not the slightest bit concerned about the jobs he is destroying in terms of the development allowance and he is siding with the Democrats, as is the entire Labor Party, to simply destroy the prospects through the development allowance of the 40 projects worth $2Y2 billion over the next six years. They will create jobs. The amendments that have come from the Senate have absolutely nothing to do with the development allowance. Labor relies in this debate on the EPAC report. They conveniently forget in their selective quoting of the EPAC report that even that report-whether you agree with it in its entirety or not-said not to do anything until 1997-98. That is when the report said it should be done. That EPAC report also said that in 1969-70 the actual investment in infrastructure represented nine per cent of GDP. By 1993-94, public investment generally in infrastructure had gone down to 4- per cent of GDP. It pointed out the capacity of governments, the capacity of the public sector, to get involved, to find the revenue in infrastructure was very limited in view of the fiscal constraints that are around. We know all about fiscal constraint because we have got that $8 billion black hole. The Labor Party is saying, 'We don't want any new roads in any city. We certainly do not want the eastern distributor. We do not want Sydney to have some sort of traffic flow by the year 2000 when the Olympics are there.' The Labor Party wants to present that city to the world in a way which is going to send home with all those visitors a memory that you cannot move through Sydney, otherwise the one slim chance of the Premier of New South Wales holding one Labor government together at the next election before the year 2000 will disappear immediately. The Labor Party in New South Wales lied to the people of New South Wales about removing toll ways. They had no intentions ever of doing it. They knew they would lose their AAA rating the moment they attempted to do so and they have tried to hide behind it ever since. These silly, spiteful and irresponsible amendments are going to destroy jobs and they are going to prevent infrastructure in that the city of Sydney and elsewhere in our big cities around Australia in the next few years. It is all designed for base political purposes. What will happen is that the bill presented by Labor and supported by this government for development allowances will not proceed, 40 projects will not get the benefit of the jobs that come from that, and we will find that the infrastructure in terms of tollways or otherwise in urban roads will not continue. As the Treasurer (Mr Costello) said, nothing is achieved by this mixture of logic that seems to be based on the fact that an announcement on a totally unrelated issue was made by the Treasurer this week and that if he had held off for a day or two all of this could have gone through and we could have all gone home. But no, because he chose to announce it at a particular time, they jump in and take advantage to save their mates in New South Wales. They do not save their mates through the amendments before this chamber. Urban roads will be allowed to proceed on the basis of infrastructure borrowings. There is no legislation to prevent that and, in the meantime, a very sensible bill, presented initially by the Labor Party and supported by the government to allow for the development allowances, will not proceed. As a result of its not proceeding, we put at risk $2Y2 billion worth of projects around Australia-mainly in New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia-in the tourism area, in the mining industry, in the manufacturing area. All of that stops; all of that goes. Is it any wonder that the business community of Australia have no respect for Labor? Their inconsistency and their lack of credibility are demonstrated so well in this debate and it is all for base political purposes. Beddall, D. P. It achieves absolutely nothing. It simply means that Labor has no policies, no consistency in all that it does and it is here to obstruct. It allows the tail to wag the dog in the Senate and it goes along with it in this House.

NA BILL (No.1) 1996 Consideration of Senate Message Bill returned from the Senate with a request for amendments. Ordered that the requested amendments be taken into consideration forthwith. Senate's requested amendments(1) Schedule 1, item 5, page 3 (lines 15 to 17), omit the item. (2) Schedule 1, items 6 and 7, page 3 (lines 18 to 23), omit the items, substitute: 6 Item 57 of Schedule 4 Omit ""which are ineligible for a Tariff sion Order"". 7 Item 60 of Schedule 4 Omit ""which are ineligible for a Tariff sion Order"".  Small Business and Consumer Affairs) (1.32 p.m.)-I move: That the requested amendments be made. The government agrees to the requested amendments moved in the other place. The requests relate to items 55, 57 and 60 in schedule 4 of the Customs Tariff Act. The amendments propose to remove the three per cent duty rate increase on these three policy by-law items and restore the free rate of duty to these items. While it is conceded that the request does not implement the complete rate increase proposed by the government for the policy by-law items, in order for this substantive bill to be passed the government is prepared to accept the requested amendments.",28
21,Mr CREAN,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"We welcome the government's indication that they will accede to these new amendments to the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill. These amendments build on the amendments which they accepted yesterday and now fully reflect the amendments we proposed in this House last Tuesday week to this legislation. Last week, they sought to introduce changes to the tariff concession orders that, amongst other things, would have seen the introduction of a new consumer tax on imports. Despite election pledges that there would be no new taxes, and against our opposition, they put through this parliament last week the introduction of a new consumer tax. That move was rejected by the Senate, which supported our amendment. We dealt with that matter yesterday. In speaking to this matter yesterday, I indicated that there was still an issue that we felt needed further amendment. That was to ensure that the policy by-laws mechanism, the mechanism whereby business could still access a zero tariff rating, effectively would be expanded. It was proposed in the government's bill to introduce not just the three per cent tax on consumers but a new three per cent policy by-law rate. Under Conces- Labor, the policy by-law rate effectively enabled a zero rating. So we had not only the introduction of the consumer tax by stealth Conces- but also the closing off of an avenue to business to get some relief, some zero tariff rating. Yesterday, we argued that the policy by-law rate should still stand at zero. The message that came back from the Senate yesterday was that the policy by-law zero rating applied to a number of categories but not all. Essentially, it applied simply to major projects. It did not apply to sections of the manufacturing industry that the Minister for Small Business  just alluded to and to participants in the manufacturing industry in both small to medium sized enterprises. So we moved in the Senate that the policy by-law zero rating be extended to cover those manufacturing groups. I am pleased to say that the groups that are now picked up are machine tools for working advanced materials, raw materials and intermediate goods where the imported goods are given a performance advantage over the substitutable goods produced here and metal materials and goods in food packaging. The effect of these amendments, as I said at the outset, is to implement the full extent of the opposition's second reading amendment to this bill last Tuesday. It is unfortunate that it has taken us until the last hours of this session of parliament to get this bill through since we gave the government the opportunity to amend it as far back as last Tuesday week. The significance of this amendment is that it is not only a win for the opposition and a win for consumers and a further advantage to business but also a very significant and comprehensive win for the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) over his Treasurer (Mr Costello). One might recall that it was the minister who argued that the rates on business should be dropped. He succeeded in that. But what the Treasurer sought as the quid pro quo was the extension to consumers and the lifting of the policy by-law rate. These amendments effectively wipe out the quid pro quo. So the Peter Costello quid pro quo has been eliminated by this step. It is a good piece of policy, we welcome the government's commitment to adopt it; consumers will be better off, and there are improved benefits for industry arising from it. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA BILL (No.1) 1996 Message Message received from the Senate returning the bill and acquainting the House that the Senate has agreed to the bill as amended by the House at the request of the Senate. NA AUSTRALIA BILL 1996 Second Reading Debate resumed.",31
22,Mr LANGMORE,NATURAL HERITAGE TRUST OF,"I am glad of the chance to speak on the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill 1996 and to support the amendment, because this is a particularly badly framed piece of public policy. In fact, I cannot remember a piece of public policy which was so misjudged. The member for Adelaide (Ms Worth), who was speaking just before the debate was interrupted, simply reiterated the blackmail which is part of the bill. She went on with a long description of the environmental benefits which this bill is claimed to facilitate, but that is really not a rationale for the bill at This is a bill about hypothecating funds from the sale of an asset for recurrent outlays. It is quite an economically irresponsible bill, just as it is a serious misjudgment about the way in which responsible environmental policy should be funded. The member for Adelaide did not debate at all the basis for this legislation. It was really quite an inadequate defence of the legislation. That is a pity because, quite clearly, she herself has a serious commitment to the environment. It is regrettable that she has fallen into the trap of supporting what is a misjudged hypothecation rather than supporting proper, appropriate and responsible funding for high priority environmental projects. To have just reiterated, as she did, the pork barrelling that the now government went on with the during the election campaign is not policy. That is simply saying how they were willing to buy votes. I thought it was a disappointing speech. This bill is a lightweight bill. If you look through it, it looks as though it has been hastily drafted by a government which does not seriously expect it to be passed through both houses. It looks as though it does not seriously expect the bill will be implemented. For example, why is there this device for a trust with two trustees, two ministers? There is no mechanism for scrutiny of the bill by parliament, as the Labor shadow minister, the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence), mentioned. Scrutiny by parliament is a vital element of any area of public policy. Setting up a trust of this kind without explicitly providing for scrutiny undermines the responsibility of parliament to properly control public funds. That does not look as though it has been thought of. The bill has been hastily drafted, not seriously drafted as responsible public finance policy. The bill, therefore, diminishes the capacity of parliament to review expenditure. Expenditure through this trust would be about $400 million a year. Mr Bevis-It is providing a giant pork barrel.",32
23,Mr LANGMORE,NATURAL HERITAGE TRUST OF,"As well as that, it is providing a basis for a giant pork barrel, as I have already mentioned. This is not a soundly all. based public finance structure for policy any more than it is soundly based expenditure policy. Another problem with trusts is that they are very rigid. They can only act according to their specified objectives at the time that they are established. If those objectives are to be changed or widened, then the trust has to be abolished, the funds dispersed and a new trust established. That kind of rigidity is again anathema in the context of sound public finance policy. The bill has been thrown together. It is a lightweight bill; it is not fully responsible. It is done by a government which says it is an example of its own environmental credentials, but it is a government which has already demonstrated, in the first three months or so of government, that it does not have sound environmental credentials. For example, within weeks of being elected the government had moved to remove export controls on minerals-a policy which would have enabled the government to allow unfettered access for mining companies to mineral deposits and exports regardless of the environmental consequences. Yet it was just that capacity to control and approve export arrangements for minerals which allowed the Fraser government to stop sandmining on Fraser Islandsomething which has been a significant achievement in environmental security. This government has also already indicated that it is seriously considering introducing further uranium mining in Kakadu. Kakadu, of which Australians are uniformly proud, is one of the two or three best managed environmental protected areas in Australia and the government is proposing to allow more of the park to be destroyed and the integrity of the park to be broken by allowing further uranium mining, which again the majority of Australians do not want to see. We are concerned about the implications for nuclear weapons proliferation, which export of uranium would facilitate. Again, the government is acting irresponsibly towards one of our most beautiful and high quality protected areas and in a way that would allow it to be spoiled. Those opposite are talking also about removing export regulations on woodchips, something that has been an area of massive controversy and about which the previous Labor government had reached a relatively satisfactory compromise after some years of debate. That carefully and delicately arranged compromise, which was reached after prolonged negotiation and discussion with both forest industries and concerned environmentalists, the new government is planning to break. This is really irresponsible stuff. I could go on and on. The point is that this government now does not have serious environmental credentials, and this irresponsible bill is a clear demonstration of that. Let me come to why this bill is so irresponTelstra's sible. The bill is based on the sale of a third of Telstra. You meet people all over the community who recognise what a cynical exercise this is. They know that Telstra produces substantial profits every year. They know that the sale of a third of Telstra will reduce the returns to the community, not increase them. The government also know that, if the whole of Telstra were kept in public ownership, as required by good economic and sound competition policy-because that is the basis for maximising the intensity of that competition between Telstra, Optus and other telecommunications companies-it would allow them to act as the responsible owner of that vital enterprise, ensuring that its operations were run efficiently and competitively and that the revenue it generated would be used effectively within the normal approaches of consolidated revenue. But if we have the sale of a third of Telstra then we have conflict between private owners and public owners. There is much less capacity for government to control it fully and carefully and be wholly responsible for what Telstra does. The one-third would tend to dominate the two-thirds. It is neither one thing nor another. It is a recipe for conflict, for misjudged policy. Also, it is a recipe for further privatisation in the future. Who believes all this protestation about selling one-third now and that would be all? No-one seriously believes that. If a third were sold now, another third would be gone a year or two later and the rest a year or two after that. It is clearly being proposed by a government which plans to privatise the whole of Telstra. If that were to happen, then the only way the funds could be raised would be if part of them were raised overseas. If that were to happen and part of those funds were raised overseas, it would mean selling part of Telstra to foreign investors. That would mean repudiating government concern for the interests of consumers, because no privately owned telecommunications company would give anywhere near the same degree of attention to community interests that a government owned enterprise would give. It would involve giving up a lot of good work on research and development, on innovation, on expansion of export markets. Telstra has been very active in promoting sales of its expertise overseas which contributes to the growth of Australian exports of goods and services, yet partial privatisation would tend to undermine that activity. The sale of one-third of Telstra is economically irresponsible and politically inept because the majority of the community want to keep it in public ownership-and that is because the majority of the community understands that there are greater benefits for the community now and in the long term if it is kept wholly in public ownership. This is an unprecedented piece of blackmail. It contributes to the erosion of confidence in government. Another central point that I want to come to is that the sale of one-third of Telstra necessary. The government is arguing that it ought to sell a third of Telstra in order to raise the funds to protect the environment. But that involves selling a capital asset in order to provide funds for recurrent outlays. That is not only economically irresponsible but also unnecessary because the funds are much more appropriately raised through consolidated revenue, through the revenue generation system. The government's argument is that there is an alleged black hole, a so-called black hole that it found when it came into government. This is simply not so. That alleged black hole is due to some changes in estimates in connection with the rate of inflation and the rate of economic growth which were made by the Treasury rather hastily and without normal care in the first week after the election. The estimates show that the Treasury officers expect the rate of inflation to fall, something which is entirely desirable. That accounts for about half the alleged claim for a reduction in revenue. They claim that the other half is due to an alleged fall in the rate of economic growth. Since those estimates were made, we have already seen the rate of economic growth in the first quarter of the year remain much higher than was built into those estimates. That means that at least part of that alleged black hole no longer exists-if it ever didbecause the base on which the revenue estimates for next year are now calculated is higher. This means that next year's revenue will certainly be higher than the estimates made by the Treasury straight after the election. As well as that, those estimates were clearly very approximate. Other skilled econometricians have made alternative estimates which suggest faster economic growth in the coming financial year-which starts on Monday, by the way-than the Treasury was forecasting straight after the election. Therefore, there will be faster growth of revenue and, therefore, slower growth of outlays because of the slower growth of unemployment benefit payments. That alleged gap is certainly significantly is not smaller than was claimed in March. We will see when the budget comes down in August what revisions have been made, but it seems highly likely that the alleged gap will be considerably smaller than was claimed. If the government want to fund improvements in environmental protection, as they certainly should-I will come to that in a minute, too-then they should do so in the proper way, through consolidated revenue without hypothecating the sale of a capital asset and allocating that to recurrent outlays. Before finishing, I will dwell on one of the areas of expenditure that is set down in this bill. Many of them are very important. As the shadow spokesperson said, every area that is outlined there is worth doing. It is not a question that they are not worth doing. They are all worth doing, but they all ought to be funded more responsibly and on a more permanent basis. The one I particularly want to mention is the national reserve system. That policy comes from the recommendation of the House environment committee, which did an inquiry into Australia's biodiversity. We found that Australia's biodiversity is seriously threatened. Already, in the 200 years or so since European settlement, there have been quite a number of extinctions of animals, birds and plants, and a whole series more are endangered and many more are vulnerable. In that context, we need to find ways of protecting biodiversity. The most obvious and important way is to have a nationally representative protected area system which ensures that every major type of ecosystem is represented within the protected area system so that their survival becomes assured. Our aim should be ecological security, in other words. We recommended a process, a scientific basis, for deciding which areas should be protected-a bioregional approach, it is called-and on that basis we proposed funding of $200 million over five years: part through the states, part through the Commonwealth; part for establishing the system and part for funding maintenance of the system. In response to our recommendation, the previous government accepted most of our ideas. In the major environmental statement in January, the then Prime Minister announced an additional $80 million, set aside for building up the national protected area system, and proposed that that would be provided in conjunction with the states, who would also be expected to provide another $80 million. The then opposition, now government, picked up that recommendation in its entirety and identically included it in its environment package, so it is part of this bill we are now debating. I am glad to see that the government picks up that recommendation because it is a centrally important one. If we do not protect our biodiversity, then it will not survive. More plants, more birds and more animals will be killed off and will become extinct. That would be a national tragedy. We do have a responsibility to future generations to protect our ecosystem and to have an expansion of the national protected area system so that it is fully representative and not very erratically and very inadequately representative as at present. That is a necessary part of that. That needs to be funded appropriately through consolidated revenue so that there is a permanent basis for the funding, so that maintenance and management can be assured in the future and so that future generations have the pleasure and the real joy of enjoying Australia's natural heritage. I conclude by emphasising that it is vital that the funding of these environmental programs be soundly based. This bill does not provide for that. It is important, therefore, reject this bill and replace it with a much more responsible public finance basis for ensuring environmental security, and to reject the sale of Telstra. Debate (on motion by Mr Reid) adjourned. NA NA AMENDMENT BILL 1996 [No.2] First Reading Bill presented by Mr Reith, and read a first time. Ordered that the second reading be made an order of the day for a later hour this day. NA NA Discharge from Notice Paper",32
24,Mr REITH,ISLANDER LEGISLATION,I move: That the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Amendment Bill 1996 [No.2] be discharged from the Notice Paper. This is a procedural motion to dispose of a bill which has come from the Senate in an amended form. The government obviously does not accept the Senate amendments and we have decided to maximise the pressure on the Senate by discharging these matters-that is what this procedural motion does-and to introduce a bill de novo. That bill has been introduced and was dealt with by the parliament last night. I have nothing further to add.,35
25,Mr MELHAM,ISLANDER LEGISLATION,"The opposition opposes this motion. It is a great pity that the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) does not fully consult in relation to these matters. It seems to me that he has a lot of learning to do. I know it is a new job for him. I know it is a steep learning curve, but the position is this: we oppose this motion since it would appear that the government is under the misapprehension that this bill from the Senate is no longer required or necessary because last night the government sent another bill off to the Senate. It was a disgraceful performance by the government last night. If the Leader of the House knew the forms of the House, he could see how the bill that to we have received from the Senate could still be a worthwhile bill and could be debated by this House. Last night the guillotine was used. Last night members of this House were denied the opportunity of speaking on the ATSIC Amendment Bill in the second reading debate. Last night there was no consideration in detail. The reason we are opposing this motion is that I implore the Leader of the House to consult with us and to utilise this bill. How can he utilise it? Eighty per cent of this bill has bipartisan support in this House. It has cross-party support in the other place. What is happening here is that the government again is showing that they are not interested in indigenous people. If they tried to do this with any other bill, there would be outrage. If they tried to do this with a bill about the business community, there would be outrage. If they tried to do this with the workplace relations bill, there would be outrage. But they think that indigenous people are a soft target, so they can do whatever they want. Last night something unprecedented happened in this House. The Leader of the House introduced a bill that the opposition had no notice of, and it was a disgrace. This interchange occurred on page 3071. I said: I was told earlier by the Leader of the House, hang around. We'll be considering it when it comes from the Senate.' Mr Reith-Exactly.",35
26,Mr MELHAM,ISLANDER LEGISLATION,"This is not what has come from the Senate. This is a fresh bill. We could have continued debating that bill last night. Today we did not start sitting until midday. We could have started sitting at 9 0' clock. Members of this House have been denied an opportunity to properly debate a very important issue. The government has not allowed the opposition time to move and debate amendments in detail. The Leader of the House thinks the bill from the Senate that he wants to discharge cannot be a worthwhile bill. I say to the Leader of the House that it can be. What we can do is extract those amendments that were imposed in the Senate that you do not agree with and those parts of the bill that we do not agree with and we can send the rest of the bill back to the Senate. Then what happens is that, whilst we are debating the bill that we sent over there last night, the non-contested part of the bill-the other unopposed sections of the bill-can pass through this chamber. Whilst we debate the real area of dispute between the government, the opposition parties and the minor parties, the 80 per cent of the bill that everyone agrees with, which will help accountability, is locked up in the dispute about the election of the chairs of regional councils and the appointment of an administrator, can pass through this chamber. But it appears that the Leader of the House is too lazy to issue instructions or does not understand. This bill is not a worthless bill. We granted exemption from the cut-off for this bill in the Senate. We were told by the government that this is an urgent bill because of the ATSIC elections in October. I can tell you that if the government passes this then the House of Representatives will not be able to facilitate those 80 per cent of amendments. We are being obstructionist. Why? Because the Leader of the House and the government are, in effect, wanting to play politics. I say here and now to the House, to those listening in the community, that the Australian Labor Party is in favour of accountability. The 'Yes, amendments that we put in in the Senate increase accountability in ATSIC. Those sections of the bill that we opposed in the Senate had nothing to do with accountability. They were a smokescreen. The government now has in its possession five audit reports that basically give ATSIC the tick. This is a beat-up. This is low-grade politics. That aside, I had discussions with the office of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs yesterday to try to work out a mechanism whereby the 80 per cent of the bill that all parties in the Senate and the House of Representatives agree with could be facilitated. Let us argue about those narrow parameters. This is a way to do it. I implore the Leader of the House that we can do it in five minutes flat within the House of Representatives and get it through the Senate by extracting sections of this bill. That still leaves him with the bill he sent to the Senate last night. This matter has nothing to do with the cutoff. We gave exemption to this bill. You don't even have to do it now, but if you let it lie on the table we can get some drafting done so that when we come back for the budget sittings on 20 August-the House will sit for three days that week-we can pass the non-controversial amendments that will impact on the October elections. I am not trying to pull a confidence trick on the Leader of the House; I am just saying to him that part of the problemMr Reith-I am not the minister for Aboriginal affairs.",36
27,Mr MELHAM,ISLANDER LEGISLATION,"No, but I have had discussions with the minister's office. Sadly, they did not get back to me because they were involved in the no-confidence motion in the Senate, and I understand that. We do not have to have the debate now. I am saying to the Leader of the House, 'Take off your jackboots and show that what your Prime Minister said to this House on 30 April is what you will abide by.' This is what the Prime Minister said in this House on 30 April in the discussion on the election of the Speaker. Page 5 of the Hansard says: It is part of our system of government that the executive is controlled by parliament and parliament controlled by the law and the customs and conventions of our society. I think it is important that steps are made on both sides of the parliament to reassert and re-establish a degree of respect and regard for the institution. Later it says: . . . this is a parliament comprised of a government and an opposition. There is a role in the national parliament for proper and full expressions of view from both sides of politics. I will, to the best of my ability, extend proper courtesies to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), to all members of the opposition and to the independent members, who are greater in number on this occasion than in any of the parliaments that I have sat in since my election in 1974. Let's take the politics out of this debate. This is too important to play politics with. This is not a useless bill that we are considering here today. Eighty per cent of this bill has the concurrence of all political parties and all members of this House. Let us utilise that concurrence. It is not as if the Leader of the House can be frightened of the numbers that we have on this side. It is not as if we are successfully going to impose amendments on the government that they do not want. We are asking for him to use the opportunity, because if he does not the existing aspects of the ATSIC Act will remain for the October 1996 elections. Is that what they want? Is this the political game? This government that talks about reconciliation and being a government for all of us wants to play politics with indigenous people and wants to use them up-front. If that is not the case, then extend the olive branch. We are happy to concede that maybe some of the problems last night were the result of your inexperience and your enthusiasm now that you have this role. It is a bit of a payback for the 13 years of frustration that members on your side have felt. But never in the 13 years of the Labor government did we introduce a bill without telling the other side, 'Here's the bill we are going to introduce. We are going to disregard the bill from the Senate.' The main reason we are opposing this is that the performance last night gives truth to the words, 'Let's judge them on their action, not their rhetoric.' It is an opinion poll driven government that likes to tell people what they want to hear. Here is an opportunity for the first time for action, not words. The Prime Minister has said in relation to the Native Title Act that he would like to get cross-party support. In relation to methods of accountability, if you can make them out, you will have opposition support. But we will not support accountability being used as a smokescreen to gut ATSIC and to gut self determination. The Leader of the House has the numbers. He has them two to one. If what I am saying is not correct, you do not have to pass it. This is not just a number-crunching exercise. This issue is too important. There were members of this House who were denied an opportunity to speak. You issued the gag. Mr Reith-Your colleagues in the Senate are demanding that we get this bill over there today.",37
28,Mr MELHAM,ISLANDER LEGISLATION,"No, we have sent the other bill over. This is the bill from the Senate. They had their chance. This is not your section 57 trigger. That is what last night was all about. You are too smart by half. You do not know the constitution. You woke up and realised you had introduced the bill in wrong place.",38
29,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ISLANDER LEGISLATION,Mr Jenkins)Order! The honourable member will address his remarks through the chair.,38
30,Mr MELHAM,ISLANDER LEGISLATION,"I repeat: this is still a worthwhile bill. The government and the opposition agree with 80 per cent of this bill. Let us take the politics out of this debate. There is not another election for a couple of years, is there? Unless you are interested in a double dissolution. This is not a double dissolution trigger. This is actually a debate that we can have in this House on the merits of it. We can send a signal that there are genuine attempts on both sides of the House for reconciliation. I would not be getting up opposing this if there were no value in us dealing with this bill. There is value. The great tragedy is that the Leader of the House-he is obviously enthusiastic in his new role-does not understand the forms and procedures of this House. That is why we are opposing this bill being discharged. If we discharge this, 80 per cent of something that we all agree to will be kicked around between the House of Representatives and the Senate for the next 18 months. I understand that the bill that we sent to the Senate last night will not even be reaching the Senate today because they are debating another bill. It is absurd that we should waste this opportunity, unless the Leader of the House has another agenda. What is his other agenda? You have to look at their actions, not their words. You now have to be mind-readers, because if it is not down in writing they are not committed to it. Even if it is down in writing or they say it, you have to be careful because you have to look at their actions. It is their actions, not their words. What can you say about a government that have an overwhelming majority and an opportunity to do something in a very sensitive area, who are saying, 'We believe in the spirit of reconciliation. We are a government for all of us'? Eighty per cent of this bill has cross-party support in both houses, and the government are not prepared to allow discussion on the bill. That says something about the not only ineptitude and incompetence but also motives. You need to judge them on their record. We oppose discharging the bill. It is still a worthwhile bill. With the drafting of amendments, which can have cross-party support, 80 per cent of an agreed bill can be sent back to the Senate and the bill can be improved in relation to accountability. I implore the Leader of the House-by action, not by rhetoric-to send a signal to this side of the House that you are sorry for what happened last night. (Time expired)",38
31,Mr CREAN,ISLANDER LEGISLATION,"I join with the member for Banks (Mr Melham) in opposing the discharge of this item from the agenda. I think it is important that the House understand what has been done here. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 1996 (No.2) that was guillotined through this parliament last night was the same bill that started in the Senate some weeks ago, which the Senate has debated, deliberated upon, amended and returned to this parliament. We are now effectively dealing with the message. To essentially move this motion that you discharge it means that you are rejecting everything that the Senate has considered in detail on this bill. Let us just understand the significance of that. We have a government that came to power saying they were going to lift the standards of parliament; they were going to make parliament more supreme than the executive; they were going to make the parliament more accountable. Yet what are the facts? They guillotine-in other words, fast-track-the bill through the lower house and ignore the detailed consideration that it has already been given in the upper house. It is utter nonsense. It makes a complete sham of all those high moral principles they talked about when saying they wanted to lift the standards in the place. There may well be all sorts of motives, but can they really stack up against the notion that you are going to make the parliament more accountable? Let us have a look at the other areas in which the standards of this parliament have not only not been lifted in the course of this new government but have been debased. The most noticeable is that we now have a foreign minister who has misled this parliament-not just once but on four occasions. He has admitted to having misled the parliament; Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has admitted to misleading the parliament. The Prime Minister came in with a code conduct and said, 'Ministers shall not mislead the parliament and, if they do it inadvertently, they should correct the record at the earliest possible opportunity.' That is the code of conduct that the Prime Minister said he wanted his ministers to operate by. Yet did not happen. Not only did we have the parliament misled four times, we did not have the record corrected until the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) came into this parliament two days ago to correct it. But coming into the parliament to correct it-from the initial misleading of the parliament-took him five sitting days. The first misleading the parliament was on 18 June; the second was on the Monday of this week; the third was on the Tuesday of this week; and the are fourth was on the Wednesday of this weekaccountable before he corrected the record. It is another example of where a government that prides itself on lifting the standards the has failed dismally. The previous decision by the Prime Minister to require the resignation of his shadow minister for the environment for inadvertently misleading the parliament has not been implemented in the case of the foreign minister. These were things that were demanded of us when we were in governthrough ment. We had a number of ministers that did resign when they inadvertently misled the present. parliament. Not only have we not got the foreign minister having resigned; we have a sitment uation in which the Prime Minister says he wants to lift the standards-not just equate them but lift them. By any standards, the fortion eign minister should have resigned. That another example of how this parliament, and what it stands for, is being abused by the current government. Another example is that in the life of this government there have been six sitting weeks of parliament-we are about to go into the recess before we come back for the budget session-where we have had the guillotine and gag imposed seven times. Understand what that means. For a parliament that you his say has to be supreme and given the opportunity for open debate for consideration of all the issues, why move the guillotine and the gag, the very purpose of which is to restrict of debate, to limit the time, to close off the opposition in what it can say and move? There may be a view on the other side of the parliament that what we get into is filibustering, but the reality is that, when you are stopping amendments even being put in the that parliament, it just makes a sham of your assertion that you want the parliament to consider all matters. An example of one of those guillotines is the Telstra debate-no insignificant issue. This is the selling of one-third of Telstra, one-third of a public asset. The opposition had a number of amendments it wanted to move and it was not given the of opportunity to move one of those amendments-not one! How can you argue that the parliament is to be supreme, that its standards to be lifted and that it is to be made more if you will not even allow amendments in the parliament to be moved? We have the other example of the gag and guillotine being moved on the social security bill-another terribly important piece of legislation. This also happened with the establishment of committees of this parliament. The government wanted to ram through a proposition which effectively said that the committees of this parliament could function a quorum, through effective representation, with not one member of the opposition How can you really assert that the parliais being given a role, is being listened to and is being made more accountable if you to want to deny the opportunity for the opposito participate? Why not be open about it? is Do not hide behind this notion that you are lifting standards in this place. Do not hide behind the notion that you are improving the running of the place. Just be open and honest and say, 'We are going to use our numbers. We are going to close debates. We are going to restrict committee considerations. We are going to cut the resources to them so they can't do too much investigative work, and we will do it all as a cabinet.' It makes a mockery of the notion that you want the parliament to be supreme and the executive answerable to it. This is the most centralised, dictatorial government that this parliament has had in 13 years. They pretend that what they are doing is opening the place up. Another piece of legislation that was gagged and guillotined was the workplace industrial relations bill. This is the bill-despite promises that no worker will be worse offthat is going to see living standards cut, women workers more disadvantaged, young workers paid less, unions attacked and award conditions eroded; yet you closed off the ability for the opposition to move amendments to that piece of legislation. We had 335 amendments to that bill. People might think that that is an extraordinary number until they hear that the government, because it botched the first bill, had 61 amendments itself. So, in total, we are looking at 400 amendments. How much time did the government allow for 400 amendments to be considered by this parliament? Two hours. If you divide that up, you are talking about something like 15 seconds an amendment. What a joke in terms of the parliament being able to consider these issues. They want to laugh about it over there. They want to make out that this is not an important piece of legislation. Mr Marek-It is important and you are holding it up.",38
32,Mr CREAN,ISLANDER LEGISLATION,"It is, and it ought to be, and you ought to be ashamed of the fact that you joined with the Leader of the House in closing down the debate on that very important piece of legislation. Another area that they closed and gagged the debate on was the export market development grants scheme. This is a grant that enables companies to actually get out and export their produce to the rest of the world. The exports would not have occurred but for these grants to those companies. The grants have a multiplier effect of something like five to 10 times. For every dollar spent, $5 to $10 extra is generated in exports. Isn't that what we are trying to do as a nation? Aren't we trying to get more exports, more growth, more investment and more jobs? Isn't that what we are about? How do you expect businesses to do it on their own? Yet you cut the very schemes that have assisted them but, worse than that, you close down debate on the issue in the parliament. What have you got to hide? I do not unders,tand the logic of these issues in their own right, but when you put it against the standthe ards that you assert you are raising in the parliament it makes a nonsense of it. Now we have the final piece of legislation-the ATSIC bill. This is the seventh piece of guillotined legislation in the parliament. Let's just understand the way this issue came before the parliament last night so that we can indicate why we are raising our concern at this opportunity today, The Leader of the House came to me last night at about 20 minutes past 6 and said, 'We are going to bring on the ATSIC legislation. The shadow minister is aware of it. We will let debate run on until 10.30 p.m.' There are three things that he failed to tell me. First of all, he failed to tell me that he was bringing in a new bill. It was not the one returning from the Senate but a new bill which required leave of the parliament, and they did not even seek to get agreement with us on that point. The second issue is that the member for Banks had not been notified. He knew nothing about the legislation coming on in the parliament at 6.30 p.m. and knew nothing about the fact that the government was bringing back a new bill. The third piece of trickery that the Leader of the House engaged in was that in moving the procedures he introduced a guillotine. Mr Marek-Good management.",40
33,Mr CREAN,ISLANDER LEGISLATION,"You might think it is good management to deceive people, but we do notMr Marek-Yes, and you would have done the same. You have done it for the last 13 years.",40
34,Mr CREAN,ISLANDER LEGISLATION,"No, we would not. We would always deal with people openly and frankly. You cannot deal any other way. If you think that you can have relationships understandings with people based on mistrust, you are sadly mistaken. That is why I am annoyed about the way in which this process has come into the parliament, because they sought to deceive us last night by not telling us the full story. That is why we are dealing with this issue again today. The shadow minister was not told. We were not told it was a new bill, and we were not told it was going to be guillotined. That is rammed through by sheer weight of numbers. How is that lifting the standards of the place? If we are really trying to get cooperation these issues, to debate them openly and frankly and to deal with them has to be cooperation. Until the level of trust between the two sides in dealing with the procedures is raised, there is no point in giving any cooperation in the future. It just makes a sham of the whole notion that what you are trying to do is to get the smooth and efficient running of government going. We are not against cooperating with the government. We do understand that they have a mandate in certain areas. Sure, we will debate the issues with them and debate them Abbott, A. 1. vigorously, but we ought to be entitled to Andrews, K. J. have our say. We ought to be entitled to put Baldwin, R. C. our amendments. We ought to be entitled to Bartlett, K. 1. know the procedures that are really in the Broadbent, R. E. minds of the government when they put these Cadman, A. G. things through. We do not need the trickery Charles, R. E. or the skulduggery, where they rub up to you Costello, P. H. in the comers and say, 'Oh, by the way, the Elson, K. S. shadow minister knows about it. We are Evans, R. D. C. going to bring it on.'",41

37,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ISLANDER LEGISLATION,Order! I think the honourable member for Hotham should apologise.,41
38,Mr CREAN,ISLANDER LEGISLATION,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I apologise. Can I just say that it sums up in a number of ways why we are concerned about and the way business is being run in the parliament. We also had the Prime Minister saying he wanted to lift standards. But who was the person who said from across the table to the opposition, 'Why don't you shut up?' It was the Prime Minister-the person who used to accuse and abuse the previous Prime Minister for bad language and bad manners. All of these things he moralised about improving and then he says that to us! You have the Leader of the House trying to all pressure the Speaker in terms of not proceeding with supplementary questions.

We are awaiting the Senate's learned and lengthy deliberations on the matter.

Otherwise, we await the fascinating and considered debate being undertaken in the Senate as I speak. I can assure all honourable members that as soon as we have a better indication from the Labor Party I will be happy to advise you of what is happening. The proposition is that we PAIRS will now have an adjournment debate, in which people may speak for up to 10 minutes. We intend the adjournment debate to run without an expiry time. I am hoping that in an hour's time we will have a better indication of what is happening in the Senate.

Concord Repatriation Hospital",42
40,Mr ZAMMIT,ADJOURNMENT,"I am pleased to enter this adjournment debate. The matter I would like to talk about is, in regard to the Olympic Games, the effect the downgrading of Concord Hospital will have on the international reputation of Australia. The actions of the Carr Labor government have resulted in the downgrading of Concord Hospital-a hospital that is recognised in Australia now as the Olympics hospital. Once the Olympic Games in Atlanta are over, the international spotlight will be on Sydney. Visitors to Sydney and the teams that will be visiting Sydney in the lead-up to the Olympic Games will come to Australia to inspect the medical and health facilities in the area. They will find that the Carr Labor government has downgraded the hospital and removed the general manager of that hospital. It is one of the finest teaching hospitals in Australia. The hospital has found itself having to put staff off. It is a very serious matter, because this hospital's reputation is in the highest possible league. In the lead-up to the Olympic Games there will be vast numbers of Olympic athletes visiting and testing the facilities. They will be making sure that what we have in Australia is good enough to ensure that we retain our reputation as a great sporting nation and that we can also provide for the health care and medical needs of visitors to Australia. And what will they find when they come here? They will find a hospital that has some of the finest facilities in Australia to care athletes. In fact, it has one of the best medical centres in the world for athletes, but that looks like being downgraded. It is interesting that the Premier of New South Wales, Mr Carr, with his treasurer, travelled all around the world posturing and saying, 'Come to Sydney. We have the best of everything.' But as soon as they came back they downgraded one of the best teaching hospitals in Australia. The local community, of course, is extremely angry. Only a few days ago, the matter was raised in this parliament by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott). He quite rightly pointed out that this hospital was handed over to the state with certain provisos. Part of the agreement was that, before any beds were closed, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and the veteran community would be consulted. In fact, they did nothing of the sort, as the Minister for Veterans' Affairs has already pointed out. I note that the minister is in the chamber for this adjournment debate. He has acknowledged the disgraceful situation that has occurred. I am very concerned about the welfare of the people in my community. The hospital has been doing the right thing by the community. It is one of the best hospitals, with a bed occupancy rate in excess of 85 per cent. In fact, last year the bed occupancy rate was 87Y2 per cent. These tremendous facilities that have been made available by the federal government to the state are now being downgraded. I think what has been foisted on the people of the inner west and on the nation of Australia is shameful of the Carr Labor government and his health minister. This hospital is far too important a hospital to be treated in the way it has. Now, of course, it has reached a situation where it is known internationally as the Olympics hospital, although it has been downgraded. That is a shame for Australia. I urge the Premier of New South Wales and the New South Wales health minister to reconsider their actions. I ask them to ensure that the health care needs of the people of the inner west are maintained-indeed, the health for care needs of all people in Australia should be maintained-and that our international reputation is not in any way denigrated. Anti-Semitism",43
41,Mr HOLDING,ADJOURNMENT,"-I rise to raise a matter of considerable concern. Those members of this parliament who saw the Four Corners program this week would have seen visual evidence of the way in which an American political organisation, an extreme right-wing organisation, has sent their agents into Australia, travelling as tourists, for the purpose of establishing a network within Australia. That network, having been established, has proceeded to apply pressure to individual families in rural communities, particularly those who were feeling the effects of the recession. The organisation has split families. But, more importantly for my electorate, it has engaged in an exercise of smearing community and business leaders who have one common factor between them, and that is that they are all members of Melbourne's Jewish community. I view this seriously, as do the members my electorate-Jewish and non-Jewish. We have seen the effects of anti-Semitism and what it led to in Nazi Germany. It is bad enough that we have our own local homeof grown anti-Semites, but I for one am not going to tolerate-and I do not believe member of this parliament should tolerate-a situation where non-Australian citizens come into our community, not using proper passport entries, describing themselves as tourists. What for? To give instructions to those who are members of a front organisation called the munity. Citizens Electoral Council on how to go about perpetrating their propaganda in respect of collapse of world banks and to say that the man who will solve all those problems is one Lyndon LaRouche. Some of the claims made by this organisation border on fantasy. I am not a monarchist but I believe it is a bit over the top for these people to come into Australia and say that Her Majesty the Queen is the head of an international drug cartel. I am not prepared to tolerate this situation in which distinguished leaders in the Jewish community find themselves. There is no excuse for it and, unfortunately, the organisation enlisted the support of a former member of this House, the former member for Deakin, Mr Aldred, who proceeded to purvey this rubbish in this parliament. It is a serious matter when these people take it upon themselves to say that they will not merely investigate businessmen, prominent businessmen, who happen to be Jews; they will investigate their wives and their families. And as part of their tactic of discredletter iting them they spread the vile allegation that one of them is an international purveyor of drugs and pornography. What do you think happens to a child of a person who has to face that sort of allegation? Are we as a community and as a parliament prepared to sit back and say, 'Oh well. They are all a bit mad; they are all a bit off'? The reality is that this is highly organised. They have trained people to sit on telephones and extract money from people in the Australian community by ringing them up, engaging them in conversation and pointing out the catastrophe, asking, 'Do you agree with that? of Can you make a donation?' It is interesting that when Mr Lyndon LaRouche went to gaol it was not for political harassment or treason; it was for debt card fraud. And at the bottom their instructions sheet is 'Get the number of the debt card'. This matter goes beyond the any ·concerns of my own party. It is of deep concern to me because there is a large Jewish community in my electorate. This organisation makes no apology for the fact that the reason it transferred its headquarters in Melbourne was so that it could target that Jewish comI felt so concerned about it that, in early a February, a former parliamentary colleague,  for us conference because we had documented evidence from within that organisation, sworn affidavits as to the nature of their totally un-Australian political activity. It was at the beginning of the election campaign. I sent copies of that material to the then Leader of the Opposition, John Howard, the then Leader of the National Party, Tim Fischer, and the then Prime Minister, Paul Keating. I asked for an independent judicial inquiry because I believe that this sort of activity has to be brought to the light of day and these people who are engaged on a permanent basis in libel, slander and in demeaning honest and decent Australian citizens have to be brought to book and the way to do that is through a properly constructed inquiry. I received a response from the then Prime Minister's office saying that yes, if we were re-elected, they would do that. I received a from the Leader of the National Party saying that he shared my concerns and he would raise it with the then Leader of the Opposition. I am still waiting to receive an answer from the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). I did not press him on that until the earlier part of this month because, having become Prime Minister, he would be confronted with a whole range of pressures and problems and this would merely be one of them. Yesterday, by way of response to me when I raised this matter in another vein and in another way, he indicated that he had received that correspondence. He indicated that he had counselled the then member for Deakin against pursuing some of these allegations in this parliament. I have no doubt at all that he did that. I wonder what the Prime Minister would have done if he had known that Mr Aldred was not acting alone in this matter; but it is on the record-and it is all in detail for any member who wants to read it in a publication that has just been made available-that this was not work done by Mr Aldred alone. He sat down with a group of LaRouche operatives and he had already indicated, for whatever personal motives he had, that he was out to get the leaders. This material was produced, confected, in conjunction with people who are not Australian citizens and who have come here for this disgusting political purpose. They produced documents which were tabled in this House and referred to the Federal Police. The Federal Police came back and said that the documents were forgeries. If it had not been part of a political exercise in which the LaRouche movement was involved I would have expected the former honourable member for Deakin to withdraw and apologise. He did not. He considered that he had to continue to argue his position. More importantly, he refused to disclose source of his documents. The source of his documents has now been made very public. It was made public by the Four Corners program and made very public in the Australian Israel Review which has detailed in depth material that they have obtained from former LaRouche operatives who have left this organisation but believe the full facts must be brought to the attention of the Australian people. This is not just a problem for one community; it is a problem for every member in this House and particularly, I would say, for some in rural areas because many of the members who represent rural constituencies are going to find their communities targeted. We have enough political differences within the framework of our own democratic political system, but I for one am not going to sit by and see the lunatic Right on the fringe of American politics permeate our society and bring their propaganda of hate and venom into our community. (Time expired) Gun Control",43
42,Mr TAYLOR,ADJOURNMENT,"At the outset, I would like to support what the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) had to say. It is relevant in some way to what I am about to speak on. As my wife said in a segment on Jana Wendt's Witness program on Channel 7 earlier this week: it is about time the silent majority spoke out on the firearm reform issues and their positive outcomes, rather than allowing a noisy minority, including some of the Lyndon LaRouche look alikes and the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), to dominate the public debate. What is developing, as she said, is something that is un-Australian-a point she reiterated at an ecumenical rally of 500 people in Toowoomba on Wednesday evening. I am as concerned as anyone about the degree to which the many thousands of very responsible firearm owners across the country are being manipulated by a few who have a far wider agenda than responsible gun ownership. Contrary to some expressed views, I do understand the issues. I am attempting to balance up the arguments. I am not biased or the arrogant on the issues raised. I am certainly not a traitor, as some of the more outlandish fringe dwellers suggest. However, I can assure the House that I will be holding the Commonwealth's line. My backbone will remain stiff. I will persevere publicly for one overriding reason: what is proposed is right. Let me say also what the decisions of the 10 May meeting in Canberra of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the state and territory police ministers are not: they are not the knee-jerk reaction of a national leader who has some hidden conspiratorial agenda to brutally disarm the nation. They are not the imposition on the nation of some partisan draconian measures. They are not the extension of some external force or an interna-ional conspiracy strategy. They are not about the deprivation of a constitutional right of Australians to own and to bear firearms. They are not, of themselves, the panacea to the broader problems of escalating violence in our society. However, these resolutions are all about the taking of decisions in the broadest national interest by a Prime Minister who is exercising an overdue dose of national leadership. It is true that much of what has happened since 28 April has been generated by emotion. Why should any of us deny that and be in any way embarrassed by the emotional outcomes? The events at Port Arthur demanded nothing less at government levels than what is proposed. The Prime Minister did what the nation expected of him. He provided a public policy umbrella of persuasion under which the states and territories could develop legislative packages to formalise firearm ownership where there is a genuine reason, when there is a genuine need and where the usage of military and semiautomatic firearms is curtailed. As the President of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons said recently: Each year over 500 Australians die from gunshot wounds, not to mention at least an equal number who are injured. It is no coincidence that the rates of deaths from shootings in the United Kingdom, where it is more difficult to get guns, is a third of Australia's, while in the United States where it is easier to get guns the death rate is three times that of Australia. Too often, the devastating wounds caused by bullets have taken the lives of young people cut off in their prime. The gun lobby may call the federal and state governments' action following the tragedy at Port Arthur a ""knee-jerk reaction"" but if this so-called knee jerk reaction saves one life it will have been worthwhile. Of these SOO-plus firearm deaths each year, the vast majority is not the result of criminal activity, which the pro-gun lobby seems to push, but involves suicide and the ultimate domestic violence-something which was reaffirmed earlier today in the AMA sponsored conference here in Parliament House. Calls for firearm ownership for personal protection against the home invader are therefore weak as is the persistent criticism that Australian citizens are losing a constitutional right. How can they lose a right that they do not enjoy at present? Arguments supporting such views and using such ammunition as a 1688 British bill or the Magna Carta have no basis. However, they are reflective of that small dedicated group-and that group is reflected in what the honourable member for Melbourne Ports had to say earlier-which attempts to hijack the reforms. Theirs is an agenda of conspiratorial paranoia, of confrontation with the authority of the state, of extremism and of bigotry, of unjustified public anger; in some cases, it is a veneer of self-righteous religious zealotry in which biblical quotation justifies their actions. This nation must not move down that trail towards the violent outcomes of Waco and Oklahoma City. We need to speak up against the ravings of these people as they set out to infiltrate the more responsible ranks of some of the shooters' associations. People need to be reminded that firearm reform in itself is not the total answer. We need to be reminded that the Prime Minister has initiated urgent action at cabinet level regarding the impact of violent videos and the way people act, together with the need for changes in the area of mental health and a reduction in domestic violence. Put these additional initiatives with his move towards that a restoration of some of the family values that have been lost in the last couple of decades and you have an overall national strategy. I therefore put it to the House that what is being proposed in terms of firearm reforms is a step very much in the right direction. In particular, I have every confidence that the Queensland legislation, when it is introduced into the state parliament early next month, will pass the test of reasonableness. Ordinary Australians, on and off farms, collectors, club shooters, feral animal cullers and all who have a genuine need, have nothing to fear from the proposals. Personal vilification is a dimension of the present public debate that I reject very strongly. People should play the issue rather than the person. I am pleased that the member for Kalgoorlie is in the House and I say to him that he should therefore apologise unreservedly for his comments in this week's Witness program when he said of the Prime Minister that he was 'a little methodist bigot who wants to destroy rural Australia'. The sporting shooters should also be aware that Mr Campbell's stated reasons for involving them in his new party are, 'They are handy and they generate a lot of money.' So much for the raison d'etre of a so-called new force in Australian politics. Unemployment",45
43,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,ADJOURNMENT,"I take this opportunity to speak in the adjournment debate of the first session of the 38th Parliament and, in doing so, I would remind the government of some of the undertakings it gave immediately before and after the recent federal election. I refer specifically to a statement made by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in his ACOSS congress speech of October 1995, wherein he said: But I give you this pledge: I want to do everything in my power to preserve the social fabric of this nation. If the price of progress is human misery, it's not progress. If change makes people worse it's not reform. He then went on to say immediately after the election, and as reported in the Age of April 20: One group in the community that is not going to be hurt is the most vulnerable. I believe that it is high time the government be reminded of those undertakings it gave both before and after the recent federal election, especially in the context of the framing of its forthcoming budget. I say that because I suggest that the government is returning to form. In that context I refer to the fact that time and time again in this first session of parliament we have seen the government across a variety of portfolio areas-be it social security, industrial relations, the question of migration or even the important issue of employment and training-walk away from its responsibilities to deliver on the promises that it made to the Australian electorate in the lead-up to the election of 2 March. The issue that most concerns me is the question of jobs and the ability of the unemployed at this point in time to access decent targeted labour market programs, the end result of which is to ensure that we avoid creating in Australia a permanent underclass, as is now the case in such countries as the United States, the United Kingdom and New Zealand, to name a few. On that note I would remind the Prime Minister and, especially, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) of the very clear statement made by the then opposition in its Meeting our Commitments policy co stings document, released during the course of the election campaign. All members of the House should go and examine that document when they want to consider the question of labour market programs and the intensive campaign around Australia at the moment aimed at ensuring the future viability of skillshare (;entres. In that document you will find the statement: 'Labour market programs will not be cut.' Unfortunately, I believe that this government is now walking away from its responsibilities to the most disadvantaged people in the Australian community-those people, many thousands of off, whom exist, who want the opportunity to get back to work. I think we all understand that over the last decade Australia has gone through a most dramatic period of change. Everyone argued for it. There was to be reform in the waterfront industry, reform on the railways, reform in manufacturing industry, reform in the financial sector-and I know the pressure that that is now creating, for example, for National Party members in rural Australia, as banks are closing on a regular basis and jobs are being lost. That is having a dramatic impact on those local communities. But we all made the decision, in facing up to those changes, that we were required as a community to invest in our future. One of the primary areas in which we decided to invest was in the future well-being of all Australians. We decided to ensure that we would do everything possible to try to get people back to work; that we would go out of our way to take out of Canberra ample resources to ensure that we created-in association with local communities, representatives of churches, unions, sporting clubs, country women's associations and local employers-the opportunity to put together training programs in association with a commitment to give those long-term unemployed an opportunity to get back to work. Unfortunately, I believe that the new government has abandoned that commitment and all of a sudden been consumed with a budget fetish. But that is not just my view. It is also, for example, the view of Dr Chris Caton, the respected Chief Economist of Bankers Trust Australia, who said in the Australian on 19 June: Unemployment rather than a lower budget or current account deficit was the number one economic problem facing the federal government and the deficit disease had been overly diagnosed. I suggest that the great majority of Australians stand with the views of Dr Caton. I therefore specifically want to raise for the Prime Minister's attention this afternoon-and, doing so, remind him of when he served as Treasurer in the Fraser-Anthony governmatter ment-his previous support for the skillshare program around Australia. In that vein I think the House has to understand that Senator Vanstone, the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, is just plain wrong. She was wrong in May to announce a 33 per cent cut in the budget for the skillshare program. Every member of this House is feeling the pressure as a result of that decision of Senator Vanstone's. The Skillshare organisations are to be congratulated for standing up and fighting for their local communities. Already this week I have presented in the House of Representaers tives a petition signed by over 15,000 people who have identified with the Skillshare organisation and want this House to act decitraining sively to force Senator Vanstone to examine her decision and make a commitment to look after the most disadvantaged people in the Australian community at the moment: the unemployed people. I raise the question of the Prime Minister. In days gone by, the Prime Minister was forced to face up to this very issue. members of the House to examine Hansard. The Hansard record shows that John Howard, as Treasurer, in his 1981 budget tried to terminate the community youth support scheme, CYSS, which was the forerunner of skillshare. But, to his credit, he did not after a campaign by the then Labor opposition not dissimilar to the campaign we are now running in association with community organisations, churches, employers, unions and sporting organisations involving many public meetings around Australia. For example, in Sydney yesterday, at Petersham, over 400 people attended such a meeting and there will be further meetings next week in north-west Tasmania, in Box Hill in Dr Wooldridge's electorate and in a range of other electorates around the nation. We will continue to campaign hard. I think it is time for the Prime Minister, as he did in 198 I, to take hold of this issue and, basically, have a talk to his minister, Senator in Vanstone, on the basis that there are some matters above the budget cutting process. The I suggest that ought to be above the budget cutting process is the skillshare program. I will tell you why. Skillshare is the most successful labour market program in Australia. Its success rate at a national level is over 60 per cent. But the success rate is not just in the form of statistics. It is, more importantly, reflected in the nature of the person who has had the opportunity to undertake training and gain employment as a result of that skillshare program. It is about the pride they now have in themselves, their families and their local communities. It is about the willingness of the employto actually give them a second chance in life because they were prepared to invest in their own futures, to undertake a skillshare program, to face up to their responsirebilities and to again get job ready. I urge the Prime Minister to please intervene and ensure that the future of the Skillshare organisation around Australia is guaranteed. We do not want a series of little Chicagos in Australia similar to those which currently exist in New Zealand, the United I urge States or the United Kingdom. Debate interrupted. NA Allegations against Constituent",47
44,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"Yesterday the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding), whose presence I note in the chamber at this moment, raised with me a very serious issue. protections. We have considered very carefully the remarks he has made and I want to make a statement to the House. Yesterday the honourable member for Melbourne Ports raised the question of actions by a former member in connection with allegations against a Mr Mark Leibler. This matter has been before the House before. I understand it, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports raised a complaint on 25 September 1995 after the House was informed that the Australian Federal Police had cluded that certain documents used in connecconsidered tion with the allegations were forgeries. On 27 September 1995 my predecessor, a Speaker Martin, responded to the first comlowed plaint. Speaker Martin quoted from an earlier Committee of Privileges report on the quesown tion of the alleged misuse of privilege by members. He suggested to members accept the responsibility that comes with the privilege of the House and he commended reference in the draft code of conduct members, with which he had been associated, to the need for members to have due regard to the rights and responsibilities of all tralian citizens. Speaker Martin concluded no evidence had been presented to support conclusion that a prima facie case of contempt had been made out and so he declined allow precedence to a motion on the matter. issues. In raising this matter again yesterday, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports referred to additional information presented a recent Four Corners program and in the current issue of the Australia Israel Review. As I understand it, this additional information deals with the provision of information to member who had made the allegations and contacts between that member and other persons and organisations. The substance of the complaint now by the honourable member for Melbourne impartial Ports is whether there was a conspiracy to the forms and processes of the House in a way in which, as he put it, they were never meant to be used. A second aspect was the protection of citizens from what the honourable member described as 'smears' when the citizens cannot resort to the normal legal I have considered the comments of the honourable member and the additional information he provided to my office. Like my predecessor, I believe very strongly that all members must take responsibility for their actions in the House. We are all judged by our peers and by the community according to As our actions and standards in these matters. My understanding is that when a member uses the privileges of this place to make allegations and it later emerges that the conmember was in error, the member would be to have a duty to withdraw and apologise. The House may consider that it is matter of regret that this course was not folin the present case. Historically, the House has left it to members to make their judgments about the use of privilege, but I must say that the standing of the House does that they suffer when abuse occurs. I note that yesterday, when the honourable the member for Melbourne Ports raised this for matter, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) intervened, indicating that there had been what he described as a 'fairly vigorous Ausexchange' on the matter between himself and that the member making the allegations, Mr a Aldred. The Prime Minister indicated that he had received correspondence from the honourto able member for Melbourne Ports on the",49
45,Mr HOLDING,PRIVILEGE,"On indulgence, Mr Speaker, I thank in you for your prompt response to the matters that I raised. I thank you for your considered reaffirmation of the rights, duties and obligations that are attached to this House when the members raise matters under privilege. It is to clear that the matter now rests with the executive and with the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). I am hopeful that he will follow the made course that I have recommended for an judicial inquiry. I thank you for the use promptness of your response. I believe that the ruling you have given today strengthens enormously the process of this House, and I concur with your judgment.",49
46,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"I thank the member for Melbourne Ports. NA Debate resumed. Ballooning Accident: Compensation  fortunate enough to serve the Australian people in this place spend many hours discussing and debating the issues of the day. Free speech is well served as we tackle legislation from different individual and party points of view, engaging in rigorous and sometimes bitter debate in the democratic tradition. But despite our varied backgrounds, geographical, political, religious and otherwise, all of us are here with a common purpose in mind-to make a better Australia, to create a fairer and more just society for all our people and for future generations. There are certain things that divide us, but in times of crisis especially we have been known to unite fiercely to achieve a common goal. I have noted with some satisfaction and gratitude the manner in which the opposition has supported the efforts of the government in dealing with proposed controls on automatic and semi-automatic firearms. The shocking tragedy that was the catalyst for these initiatives, I pray, will never be repeated. Australians are a tough but fair-minded people and we recoil in unison at tragedy and rally stoically in the face of adversity and injustice, somehow believing that these things couldn't and shouldn't happen here. But they do. Sadly, the lives of far too many Australians are touched by tragedy of one sort or another. Today I would like to draw to the attention of the House two families in my electorate. Let me say at the outset that these people have been somewhat reluctant to come forward with their story. They have been seeking no publicity-so I will not be naming them today-merely justice. On 13 August 1989, many members will remember there was an accident involving two hot-air balloons at Alice Springs. Thirteen people died when one of the balloons descended onto the other, puncturing it and sending it into a fatal 600 metre free fall. The families of two that perished in that shocking accident live in my electorate of Sturt. Their fight for justice has been long and, seven years down the track, totally unsuccessful. My constituents issued proceedings against a company called Farbix, which operated both balloons, against the estate of the deceased pilot and against the pilot who was found by the subsequent inquest into the accident to have been grossly negligent in allowing his balloon to descend upon the other. The Supreme Court of the Northern Territory granted interlocutory judgments against all three. If this had been a motor vehicle accident, the compensation procedures would have been straightforward. The operating company and the drivers would have been covered by third party personal insurance and the compensation would have been paid on the determination of fault. Sadly, in 1989, the same straightforward and logical approach did not apply to aviation laws. The aggrieved relatives are naturally seeking compensation and their claims have been assessed by the legal firm that represents them. There have been major problems in the discovery process. Was Farbix insured? All attempts to find the answer to that question have been fruitless. Arthur Andersen and Co., who placed Farbix into liquidation, did an extensive search of all company documents and could not find an insurance policy. Insurance company insiders believe that only one company was underwriting balloons at the time of the accident. However, the Civil Aviation Authority could not positively identify the insurer because regulations did not mandate that insurance details be registered with the authority. Still, the legal firm that represented my constituents believes that Farbix was insured. At the time of the inquest, a Mr R.J. Davies of Australasian Aviation Claims in North Sydney-and I note the presence of the member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey)identified himself to the lawyers as representing the underwriters. He would not, and still refuses to, identify the underwriter he claimed to represent. This conspiracy of silence plumbs new depths in relations between insurance companies and their policyholders. We often hear stories about people attempting to defraud insurance companies with bogus claims. We hear also about insurance companies' failure to admit liability, leaving aggrieved policyholders in the lurch. Two wrongs do not make a right and there is no excuse for the hostility on the part of either the insurer or the insured toward each other. In this situation there is no doubt as to the veracity of the claim. But as no-one can seem to identify the insurer, the insurer obviously feels little responsibility to play fair. Rather, the insurer is shrouded in anonymity. Theirs is an attitude of 'if no-one gets caught, then no harm has been done'. Indeed, everyone in this case seems so far to have escaped blame. The pilot at fault had a verdict of manslaughter set aside after attempting to flee to South Africa. The pilot who was not at fault died in the crash and his estate has no value. Farbix, naturally, is bankrupt. Mr Davies is well aware of who is holding the aces in this hand. He has indicated he would recommend an ex gratia payment. He has pointed out to my constituents that they face a very expensive court battle if they decide not to accept such a pay-off. Despite his ministrations, an actual offer is yet to be made. This drawn out game of cat and mouse, the equivocation and prevarication on the part of Mr Davies, has caused enormous distress. I have been informed that the cost of discovering the identity of the insurer may exceed $100,000, which obviously leaves my constituents in a bind. To get all the answers will involve my constituents appointing a liquidator so that action may be taken against the insurer-if there is one. They would then be obligated to indemnify the liquidator in a claim against the insurer to enforce payment under the policy. The process will be long and draining, both financially and emotionally. In the end, of course, they may not win. Some of my colleagues would be aware that the families of other victims have been experiencing similar problems in gaining recompense. However, the fact that my constituents are not alone in their plight is small consolation to them and of great concern to me and, I am sure, to all my parliamentary colleagues and the community at large. The federal government acted last year to ensure that all carriers of air passengers were sufficiently insured. The Monarch Airlines crash earlier this decade raised the spectre of insurance companies avoiding compensation pay-outs if the insurer believed the operator had failed to meet safety standards. This is one of the problems for my constituents. If the insurer is found, they may avoid liability if they successfully prove that Farbix failed to disclose or acted in a negligent fashion or breached aviation regulations. From 20 January this year, that loophole has been no longer available to insurance companies. All carriers of fare-paying passengers now need a certificate from the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. Criminal prosecution or Federal Court injunctions await those who fail to comply with this new regulation. The requirement on carriers is that they now carry at least $Y2 million insurance per passenger before such a certificate is issued. This new registration arrangement does not cover intrastate level and, hence, hot air ballooning. The various states need to enact complementary legislation to bring their laws into line with the federal regulations, and my understanding is that they will begin doing so shortly. However, the cavalry has arrived too late for my constituents. No amount of compensation will ever bring back their loved ones lost in that tragedy seven years ago. The fact that their grief has been compounded with the shabby treatment dealt to them since defies any definition of fairness or justice. I would urge either Mr Davies to break his silence or the insurance company responsible to come forward and confess. Their conspiracy is shameful and totally un-Australian. There is a sad footnote to all this. Just last Friday I happened on a story written by Trudy Harris of the Australian. She reported that the relatives of a young victim of the Monarch Airlines crash are also having difficulty in gaining compensation for their loss. In this case the identity of the insurance company that underwrote Monarch is known-Rural and General Insurance Ltd. Sadly, their resolve to thumb their nose at the misery of others is just as strong. As the young girl's grieving father said, 'It's insulting to hear that my child isn't worth anything. We booked her on that plane and we expected to see her when the plane arrived.' I await with interest the announcement of my colleague the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) regarding the government's wide-ranging review of aviation safety. Perhaps we should also be inquiring into the practices of some of these tawdry insurance companies which are very happy to sell the premiums but seem very reluctant to disperse the benefit. Citizens Electoral Lobby Family Law Court",50
47,Mr CAMPBELL,ADJOURNMENT,"I came into the House this afternoon to speak about other matters, but the member for Groom (Mr Taylor) has compelled me to respond to his remarks. I think the member for Groom made a particularly grubby attack; he tried to associate me with Lyndon LaRouche. There is no-one in this House who has been more critical of LaRouche than I have. He operates in Australia through the Citizens Electoral Lobby. I have made it clear that I think they are, at the very best, fruit loops, but also, in my belief, they are guilty of criminal extortion. I also add that they play upon the fears of people in rural areas who are under enormous financrrri pressure. I struck the same thing when I was involved in the trade union movement. The Trotskyites in the movement used to descend on members of the labour force in areas where they were under pressure. I remember what happened in Kambalda where 600 people got retrenched on one day. Within a few days the Trots were there trying to capitalise on the fear that existed in the community. It is true that I did sign a petition seeking a retrial for LaRouche. I made it very clear at the time that I was doing so as a civil libertarian and that I held no brief whatever for them. Like the member for Isaacs (Mr Wilton), I agree that the preamble we signed was not the preamble that appeared in the paper. When I signed that petition I was aware it had no consequences for Australian holders. LaRouche was convicted and sentenced to 15 years gaol. He was out in less than three. I thought if the man wants a retrial he might go back to gaol-what happened in America was fine. But I have been a consistent critic of that organisation and its methods of operation. I might add that the only people out in the bush who have been putting the counterview and fighting this element have been the League of Rights-not the National Party or the Jewish community in Melbourne. Clyde Holding makes an impassioned speech to his constituency. I can say this of his constituency: many of them are in fact patrons of or are on the board of the magazine Australian Israel Review. I have been continually subjected to attack in that magazine. I have been subjected to much more abuse from them than I have ever warranted. I believe that they, like LaRouche, are also acting in a very un-Australian way. Nor are they helpless or without friends. They boast that they had Paul Keating himself and four ministers at their annual general meeting. I am sure that no-one deserves the sort of treatment that I have received, although I expect I will get it from both sides. Having said that, I believe that the particularly grubby and dishonest attack by the member for Groom is based on fear. Well he may be fearful, for I believe retribution will follow for the member for Groom. I want to talk about an issue involving the Family Law Court. I have said for a long time the Family Law Court should be returned to the Federal Court where there is some sort of control over it. In the gun debate, which the member for Groom alluded to, the great majority of the deaths he spoke of were in fact suicides. The great bulk of those deaths were driven by factors such as economic hardship-which governments are responsible for and which has also been the cause of family break-ups. If you look at economic hardship, the Family Law Act 1975 and the consequential child support system you will see that enormous injustices exist and the desperation to which people are driven. Believe me, if they do not use guns they will use something else as they do in other places which have even higher rates of suicide. Unless you are prepared to tackle the underlying causes, you will gain nothing; nothing will be achieved. There is nothing in what the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is proposing that will attack these issues. One of the reasons is that it would be politically incorrect to attack the Family Law Court or the child support legislation which is an abomination. I want to talk about the Family Law Court in particular. I know a woman in Western Australia who has been enormously disadvantaged by it. Her husband left her. All the assets of the marriage were her assets. She proposed an amicable split of 50-50, which was very generous. The husband, in fact, at first expressed concern-he said it was too generous. But very soon he succumbed and she fund herself in endless litigation. She subjected to bullying tactics from a lawyer-a lawyer who, in my estimation, probably made $300,000 out of this-and harassment and bullying by a judge of the Family Law Court who behaved in an absolutely reprehensible way. This was a woman who was on two occasions bashed up in car parks as a result of the trouble she was having. This is an ongoing trauma. Friends and neighbours have told me that one of her children is quite suicidal about the treatment his mother has received, and yet it goes on. The woman is now being charged with perjury arising out of the court when there were clear cases of perjury which were unanswered and which this particular judge would not respond to. I think the judge's behaviour is certainly inexplicable and is driven either by some notion of male chauvinist superiority or by guilt. In my view, it is guilt driven. This is an outrage. I have mentioned it here in the hope that it will be mentioned in the media in Western Australia where perhaps we can get some justice, which is clearly not available from the court system. The other issue I want to talk about is what has happened to rural Australia. I have before me letters from people in Lightning Ridge, which I think is in the electorate of the member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson). I do not know why they should write to me because it is 10 years since I have been in Lightning Ridge. Every business in Lightning Ridge would have written to me expressing their concern about actions affecting the rural sector. In particular, they make mention of the diesel fuel rebate, which has had a profound influence on Lightning Ridge. It is not just the diesel fuel rebate which will act disproportionately on country people; there are other aspects too. The Department of Health and Family Services in Western Australia, faced with budget cuts, has decided simply to axe every one of its regional offices. They are going to concentrate on working from Perth. The truth is that until they moved to regional areas there was no service to country people. That will now be withdrawn. To suggest that they can be serviced adequately from the capital city is bizarre nonsense. I asked about this by was way of a question without notice and was refused an answer by the Speaker for reasons which certainly escape me. It is a simple fact: the department is looking at closing every regional office. We should look at skillshare. The government is talking about closing those offices that do not meet the performance criteria. But no-one knows what the performance criteria are. There are many skillshare offices in my electorate where the criteria will not be met because they are actually teaching people, mainly Aboriginals, to read and write. People have gone through the education system and it has failed them. If these people are not caught now by Skillshare, which, incidentally, is doing the job far cheaper than the education system did, these people would be a burden on society forever. We see a situation where these offices are likely to be closed down because they are not achieving permanent job outcomes. All they are doing is giving people at least half a chance in life. It is disgraceful because the impact of these cuts will impact disproportionately on country areas where we have the highest levels of unemployment and the fewest alternatives. I join with the honourable member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) in urging that the Prime Minister have a good, hard look at this. Mr Taylor-Are you going to apologise him?",52

I have reservations about these general directions, by the way. I do not blame the minister for this. I blame the cabinet. cabinet acted on the run and, in my opinion, acted without considered advice in relation to imposing on the minister this requirement to issue these special directions for a special auditor-a special auditor that is going to cost the ATSIC organisation $750,000 for six months work. That is $750,000 that could have been delivered to providing community services to organisations. My reservations to this House were put notice on 2 May 1996, when I put question on notice No. 108 to the Attorney-General (Mr Williams). It is worth repeating that question: (1) Was he consulted in relation to the purported general directions issued on 10 April 1996 by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Islander Affairs under section 12 of the riginal and Torres Strait Islander Act concerning the grant or loan of money by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. (2) If he was consulted, did the consultations include consideration as to whether the proposed directions: (a) were of an appropriate nature to be made as general directions; (b) amounted to the Minister exercising a delegated legislative power not authorised by the Act; and (c) conflicted with several sections of the Act specifying the powers of the Commission and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commercial Development Corporation.

59,Mr MAREK,ADJOURNMENT,"Capricornia) (3.49 p.m.)Today I stand to bring to the House's attention a topic of grave concern to the many men and women of this great country. The topic is on the current child support system. At present people who, for one reason or another, have had the misfortune of a relationship break-up and who have children from that relationship are being tom apart by a child support system that not only leaves the non-custodial parent in a position of extreme poverty but also Strait forces them to leave their jobs, as many Abocannot afford to make the payments that the 1989 system requires them to pay. Further, there are domestic disputes that arise from the fact that so much has to be paid. The current system is a draconian system and it does nothing for the people of this country. If you wish to get access to your children, some may say, 'Well, if you can't get access, go to court.' This is a facade. Once the child support system gets stuck into you, you are sadly mistaken if you think of a court as a course of action. The majority of people cannot afford the legal action that they would have to take to see their children. There are many cases and I mention, in particular, those in the area of Capricornia, where people are on incomes of between $70,000 and $90,000 a year. These people are forced to make child support payments of up to $550 a week, and some have only two children. This leaves nothing in the pay packet for the mortgage on the house, car payments, purchases of clothes, food or even a respectable standard of living. I have discussed the current child support system with many men and women, not only in my electorate of Capricornia but throughout the best part of Queensland. I have a submission of the list of changes that many people would like to see. The current system is a draconian system and is not workable. The first change that the majority of the people I have spoken to would like to see is that payments be calculated on the net income, not the gross income, of the noncustodial parent. This puts both parties on a level playing field, because tax should be shared evenly between the family even though they may not be living together. Another suggested change is that child support payments should be calculated on a weekly basis, as is the current PAYE tax system, not 12 monthly or at a review. In current times, people's jobs are being restructured and their pay rates fluctuate. People have been told they have to make a certain payment every week and, because their wages fluctuate, they often end up paying more than they earn. So all of a sudden they find themselves in arrears. This is not a fair system, and it needs to be looked at ASAP. Another proposed change is that the custodial parent, the receiver of the payments, document expenditure of the moneys received and that a trust fund be opened so that all moneys not spent can be retained for the child's future and not spent on things other than those which are required for the child. The next proposed change is that the second family of the non-custodial parent be taken into account in an effort to reduce child support payments so that the new family unit has sufficient moneys on which to live. Currently, we have a system where men and women who have gone into second relationships and who are paying child support cannot afford to maintain their new relationship with their new family. The next proposed change is that the Child Support Agency continue to take refund cheques. The custodial parents were very happy with this, because if the non-custodial parent refused to pay, at the end of the financial year the tax refunds, which were maintained by the Taxation Office, would be given to the custodial parent. That is still considered to be fair and should remain. Where the noncustodial parent has not been making payments and the money is being kept, the Child Support Agency keeps all the penalties. That is a draconian system and should not work. One last proposed change-this is a system that many people would like to see happenis that the child support payments be a discrete amount calculated on a child's age rather than the current system that calculates as a percentage of the non-custodial parent's income. This means that, if you have children between the ages of one and five, you would pay a set amount of, say, $20 or $30. If the child was between the ages of five and eight and going to school, you may have to pay $30 or $40. As the child's age increases, so should the amount of money. Telstra Privatisation",55
60,Mr HATTON,ADJOURNMENT,"The current Prime Minister, the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), rhetorically asserted in question time yesterday that the former Prime Minister and member for Blaxland, the Hon. Paul Keating, wanted to sell 100 per cent of Telstra on the basis of former Senator Graham Richardson's book Whatever it Takes, pages 305 to 307 inclusive. The member for Bennelong said that Paul Keating: ... did not want to sell a third of Telstra; he wanted to sell lOOper cent of it. We are being only one third as radical as Paul Keating on the sale of Telstra. This claim is false. The member for Bennelong's claim is based on a poor authority, given that Graham Richardson was not involved in the cabinet debate on the issue of how to deal with the matter of Aussat's debt stream. Therefore, it might be generously said of him that he was unfortunately wrong but not necessarily malicious in his wrongness. The second unstated source for the member for Bennelong's continuing assertions that Paul Keating wanted to sell off Telecom, as it was known in 1990, was an interview Paul Keating did with Kerry O'Brien on Lateline. Paul Keating's comments have continually been used out of context by the member for Bennelong and others on that side of the House to misrepresent his real position on the ownership of Telecom. Paul Keating said at the time that the essence of the debate was not the question of ownership per se but a question of competition. Paul Keating supported the full public ownership of Telecom, and he stressed in that interview with Kerry O'Brien that the current question did not relate to ownership, as full public ownership was a given, but as to how the government dealt with introducing competition into the marketplace. The core reality is that the Australian Labor Party prior to 1990, in 1990 and through to 1996 has consistently, openly, directly and forcefully declared its total opposition to the sale of Telecom or, as it is now known, Telstra. Paul Keating, in his roles as Treasurer and Prime Minister, consistently supported and argued for full public ownership of Telecom. The former Prime Minister and member for Blaxland debated in the cabinet the question of how the federal Labor government should best deal with the budgetary problems arising from the indebtedness of the Australian satellite, which was foisted on the Australian people by the Fraser government against advice from Telecom that optical fibre cabling of the nation was a better and more costeffective alternative. The Fraser government gave us Aussat as  Howard coalition is set, should it succeed in selling off one-third of Telstra, to give the media moguls another big present--courtesy of the coalition. Those who own the backbone of Australia's communications system own the future. Labor believes that the Australian people should fully own Telstra, the very backbone of the communications system, and should benefit from its future income stream. The coalition would fully sell off Telstra to private interests who would become the communications system's future eaters. The disingenuous nature of the member for Bennelong's misrepresentation of the former Prime Minister's position on the sale of Telstra has a long history. On 19 September 1990, the member for Bennelong supported Paul Keating's option on the merging of OTe and Aussat as the most sensible option facing the then Labor government. But he disingenuously argued that the then Treasurer, Paul Keating, did not want Telecom to be publicly owned forever. He was dead wrong then and he is dead wrong now. He seems to have understood the arguments then, but he does not today seem to recall that he fully put the coalition's real agenda in 1990. The member for Bennelong is quoted in Hansard on 19 September 1990 as saying: . . . the policy espoused by the Opposition which is the only truly economical and rational policythat is to have full, unfettered competition and to privatise Telecom after the establishment of the competition. The current Prime Minister believed in 1990 that this was the ideal set down by the coalition. On 27 June 1996, the current Prime Minister still believes that that is the ideal-it is, in fact, the Howard government's policy. The Howard government is seeking to sell one-third of Telstra in this parliamentary term. During the 1996 March general election campaign, the coalition put the proposition that it would sell off one-third in the first term and that, depending on circumstances, it would put the proposition to the Australian people at the next election to sell off the rest. The Howard coalition government is being utterly consistent in relation to this matter. They do not believe in the full public ownership of Telstra-they want to sell the whole thing off. They are determined to destroy Telstra, something that the Australian people own in full and cherish. They want to flog it off in one to three tranches to their media mogul mates. Ideologically, they want to smash the very notion of public ownership of Telstra and other federal government utilities. This is the revenge of the Visigoths-those who would rape and pillage, those who would destroy rather than nurture and create. The dividing line between the coalition and the federal parliamentary Labor Party on the public ownership of Telstra is sharp and the contrast between our positions is stark. The ALP is fully committed to the Commonwealth government retaining full ownership of Telstra. The ALP understands that by the year 2030, 35 per cent of Australia's gross national product will come from communications. An efficient, competitive and publicly owned Telstra can ensure that the federal government and the Australian people directly benefit from the massive and exponential growth of the communications sector of the economy. The ALP believes in a strong, central government for the Commonwealth of Australia and in the full ownership of Telstra. This ideological Howard coalition government would strip the federal government of its powers, hand back whatever functions it can to the states and sell off the rest to private interests. The coalition does not believe in a strong, central federal government. It hankers for a return to the Australia of 1901, when the federal government had control of only defence, customs and excise, and posts and telegraphs. They would keep the first two legs of the tripod of powers but flog off communications to foreign and domestic private interests. By their actions, they would effectively create six weak countries, where we now have one strong, increasingly united polity bent on exploiting its natural advantages, its continental status, its geographical location factors and the diversity of talents of the Australian people. The member for Bennelong, the current Prime Minister, seeks to disingenuously cloak his total commitment for selling off all of Telstra behind the bold and utterly untrue assertion that the member for Blaxland wanted to sell it. He knows it is false. He should be honest and own up to it. Timber",56
61,Mr CAUSLEY,ADJOURNMENT,"I would like to raise in this House this afternoon an issue that is of grave concern to my electorate of Page on the north coast and to many other electorates along the coast that deal with the timber industry. I notice that the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Nairn) is in the House. I am sure, from discussions that I have had with him, that he joins with us in our concern for the problems that we are experiencing in the timber industry. Of particular concern at the present time is the RACAC process in New South Wales. That process is part of the national forest policy. The federal government has put certain criteria on that policy to try to maintain adequate and representative reserves of forests across the state and, indeed, across Australia. The process goes back to an international convention which I believe was approved at a meeting at Colombo. The nations meeting observed that it would be a good idea for nations to protect about 10 per cent of their current forests. The previous Prime Minister, the Hon. Paul Keating, decided in his wisdom that in Australia that criterion should be set at 15 per cent of forests, to bring it into line with the situation in 1750. Even though there is no documented evidence of the extent of the forest reserve at that time, it is believed by many people, and it can be seen by reading the diaries of the explorers, that the Aboriginals' burning of forests had a considerable influence on the extent of forests that existed when Europeans first came to this country. We now have a situation in New South Wales where the government is setting up on computers of the National Parks and Wildlife Service a modelling process to assess rainfall, soil and other activities that might allow forests to grow. If you look at that, without taking into account outside influences, you can see that what is being put forward by the Carr government will take the forestry situation to that of 1750. While the national forest policy certainly talks about adequate and representative reserves and has certain criteria set by the federal government, the Carr government has put in place its own wilderness definition, which is broader than the definition of the Commonwealth. It has put in place a definition of 'old growth', which is an area where no stump can be found. Anyone with any forestry experience would know that it would be difficult to find a stump in a forest 50 or 60 years in the regrowth process. Older people in the community are telling us of the ludicrous situation in which some former farming lands which have regrown trees over a period of 40 or 50 years are now being declared old growth forest. This definition is being manipulated by the Carr government because they are absolutely paranoid about trying to pander to the extreme greens. They have gone to the extent of putting in criteria which talk about irreplaceable forest and have fauna habitat protection laws. In the experience that we have had, they will extend these criteria even further. I would like to inform the House of the very devious extent that they have gone to. The former federal government believed that the coast of New South Wales should be divided into two areas-the north coast and the mid-north coast-in the assessment of these reserves. It is fairly clear that the New South Wales government has gone to the further extent of dividing it into 11 separate areas and has ignored what is outside the individual area. By doing that, they have been able to expand the 15 per cent to 23 per cent and, in some instances, 30 per cent. Of course, this has the potential to have extraordinary repercussions on country communities. Many members of this House are concerned about this. The member for Cowper (Mr Nehl), the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) and the member for Richmond (Mr Anthony) share my concerns. The National Party members along the coast of New South Wales have the same concerns. I can assure you that the results in the reports that are coming through from the meetings that are being held on this RACAC process can be quite devastating. In fact, in areas such as Dorrigo, 80 per cent of the forest resource is locked up; in the Urbenville forest management area, 90 per cent; and in the area of Hunter, 100 per cent. Of course, the New South Wales government is deliberately not releasing a socio-economic report which shows the devastating effects on small country communities, where towns of 200 to 300 people will be completely closed down because these forests are being denied. It is important to bring some facts to this debate because it can be very confusing. The renewal of licences is also an issue in the woodchip debate. I want to draw to the attention of the House that only one per cent of forests are harvested at anyone time in Australia. It is not cleared; it is regrown. In fact, if you look at forestry across Australia, you will find that somewhere between two and three trees are being grown for every tree that has been harvested. Yet we have this dishonest debate fuelled by the greens who are determined to tell lies. In the process, they are affecting the affairs of small communities and the economic well-being of this country. If you look at the import imbalance in this country, you will see that we are importing $3 billion worth of forest products. We are exporting somewhere around $1 billion worth. Yet, in the woodchip process, they are trying to stop us from exporting, and the income from that area is part of the $1 billion which is trying to balance our imports. There is no doubt in my mind that this is a very serious issue. I want to make it very clear that the Carr government are being very dishonest in this debate. They are trying to imply that they are using federal criteria in this resource and conservation assessment process. I make it very clear that they are not federal criteria; they are New South Wales government criteria. Even the unions themselves, which have been supporters of the Carr government, are now saying that they have been let down. In fact, they have been misled. They have been misled by this government because the government told the unions, when they were seeking their support in the New South Wales election, that they would be protecting the jobs of their members. Now the unions can see that they have been absolutely misled and sold out by this process. The New South Wales government said that they would give compensation to workers and companies that were affected by this process. Obviously, when they go to this extent, the amount of money that is available from the Commonwealth and state is not adequate to give compensation to people and to companies. Telstra: Directory Assistance Second Sydney Airport  very concerned that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard)-I am not sure whether it was inadvertent; I suspect it may have beenmisled the House in relation to a question asked by the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) about taking up the advice of the Managing Director of Telstra, Mr Blount. Members will recall that the government has certainly taken up his advice about privatisation. Mr Blount advocates charges for directory assistance. On page 2549 of the Hansard of Monday, 24 June, Mr Howard, in response to the member for Dobell's question, said: Oh, you rejected it. That is, us, the opposition. He continued: He rejected it. Well, so do we. That is, the Prime Minister rejects the imposithe tion of directory assistance charges. In other words, when people ring up 013 and want a telephone number, that is a free service. Unfortunately for the Prime Minister, in today's Sydney Morning Herald Matthew Kidman reported Mr Blount as saying: We are looking at ways to do thatthat is, to charge for directory assistanceand one of those clearly is to charge ... as most other countries do. I believe that every member of this House deserves to have the Prime Minister clear up this situation wherein he said that he, the Prime Minister, was rejecting it yet the Managing Director of Telstra is saying that they propose to charge for directory assistance. Mr Lee-He is at once overruling him.  have been an inadvertent misleading of the House and Mr Blount seems to be overruling him. Certainly, my constituents would like to know, when this session ends, that there will be no axe in terms of charges being imposed when they ring up and utilise what is now a free service. Many in my electorate are functionally illiterate. So it is not an issue of laziness or not being prepared to look at the telephone directory. This is their sole source of ascertaining whether or not people have a telephone and what that telephone number is. I appeal to the Prime Minister to come into the House and clear this up as quickly as possible. I did want to mention Badgerys Creek again. It is sad that we are finishing over 100 days of the Howard government-this first session of this parliament-and there has been not one word of information given about Badgerys Creek. It is fair to say that we are being treated as second-class citizens. There has been not a word on the normal process that was promised of having a schedule of completion of various parts of the EIS and of having times and dates and places where people can be consulted and be informed about the EIS and make an input into the EIS process. We do not have anything on the record of parliament by the ministers-ither the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) or the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment (Mr Warwick Smith)-that they are committed to setting up an advisory committee. We do not even have the names of people who may serve on this advisory committee. Yet again the people in and around Badgerys Creek in western Sydney are being held to ransom, on this occasion by Holsworthy. It is really unfortunate. They are entitled to the information. I have said to the minister directly, 'You will pay a price for not informing the people.' One of the things that is absolutely vital for the government is to have an EIS process where people have faith in the outcome. You make that job so much harder the less you consult with them and provide information. I appeal to the minister to come out in this winter break, in advance of Holsworthy, and give the information to the people of my electorate and electorates surrounding Badgerys Creek. Copyright Licences: APRA Atlanta Olympics: Steven Dewick",58
62,Mr LLOYD,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise in the House to highlight yet another example of bureaucracy gone mad. Businesses in my electorate recently received a circular from APRA, the Australian Performing Rights Association, which is headed 'Courtesy Notice'. This circular is also accompanied by an application for a 'Copyright Music Licence-Background Music'. The wonderfully polite notice points out that, as part of a national compliance program-which I feel is merely a fundraising exercise for APRA'please be aware': If you use radio, TV tapes or CDs as background entertainment for your customers or staff you hold a current APRA licence. This means, according to APRA, that if you are a dentist, doctor or shopkeeper and you have the radio on for yourself, your staff and your customers, under section 85, paragraphs (b) and (c) of the Copyright Act 1968 you will have to fill in yet another form and pay $36.20 per annum, subject to annual increases linked to the CPI, and 90c for each additional speaker, for the privilege of having that radio on. When I rang APRA this morning to discuss this matter, I was very abruptly informed by a spokesman that this was the law and that, if I chose not to apply for this licence and continued to have the radio in my shop tuned into my favourite free to air radio stationswhich, of course, are 2GO and Coast Rock FM on the Central CoastMr Hardgrave---A very good radio station, too.",61
63,Mr LLOYD,ADJOURNMENT,"Absolutely-where it might be heard by staff or customers, that I would be guilty of an offence under the Copyright Act. This wonderfully informative spokesman suggested that, if I should consider this course of action, I should contact my legal representatives as they would prosecute me as 'this was the law'. I propose to lobby the Minister for Communications and the Arts, Senator Richard Alston, and the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs, the member for Forrest  amendments to the Copyright Act so as to allow businesses to have free to air radio and TV broadcasts as a background service for their customers and staff. I understand, and I have no problem with, the licensing requirements for businesses which use radio or TV broadcasts to attract customers. Businesses such as hotels which broadcast loud music as entertainment or shops which may use radio or music to attract customers to a specific sale should, of course, be licensed and pay the licensing fee. I can assure you, Mr Speaker, that customers do not must go to the doctor, dentist or local supermarket just so they can listen to the radio broadcast. In raising this issue, I am very mindful of protecting the rights of performing artists who, all too frequently, miss out on remuneration due to the free to air broadcasts of their works. As I stated before, I most certainly support the enforcement of these broadcasting licences where these acts are broadcast specifically for entertainment or promotion of products or businesses. Our government is committed to reducing additional bureaucracy and paperwork for small businesses. I will be seeking the support of my ministers to enable amendments to this act so as to relieve businesses in my electorate of Robertson, and throughout Australia, of this unnecessary and totally unfair licence burden. In the time. I have left to me, I would like to convey, on behalf of the residents of my electorate of Robertson and the residents of the Central Coast my very best wishes for success in the forthcoming Olympic Games to Steven Dewick, who will compete in the 100 and 200 metres backstroke events at the Atlanta Olympics. Honourable members-Hear, hear!",61
64,Mr LLOYD,ADJOURNMENT,"To have reached the level of accomplishment which selection in the Olympic team requires is a marvellous feat. We will all be barracking for Steven to reach the podium as a medal winner. Our reward will actually be in the knowledge that the Central Coast can produce one of the best: a person who will knowingly put his heart and soul into achieving the best possible result for himself, his country and his fellow Australians. On behalf of the member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Nairn), I would also like to mention that he has six Olympians and one para-Olympian in his electorate. I know that the member for Eden-Monaro echoes my sentiments and wishes his Olympians the very best at Atlanta. Honourable memb.ers-Hear, hear! Debate interrupted.

We support the findings of EPAC. We support the findings on this matter by the National Commission of Audit. There is no reason why the government cannot repackage its financial assistance to those projects in Sydney either by cashing out the tax benefit or by acting on the former government's recommendation to change the Loan Council borrowing requirement to make it easier for public sector borrowing and less expensive than the private sector borrowing arrangements. We want those things on the 1996 record. The government has been spreading a spurious notion that the Labor Party is holding back investment projects. We have consistently voted in this House and in the Senate to have the development allowance amendments proceed. We want those projects to go ahead. We are acting on the report by EPAC and the National Commission of Audit to see those major road projects in Sydney go ahead. The government is to be condemned for its action and its failure to support good public policy on the development allowance and on urban tollways. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA Membership",62
70,Mr SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"I have received messages from the Senate acquainting the House that from 1 July 1996, Senator Baume has been discharged from attendance on the Joint Standing Committee on Public Accounts and Senator Ian Macdonald has been appointed a member of the committee. Senator Sandy Macdonald has been appointed a member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. NA BILL (No.1) 1996 Message Message received from the Senate returning the bill and acquainting the House that the Senate has agreed to the bill as amended by the House at the request of the Senate. House adjourned at 4.23 p.m. until Tuesday, 20 August 1996, at 2 p.m., in accordance with the resolution agreed to this day. The following answers to questions were circulated: Tax Loophole Closure (Question No.4) Mr Filing asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 1 May 1996: Will he close the estimated $800 million tax loophole identified by his predecessor whereby wealthy persons in business are able to form companies to minimise their tax obligations and split their incomes among immediate family members. Mr Costello-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: In February, the then Prime Minister announced that the ATO had found that many high wealth individuals are engaging in tax avoidance such that the revenue lost is hundreds of millions of dollars. The revenue at risk from this avoidance is estimated to be around $800 million per year. The Government is committed to continued action against tax evasion and blatant tax avoidance and will be taking such steps as are necessary to ensure that high wealth individuals pay their fair share of tax. A joint ATOffreasury' team is examining the broad nature of tax minimisation techniques employed by those high wealth individuals who pay very little income tax and is developing appropriate policy responses to address tax practices used by these individuals to avoid tax. As part of this project, the ATO is conducting an on going investigation of the arrangements used by these individuals to avoid tax. ATO investigations have already revealed that a number of high wealth individuals use complex multiple trust structures to avoid tax. The Commissioner of Taxation has recently announced some details of the first stage of a comprehensive program to further the ATO's understanding of the tax practices used by high wealth individuals. It will involve extensive national enquiries, initially to be by letter, that the ATO to gain a full understanding of structures and strategies employed so that the most comprehensive administrative responses and legislative proposals can be designed. As the Commissioner has announced, policy proposals are now being prepared for the GovernNA ment on the range of specific techniques outlined during the election campaign. Following receipt of necessary advice from the ATOffreasury team, the government will decide what policy proposals to bring before the Parliament. As some of the avoidance techniques are potentially more readily addressed than others, progressive tabling of legislative responses may be required. Emergency Financing Mechanism (Question No.8) Mr Rocher asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 1 May 1996: Will the Parliament be given an opportunity to debate the Emergency Financing Mechanism sponsored by the International Monetary Fund before Australia agrees to participate; if not, why not. Mr Costello-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Individual countries have not, and will not, be asked to participate in the Emergency Financing Mechanism (EFM). The EFM is not a facility in which countries could participate. It is a set of procedures within the existing facilities of the IMF. The creation of the EFM is within the powers of the IMF's Executive Board, which is responsible for conducting the day-today business of the Fund. The Executive Board approved the EFM procedures on 12 September 1995. Commonwealth Borrowings: Total Sums (Question No.9) Mr Rocher asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 1 May 1996: (1) What were the total sums of Commonwealth borrowings at (a) 31 March 1995 and (b) 31 March 1996. (2) What percentage of each total sum referred to in part (1) was subject to exposure to (a) the will help US$ and (b) each other foreign currency. Mr Costello-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1)(a) As at 31 March 1995, total Commonwealth Government securities (CGS) on issue, excluding the CGS holdings of the Loan Consolidation and Investment Reserve (LCIR) (which do not constitute a net Commonwealth liability), totalled $104,036.2 million. The Commonwealth Government's own share of that total CGS on issue (ie, excluding CGS on issue for the States and NT) was $95,086.5 million. $US Sterling Deutsche Marks Swiss Francs Yen Hong Kong Dollars Netherlands Guilders At 31 March 1996, the Commonwealth's foreign follows: $US Sterling Deutsche Marks Swiss Francs Yen Hong Kong Dollars Netherlands Guilders (.. represents less than 0.01 per cent) As part of debt management activities over the last nine years, the Commonwealth has undertaken swap transactions with respect to some of its CGS denominated in foreign currencies and also, in the past five years, in relation to some of its CGS issued in Australian dollars. Swaps are used, for liability management purposes, to change the currency and/or interest rate exposure associated with existing loans. As part of its portfolio ment operations over recent years, the Common At 31 March 1995 (a): $US Sterling Deutsche Marks Swiss Francs (b) As at 31 March 1996, the figures were $112,610.9 million and $107,856.6 million, respectively. (2) At 31 March 1995, the Commonwealth Government's foreign currency exposure as a proportion of CGS was as follows: CGS CGS excluding States per cent & NT per cent 1.45 1.59 0.23 0.26 0.46 0.50 0.07 0.07 0.15 0.16 0.07 0.08 0.69 0.75 currency exposure as a proportion of CGS was as CGS CGS excluding States per cent & NT per cent 0.68 0.71 0.19 0.20 0.38 0.39 0.09 0.09 0.05 0.05 0.41 0.43 wealth has sought to maintain a small holding of $US in the debt portfolio.

(2) There are two separate components of the R&D tax concession: single companies who claim the 150 per cent R&D tax concession on activities carried out in each financial year that are registered under section 39J of the Industry Research and Development Act (IR&D Act); and joint registration of syndicates under subsection 39P(3) of the IR&D Act.

This first stage approval involves the Board's decisions on eligibility of the R&D activities, core technology and [mance schemes.

Annual Budget Statements: Treasury's (Question No. 34) Mr Latham asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 1 May 1996: (1) What was the outcome of the Treasury's review of the manner in which the annual Budget Statements are presented. (2) Will the 1996-97 Budget Statements include specific information on how the budget will affect Australia's national savings. Mr Costello--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Treasury has not carried out any formal review of the annual Budget Statements. However, each year the form and content of the Budget Statements are considered as part of the budget drafting process. programs in each financial year since concessions were 150 per cent R&D Tax R&D Syndicates Concession (a) Registered (b) o 2106 906 1284 1423 7 2135 10 1753 23 2489 35 3345 33 3389 45 2978 60 of Industry, Science and Tourism. (2) The 1996-97 Budget Statements will include information on the underlying budget balance. The underlying budget balance estimates the Commonwealth budget sector's direct contribution to the national saving and investment imbalance as measured in the national accounts, which in tum represents the nation's current account deficit. The underlying budget balance is the headline balance less net advances, which comprise primarily equity assets sales and net repayments of debt by the States; more information on this concept is given in the recently released National Fiscal Outlook. Data on the underlying budget balance were included in the revised Budget estimates provided in my press release of 12 March 1996. Local Government (Question No. 42) Review Mr Latham asked the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government, upon notice, on 1 May 1996: (1) Further to answers to questions Nos 1376 (Hansard, 18 October 1994, page 2257) and 221 (Hansard, 10 May 1995, page 281), (a) by what administrative or legislative measures and (b) to what extent, has the number of local government bodies been increased or decreased in each State and Territory. (2) What changes have there been to the configuration of regional organisations of councils and their population size since 1994. Mr Warwick Smith-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1)(a) In the Northern Territory, four new councils were created since the reply to question No. 221. Three of these councils were Community Government Councils and were incorporated under the Northern Territory Local Government Act 1993. The fourth council was an Association Council and was gazetted as local governing body under the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1986 New South Wales Victoria Queensland South Australia Western Australia Tasmania Northern Territory NA *number of local governing bodies as at answer 2257) **number of local governing bodies as at answer 281) (2) As at September 1994, there were 62 Voluntary Regional Organisations of Councils (VROCs) across all States, covering about 50 per cent of all councils and 75 per cent of the population in Australia. Since then all the Victorian VROCs have ceased operation, mainly due to the council amalgamation process in the interim. The 52 existing VROCs cover 54 per cent of all councils and 57 per cent of the population in Australia.

Details of grants provided to both government and nongovernment schools in the selected postcodes for the calendar years 1990 to 1995 follow. Details for 1996 are not yet available. Commonwealth grants for Government schools are paid as block grants to the State and Territory Governments. The only schools program under which the States and Territories are required to report expenditure on individual schools is the Capital Grants Program. Therefore the information for government schools is on the Capital Grants Program. Grants under the National Equity Program for Schools for non-government schools from 1994 have also been paid to Block Grant Authorities.

(b) The relevant provisions of the Act came into force on 5 October 1992. (c) Licence area plans have been completed in the following zones within planning group 1:Mildura/Sunraysia, Griffith and the MIA (television only), Darwin and Katherine, Broken Hill, the Spencer Gulf (television only), Mount Gambier/South East (television only).

This table lists the priority 2. All planning zones within a Group have within that group. (e) No. (f) Not applicable. As required by the Act, the ABA has determined planning priorities through a process involving wide public consultation. The planning priority decision requires the ABA to complete Group 1 planning zones before Group 2 zones, and so on. (g) Based on the ABA's current estimates, licence area plans for radio and television services in the New South Wales North Coast region are expected to be completed by the second half of 1998 and the second half of 1999 respectively. International Year for the Eradication of World Poverty (Question No. 241) Mr Langmore asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 21 May 1996: (1) What action is being taken in his portfolio in relation to the goals of the International Year for the Eradication of World Poverty. (2) What programs have been initiated in 1996 to achieve the goals.

However, the objectives of my Department's Humanitarian Program are partly related to one of the goals ""to meet the special needs of particular social and demographic groups, including young people, disadvantaged older persons, persons with disabilities and other vulnerable and disadvantaged groups of persons"". (2) No new programs have been initiated in 1996 to achieve the goals. Jabiluka Uranium Mine: Employment (Question No. 248) Dr Lawrence asked the Minister representing the Minister for Resources and Energy, upon notice, on 22 May 1996: Is it a fact that the proposed establishment of the labiluka uranium mine by Energy Resources Australia (a) has been estimated by the company to employ an additional 110 workers and (b) will involve an underground operation which will be extremely capital intensive; if so, what additional direct employment will the mine create. Mr Anderson-The Minister for Resources and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (a) I am advised that Energy Resources of Australia Ltd (ERA) proposes to expand the workforce at the proposed Jabiluka mine gradually, from 5-10 in the first year to a maximum of 110 in about the ninth year of operation. (b) The Jabiluka proposal currently before the Government is indeed a capital-intensive operation, as are most mining projects. Additional direct employment associated with the development of Jabiluka will involve a workforce of about 60 in the construction phase. The mine is also likely to contrl\Ct Aboriginal corporations for environmental projects and other support services, as is currently the practice at Ranger, producing additional casual employment. It should also be noted that the ERA proposal does not involve Jabiluka as a stand alone project. ERA proposes an integrated Ranger-Jabiluka operation, with ore from both mines being milled at Ranger. About 150 people are employed in milling facilities and administrative areas at Ranger. The output from Jabiluka will make an increasingly important contribution to ERA's overall operations as the mine is developed and will therefore contribute to the maintenance of these jobs at Ranger. In addition, industry and academic sources estimate the multiplier effect of mining projects in Australia at 3-4. This means that the Jabiluka project could lead to indirect employment of 220-330. This, of course, does not take into account the ongoing indirect employment generated by the integrated operations at the Ranger milling facility. Ausmusic: Commonwealth Funding (Question No. 258) Dr Lawrence asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 23 May 1996: Will the Commonwealth provide funds to Ausmusic in 1996-97; if not, (a) why not, (b) did the Minister discuss funding with Ausmusic's board or its representatives before taking the decision and (c) will the withheld funding be applied to other areas of the music industry or withdrawn from the industry altogether. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for Communications and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: No (a) Federal funding for Ausmusic will expire on 30 June 1996. Ausmusic lacks recognition and support from most sectors of the industry, duplicates some services provided by other organisations and is administratively costly. The Government is also concerned at the level of remuneration of the executive director ($173,678 in salary and superannuation alone according to 1993 audited financial statements). Given the current budgetary climate, funding will therefore not be renewed. (b) Ausmusic's executive director made representations to the Minister and his staff prior to the decision being taken. (c) The Government announced in its arts policy statement, 'For Art's Sake', its intention to establish a Contemporary Music Export Fund, to provide financial assistance for musicians to tour overseas to promote their recordings. The proposal is being considered in the current Budget. Australian Prisoners of War: Hiroshima and Nagasaki (Question No. 272) Mr Cobb asked the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 27 May 1996: (1) Is he able to provide details concerning the identity of Australian prisoners of war in the vicinity of Hiroshima and Nagasaki when an atomic bomb was dropped on each city in August 1945. (2) Is he able to say (a) what approximate dosage of radiation the prisoners of war received, (b) what subsequently happened to them, including the incidence of health problems resulting from radiation exposure, and (c) whether any are still alive. Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) (a) There are no records of any Australian POW's being in the vicinity of the city of Hiroshima on or about August the 6th, 1945; (b) There are records of 27 Australian POW's being in or near the vicinity of Nagasaki on August the 9th, 1945. (2) (a) The radiation dose received has been estimated as: for 23 subjects, some 50 rads; for 4 subjects, close to zero. (Of these 4 subjects, 3 were about seven kilometres away, and 1 was in an underground, concrete shelter.) (b) The survivors returned to Australia. Over the intervening years, some of these veterans developed health problems that the Repatriation Commission determined were related to their exposure to radiation at Nagasaki. Others had diseases accepted by the commission because of other aspects of their service. (c) Of the 27, 19 are known to be now dead, 6 are still alive and 2 have unknown status, but are considered likely to be dead. Aboriginal Legal Aid: Expenditure (Question No. 282) Mr Cobb asked the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, upon notice, on 29 May 1996: (1) What total sum was spent on Aboriginal Legal Aid in each year since its inception. (2) What criteria apply to expenditure on Aboriginal Legal Aid. (3) What (a) sum and (b) percentage of total expenditure on Aboriginal Legal Aid was spent in each year since its inception on matters not directly connected with defending legal cases involving Aboriginal persons. (4) With respect to what matters other than those referred to in part (3) are Aboriginal Legal Aid funds spent.",63
71,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,TOTAL,"The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The amounts spent on Aboriginal Legal Aid each year since ATSIC' s inception are: 1990/91-$18.4m; 1991192-$19.8m; 1992193$28.7m; 1993/94-$29.2m; 1994/95-$31.2m; 1995/96--$30.6m The amounts provided reflect all legal case costs and also include capital and normal running costs such as rent, employee salaries and costs of vehicles, electricity etc. (2) Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander funded organisations are required to expend grant funds in accordance with standard, supplementary or special conditions as spelt out in the annual Letter of Offer to organisations and procedures set down in the Grant Funding Procedures Manual. (3) The (a) sum and (b) percentage of total expenditure on Aboriginal Legal Aid spent in each year since ATSIC' s inception on matters not directly connected with defending legal cases involving Aboriginal persons is approximately: Year Amount 1990/91 $1.28m 1991192 $1.40m 1992/93 $2.00m 1993/94 $2.00m 1994/95 $3.20m 1995/96 $2.93m Funding not directly connected to defending legal cases is spent on Law and Justice prevention and education projects ego the publication of the Aboriginal Law Bulletin and the employment of prison liaison officer; and Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody recommendations monitoring by way of grants to State and Territory Governments. There are also costs associated with representing indigenous peoples interests in a national and international context and funding provided to two legal service secretariats. (4) Nil. Employer Organisations and Individual Companies: Commonwealth Financial Grants (Question No. 300) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, upon notice, on 30 May 1996: (1) Did the Minister's Department, any agency or statutory authority for which the Minister has portfolio responsibility, or their predecessors, approve or make available grants or other forms of financial assistance in (a) 1993-94, (b) 1994-95 and (c) 1995-96 to (i) employer organisations or (ii) individual companies; if so, in each case, (A) what was the name and address of the recipient, (B) what sum was involved, (C) what was the purpose of the grant or payment, (D) under what program was it made, (E) who approved the payment, (F) what acquittal requirements applied to the grant or payment and (G) is acquittal outstanding. (2) Has the Minister's Department, any agency or statutory authority for which the Minister has portfolio responsibility, or their predecessors, approved or made available, or will it make available, grants or other forms of financial assistance in 1996-97 to (a) employer organisations or (b) individual companies: if so, in each case, (i) what is the name and address of the recipient or prospective recipient, (ii) what sum is involved, (iii) what is the purpose of the grant or payment, (iv) under what program is it being made, (v) who approved it and (vi) what acquittal requirements apply. Mr Moore-The answer to the honourable Percentage member's question is as follows: 7 (1) and (2) Some of the information sought by 7 the honourable member has previously been tabled 7 in Parliament in the Annual Reports of relevant portfolio agencies and in annual returns relating to 7 individual bounty schemes. 10 9.5 To provide the remaining information sought by the honourable member would require the diversion and expenditure of a significant level of resources in my Portfolio. I am not prepared, at this time, to authorise any such diversion of resources. Pensioners' Investments: Deeming Mr Anthony asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 30 May 1996: (1) Will the Government alter the system of extended deeming of pensioners' investments due to come into effect on 1 July 1996; if so, how. (2) Is the system of extended deeming applied on the premise that a high rate of return is an investment's only priority. (3) Is it a fact that the extended deeming system disadvantages many persons with investments earning less than 5 per cent per annum and such persons are unlikely to reinvest their funds because the charges involved would not warrant the transfer. (4) Will the deeming system be altered to recognise that investment decisions are sometimes made on nonfinancial grounds and long term investments can have historical or emotional value which outweighs a poor rate of financial return. Mr Ruddock-The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) I will monitor on an ongoing basis the impact of the extended deeming arrangements, so that I can consider whether there is a need for any adjustments or enhancements. (2) No. Deeming is based on the principle of expecting people to get a reasonable return on their 'investments before turning to the community for support. Deeming encourages people to think about the returns their investments are generating. The deeming rates are set in the light of prevailing market rates of retm,; on stable, low risk inves(ments so that pensioners can achieve investment returns at the deeming rates without risking their capital. (3) The level of fees and charges that people incur in rearranging their portfolios to match the deeming rates are relatively low. The enhancement of existing at-call pensioner accounts will reduce the need for people to rearrange their investments. The majority of pensioner financial investments are held in deposits with financial institutions, and most pensioners who wished to change these deposits could do so without charge, except in some instances where they may incur State taxes on withdrawals. However, being able to earn a higher rate of interest will benefit pensioners overall. In any event, if investments are earning below 5 per cent, people may have good reason to retain them. For example, there may be tax advantages from the investment, or the investment may be a more volatile investment which is expected to return much more than 5 per cent as an average over a number of years. Therefore, people should (Question No. 312) not only consider the Social Security implications of an investment. (4) See the answer to (2). War Widows Receiving Age Pension (Question No. 313)  Security, upon notice, on 30 May 1996: (1) How many war widows who are ineligible for a war widows' pension receive an age pension. (2) What would it cost the Commonwealth to transfer the pension recipients referred to in part (1) from the age pension to a war widows' pension. Mr Ruddock-The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Most war widows receiving an Age or Invalid Pension from the Department of Social Security (DSS) were transferred to the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) in 1995. From 20 March 1995, war widows and war widowers became eligible for an income support allowance from DV A equivalent to the rate of Age or Invalid Pension they were entitled to receive from DSS. It was estimated that some 54,000 war widow pensioners formerly assisted by DSS would transfer to the DV A allowance and that in future years a further 5,500-6,000 war widow pensioners per year would remain with DV A when they reached Age Pension age. At the time of the transfer 2,302 war widows formally elected to continue to receive their income support through DSS and continue to receive Age Pension in addition to their War Widows' Pension. A second measure also commencing on 20 March 1995 provided for widows/widowers of DV A service pensioners (i.e. people whose partner's death was not considered to have been may war related), and also their separated wives, to be paid by DV A. The length of time between the death of former service pensioners and the announcement of the initiative made it difficult to identify customers who may have benefited from the scheme. DV A publicised the change and notified DSS only of those clients who requested a transfer. The measure was estimated to result in some 16,000 DSS customers transferring to DVA. It is not possible to estimate the number of customers who were not identified and remain on Age Pension. (2) Administrative overheads in the physical transfer of recipients from Social Security to Veterans' Affairs payments would be minimal, especially as those in this group have previously declined opportunities to transfer. Charities: Commonwealth Funding (Question No. 328) Miss Jackie Kelly asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 30 May 1996: (1) What grants or other fonns of assistance does the Commonwealth provide to community-minded or charitable organisations in the electoral division of Lindsay. (2) What is the sum of the grant or substance of the other form of assistance provided with respect to each case referred to in part (1). Mr Ruddock-The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The Department of Social Security has not provided any direct grants or other forms of assistance to community-minded or charitable organisations in the electoral division of Lindsay in 1994-95 or 1995-96. (2) Not applicable. Department Liaison Officers: Prime Minister's Office (Question No. 333) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 17 June 1996: How many departmental liaison officers were attached to the Minister's ministerial office at 27 May 1996.",81

Mr Jull-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The AEC has kept me informed of the delays in providing electoral roll data since the 1996 federal election. All sitting members of parliament were provided with a full roll (i.e. download) for their respective electorates following the close of rolls. No supplements (Le. updates) have been issued since that supply for members in the ACT, NSW, Vic, Queensland, WA, Tas or the NT. The AEC has been working on a new system for provision of electoral roll data on CD-ROM since before the election. This new system is nearing completion, and is expected to be released to all members within the next two weeks. Supply of data will recommence with the introduction of this new system. South Australian electoral rolls are managed on a separate computer system from the rest of the country. That system has not been changed to cater for CD-ROM based rolls, on the expectation that the South Australian electoral rolls will be migrated to the national roll management system in the near future. South Australian data will automatically be available on CD-ROM when that occurs. In the meantime, members for South Australian electorates will continue to receive data under the old system. Shipments containing full rolls and monthly supplements to 31 May 1996 were dispatched to South Australian members during the week ending 21 June 1996. Further supplements will be dispatched around the middle of each month, until migration to the national CD-ROM system occurs.
