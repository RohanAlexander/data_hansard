1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. R.G. Halverson OBE) took the chair at 2.00 p.m., and read prayers. NA Resignation J\ilr SPEAKER-Later today I will be tendering to His Excellency the Governor General my resignation as Speaker of the House of Representatives. It has been a great honour to serve the parliament as Speaker and I would like to thank everyone who has supported me in my endeavours in this role. This is not a decision I have taken lightly or without considerable and careful consideration, but it is my decision and mine alone and I am entirely comfortable with it. Thank you.",13
2,Mr BEAZLEY,SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, I do not actually think the matter can be left there. I would like to say a thing or two about your service.",13
3,Mr SPEAKER,SPEAKER,I would be happy for you to do it in the privacy of my office. Mr Reith-I ask leave of the House to move a motion relating to the routine of business for this sitting.,13
4,Unknown,SPEAKER,Opposition members interjecting,13
5,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPEAKER,"Mr Jenkins)Order! The Leader of the House will understand that the Leader of the Opposition was on his feet, had attempted to get the Speaker's eye and, given the circumstances and the confusion, unless he has great objection, I think that the chair would be of the belief that indulgence should be granted.",13
6,Mr REITH,SPEAKER," Mr Deputy Speaker, on indulgence",13
7,Unknown,SPEAKER,Honourable members interjecting,13
8,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPEAKER,Mr Jenkins)Order! I will hear from the Leader of the House.,13
9,Mr REITH,SPEAKER,"Mr Deputy Speaker, obviously there would be members of the House who would like to wish the member for Casey (Mr Halverson) well and to make any other comments they wish to make. In respect of the timing of his particular statement, I was aware of it, as I am told, about five minutes before he went to see the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley). Under those circumstances, we have had no opportunity to speak with members of the opposition about the timing or how we would handle any comments in respect of this matter. The motion which I propose to move is simply in relation to the routine of business for the sitting. As we have the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) coming back from Melbourne with other senior members of the government, we propose to have question time later this day so that we have a full complement to answer questions. As to other matters in respect of the statement made by the Speaker, the timing of it is entirely a matter for him. As to any comments that people will make, that is a matter for you, Mr Deputy Speaker.",13
10,Mr BEAZLEY,SPEAKER,"Very briefly on indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker, you were kind enough to recognise me immediately after the Speaker left the chair. I just want to put down a few remarks of personal appreciation. Indeed, I have been aware for some time 25 minutes now that this was going to occur-the Leader of the House has obviously been aware for 35 minutes, or something approximating that-and I can gather sufficient thoughts in those 25 minutes to at least say one or two words of appreciation of the service of Mr Speaker. I think that Mr Speaker has attempted, within his lights, nobly to be as fair-minded and independent a person that this House is capable of producing, given the party circumstances which inevitably produce a Speaker. He has sought to impose disciplines which, if actually adhered to, would have produced a situation in which, both in question time and more generally in the conduct of the House, that improvement of standards which the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) sought, but which has scarcely been delivered upon, might well have proceeded. I think particularly of his suggestions for the conduct of question time, both in the asking of questions and the way in which they are answered, that he put down during the course of last year. I can say that, though we have breached it on several occasions, we have tried honestly to conform with that. I rather suspect that the government has not. The Speaker did assure me when I spoke to him, as he has said to the House here, that this is a decision by him and him alone. Nevertheless, there will be the thought in the mind of a number of us that he may have had a degree of difficulty with others on the other side of the House. I recollect, in particular, a comment he made last year when he suggested that his skin was getting thicker and thicker. That may well have been due to barbs from this side of the House, but generally speaking I would say it was a situation which he found confronting him that was a worry on the part of the other side. Nevertheless, having said that, I just want to say that it is a sad thing when any person relinquishes his office in this chamber, particularly when he has graced it. Mr Speaker Halverson has graced the position in the two years that he has held it. For us in tion it is a matter of profound regret that he has taken the decision that he has. He was, from our point of view, as any opposition would have it, very much on trial as to his attitude to fairness. While we have had very many complaints about whether or not we have been fairly treated in this place, we have certainly always taken the view that in the way in which he saw things and within his lights he attempted to deal with the opposition fairly and lift the standards of the place. It is a sad day for this House. It is a sad day for members of parliament who believe professionally, irrespective of what our party affiliations might be, that we belong to an honourable profession, one with some centuries worth of tradition. It is a sad day for us when we see depart from our ranks somebody who was at least mindful of those centuries of Westminster tradition that go into the makeup of this House. We wish the Speaker well. We take most immediately at face value the words that he said to us. We take it in the sense that we believe him to be a dignified individual, a prideful individual-a person who is circumspect about the circumstances in which he finds himself and loyal to his old colleagues. We will, however, have our own interpretation on the set of circumstances which has produced this.",13
11,Mr REITH,SPEAKER," Mr Deputy Speaker, on indulgence, in respect of the statement made by the Speaker, can I say that Bob Halverson and I have been good mates since the time we both arrived. Opposition members-Oh!",14
12,Mr REITH,SPEAKER,"It is well known, if it is not well known to the Labor Party, that Bob and I have been mates since he first arrived. In fact, there were a couple of you on that side no longer here, but he used to be the other pair in the billiards competition that Halvo and I used to secretly run in the old house. We had a code for when we felt like a game. If we were not there, the message would come in that it was time for a special committee meeting, which was always the indication that we would meet in the old house in that famous billiard room which, if walls could the opposi- talk, would have much to say. I, for one, will be very sorry to see him leave that position. He has served this parliament with great distinction, not just as a strong and independent Speaker but also as a senior member of the opposition for those many years that we had the privilege of being the loyal opposition. As the Chief Opposition Whip he was a friend, he was an adviser, he was good company; but he was also a most effective political operator. That is a reflection of the fact that the Speaker is a person of very wide experience of life, whose contribution to this country has not just been as a distinguished member of the federal parliament. He served as a member of the Royal Australian Air Force both in Washington for a number of years and in the United Kingdom as an exchange officer with the Royal Air Force. That latter service earned him the high honour of receiving an OBE. He will be very sadly missed as Speaker. He will, as he retires from the parliament in due course, be missed as a representative of the people of Casey. It is also typical, I would have to say, of the Speaker that in making arrangements he should basically make arrangements which dO)lOt-perhaps give us as full an opportunity to present the distinguished highlights of his career. Whilst he was with the Leader of the Opposition at 20 to two or thereabouts, I got a phone call saying that he was going around to tell him matters. There will hopefully, therefore, be an opportunity-I know others would want to have an opportunity, certainly including the Prime Minister (Mr Howard)-to put something on the record about his long service. So, with those few remarks at this point in time, Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank you for your indulgence. NA Motion (by Mr Reith)-by leave-agreed to: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the routine of business for this sitting being as follows unless otherwise ordered: 1. Notices and orders of the day, government business. 2. Questions without notice (at 3.15 p.m.). 3. Presentation of papers. 4. Ministerial statements, by leave. 5. Matter of public importance. 6. Notices and orders of the day, government business. NA NA Motion (by Mr Andrew) agreed to: That the following bills be referred to the Main Committee for further consideration: Insurance Laws Amendment Bill 1997; Telecommunications Amendment Bill (No.2) 1997; NRS Levy Imposition Bill 1997; Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No.3) 1997; Gas Pipelines Access (Commonwealth) Bill 1997; Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Amendment Bill 1997; and Therapeutic Goods Legislation Amendment Bill 1997. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1997 [No.2] Second Reading Debate resumed from 2 March, on motion by Mr Reith: That the bill be now read a second time.",14
13,Mr SLIPPER,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"Owing to certain arrangements concerning the time needed to proceed with the balance of this second reading debate on the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill 1997 [No.2], I will be using only about five minutes of the 15 minutes available to me. At the outset, I would like to place on record my sorrow with the departure of the Speaker. I have the highest personal regard for him. I believe that he has carried out difficult duties under very great pressure from the opposition. He is a person of the highest integrity and he-will go down in history as one of those very fine occupants of the office of Speaker of the House of Representatives. The bill before the House is, as I mentioned in the debate last night, very important. It is being introduced to this place after it was rejected by the other place on 21 October last year. It amends the Workplace Relations Act 1996 so as to exclude new employees of small businesses from the operation of the federal unfair dismissal provisions. The measure is intended to recognise that defence of unfair dismissal claims is disproportionately burdensome to small businesses and to encourage growth in employment in small business by removing a specific disincentive to employment. Over the years since the member for Laurie Brereton introducedMr Kelvin Thomson-You can unfairly dismiss such an employee? Do you think that is right, that they have no rights?",15
14,Mr SLIPPER,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"You really ought to keep quiet, you ought to listen to what we are saying and you ought to change your mind and vote with us so that we are able to create a situation where small business is prepared to put on extra staff. Last night we heard honourable member for Cunningham (Mr into Martin) and the honourable member Canberra (Mr MCMullan) say that this legislation was not needed and that it was unfair and unreasonable, and implying that the current unfair dismissal law was not having an verse impact on employment opportunities. I would like to draw the attention of those opposite to the provisions of the second reading speech in this place for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith). He said there is plenty of evidence that small business does not agree with what the opposition is saying. For instance, referred to the Morgan and Banks 1996 survey which indicated that 16 per cent businesses with fewer than 30 employees been adversely affected in their hiring intenpeople tions by the previous federal government's unfair dismissal law. He pointed out the results of the Recruitment Solutions survey released in April 1997, which indicated that 32 per cent of businesses in metropolitan Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane had been the subject of some sort of unfair dismissal claim in the 12 months covered by the survey. The Labor Party is once again seeking frustrate the attempts by this government make positive change which will create Labor's employment opportunities for many young Australians. Rob Bastian from the Council Small Business Organisations of Australia said that small business would create 50,000 jobs if this bill could go through the Senate. Kate Lahey, Chief Executive of the New South Wales Chamber of Commerce, said: For the Opposition to claim that there has been independent research proving business concern this issue is nonsense-it shows how little attention they have paid to the needs and concerns of the small business community. There is also the New South Wales chamber's own survey showing that 56 per cent of to businesses surveyed said that the prospect unfair dismissal claims had discouraged them from recruiting additional staff to their nesses. So we have all of the evidence lined up on this government's side and yet we find that members of the Labor Party here and particularly their colleagues in the Senate continuing to refuse to see the obvious. on the However, Labor ministers and members come this place professing to be experts in the for area of industrial relations! Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be aware of the appalling inefficiencies on the Australian waterfront which make Australian ports adamongst the most inefficient ports in the - orld. Australian ports are 25 per cent more expensive to use than Auckland and twice as expensive as Tauranga, New Zealand's most by the Minister competitive port. The Labor Party were in office for 13 years, they did absolutely nothing effective about the he waterfront, they brought in industrial relations reforms which made it more difficult for of people to be prepared to put on staff and, had what is more, having been rejected by the at the election in 1996, they have not learnt-one might have thought they would have by now-and they continue to seek to frustrate the attempts by this government to sweep up yet another mess left to us. We did not create the problemMs Gambaro--No.",15
15,Mr SLIPPER,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"But we are determined to fix it. I know the honourable member for to Petrie is happy to join other members on the to government benches in helping to fix up mess. It is absolutely appalling that this government, having been elected to of office, is being prevented from implementing its intention to exempt from the federal unfair dismissal laws small businesses employing 15 or fewer people with respect to new staff members. This law will not affect any existing staff member of small business, but, we no are determined to remove any remaining log on jam so that we will be able to give incentives to small businesses to grow, invest and put on staff. At this late stage, I appeal to those opposite encourage their colleagues in the Senate to of support this legislation and give new opportunities to people to put on staff and to those busion the dole queues to get one foot onto the employment ladder. If those opposite adhere to their existing intentions, there is no doubt that this will become a double dissolution are trigger. We do not want a double dissolution this issue, but we will not hesitate to bring this bill before a joint sitting after an election. We believe that this is one more item of Labor's mismanagement which has to be fixed up. I commend the bill to the House.",16
16,Mr WILTON,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"When the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) says 'we believe', we all know what he means. Indeed, he has been a member of both the National Party and the Liberal Party, so the royal plmal is aptly used. The Workplace Relations Amendment Bill 1997 [No.2] should, by and large, not be introduced. There is simply no need for it. It is nothing more than a political stunt which will achieve nothing positive in improving industrial relations in this country. It will also do nothing for jobs growth. It is just another ongoing assault by this government directed fairly and squarely at the hearts of Australian workers. The government has decided to attack the rights of those workers. It has been engaging in this assault since its election just over two years ago. Let us examine briefly the effects of the government' s Workplace Relations Act and what this act has done to Australian workers. First and foremost, it has removed the power of the Industrial Relations Commission-the independent umpire-in the same way that it has removed the independent umpire here in this chamber this afternoon. In no less heinous an act, where it coerced, the Speaker resigned. In many similar ways it has sought to undermine the Industrial Relations Commission which has acted for many years as an effective and independent arbitrator on the matter of workplace relations in this country. Workers will now have to bargain directly not only to secure decent wages but also to secure decent conditions. This act also requires the Industrial Relations Commission to set nothing more than minimum wages. Furthermore, it undermines the award system as a highly effective safety net for wages and conditions for workers. Enterprise bargaining will now be the main way by which wages and conditions will be determined. For the first time it also allows individual employment bargaining and highly secretive individual contracts. This means that workers will find it more difficult to be represented by unions in their bargaining and negotiating with employers. Furthermore, the act introduces a range of new penalties and punishments for industrial action by unions which, when involved in legitimate industrial activity, can now be penalised by both common law damages and significantly hefty fines. It is clear that their track record of looking after Australian workers and ensuring, as it said time and time again during the campaign two years ago, that no worker would be worse off, stands shabby. This piece of draconian legislation will do nothing to improve the government's track record in this area. There are a number of arguments against the widening of the small business exemptions for unfair dismissals in the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill 1997 [No.2]. The way the law currently stands 'is that any employer can dismiss an employee within three months of their starting employment and the employee has absolutely no effective redress through the unfair dismissal law. That really should be enough. Shouldn't a decent employer know after three or four months whether or not a new employee is suitable? Shouldn't that be a sufficient probationary period to determine an employee's appropriateness to work in a particular position for which they have been selected? We do not need these small business exemptions. The government's position on this issue is not at all clear. It has chopped and changed on a number of occasions. In fact, it does not really know what it wants in this important area. These unfair dismissal laws were extensively amended by the government's Workplace Relations Act. Those changes came into effect on 1 January last year. We have heard that both the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) had bestowed praise in copious quantities upon their new rules which would be a panacea for the issue of unfair dismissal in our great country. What the government is proposing to do with the legislation before the House now is to create an exemption to the government's own unfair dismissal laws. This is totally inconsistent with its overwhelming praise for its previous wonderful legislation about unfair dismissal. These laws will do nothing to improve the employment opportunities nor job security for Australians. Far from that, they will make Australians simply easier to sack. This proposed exemption is, by and large, inconsistent with the government's own pre-election undertakings, wherein it said that at no time prior to the election did the coalition foreshadow an exemption from small business to these unfair dismissal laws. The Sydney Morning Herald reported quite to the contrary on 20 February 1996. It stated: The coalition has flatly ruled out any exemption for small business in its redrafted unfair dismissal despite a plea that the sector should not be subject to the same treatment as 'the big end of town' ... I guess that is just another broken promise. Mr Kelvin Thomson-They ruled it out.",17
17,Mr WILTON,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"That was indeed ruled out. While we are talking about broken promises on industrial relations, let us again re-examine the coalition's pre-election commitment that, as I said before, no worker will be worse off. Let us look at what is happening in one particular area-the hospitality industry. The government is pushing in that area a full scale slashing and burning of the award system which has worked so well, to the point where we may now see casuals being forced to endure a 25 per cent cut in pay and their public holiday being additionally cut. The workers in the liquor trades industry have had to resort to paid advertising to inform the public just what is happening in their industry. I am a Victorian. I have seen at some length over recent years just what the Kennett government did to the rights of Victoria's workers. It could be construed as nothing less than a wholehearted and full-scale award rights demolition. There is no doubt that workers in this country have been treated with contempt by this government. Its industrial relations policy could best be described as nothing more than a sick joke. Given the current track record of this government, it is no surprise in many ways to find that the legislation before the House today will only add to job insecurity, as I have previously stated. About two million workers now being protected against being unfairly dismissed-two million workers employed by small business-will now lose that important protection. Of course, subsequently they face a much less secure future. Let us look at some particular facts of this matter in some more detail. The proposal that the government is submitting to the House does not distinguish between unfair dismissal claims on the merits of the case. Instead, it just distinguishes between claims on the basis of the size of the employer. The small business exemption will discriminate against employees who work in small business. They laws, just will not have the same protection. In no way will they have the same protection from unfair dismissal as do their counterparts who work in larger businesses, that is, businesses with over 15 employees. It is not only the employees who will suffer, because I am sure many decent, honest and committed employers in small business do the right thing by their employees. Those employers will have to compete against other operators, often in the same industry, who are seeking to gyp the system, they being shonky operators who know that they can get away with treating their employees with contempt and like dirt. The unfair dismissal exemptions will protect only those less dedicated, shonky operators. The proposal before the House may well indeed prove to be a significant disincentive to growth within the small business sector. Indeed, if a business currently employs 14 people and wants to expand by employing a couple of new people, will that mean that the business will then have to comply with the unfair dismissal legislation? Or will it mean that some employers who want to avoid complying with the unfair dismissal law might create artificial employment agreements by simply splitting their work force up into smaller units of less than 15 employees, thereby effectively escaping and evading the unfair dismissal laws because the companies they have set up under the act will be deemed small businesses? This is going to add to the legal complexity that many businesses already face-something that would be acknowledged by members on both sides of the chamber. Of course, this bill has nothing with the issues that the government needs to be addressing; and we all know those issues well. They are issues such as boosting employment opportunities, encouraging business investment, boosting job security for working Australians, and ensuring that a worker gets a decent day's pay for a decent day's work. This bill has nothing to do with any of those important things. Those are issues that the government should be addressing, but it is not. It should not be addressing this issue of exempting small businesses from the unfair dismissal laws, because, contrary to the exhortations of those opposite, no-one in the small business sector that most of us speak to ever mentions the issue of unfair dismissal and the current laws which surround it, which legitimately and fairly apply to all business, large or small, ever mentions the fact that those unfair dismissal laws are in any wayan impediment either to the operation of their small business or to their incentive to attract and employ new staff. I am not just saying this because I sit on this side of the House. I am saying this because that is what business operators in my electorate and my colleagues who talk to operators in their electorates tell me, that is, unfair dismissal law reforms are not a high priority for small business operators. In surveys undertaken of small business, unfair dismissals and the impact of those laws upon the viability of small business ranked very low or, indeed, in some surveys did not rank at all. In fact, a recent Morgan and Banks job survey-a survey of no small sample size, being of some 3,500 business organisationsrevealed that 80 per cent of small businesses did not believe that the existence of unfair dismissal laws affected in any way their decisions to employ new staff. Only 16 per cent of small businesses employers believed that they would benefit from the proposal to exempt them from the unfair dismissal laws, because they know that the three-month probationary period is sufficient for them to determine whether or not any new employee is a suitable person to perform the task they really to do are required to perform. In addition, these statistics were basically the same for all other sizes of business, indicating that the unfair dismissal laws are of no particular or special concern to small business and small business operators. A recent Yellow Pages Small Business Index showed that a meagre five per cent of small businesses are concerned about industrial laws, whilst 84 per cent are more concerned that lack of government action has failed to get the economy moving. I draw your attention, Mr Deputy Speaker, to the fact that there is no minister at the table.",18
18,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,Mr Jenkins)There should be a minister at the table. The minister is returning. I thank him for his spritely assistance. .,19
19,Mr WILTON,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"An ACCI survey ranked or dismissal laws a distant seventh out of eight as the main impediment to employment. It was well behind lack of sales, a weak economy and lack of profitability. That is what small business is telling the government. But the government simply is not listening. The government is also suffering from selective memory loss. On radio this statement was made: Look, our position's very clear. If you've been unfairly dealt with at work, then you should have a right of appeal. The proposal before the House fairly and squarely negates that promise. It simply must not have been a core promise. This government is telling workers that they basically have no rights at all if they work in a small business. I would like to remind the Prime Minister of yet another promise he made when he was in opposition. He said: ... I'm not going to have a law where an unreasonable employer can capriciously sack a decent, hard-working employee. Of course, at that time he did not tell us that if you are a small business owner the rules will not apply to you. Mr Charles interjecting- .",19
20,Mr WILTON,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"The member for La Trobe will have 20 minutes to defend the Prime Minister's comment in that regard in light of the bill that is now before the House. It is interesting that the coalition told us that would govern for all of us, but I guess 'all of us' does not include the thousands and thousands of Australians employed by small business, which is coveted by those opposite and, indeed, those on this side of the House as by and large the engine of the Australian economy. We on this side of the House do not believe that an employee's right of appeal against unfair dismissal should be determined on the basis of who they work for or, indeed, the size of the employer with whom they are employed. That is not fair. It is not the Australian way of doing things. Those on this side of the House and I will continue to oppose the bill on the principle that it is unfair, that it is unneeded and that it is an unwarranted attack on the rights of Australian workers-rights which, despite the government's exhortations of working for all of us and that no worker will be worse off, continue to be diminished under this government.",19
21,Mr CHARLES,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"I rise to support the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill 1997 [No.2]. It seems clear, at least to me, that the engine of growth for the Australian economy is indeed our small businesses. Without small businesses, we never get to medium size businesses or to major industry. There are a lot of obstacles that we place the way of small business. The member for Isaacs (Mr Wilton) carried on and on about what small business wants the government to do, that small business wants this and small business wants that and that they do not want the unfair dismissal rules changed. Let me tell you that it seems to me to be the height of hypocrisy for a member of the Australian Labor Party, now in opposition in this parliament, to stand up here and talk about the needs, the desires and the wants of small business. For 13 long, hard years the Labor Party never once in government made a move to assist small business. The member for Rankin (Mr Beddall), when Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, brought down a report on small business and recommended a heap of changes they to the law in order to give small business a fair go against large business. Do you know what happened to that report? It got shelved, along with subsequent reports. It took a coalition government in fact to make changes that are now in process in the legal system to give a fair break to small business-to give them a hand. That is not what the Australian Labor Party was all about. So do not come in here and lecture us about what small business needs and wants. The member for Canberra (Mr MCMullan), in talking about this bill last night, said: It is a tawdry little political exercise. The sadness is that, if the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill 1997 [No.2] is passed and it achieves the objectives its advocates claim, the benefit to this community will be very low. I do not know how on earth the member for Canberra would know that. He seems to think that the benefit to the community will come only in economic terms-at least, that is what he implied in subsequent remarks to this bill. I view the bill as being of major benefit to small business. Forgetting about the economic benefits, it generates employment opportunities for unemployed Australians. If you think that that is not a major benefit when Australia still has major unemployment, when we need business, industry, science and technology employing people and we need to build in dynamic new jobs to give all Australians a chance, then you are sadly mistaken. It is certainly true that small business has. the capacity to hire more people. Lately we have seen a resurgence in consumer spending patterns, which tells us that consumers are now willing to part with more of their dollars. They are more comfortable with the state of the economy. They are more comfortable with the future. That is positive. But we need to remove as many straitjackets as possible from the operation of small businesses to give them a better chance to compete. This business of unfair dismissal is something we ought to look at seriously. I do not know who the member for Isaacs talks to, but I have talked to heaps of small businesses in my electorate and, indeed, others right around Australia. An issue that is brought to my attention constantly is employers' fear of the long bureaucratic process associated with removing an employee whom they find unsatisfactory for whatever reason. If an employer has an employee who is unsatisfactory-their productivity is poor, they do not get along with their workmates or their efficiency is rotten-there are many ways that an employer can continue to operate in this manner. Without the employer having the benefit of a large human relations staff and the procedures and paperwork to go with it, the employer may find it very difficult to ask the employee to leave. If the employee is happy to stick with the job, notwithstanding the fact that the employer finds them unsatisfactory, the employer is stuck. Many employers say to me, 'I do not have the right to dismiss an employee because they are totally inappropriate for the job that I have given them. But, if that employee leaves me, all. he needs to do is say, ""I'll give you one week's notice, and I'm off."" Then I've got to go through the whole hiring procedure of finding someone else, training them and trying to integrate them into my operation. Why don't I as a small business person have the same rights as the employee? If the employee can leave me with all but no notice, why is it that I must retain the employee forever without due course?' It is a question that I am asked frequently, and I find some difficulty in answering that question. It seems to me that the procedures the government is intending to put into place with this bill-assuming that the Australian Labor Party wakes up and finally acquiesces and lets it pass through the Senate-are fair and reasonable, that is to say, you cannot illegally dismiss an employee. You cannot say to an employee, 'Because you are now pregnant and you are going to have a child, I am going to dismiss you.' You cannot say to an employee, 'Look, I made a mistake. I should not have hired a black person; I should have hired a white person, so you are sacked.' Mr Kelvin Thomson interjecting",20
22,Mr CHARLES,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"That is a load of rubbish! You cannot say to an employee if the employee refuses to do something that is illegal, 'I'm going to sack you,' because it is illegal. That still remains in the legislation. What we are saying is that if an employer finds an employee does not meet their requirements and will not work efficiently or productively, then the employer can, with due notice, replace that employee with someone who wants to work. Let me ask you this: with the hundreds of thousands of people out there who want a job and cannot find one and who would be hard working employees, where is the fairness and equity in one who does not really want to work-who only wants the money-taking the place of someone who wants a job, wants to work and wants to be productive? I say to you that it is demonstrably unfair. It is true that the more rules and regulations we create th-t surround this area of employment, the more obstacles we put in place for people to employ other people and the higher we build the wall of protection, the less real protection people have. All we do is help keep those who have jobs in their jobs. Look at the dispute on the waterfront-the business of the MUA. That is another area that the Labor Party does not want to talk about. They do not want to talk about the dispute on the wharves at Webb Dock in Melbourne. Why don't they want to talk about it? They do not want to talk about it because the Australian public knows that there is a monopoly in terms of labour on the wharves in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth, and they do not think that is fair. Teachers in my electorate, who think that they are working their backsides off, believe that they are worth more than they are being paid, and I do not disagree with them. They are worth more than they are being paid, and they are being paid half of what the wharfies are paid. They work much longer hours than the wharfies work and, (would say, under even more difficult and trying conditions-dealing with some of the social problems that our teachers deal with in schools today. There is a parallel for you, Mr Deputy Speaker. The Australian Labor Party will stand in this place and argue that this is unfair legislation because it intends to retrench the rights of existing employees. They believe that the waterside workers and their union have not only rights to their jobs but also monopoly rights from which they can extract monopoly rents, and I do not think that is fair. I do not think the Australian public thinks it is fair. I do not think business thinks it is fair. I do know anybody who thinks it is fair, except the ACTU, some other union heavies and the Australian Labor Party. I do not even think the Australian Labor Party thinks it is fair, they will support the MUA because the MUA supports them financially. An important part of the political structure of the Australian Labor Party is to have the financial support of a powerful, monopolistic, financially wealthy trade union that can extract rents beyond what the rest of the community can take, and that costs all of us money. The only people who make the money are the leaders of the union and the wharfies. The people sitting up in the gallery do not make it because they are paying more for goods and services that they buy in the shops than they otherwise would if we did not have the monopoly position of the MUA on the waterfront. I liken this rent taking to the same situation that we have in small business today where, if an employer finds an unsatisfactory employee and wishes to replace them with one who wants to work but is denied work at the moment, the union wants to deny that worker-the one who really wants to workthe opportunity. Let's get rid of the monopolies. Let's support this bill.",21
23,Mr ROCHER,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"This bill amends the Workplace Relations Act 1996 to exempt businesses employing no more than 15 workers from the unfair dismissal provisions of the act. To understand the bill, it is necessary to consider some elements of the 1996 act. The present government in May 1996 introduced amendments to the industrial relations legislation which were substantially enacted into law on 31 December of that year. In line with its election policy, the coalition's new legislation made significant changes to the existing unfair dismissals regime. The government's proposal, in brief, allows an eligible employee to apply to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, or the AIRC, for a remedy in respect of an allegedly unfair dismissal. The commission is compelled to endeavour to conciliate such a claim. If conciliation is unsuccessful, the employee not may elect to have a claim arbitrated and, if the AIRC decides that the dismissal was harsh, unjust or unreasonable in all the circumstances of the case, the commission may but reinstate the employee or order that the employer pay compensation. In its policy entitled 'Better pay for better work', the coalition described the previous regime as 'far too detailed, too prescriptive and too legalistic and, hence, a disincentive to employment'. The coalition advocated a policy of 'a fair go all round' in an attempt to redress the balance that had shifted in favour of employees. Accordingly, the government's 1996 regime included the following key changes. Whereas previously an employer was required to prove the existence of a valid reason for dismissal, now the Australian Industrial Relations Commission can form its own view on whether a dismissal was harsh, unjust or unreasonable, having regard to all the circumstances of the case. Instead of proceedings being in the Federal Court, they are now heard and determined by the AIRC. The commission is required to deal with matters promptly and with a minimum of technicality. Further, to discourage employees without genuine complaints from making applications, the new legislation imposed a $50 filing fee, with provision for a waiver if the employee was in financial difficulty. Importantly, the AIRC is able to order the employee to pay the employer's costs if an employee unreasonably proceeds with a claim which lacks merit. The power to award costs should filter out complaints lodged purely out of vengeance or greed and with no basis in truth. The cost provisions should also discourage employers from agreeing to settle a claim purely because of the commercial cost of defending it. The government's new unfair dismissal laws provide that if the AIRC decides in favour of an employee, then it must take into account the effect any remedy may have on the viability of the employer's business. The 1996 legislation also provides clearer guidance for employers and employees on the circumstances in which an employer can dismiss an employee without notice and what is meant by the term 'serious misconduct'. Importantly, the act does not prescribe a formal process for dismissal, in contrast to old Industrial Relations Act, which placed too much emphasis on the process by which a dismissal was carried out. The 1996 act simply requires a fair go all round. This means that, while the AIRC will take procedural fairness into account, an otherwise fair dismissal will not become unfair merely because of a technicality. Further, the 1996 act makes it clearer that an employee will be excluded from the protection of the unfair dismissal laws if the employer has clearly set down a probationary period of three months or less. That means that employers can hire employees for a thteemonth probationary period and be confident that, if the employee's work is unsatisfactory, he or she can be released without the employer risking an unfair dismissal claim. Employers can set longer probation periods, if necessary, but they may later have to satisfy the AIRC that the period was reasonable. As for casual employees, the 1996 changes prevented an employee from making an unfair dismissal claim unless he or she had been employed on a regular basis and a systematic basis for more than 12 months. The bill before the House was introduced on 26 June 1997. It was defeated in the Senate on 21 October 1997 and subsequently reintroduced into the House on 26 November last year. The amendments to be made by this bill, if enacted, will provide that an employee--other than an apprentice-who is first engaged by the relevant employer after the commencement of the bill will not be able to make an application on the ground that the termination of his or her employment was harsh, unjust or unreasonable, or on grounds including that ground, if he or she was employed by an employer who employed no more than 15 employees. The exclusion will not affect the rights of existing employees or the rights of small business employees to take action against unlawful termination of employment. The 1996 act distinguishes between 'unfair dismissal' on the one hand and 'unlawful dismissal' on the other. As the minister has noted in his second reading speech, the 1996 act protects employees against dismissal on the the basis of discrimination, against dismissal for engaging in protected industrial action in seeking a certified agreement or in an Australian workplace agreement industrial action. The freedom of association part of the 1996 act prohibits dismissal on grounds contrary to the principle of freedom of association. Another section of the act prohibits dismissal without one to five weeks notice, depending on the employee's length of service and age or pay in lieu, except in cases of serious misconduct. The workers principally affected by this bill are those on federal awards employed in small businesses. However- it does not affect all such workers because the unfair dismissal laws are confined to workers in businesses that are constitutional corporations. Constitutional corporations are foreign corporations and those domestically formed companies that carry on trading or financial activities within the meaning of the constitution. So unincorporated bodies, such as sole traders and partnerships, are not subject to the federal unfair dismissal laws and will, accordingly, not have any benefit or any detriment indeed from the exemption proposed in this bill. Similarly, corporations not bound by federal awards may not need to rely on the proposed exemption as they may not be subject to the federal unfair dismissal laws. The government argues that the reason the exemption is necessary for small business is that those employers face substantial difficulties in dealing with unfair dismissal cases. The minister says that the disruption to the business arising from such proceedings will generally be significant because of the need for the employer to personally attend conciliatibn conferences and hearings as well as any time required to meet with legal representatives. The government says that in larger businesses, which in the context of this bill includes all businesses with 16 or more employees, expertise and resources can be put into termination procedures whereas small businesses have no such resources. In the explanatory memorandum the government states that the benefit for small business is the elimination of possible costs of unfair dismissal claims, including legal expenses, time spent away from the business and the costs of settling claims or paying damages to former employees. The minister's office has not been able to provide me with any details of the average cost involved in defending an unfair dismissal claim but says that the principal cost to small business arises from the likelihood that the employer would have to close his or her business to attend hearings. In his second reading speech the minister cited the results of some new research conducted for the Labour Ministers Council. The research was conducted in conjunction with the latest Yellow Pages Small Business Index survey from 30 October 1997 to 12 November 1997. According to the minister, approximately 1,200 randomly selected small businesses with 19 or fewer employees were surveyed with specific questions on unfair dismissal. Seventy-nine per cent of proprietors surveyed thought small business would be better off if they were exempted from unfair dismissal laws. Thirty-three per cent of small businesses reported that they would have been more likely to recruit new employees if they had been exempted from unfair dismissal laws in 1996-97 and 38 per cent of the businesses surveyed said they would be more likely to recruit new employees if they were exempted from this government's unfair dismissal laws. The minister admits that the government's changes to the unfair dismissal laws have not gone far enough for many small businesses. In his second reading speech he states: It is an unavoidable fact that the defence unfair dismissal claim, however groundless, is especially burdensome for small business. He adds: The Yellow Pages survey confirms the difficulties that even the government's new provisions cause for those small businesses who experience an unfair dismissal claim: not just the cost of settlement, where that occurs, but the time and location of hearings, stress, costs to businesses in lost time, disruption to working relationships and the costs of defending the application. The minister continues: And the Yellow Pages confirms the terrible pall that the fear of those difficulties casts over small business employing intentions, even amongst businesses which may not have themselves experienced a claim. The minister describes this bill as an entirely reasonable initiative that sends a clear and simple signal to small businesses that they can again hire new employees confidently. The minister has said on other occasions that the small business community is in need of some encouragement and an incentive to give people jobs. This statement has been generally endorsed by small business groups which have a variety of views about the problems with the unfair dismissal system. The bottom line seems to be that small business is seeking a signal from the government that will give it renewed confidence to take on new employees. Mr Kevin Redfern, the Director of Industrial Relations at the Victorian Automobile Chamber of Commerce, representing 4,000 small businesses in Victoria's retail automobile industry, says that concerns about the unfair dismissal laws make his members have second thoughts about offering people jobs. Mr Redfern says that, if a small business person has an unsuitable employee, the restrictions imposed on him or her under the current laws put their business and the jobs of the other people they employ in jeopardy. Mr Derek Graham, the Chief Workplace Relations Adviser at the Australian Business Chamber, spells out another specific concern. He says that small businesses would be more willing to engage employees if they knew that in the first 12 months in the event of dismissof an al for unsatisfactory work the dismissed employee could have no recourse against his or her former employer. Mr Graham says this is the real problem for small business and that to limit probationary clauses to three months or six months is inadequate. The Executive Director of the New South Wales Employers Federation, Mr Garry Brack, is reported as saying that the Reith unfair dismissal laws have not really come to the aid of small businesses as intended. He says that thousands of small businesses are traditionally not incorporated and therefore do not come within the new laws anyway. Mr Don Armstrong, the Deputy Chairman of the Small Business Coalition, does not point to any specific provisions of the government's legislation that pose particular problems for small business. Mr Armstrong, though, says that his group objects to small business being subject to the unfair dismissal laws at all, principally because of the magnitude of the compensation that can be awarded against an employer in a successful action. Senator Alston quotes the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry as having welcomed the proposed exemption on the following basis: It would directly address the evidence in surveys of business views on unfair dismissal legislation that these legislative requirements adversely affect employers' decisions to employ. On the other hand, the reality appears to be different from the perception across government and business. Objectively, there has been a dramatic decrease in the number of federal unfair dismissal claims since the 1996 act came into force on 31 December of that year. According to the government's own figures, between 31 December 1996 and 3 October 1997 there were 5,222 federal claims about termination of employment. According to the government's own figures, between 31 December 1996 and 3 October 1997 those claims mounted up and they compare with the claims in the corresponding period in 1996 totalling 11,196-11,196 in the previous period down to 5,222 under the provisions of the 1996 act. This represents a 53 per cent decline in the number of federal applications. These figures had been accepted by the Australian Democrats and the Labor Party before the latter finalised its most recent industrial relations policy with its troglodytic abandonment of its own reformist 1993 policies of decentralisation and workplace bargaining. Heaven help the Australian people and the peace process if the Beazley-Kernot party ever gets elected. But I digress. The vast majority of unfair dismissal claims are now being settled at the conciliation stage. The number of complaints withdrawn before a hearing has risen from 19 per cent to 27 per cent and fewer cases, only 20 per cent, are going to full arbitration. Several conclusions may be drawn from all these observations. The government's own unfair dismissal legislation may be inadequate. It does not appear to draw a proper balance between the rights of employee and employer in small businesses to the same extent that it does elsewhere in the sector. This conclusion is drawn from the evidence of the dramatic reduction in unfair dismissal claims together with the government's firm statements that the laws are not working for small businesses. If the government's unfair dismissal laws are faulty, I would ask the minister to explain when he sums up this debate why the government is not proposing to amend them in order that they can be effective across the entire business sector. Alternatively, if the government is of the view that its unfair dismissal regime puts so great a burden on small busi. ness that the only answer is to provide a special exemption, it is worth examining the effect that the laws have on the so-called big end of town. It may be the case that larger enterprises, those employing 16 or more workers, should also be exempt from the laws. Alternatively, there may be no need for an exemption from the government's new laws for small business. For the constitutional reasons I have already dwelt on, most small businesses may not even be affected by the federal laws. To them an exemption would be meaningless. (Time expired)",22

25,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,,25
26,Mr FILING,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,When is question time? Mr Warwick Smith-At a quarter past three.,25
27,Mr MAREK,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"I will have another go. Let us make everyone aware that the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill 1997 [No.2] could be the trigger for a double dissolution because this will be the second time it has been presented to the Senate. I hope, for the sake of small business, that when those in the Senate debate this bill for a second time they will have come to their senses and they pass this legislation to assist thousands of small businesses and their future employees. At the outset one may have considered be a topic the Labor Party would know something about. Today let us question their credibility on the topic. Do they really underlong stand what is trying to be achieved with legislation? On industrial relations, in general the Labor Party would be well aware of the mass exodus of union members away from the Labor Party membership in particular, the last nine to 10 years. 'Why has this happened?' many would ask, unless they were at the coalface in the union movementwhich, as a coal miner, I was. Unlike many of the people who espouse to be truly representative of the union movement, those in the opposition are not unionists; they are merely puppets to the ACTU. I think it is time we had this, particularly in relation to the pilots' strike. This is one example that particularly comes to mind. Talk about being sold out by the Labor Party! Being a pilot and being the union movement, I knew exactly what the effect would be on the pilots in this situation. What an absolute joke. You pay the union fees, you go out to help the ALP-and what do they do for you? They sack you. You pay union fees for yonks and then you are out. That is what it is like. It is the hypocritical approach of those in the opposition that disgusts the people of this country. moans and complains about small business employers who want to be able to sack people-what a lot of rot-under the unfair dismissal legislation, yet the former ALP govemment",26
28,Mr MELHAM,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"You have been grounded, have you?",26
29,Mr MAREK,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"You are the only one who overseas is grounded with your sense of humour. All these years of work have meant nothing. You sacked your pilot union colleagues. If what happened was not so laughable, it would probably make you cry. Labor took the pilots' dues for years, then sacked them. You wonder why the people want the right of choice on whether to pay union dues which obviously just go to the ACTU and the Labor Party. But it was not just pilots and the mining industry which suffered under Labor, with the workplace models and the enterprise bargaining. What about the meat industry union people it to who lost their jobs at AMH meat works in Rockhampton? They not only lost their jobs but lost holiday pay, leave entitlements and service provisions as well. What did the this Labor Party member for Capricomia do to help those people? She did absolutely nothing-just like our colleagues in the opposition-to help the battlers out there in the past years-in centre of Queensland. On reflection, I ask: what is unfair dismissal? Is it putting someone off because they have been stealing from the cash register or is it sacking someone for stealing your equipment from your business? In both cases, because you did not tell them and put it in writing, you were not allowed to put them off. It is absolutely hypocritical of Labor's role in a close look at this situation. Mr Latham-What situation? Mr - MAREK-Exactly. Someone said to in me the other day that Bob Hawke should put in an unfair dismissal claim for what Labor and Keating did to him-another joke.",26

I would like to take the opportunity to say a couple of things about that. In a discussion we had last night the member for Casey did inform me that he had decided to resign as Speaker. The understanding between us was that the announcement would be made in a manner and at a time of his choosing. I understand that it was made whilst I was absent from the chamber. I take the opportunity to thank the member for Casey for his service as Speaker. I also want to record my thanks to the member for Casey for the tremendous service he rendered to the parliamentary Liberal Party as Chief Opposition Whip over a number of years.

76,Mr HAWKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. For the fifth time. I will ask my question to the Treasurer. What are the implications of today's balance of payments figures for the Australian economy and how do these compare with previous results?",29
77,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Wannon for his question because today balance of payments were released for the December quarter showing a balance on the current account of $5.7 billion. That outcome was slightly better than was expected by the Australian markets, although it does show, as was expected by the government, that the current account deficit over the course of this year will increase. The last two quarters combined show a current account deficit of about $10.4 billion. The government has been forecasting for a full year about $23 billion, and today's outcome is consistent with those forecasts, which would again indicate that over the course of the remainder of tJte financial year the current account is likely to widen in line with that forecast. The current account deficit in particular has been led by strong imports, which is consistent with strong demand in the Australian economy, a matter also revealed by today's retail trade figures, which showed a very strong increase in January 1998 of 2.1 per cent. Over the course of the last decade we have seen on three occasions a blow-out of the current account deficit under Labor's administration: 1986, a current account deficit blowout of 6.6 per cent to GDP; the Keating Labor Party second current account blow-out in 1990 at 6.8 per cent; and the Keating Labor third blow-out in the current account deficit of 6.8 per cent in 1995. Unlike those last three occasions when there was a blow-out in the current account deficit, Australia stands poised in much better shape. In 1986 inflation wasat 9.3 per cent, in 1990 inflation was at 8.6 per cent and in 1995 inflation was at 3.9 per cent. Although consistent with the cycle, the current account deficit is expected to grow this year. Inflation, of course, is substantially better than it was on any of those occasions with an underlying inflation rate of 1.4 per cent. An incident having occurred in the gallery",29
78,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is also consistent with government policy not only to lower inflation but to lower interest rates. Interest rates have been lowered to a level which is the lowest in the last 30 years. Low interest rates are consistent with the government increasing economic opportunities throughout the course of the year for small business, business generally and particularly for home buyers. For the average home buyer on a mortgage of $100,000 a year, this represents a saving of nearly $3,000 a year-as the Prime Minister said yesterday, the equivalent of a $100 per week pay increase for those that are getting the benefits of low mortgages. One hundred dollars per week for the average Australian on the average home would be the salary increase required to get to the situation that they now have because of the government's low interest rate policy. Today's figures on the current account are consistent, as I said earlier, with strengthening demand in the domestic economy. It reinforces, from the government's point of view, the importance of its savings objectives: that this government has to produce savings as a government by producing surpluses in order to attend to Australia's savings needs. Again, today's current account deficit reflects the importance of continuing on with sound structuralchange in the Australian economy, the kind of change that is required in relation to Australia's taxation system. If we want to give our exporters a go on international markets and if we want to help Australian exporters, which of course will go towards making a contribution to solving our current account problems, we should be moving to a taxation system which does not penalise exporters, which does not make them carry the burden of taxes on international markets, which gives them the opportunity that exporters from all over the world who have proper and modem taxation systems have to have their taxes taken out and which gives them a go on an even-handed basis on international markets. That is why this government stands for tax reform: to give those exporters that opportunity, to give this country that opportunity. Motor Vehicle Industry Mr BEAZLEYI understand that the Leader of the House is going to facilitate a suspension motion at the end of question time, and on that basis I will not persist in this matter.",29
79,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That is my understanding.,30
80,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question therefore is to the Prime Minister. Are you aware of Mitsubishi's concern at the implications of Asian economic meltdown, which led them to send 3,000 of their workers on compulsory leave? Have other automotive companies told your government of investment plans to be put on hold? When are you going to snap out of your complacency and put a strategy in place to address this situation? In particular, why have you failed to finalise the new export facilitation scheme for the automotive industry which you promised last June? How many more workers must have their security threatened before your government acts?",30
81,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It takes a special kind of gall from the $23 billion deficit man over there; the man who misled the Australian people month after month and week after week during the election campaign; the failed finance minister who is now the Leader of the Opposition who went around during the election campaign swearing blind that we had a surplus when he knew all the while that we had a deficit of $10.3 billion-as the Treasur- your policy? er pointed out yesterday, in just two years he racked up $23 billion worth of deficit",30
82,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I have a point of order in relation to relevance. My question was quite clearly about the circumstances of the Mitsubishi workers in Adelaide and, in particular, the relationship of the export facilitation scheme-and the Prime Minister who as Treasurer left us with a $26 billion deficit has nothing to talk about.",30
83,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I repeat: it takes a special kind of gall for the man who gave us the highest level of unemployment since the Great Depression, the man who gave us, over two years, $23 billion worth of budget deficit, to now have the nerve to tell the Australian business community that he is going to produce three surpluses if he wins the election. He really is a magician. He is going to produce three surpluses. He is going to spend literally thousands of millions of extra dollars. He is going to give us all income tax cuts. He is going to provide this and that in Mandrake-like fashion in every area of government spending and every area of taxation. I have trawled through the history of the leadership of the Australian the Labor Party. I thought they had had some economically irresponsible leaders in the past, but the way this one has been behaving in recent weeks takes the cake; he absolutely tops the bill. Mr Crean- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. My point of order goes to the question of relevance. He will not meet the Cobar workers. Why will he not defend the 3,000 Mitsubishi workers either?",30
84,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order.,30
85,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am delighted that the honourable member for Hotham makes reference to the motor vehicle industry. I just remind the member for Hotham and the House that, under our government, motor vehicle sales in Australia are at an all-time record high. As a result of the industry policiesMr Crean-What is your target? What is",30
86,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Hotham!,30
87,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"How many hundreds of thousands of vehicles were they able to sell under your government? They have gone up and up ever since we were elected to office. new That is what has happened to motor car sales in this country. They have gone up. They have not stayed flat; they have not gone down. They have gone up. I know you are tremendously unhappy about the $1.8 billion that General Motors is investing. I know you are unhappy about the money that Toyota is investing. The fact is that, under our government, we have given them confidence with our industry policy. They are not only ing more cars; they are selling more cars. They are attracting more investment, far more investment than was ever attracted under your administration.",30
88,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Before I call the next question, I would just like to say to the House that I know it is an exciting time, but we have a responsibility to the people of Australia to conduct this chamber with some decorum. I invite all members to behave as their constituents would like them to behave. Economy",31
89,Mr ANDREW,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister inform the House of the main differences in the economy the government now presides over compared with the economy it inherited from Labor?,31
90,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The differences are not only significant but also require a certain amount of time to recite so that those opposite and those who are listening in have a very clear understanding of how very different the administration of the Australian economy has been under my government. First and foremost, of course, we inherited a deficit of $10.5 billion from the failed finance minister, the Leader of the Opposition. In two years we have pared that back so that there is every prospect when the budget is brought down in May of this year that this country will be once again in the black and the Treasurer and the government will have been able to achieve something that utterly eluded the Leader of the Opposition when he was finance minister in the former government. So we are, first and foremost, on track to achieve a significant underlying surplus in 1998-99. I remind the House that, under the former government, Commonwealth general government net debt increased nearly fivefold to around 19 per cent of gross domestic product in 1995-96. Under the coalition, it is expected that that figure will be cut in half to about 10 per cent in the year 2000-2001. In the last five months of the Labor government, only 48,000 new jobs were created. In contrast, produc- more than 140,000 new jobs have been created in the past five months of the coalition government. Not only have 140,000 new jobs been created but last week my colleague the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs also unveiled a new system for placing unemployed people that will in many cases treble and in some cases quadruple the number of job placement agencies that are available to help the unemployed. The new jobs network system signals a new era of hope and new prospects and a new dawn so far as the unemployed of Australia are concerned. Instead of there being just one agency available to help the unemployed, there will now be something like three or four available. When the Labor Party left office, the headline inflation rate was 3.7 per cent. At the December quarter 1997, Australia's headline inflation rate was negative. We had a headline inflation rate at the end of last year that was the best in the OECD.",31
91,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Eleven per cent is what you left.,31
92,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It was not the second best, the third best or the 10th best; it was the best in the OECD. That is a demonstration of the fiscal rectitude that my government has brought to the management of the Australian economy. Under Labor, variable bank home loan interest rates peaked at 17 per cent in 1989. In March 1996, when we took over, they were 10'12 per cent. They have now fallen to 6.7 per cent. That is the lowest level since the early 1970s. What it means is that, for a family paying a $100,000 mortgage back, that is a saving of $256 a month. That is a saving equivalent to a $100 a week increase in the average wage. So the difference between us and Labor is that the average wage earner has received an interest rate cut which is the equivalent of a wage increase of $100 a week. All of that has occurred in the space of two years. Under Labor's industrial relations system there were only 237 enterprise flexibility agreements approved by the AIRC. Under Labor, we spent $450 million to reform the waterfront, and all that happened was that we went further backwards in the world competitiveness of our waterfront. But under this government, as a result of the reforms that have been introduced by the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, we now have the courageous act of the National Farmers Federation of Australia, which is providing leadership to the Australian business community. Let me take the opportunity of congratulating the National Farmers Federation of Australia for not only powerfully representing the a question? interests of their own constituency but also giving a very fine example to the rest of the Australian business community. For years the business community of Australia has begged for somebody to have the courage to reform the waterfront. Now they have a government that had the courage, with the assistance of Labor's newest recruit, Cheryl Kernot-I repeat that; and thank you, Cheryl; thank you for obliging; with Labor's newest recruit-to change the law to break the monopoly of the Maritime Union on the supply and the recruitment of labour. They also now have in the National Farmers Federation a group of men and women who are prepared courageously in the national interest to take advantage legislation to provide competition on the wharves, to give new hope to people who have lost millions over the years because of the lack of competitiveness and the lack of productivity under the system which the Labor Party encouraged and maintained on foot. The comparisons are very stark, indeed. Let me tell the opposition and let me tell the Australian public that over the months ahead the Australian people will be hearing a lot more about the comparative economic record of my government over the last two years and the deplorable economic record of which the failed finance minister opposite was the principal architect under the Keating government. NA",31
93,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"Mr Nehl)Before I call the next question, I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon members of a parliamentary delegation from the National Assembly of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam led by the Chairman of the National Assembly, His Excellency Mr Non Duc Manh. On behalf of the House, I extend a very warm welcome to our visitors. Honourable members-Hear, hear! Mr Gareth Evans-What about the miners of Cobar?",32
94,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,Do you have NA Current Account Deficit,32
95,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Present are the miners of Cobar as well. You are welcome, to our side anyway. My question is directed to the Treasurer, and it follows the answer he gave to the member for Wannon.",32
96,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,When were you last there?,32
97,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Not so long ago, actually.",32
98,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Move of that on to your question.,32
99,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In 1988. I visited the mine, which is a damn sight more than you have ever done. Treasurer, do you remember the Prime Minister saying on the day you launched your pre-campaign foreign debt truck three years ago that the coalition's 'first priority in government economically will be to tackle the current account deficit'? How can you now explain that in less than two years you have brought foreign debt to an alltime record high of $222 billion, which is $28 billion more than it was when Labor left office? How can you now explain the December quarter current account deficit coming in at the highest level since 1995 when you said on the record during that quarter that the impact of the Asian economic crisis would hardly be measurable?",32
100,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I wasn't quite sure whether you had finished or not. I think your point was that the situation now was nearly as bad as it was in 1995. Is that your point? I think that was your point-that foreign debt is now the worse since 1995. Was that your point? Yes, that was your point. I assume it was worse in 1995 when you were in government. Was that your point? Mr Gareth Evans-How are you going to fix it?",33
101,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What is the point of your question? The point of your question is that we are only a little bit better than you; we are not miles in front of you. Is that the point of the question? Mr Gareth Evans-It is perfectly clear. How can you explain blowing out foreign debt by another $28 billion when you said that you were going to reduce it? How can you explain the current account deficit blowing out in the way that it has at a time when the Asian economic crisis, according to you, was not measurable?",33
102,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will take the subsequent question, too, which is about the Asian economic crisis. I have said consistently that the Asian economic crisis is something that will not be in Australia's interests. Mr Tanner-What a revelation! Mr Latham-You said it could not be measured!",33
103,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,33
104,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,33
105,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am pleased to be of such amusement to the cockies on the front-bench of the Australian Labor Party. We, as a government, have been part of IMF programs for Thailand, Indonesia and Korea. There are only two countries in the world that have done that, and they are Japan and Australia. No other country in the world has been as active as we have been in meeting the financial crisis in Asia; no other country in the world, bar Japan and Australia. We took a lot of criticism about that from various sources, not necessarily the opposition, in the Australian community who said why was it that Australia was taking such an active role in relation to stabilising the Asian financial system. The point I made at the time was this: it was in Australia's interests to have a strong Asia and we will be doing what is necessary in Australia's interests to try to secure Australia's interests in the region. Mr Gareth Evans- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. It goes to relevance. The point of the question is not what the government is now doing to address the Asian crisis but what it actually did before there was an Asian crisis to ensure that we had debt blowing out to $28 billion more than it was when we left office. That was the question.",33
106,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order.,33
107,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is now the third question that he has asked, and I will go to the third question as well. Point No.1: no other government in the world bar Japan's has been as active as this government has been in relation to the Asian crisis. Number No.2: he then asks what did we do before toe Asian crisis. I will tell you what we did, old tiger: we took $10,000 million and determined to tum it into a surplus. And where would we have been if the Australian Labor Party had been building up $10,000 million deficits in relation to the Asian crisis? We had a failed finance minister-Australia's worse finance minister ever: the Leader of the Oppositionwho in two years presided over $27,000 million of losses: I often say: imagine a crowd of 23,000 at the Sydney Cricket Ground and imagine that every one of them stood for $1 million. That is his record: $23,000 million. While he was the finance minister, he racked up",33
108,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I do not know want relevance this has to the question but, given that he is talking about $28 billion of foreign debt, I suppose he could say the same for those people at the Sydney Cricket Ground under him on foreign debt.",33
109,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order.,33
110,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You say what did we do before the Asian financial crisis. We took a $10,000 million deficit and we determined to tum it around. And what did the Labor Party do? The Labor Party tried to stop this process at every tum. It was not enough that they created the crisis; they then tried to stop us solving it. The best thing about it is that were incompetent in doing that, just as they were incompetent in their management in the first place. We as a government sat down and we took the hard decisions-fought all the way by the Australian Labor Party. We decided to put some fireproofing into the Australian economy when Labor said it did not need it. We decided to attend to Australia's budget position when Labor said it was not warranted. We decided to deal with inflation when the Australian Labor Party said they would sue us. You were going to sue us over our agreement with the Reserve Bank for low inflation. Now the Leader of the Opposition wanders up to Sydney and says, 'Hey, guess what the Labor Party policy is now?' The Labor Party policy, after running a decade of deficits-and you ran $23 billion worth-is to· produce three years of surplus. Guess what the Labor Party policy now is on inflation? To endorse an inflation target with the Reserve Bank of Australia. Mr Gareth Evans- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. The question was not about inflation. It was about foreign debt. It was about how he explains $28 billion, which is $1 million for each one of those 23,000 people sitting in the Sydney stadium.",34
111,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order.,34
112,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The question was: what has the government done to address the crisis in Asia? Not only do we have inflation down, not only have we brought the budget back, not only had we overcome the Australian Labor Party but I tell you what else we are going to do: we are going to get a better system of industrial relations in this country. You are against that. You are against any reform in relation to industrial relations. We are going to get a better taxation system in this country. You are against that. You can get up here and talk about current account deficits, but what is your policy? To have indirect taxes on exports sailing out of this country. That is your policy. That is the tax system that you are defending. You are they opposed to Australian exporters being given opportunities on world markets. And why? I will tell you why. This is an opposition that has no policy, no principle, no credibility, no economic literacy, no future and no hope. Natural Heritage Trust",34
113,Mr EOIN CAMERON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, who represents the Minister for the Environment. Does the government have a record of addressing environmental problems on their merits? How does this compare with previous approaches to environment policy?",34
114,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I would ask that you convey my commendation to the outgoing Speaker. I wish him well. In respect of the question by the member for Stirling, I want to say Australia is the second driest continent in the world. That is paralleled by the environmental problems which exist the length and breadth of this land. The coalition government is committed to doing something about it in a very pragmatic and very practical way to help tum the tide. In that regard, I want to bring to the attention of the House a particular example. The asset test-the nub of the arguments which are being pushed by Labor comes from hanging onto the coat-tails of a distinguished publication of this country rather than doing their own homework, but they have come on the· trail-is to examine what happened in Tasmania. I refer to Tasmania because Tasmania is the one state where Labor· has, in terms of area, the majority of representation. In the rest of Australia, the coalition, the Liberal and National parties, is well in front. The asset test with regard to all of this saga is whether the seat of Lyons, the majority of land mass of Tasmania, received more than the average or less than the coalition-held electorates in Tasmania, such as the seat of Bass. That question deserves a thorough answer at this point in this debate. It is a very interesting answer because of the outcome in respect of Tasmania-that one part of the country where one member of the opposition does have some area coverage. What was the outcome? The outcome was that the seat of Lyons received 42 of the 64 electorate specific projects, as opposed to state wide projects. In fact, under the Natural Heritage Trust funding the seat of Lyons received $1.2 million, or around 60 per cent of the allocation for the state of Tasmania. So our bona fides stack up. There is no whiteboard. There is a proper process, and it is vindicated by this example from Tasmania. Your problem is the rest of Australia. The problem is simple enough: the National Party members-the country Liberal members-represent over 90 per cent of the land mass of Australia. My own electorate of Farrer is larger than the entire area represented by the parliamentary Labor Party in this House. That is something you ought to think about. It would help if you did your homework for yourself in relation to these matters. I am even happy to table the breakdown in respect of Tasmania as a gesture of goodwill on this matter. It was at the shadow cabinet meeting in Blackstone, ably chaired by the Prime Minister, that the foundations were laid for the very correct decision to privatise Telstra and provide for Natural Heritage Trust funding. It was a very significant meeting. It has enriched many thousands of Australians and it has gone on to allow us to tackle the environmental problems which exist over the length and breadth of this land. The Prime Minister has carried that policy right through. It is a successful policy, and that is why you do not like it. We will continue with the Natural Heritage Trust funding. It is doing the job. It is starting to do the job a whole lot more in turning the tide. It will include a land and water resources audit of over $30 million. I challenge the member for Lyons to stand up and say whether he has made representations in relation to those projects, 42 of which were approved by Senator Robert Hill and Minister John Anderson. I table the document. Health Insurance",34
115,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am glad we know where the rorting began. My question is directed to the Prime Minister"" Does the Prime Minister recall the following exchange at the launch of his health policy in February 1996: Journalist: What's your target for the number of people who will take out private health insurance? Mr Howard: Well our target is by the year 2000 it should be 40 per cent. Journalist: Sorry, is that 40 per cent moved back in or 40 per cent? Mr Howard: No, no, by the year 2000 it will be 40 per cent. Prime Minister, did you honestly believe then that your taxMr Ross Cameron-I rise on a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. You are quite aware that the standing orders are quite explicit about quoting lengthy extracts from media statements. Are you going to uphold those standing orders in this instance?",35
116,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I always uphold the standing orders. There is no point of order.,35
117,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Prime Minister, did you honestly believe then that your tax rebate policy would increase health fund membership to 40 per cent or, like your health minister, were you deliberately making a claim you knew you could not achieve?",35
118,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If I remember rightly, the deliberate claim that was. made during the 1996 election campaign that was plainly wrong to the person who uttered that claim was when you ran around Australia saying that the budget was in surplus. You actually had the material in front of you. Mr Lee-On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: the Prime Minister was asked a specific question about his undertaking about health insurance rates. He said it would be 40 per cent by 2000. That is the question and that is the answer he should be providing.",35
119,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order.,36
120,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Unlike the Leader of the Opposition, I did not make statements which I knew when I made them were absolutely false. The Leader of the Opposition absolutely knew about the deficit. He knew the statements were completely false.",36
121,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I rise on a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker-absolutely. This has to be a point of order on relevance. The only person who has known of a deficit before an election was him-before the 1983 one. Neither that nor what he is saying has anything to do with",36
122,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order.,36
123,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I know the sensitivity of the Leader of the Opposition on this issue. You know that you said to the Australian people as finance minister that your budget was in surplus and you knew then that it was in deficit. Your Prime Minister knew that it was in deficit and you knowingly lied to the Australian people on that subject.,36
124,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I really must ask for a withdrawal on that, Mr Deputy Speaker. Apart from anything else, it is untrue but it is also unparliamentary .",36
125,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If the Leader of the Opposition is sensitive, I withdraw that and I substitute 'deliberately misled the Australian people.'",36
126,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Prime Minister. Mr Lee-On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: did I hear the Prime Minister accuse the Leader of the Opposition of deliberately misleading and you are allowing that on the Hansard record?",36
127,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, you did not. Mr Lee-He said 'deliberately mislead'. Opposition members-He did.",36
128,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Deliberately decieve-try that! Waterfront Reform,36
129,Mr CHARLES,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business.,36
130,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"So we now can ask, 'Minister, did you deliberately deceive?'",36
131,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Banks.,36
132,Mr CHARLES,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Minister, could you outline for the House the issue at stake over reform of the waterfront? What is the government's response to the positions which have been taken by other relevant parties to the reform process?",36
133,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It seems that the need for reform is obvious to everybody except those on the other side. There have been some very interesting statements about the need for reform, which I think are summed up in the excellent editorial in today's Daily Telegraph. It says: The central and immovable issue in the battle over who runs Australia's waterfront is the massive cost of inefficiency. It isn't the right of union coverage, or the right to start up a new stevedoring company. It is the burden of waste and poor productivity which is shoved on to all Australians. This inefficiency, often appearing as featherbedding, clearly doesn't make life easy for stevedoring companies. It also has become a back-breaking load on all our export industries, and a drain on the household budgets of consumers at home who end up paying for the lurks and fiddles. How true that is. The silence of the Labor Party on this issue just shows how they are bound hand and foot to the MUA. In the face of'the most outrageous rorts and the incredible cost to the Australian economy with jobs and living standards, they sit there mute, completely incapable of saying anything in the national interest, because they have to bow down to John Coombs. What a contrast it makes going back to the pilots dispute. Reading extracts from the pilots dispute would keep any interested politician up all night. This one caught my eye. This is from the Australian on 16 September 1989, and these are the words: The Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, made an impassioned plea to Australia's domestic airline pilots yesterday to abandon their unionwould you believe itand to retum to work for the good of themselves and the nation. What a contrast this makes! The article continues: In a personal letter, Mr Hawke warned pilots the government would not back down and said if they wanted to be re-employed they must sign individual contracts with the airlines. What an unbelievable contrast! Let us go to Mr Beazley on the radio this year. He has hardly stuck his head up on this issue, and no wonder. What an embarrassment he is. He is asked: Mr Beazley, the NFF has not broken any laws. What is wrong with a bit of non-union competition on the docks? He replies: Let me just say, dock reform is important and dock reform progress has been made. How pathetic ! You weak leader; you weak person. Then you are asked: But you have to be a union member to work there. Could you confront that one? Talk about Mr Mealy-mouth, Mr Flim-flam; and his answer to a simple question is: And the MUA is concerned to ensure that they have a capacity to bargain for their membership on the docks. You are pathetic; you are truly pathetic. As an example of the long list of rorts and inefficiencies on the waterfront, it is hard to go past this following example. I raise this example because one of the claims of the Waterside Workers Union is that part of the problem is the management. I do not say that the management are beyond blame. But it is true-as this example shows-that the problem on the Australian waterfront is that the management are not allowed to manage their businesses. The so-called statement by the MUA and the ACTU the other day called for an improvement in productivity, but here is my rort for the day for the House. Last week the MUA pulled a four-hour stop-wor- meeting at Container Terminals Australia Ltd. The stoppage related to the MUA allocating labour. In other words, the management does not decide where you work; the MUA decides where you work. In this particular case, an union officer allocated the company's two best crane drivers to doing lashing work and the company disagreed. So they took out the whole place for four hours because the company wanted the people best able to drive the cranes to actually do that job. It is like a football match. Let us say you might barrack forMr Costello-Matthew Lloyd.",36
134,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Matthew Lloyd is a fullforward. If you have a great full-forward, most weeks you put them in the full-forward position so that they can kick a few goals. What do the MUA do? They take the fullforwards and put them on the half-back flank, they put them in the centre and they put them at full-back. Why do they do that? Because they allocate the work-and this is the rottto make sure that everybody gets a slice of the overtime. It is the overtime culture which means that the place is not run properly, and we have higher costs, higher inefficiency and fewer jobs. Commonsense dictates that the Labor Party in the national interest ought to at least be able to stand up and say they oppose rorts. It shows how you are bound hand and foot to the unions, but you cannot even say that. Health Insurance",37
135,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Why with his record in this area would anyone believe him? My question is to the Prime Minister again to try and get an answer to the previous question. Prime Minister, did you honestly believe when you launched your tax rebate policy, and did you believe again when you implemented it in your first budget, that you would increase health fund membership to 40 per cent? Or, like your health minister, were you deliberately making a claim you knew you could not achieve? Do you still stand, by the way, by that commitment to get it to 40 per cent by 2000? .",37
136,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"- -.:.I assure the Leader of the Opposition of a number of the things. The first of those is that in relation to the health policy, or indeed any of other policies that I put before the Australian public at the last election, unlike you, I did not deliberately mislead the Australian people. I repeat that; I did not deliberately mislead the Australian people. You did. And also unlike you, the coalition is the only side of politics in Australia that is making any serious attempt to defend and improve the Australian health system. In the two years that you have been in opposition you have deliberately embarked upon a policy to undermine public confidence in the Australian health care system. You have deliberately set about destroying and eroding public confidence, having watched the level of private health insurance",37
137,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order which goes to relevance. I would have thought that as they are in government they would accept responsibility. The simple question is does he still stand by that commitment and did he, when he said it, believe it?",38
138,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is no point of order.,38
139,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"When the Labor Party introduced the Medicare system in the early 1980s, the level of private health insurance in this country was 61 per cent. Through a policy of deliberate and malign neglect, that level of private health insurance fell from 61 per cent down to the fifties, into the forties, and by 1990 it had reached a figure of about 39 per cent. It was at that particular time that the former Labor health minister sounded an alarm bell and said, 'Unless we as a Labor government are prepared to provide incentives for private health insurance, it is going to decline further.' The now Leader of the Opposition, the then Prime Minister and the member for Fremantle all got together and decided, 'It is a good thing to drive the level of private health insurance down further because we have an ideological opposition to it. ' Mr Bevis-That's rubbish!",38
140,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They say it is rubbish. If it is rubbish, how is it that when you came to power in 1983 it was 61 per cent and when you lost office in 1996 it was down to about 34 per cent? You deliberately drove it into the ground. You have an absolute gall to attack a government that has at least made an attempt to stabilise the levels. As the health minister said last night, if we had not introduced the rebates that we introduced after the last election, the level of private health insurance would have been a lot lower, and I suppose you lot would have been a lot happier. Iraq",38
141,Dr SOUTHCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. What is the government's response to the United Nations Security Council resolution adopted on 3 March concerning the agreement struck between the United Nations Secretary General and the Iraqi government?,38
142,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Boothby for. his question and recognise his particular interest in many of these important issues. The United Nations Security Council unanimously passed a resolution today Australia time-and 3 March New York time-concerning the situation in Iraq. The resolution first and foremost endorses the agreement concluded on 23 February by the Secretary-General of the United Nations and Iraq and, as the government has done, commends the United Nations Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, for his initiative to secure a commitment from Iraq to comply with its obligations. The resolution makes clear the Security Council's determination to ensure Iraq's immediate and full compliance with relevant Security Council resolutions without conditions or restrictions. The resolution importantly sets out that any violation by Iraq of its obligations will have severest consequences. The council is acting under chapter 7 of the United Nations charter, which envisages the use of force if necessary. The government previously stated its view that there is sufficient basis already under existing resolutions for military action to be taken in support of the United Nations Security Council resolutions. The resolution adopted today reinforces this view. The resolution also states that Iraq's failure so far to comply with its obligations and to allow UNSCOM unrestricted access has delayed the council being in a position to consider a modification to sanctions. That is a very important matter from a humanitarian point of view. Saddam Hussein is to blame for these delays. His obstruction of UNSCOM's work is but one example of his complete disregard for his own people. The unanimous message from the council is that Iraq must comply with the agreement and with the United Nations Security Council resolutions and any failure to do so will result in severest consequences. It remains the government's strong hope that Saddam Hussein will fully live up to the fundamental commitments he has made in the agreement and that resort to force will be averted. It is important to put Saddam Hussein's preparedness to live up to his part of the bargain to the test, and it is for this reason that the Australian government will keep forces in the region to ensure Saddam Hussein understands the resolve of the international communityreinforced by today's Security Council resolution-for full compliance. Commonwealth-State Relations",38
143,Mr FILING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Given the cuts to Western Australia's share of federal grants and the government's failure to remedy the Commonwealth-states vertical fiscal imbalance, what should I tell my constituents in Merriwa, who want urgent improvements to public transport and law and order; my constituents in Kinross, who desperately need a high school; and my constituents in Perth's northern suburbs, who cannot obtain adequate out-of-hours emergency medical treatment?",39
144,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I really do not know what cuts the member is referring to. But, now that you have asked me what advice you should give your constituents, the first piece of advice I would give them is this: for heaven's sake, do not ever vote Labor again federally. If your constituents were to vote Labor at the next federal election, they would put at risk the cut in interest rates worth a $100-a-week increase in wages that they have received under our government. The fact is that Western Australia has been very well treated by my government. The rate of economic growth in Western Australia is very high. During the Australia Day weekend I had the opportunity of spending a couple of days with the Premier of Western Australia, during which I announced a contribution of over $80 million to the Jervis Bay infrastructure project that is going to underpin the oil and gas industries qf Western Australia and provide a marvellous strengthening to its infrastructure. The Western Australian economy is in a very good condition, which is due to the combined effect of the policies of the Western Australian Liberal government and the federal coalition government. So my advice to the constituents of Moore at the next election is to vote Liberal, under no circumstances vote Labor, and retain the Court Liberal government in power and continue progress in a state which is growing at the fastest rate of any state in Australia. Health Insurance",39
145,Mrs ELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. Is the minister aware of recent statements about the private health sector which have been made in the media? Will the minister advise the House of the likely consequences if these views were translated to policies?,39
146,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for her question. There have been. some quite extraordinary comments in the media recently, but one possible good thing has come out of it: at least the Leader of the Opposition has discovered health. The Leader of the Opposition, though, has made the extraordinary statement that his solution to fix this would be to put more money into hospitals. That is a ridiculous statement and shows that he has no understanding of the health system whatsoever. The first point I would make is that that was exactly what was done in the 1993 Medicare agreement. You were such fools that you signed a Medicare agreement that allowed the states to slip the money out of the hospitals, so you were no better off. The second point is that what happens in public hospitals is independent of what happens in private health premiums. Mr Beazley interjecting",39
147,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, you have got to understand there is not a linkage between the two. There might be in your little mind, babbling to yourself, but Modecate will fix that. The third point is that if you have a look at the Industry Commission, the biggest single cause of increases in private hospital premiums is the public to private shift. That public to private shift came as a deliberate result of your 1993 Medicare agreement. 1!-e opposition spokesperson on health has been using words such as 'crisis' and 'deluge', which is extraordinary given that the rate of drop-out in the last six months is actually the best result we have had for 10 years. It is also extraordinary coming from a political party where the former Labor health minister, Graham Richardson, said this: I steered a package through the cabinet but resigned before I could sell it to the caucus. Practically whole package died when I left as the Labor Party had always been a bit biased against private health insurance, and without a sponsor any proposal ... was doomed. If we are in a position today that is of some difficulty, it is because in 1995-96 the health insurance funds lost $122 million. In 1996-97 they lost $113 million. This year, with a bit of luck, they might actually break even. The fact is they have suffered long-term neglect and long-term decline by a party that even its former health minister admits is a bit biased against private health insurance, and this sort of overblown humbug is complete rubbish. Health Insurance",40
148,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question without notice is addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. Minister, do you recall your 1996 budget night press release which states: We are expecting 70,000 high income earning single people and 65,000 couples and families to join health funds as a result of this measure. This alone will increase the participation rate by cent. If you do recall this press release, why did you deliberately deceive the viewers of the 7.30 Report last night when you said, 'Well, I didn't say that.' Is this just another case of your misleading the Australian public or are you going to claim, like you did yesterday, that a bureaucrat wrote your press release?",40
149,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On the issue of 1.5 per cent, it may very well be reached. We are not at the end of the financial year and we will not know until the end of the financial year. It only came in on 1 July 1997, so what you are talking about is nonsense.",40
150,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I have a supplementary question. Does the minister therefore believe that he will produce a 1.5 per cent increase as a result of the measures?",40
151,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I will not accept that as a supplementary question. Work for the Dole,40
152,Mr ANTHONY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs-a very good minister. Young people in my electorate of Richmond have welcomed opportunities to the participate in the work for the dole projects. Mr Fitzgibbon-How many projects did you get, Larry? Mr Crean-Did you get a fence?",40
153,Mr ANTHONY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The government has been very generous. What other initiatives is the government introducing to reinforce the sense of mutual obligation between young people and their communities? What response has the government received to these initiatives?,40
154,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Richmond for his question, and I am delighted to hear that the members of communities in the electorate of Richmond have embraced work for the dole there, as have members of communities around Australia. This government has rebuilt the relationship between young people and their communities in a way that desperately needed to be done. When we came into office we found that a third of young people could not read and write prop1.5 per erly. The apprenticeship system had been almost killed. While he was employment minister, the Leader of the Opposition had the appalling record of pushing youth unemployment up to over 32 per cent. He added to the ranks of the long-term unemployed by 95,000. The Labor Party has absolutely no credibility in this area whatsoever. It despises the unemployed. This government has taken a whole series of actions to build a comprehensive strategy to help young people get back into the work force, to build up their skills and to build up their work enthusiasm and work ethic. At the end of January this year, the Prime Minister made a very important announcement that, from the middle of this year, all young people 'aged from 18 to 24 who have been out of work for six months or more will be expected to undertake some oth""r activity in addition to receiving the dole. This announcement will reinforce and rebuild some very fundamental values in this country. First and foremost, it gives young people the opportunity to take personal responsibility in choosing the activity which will best fit them for the work force, whether it is voluntary work, whether it is part-time work, whether it is work for the dole or whether it is added literacy and numeracy training. The government is also, through this program, rebuilding the support, the sense of mutual obligation, between young people and their communities. Eighty thousand additional work for the dole places will be created over the next four years under this anno""ncement. One of the most important aspects of this announcement is that the government is preparing to provide to young people who have missed out on those crucial literacy and numeracy skills in school a major program of literacy and numeracy training. There will be 48,000 extra places provided over the next four years at a cost of $139 million to get literacy and numeracy training. In addition to this, the Prime Minister announced that the government would be ensuring that there are an additional 8,800 JPET places for homeless and disadvantaged young people. This is a excellent program that the previous government tried to abolish which we have revived, which brings out the very best people in our communities committed to helping young people rebuild their future lives under conditions when they are most distressed. What a contrast this is to the attitude to the unemployed that we see from the other side of the House. The Leader of the Opposition said about young unemployed who were not on work for the dole that they would just continue to lie around in bed. That was his view of young people on 2BL on 12 March 1997. The member for Batman in a press release last week said, 'People will seek to get on welfare even if they have to cheat to get there.' Unemployed people are cheats in the minds of the Labor Party. On 10 February 1997, the member for Batman in a radio interview with Pru Goward said that young people 'just go home and go back to bed or watch TV for the rest of the week'. So unemployed people, in the eyes of the Labor Party, are lazy; they are cheats. You have no regard for the unemployed people in this country. That is why you betrayed through your policies a generation of young people-and that is why this government is acting to restore some fundamental values on which the future of the next generation in this country will be built. Health Insurance",40
155,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. I ask the minister: why have you approved health fund premium increases which hit loyal, long-term older members hardest? ,Dr WOOLDRIDGE-The honourable member obviously does not understand the process under which the government mayor may not be able to approve premium increases. The legislation gives a very limited basis on which premiums can be knocked back. If that that basis is not met, then the premiums cannot actually be disallowed. There has only been one occasion in the last 20 years when a minister has been able to actually disallow a premium increase, and then that was overruled in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. But I do understand the concern that older Australians feel and I do understand why they are angry. For example, in 1985 the former government took away the bed day subsidy; in 1986 they made health funds pay for the difference between the 75 per cent Medicare rebate and the schedule fee; and between 1984 and 1989 the government took away its $100 million a year contribution to the reinsurance pool. The net effect of those three decisions has been to make private health insurance 30 per cent more expensive than it would otherwise be for your constituents. So the message I would give to the people-and, unlike the majority of people on the other side, I do have private health insurance and I understand how frustrating it is when the· premiums go up-is that it is 10 to 15 per cent, probably 18 per cent, cheaper than it would be without the incentive scheme. If you lot ever get in and take it away, premiums will go up overnight by 18 per cent. Small Business",41
156,Mrs JOHNSTON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. Minister, is the government implementing reforms in the franchise industry and taking a leadership role on retail tenancy issues for the benefit of small business? How do these reforms compare to previous reforms, when will small business in my electorate of Canning benefit from these reforms?",42
157,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Canning for her question. She is a great fighter for small business. I recognise her tremendous commitment to ensuring a fair deal for the small business community. I am delighted to be able to say that we are leading the charge when it comes to providing a better deal for the small business community. This week it seems that every day there is some additional benefit which we are putting in place for the small business community. Yesterday we had the extension of the banking industry ombudsman scheme. That is a fantastic boost for the small business community, and it is one in which we took the lead. In respect of retail tenancies, that is another area where this government has taken a lead. I must say I am very disappointed at the member for Cunningham's complete lack of understanding of what we are actually doing. It is bad enough that they did nothing for 13 years, but now they oppose what we are doing only to find that they do not even understand the extent and the magnitude of the changes that we are making. Yesterday he said that we had failed to deliver uniform retail national tenancy legislation. That was never our objective. We do not want two sets of legislative schemes, federal and state, for retail tenancy. Nothing could be worse, nothing could be more costly and more burdensome for the small business community. So what we have done is set out-we set them out last year-a set of principles which ought to underpin the approach which is taken by the state parliaments. That has been a very successful approach. It is a long road, but we are effective, we are pushing this agenda. As the member for Canning has said, we are committed-and the member for Cowan backed her up. We took this to the meeting of ministers and parliamentary secretaries last year, and this is what the communique said that the ministers and parliamentary secretaries endorse the objective of establishing consistent legislative or regulatory minimum retail standards across the Australian jurisdiction. They went on to sayand this is not just coalition people but Labor people as well-that the initiatives are major steps towards achieving greater consistency in the business environment across Australia. What else did they say? They said that the ministers and parliamentary secretaries commended the package of initiatives announced by the Commonwealth on 30 September. What a contrast to the '13 years and 17 reports do nothing' approach of Labor. I will tell you what: if Labor were ever in, they would again do nothing for the small business community, except tax them, put more red tape on them and generally make their life as difficult as possibility. So, in the retail tenancy area, we are certainly driving this agenda in a way that has never been done before at the Commonwealth level. Similarly, in the franchise area-the Labor Party had a voluntary scheme for big business, and it was not working in the interests of small business. So the Reid committee said, 'We want a mandatory code; we will require people to meet reasonable standards.' And we have introduced that. The Labor Party had a recommendation to that effect and they knocked it back. Who was sitting in the cabinet when they knocked back that benefit for the small business community? None other than the old Leader of the Opposition-ld Mr Anti-small business. Doing the bidding of Finance and Treasury, he opposed the sensible measure for the small business community. To cap it off, here we have the most important legislative package for the small business community in 20 years, and yesterday this is what the member for Cunningham had to say. He said, . ' Mr Reith has the hide to accuse the Labor opposition of stalling the legislation which his own government hasn't even introduced into the Senate.' That is what he said yesterday. I refer honourable m-mbers to page 10401 of Hansard of 4 December last year. I think my colleagues are picking up the message. The second reading speech was moved by Senator Ellison: I move: That this bill be now read a second time. I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. Leave was not granted. He said that we did not introduce it into the parliament. We took it into the Senate and they refused the first measure to get it under way in the Senate before Christmas. The best package in 20 years and you people are out there deceiving the Australian small business community about your attitude. The fact is that you want to delay this measure, you want to filibuster this measure and you have the cheek to say that we have not introduced it into the Senate. As the Hansard shows, it is in the Senate. No wonder he is an embarrassment to you. Hindmarsh Island Case",42
158,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Attorney-General and it follows his answers to my questions yesterday on the Justice Callinan matter. If the material drawn to the judge's attention by Senator Bolkus was as insignificant as you were suggesting yesterday, can you please explain to the House why it was that Justice Callinan withdrew from the Hindmarsh Island case immediately that material came to light? Isn't the truth of the matter that your appointee's failure to disqualify himself from the outset was a shocking error of judgment; that you knew that from the outset; that you had available to you from the outset the information that would have enabled you to correct that situation; that you failed in your duty as first law officer to use that information; and that this was because Justice Callinan was the Prime Minister's appointee as well as that of the National Party and you feared for your political life if you did so act? . Mr Tim Fischer-On a point of order: I submit that understanding orders only a motion can be moved and no other criticisms made in respect directly of a judge of the High Court of this land. I accept that it was not the entirety of the question, but I ask that that aspect of the question be withdrawn.",43
159,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I accept the point of order by the Deputy Prime Minister. I ask the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to withdraw those particular sections. Do you withdraw them? Mr Gareth Evans-The reference was to an error of judgment by the judge which he himself has acknowledged in a decided opinion. If a shocking error of judgment is too heavy in the circumstances, I withdraw that.",43
160,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I do not want a debate. I have asked you to withdraw those reflections on the High Court. Mr Gareth Evans-What is the reflection? Is the reflection that it was an error of judgment or was it the adjective that is the problem? That there was an error of judgment was acknowledged by the judge himself.,43
161,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Do you withdraw or not? Mr Gareth Evans-I withdraw the 'shocking' if that is what you want.,43

163,Mrs BAILEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I address my question to the Attorney-General. Can the Attorney General inform the House whether he is aware of improper use of Federal Court documents? Can the Attorney-General advise members what the implications of this may be?,44
164,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This House should know that in the Senate yesterday Senator Vanstone rev-aled that the shadow spokesman on legal affalfs, Senator Bolkus, had leaked details confidential action being taken to recover overseas assets from one of Australia's wanted fugitives: namely, Christopher Skase. Senator Bolkus has been captured red-handed on video revealing to the media the contents of confidential Federal Court documents. appears those documents have been unlawfully or improperly given to Senator Bolkus or unlawfully or improperly obtained by - hat Senator Bolkus has done is help Chnstopher Skase. Senator Bolkus has given Skase the opportunity to know about the action being taken. This will enable Skase to take countermeasures to prevent recovery of the assets. He is acting against the interests the Australian public. The Australian public want those assets returned for the benefit creditors. This is a matter for action by the Leader the Opposition. It is a time for leadership' time for responsibility. Does the Leader of the Opposition disapprove of the shadow tion, - ttorney-General acting against the public mterest? Does the Leader of the Opposition have control over Senator Bolkus? Does the L-a-er of the Opposition accept that, like mmlsters, shadow ministers must meet approbody priate standards of conduct?

192,Ms ELLIS,SPEAKER,"I have a question to you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I understand that last night the families from Cobar, legally and peacefully demonstrating outside this place, had the misfortune to be hosed down several times over the night by the sprinkler system. The demonstrators include families and young children. I ask you whether you could look into the matter and give an assurance to this House that this will not occur again over the remaining nights of their peaceful and legal demonstration.",45
193,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPEAKER,"I thank the honourable member for Namadgi for her question. I am advised that about 1 a.m. the sprinkler system on Federation Mall turned on while a number of people associated with the Cobar mine assembly taking place outside the building were still in the area. The sprinkler system is automatic and turns on during programmed time blocks in response to ground moisture content. As arrangements had been made with organisers for the people associated with this activity to sleep or camp outside the Old Parliament House, there was no perceived need to isolate any sprinkler system on or adjacent to Federation Mall. Had the intentions of the group been known, suitable arrangements could have been made to isolate the sprinkler system. The watering system in this area of Federation Mall is controlled and managed by the Australian Capital Territory government. As advice has been received that people may again be in this area tonight and tomorrow night arrangements have been made through the National Capital Authority to isolate the sprinkler system. Arrangements have also been made with the Parliament House garden services section to isolate any sprinklers under the parliament's control to ensure that there is no inconvenience to this group. Honourable members should be aware that both Madam President and I are sympathetic to the plight of the Cobar people. The security controller has assured me that every courtesy will be extended to these people for the duration of their visit to Parliament House. AUDITOR-GENERAL'S REPORTS",45

196,Mr BEAZLEY,SPEAKER,"by leave-I move: That the House notes the Speaker's foreshadowed resignation, the Prime Minister's failure on learning of the intention of the Speaker to put in train procedures for the orderly running of the House, and the Prime Minister's previous undertaking to support an independent Speaker, and his failure to achieve that objective. I have moved this motion because the events that have occurred here today are matters of very substantial concern to this House. The Speaker has very honourably stood in this place although he has done it in a manner that makes quite a point. It makes quite a substantial point when he comes in here at 2 o'clock, announces his resignation and leaves. He is making a statement via that particular action. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is now leaving the chamber. In the presentations that the Speaker has made as to the reasons for his resignation he has been perfectly appropriate and circumspect. He has said that this is a matter that he has determined on his own, without pressure. He told me privately that he arrived at his conclusion in this direction some time ago and that he had a conversation with the Prime Minister last night as to what his intentions were on this matter. He is a man of discretion and honour and I accept the points that he has made. What interests me is the circumstances which have brought him to this position: a failure of standards on the part of the departing Prime Minister. He has failed in every single area of standards that he said he would bring into this place. We still do not have a ministerial code. He found the ministerial code impossible for his ministers to accept. He did not abolish the ministers-he did get rid of one or two of them; he abolished the code. The code will be, ultimately, a code that his ministers find acceptable. Two years on, we do not have it. The Prime Minister came out shortly before the last election and said these things about the position of Speaker: The second thing that I will do is I will have an independent speaker. A great weakness in parliament over the last few years is that we have not had an effectively independent speaker. You have had a speaker who has not been truly independent of the Labor Party and if I become Prime Minister I will adopt a system of having a completely independent speakerand these are the relevant words in this situationwho can be just as tough on me and my Ministers. What we have had from Speaker Halverson is within his lights, his best endeavours to achieve that end. He has, in the process of it, given an indication that he will uphold the standing order in relation to supplementary questions. He has put down a proposition on that. He has also put in place and indicated by note to both sides of the House that he intends to improve question time by insisting on brief and to the point questions from the opposition, and relevance from the government. What Speaker Halverson has experienced in the last two years is persistent harassment on all those points. Persistent breach by the Prime Minister and other ministers on the question of relevance; persistent breach in relation to length. Nobody who sits in here and watches question time can come to any other conclusion. I fully confess that we have from time to time breached the provision he put on us for short and to the point questions, but the vast bulk of the questions that we have asked have absolutely observed that requirement. The vast bulk of the answers that we have received, and that all members in this House have received, have been something entirely different. We have a Prime Minister who has, firstly, breached that to the very considerable humilidecided ation of the Speaker, who once was his campaign organiser for his leadership bid in this place and dear friend, and, secondly, defied the Speaker. The symbol of this government's harassment of this Speaker was provided some time ago. The breach was so spectacular that they have not been able to match it since. Nevertheless, it was spectacuthe lar enough for us to draw attention to it in this place. Nothing like this has happened for some considerable time. The Speaker invited, on 3 December, a withdrawal from the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) of an accusation directed at the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown). The Leader of the House was repeatedly asked by the Speaker to withdraw. When he failed to do so the Prime Minister stood and supported him, not the Speaker. The Prime Minister stood and supported the Leader of the House against the Speaker. Mr Halverson's resignation comes today and not then for one reason-and one reason only. The only reason why it did not come on 3 December 1996, as opposed to now, is that we in the opposition chose to withdraw. We in the opposition chose not to force Mr Speaker Halverson to make a choice between his loyalties to his political party and his obligation to uphold the standing orders in this place-his loyalties to a Prime Minister whom he sought to put in place at one point of time and his loyalties to an old friend in the form of the Leader of the Government in this House. We chose not to put Speaker Halverson to that test. We chose not to do so. We did so for one reason: a time honoured position as far as all members of parliament are concerned-that is, their obligation to assist Mr Speaker. It has to be said that in the robust cut thrust of debate not everybody helps Mr Speaker. When we are unfairly dealt with, we feel the need to get up and occasionally dissent from Mr Speaker's or Mr Acting Speaker's ruling, and we have done so from time to time in this place under the appropriHouse. ate orders and forums of the House. But on that occasion, because we recognised that it had got to a point where only the Speaker's authority would oblige him to leave, we that it was in the interests of all members of parliament that we withdraw, and we did. What has happened since that point of time has been endless grouching from the Prime Minister, open grouching from the Prime Minister-challenges to rulings made by the Speaker when those rulings have gone against Prime Minister, challenges to the dignity of the chair, a repeated refusal to acknowledge the obligation that is on the members of the other side's front bench to uphold what was an effort by Speaker Halverson to improve standards in this place. This was a position that obviously brought Mr Halverson to a point of the deepest personal disappointment. We can place no other interpretation on this action. We can place no other interpretation on the brevity and the perfunctory, in some ways, nature of the way in which this resignation is being presented than that he wants to make a point. That point is his best endeavours are endeavours that have been upheld; if they have been upheld by any side of the House, It has not been by the government. That is the only interpretation that we can place on the position that Speaker Halverson has come to. We note Speaker Halverson's loyalty. We note Speaker Halverson's concern for the Liberal Party's capacity to put in place an alternative candidate at the next election and the motivations that go into his presentation of his circumstances at this time, but the simple fact of the matter is that simply goes to his character. It does not go to the circumstances in which he was placed. And everybody in the press gallery who sits and watches these issues debated here in question time and and sits and watches the performance in question time-every person who has experience in this place-understands that thoroughly. Elsewhere in this motion we talk about the provision for the orderly running of the The simple fact of the matter is that the government is very lucky indeed that Speaker Halverson's resignation has not at this stage been formally presented to the Governor General and returned. Had it been, there would be no processes: there would be no question time and there would be no discussions taking place in this chamber. The government's whole demeanour in this place has been completely reflective of the fact that they have been caught wanting and should not have been, given the Prime Minister's notice. . We had an agreement on 10 minutes and my 10 minutes is up. I would not want anyone to think that my sitting down 10 minutes before the time that was allocated to me in any way diminishes the seriousness with which we regard this. These circumstances place on the new Speaker, whoever that Speaker is, an unbearable burden. These are circumstances in which, if that new Speaker is to be in a position which he or she feels is one of honour, they will have to have very considerable regard for that promise of Mr Howard's made so long ago and so completely breached since. They are going to be in a situation of very considerable difficulty, and it is going to be a challenge to government, having put a set of circumstances in place that has seen one Speaker go, to produce a set of circumstances that allows another Speaker to survive with honour.",47
197,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPEAKER,Is the motion seconded? Mr Crean-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,49
198,Mr REITH,SPEAKER,"This is a rather sad motion that the opposition has put today. I say that because the Speaker has announced his intention to resign; he has done so after holding the office for the last two years; he has held that office honourably, which I think is generally recognised within the parliament; he has given good service to the parliament; and, quite frankly, in the end he is entitled make a decision about his future career and he is entitled to announce it.",49
199,Mr MELHAM,SPEAKER,And he did it in the absence of the PM in the parliament. What does that tell you?,49
200,Mr REITH,SPEAKER,I have been asked about the immediate circumstances. It does tell you something about the Speaker. I will come to that in a moment.,49
201,Mr MELHAM,SPEAKER,Nothing so begat him as the manner of his departure.,49
202,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPEAKER,I warn the honourable member for Banks!,49
203,Mr REITH,SPEAKER,"What could be said about the Speaker is that he resigns his office at a time of his own choosing, and that could not have been more clearly demonstrated today. I came into the parliament on my second occasion in December 1984. I was finally sworn in in February 1985, so I was sworn in at the same time as the Speaker. Over the years, by dint of that circumstance and the fact that we are Victorians and various other things-we both enjoyed our billiards-we have struck up a close friendship in the time that he has been with us. He has been a person of great honour and distinction in this parliament. I suppose that this should not have been a surprise to the new parliament-as it was in 1984, or February 1985 when he arrived-because he already had a distinguished career in service to the nation in the armed forces. For a brief period, between leaving the defence forces and coming to the parliament, he was in the stockbroking business but, apart from that, his life's work was within the defence forces. Two career highlights there were the time that he served in the United States in the Defence Office within the Australian Embassy in Washington and another time when he served as an exchange officer with the RAP on behalf of the Royal Australian Air Force. For that latter service, he was awarded an Order of the British Empire, an OBE. I think it is also relevant to place on the record that, in Bob's long service to the parliament, he has been ably supported by a number of people, but I want to put on the to record my admiration for, my respect for and my thanks to two quite remarkable people. The first is his wife Maggie, who has been a tower of strength to him and a great support in his public life. Of course, in the role of Speaker, there are many engagements where a spouse can be a great help with the tasks to be completed. I also want to place on record the role of Pauline Osmond who is a great character in herself. She has been a very good adviser to Bob in the time that he has been here. She is a personality in her own right-a real character-and has been a great worker for the Liberal Party and for Bob in the time that he has been a member of parliament. I do not really want to reply to the claims that the Speaker has been humiliated, that he has been defied, that he has been harassed by the government. Quite frankly, these are not becoming allegations to make. The fact is that he has been an independent Speaker, he has been a good Speaker, and he decided that he had served his time and that it was time to make the resignation announcement that he made. I was with him last night when he met with the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and indicated his intentions. He said at the time that we would have a further discussion today about the timing and I said, 'When the PM gets back from Melbourne we can discuss it.' Then he rang me at about 1.20 p.m. or 1.25 p.m. and said that he was about to tell the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) that he was going to make a statement at 2 o'clock, and I said, 'Well, fair enough.' He then made the statement. The claim here is that the Prime Minister has not put in train procedures for the running of the House. I do not think Mr Speaker will mind me saying that we had intended to have further discussions but the timing of his announcement and the Prime Minister was unfortunately on the plane at the time, and I do not think there is any more to it than that. As· to the arrangements, Mr Deputy Speaker, we are obviously happy to facilitate the opportunity for people to say something. I know the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles), who is also a good friend of the Speaker, will also speak. I am proposing that we will have the MPI after this. I think the opposition is entitled to have its MPI. In terms of the processes, once the resignahe tion has been tendered and that resignation has been transmitted to the Clerk, the parliament's next order of business must be the election of a Speaker. I will need to speak to the Prime Minister but, from the government's perspective, that means we will need to have a party meeting tomorrow morning so that when the parliament resumes tomorrow we will be able to nominate a new Speaker. Normally, under the standing orders, the parliament would meet at 9.30 a.m., so I give members notice that we will be looking at probably a later start. I have already raised this with the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Crean) and, as soon as I have had a chance to talk to the Prime Minister about it, we will come back to you and advise you of that. Bob Halverson has been a good friend of mine. I am pleased that he is staying on through to the election. He wants to make sure we hang on to that seat of Casey, and that is typical of his loyalty to the party. We, of course, wish him well and I place on record my personal appreciation of the job that he has done and, from a personal aspect, that I, for one-and I know I speak for many-will be very sorry to see him leave.",49
204,Mr CREAN,SPEAKER,"I think it appropriate to place on record our appreciation for what the Speaker tried to do but was not allowed to do because of the thuggery of this government and because of the failure of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to uphold standards that he said he would uphold when orderly he was elected to the parliament. Let me just go to two important points that I want to develop on this. One is the pressure he set that was imposed upon Speaker Halverson which we believe was part of the reason for his extraordinary decision today to vacate the field. The second is another demonstration. of how low the Prime Minister's standards have been. This is what the Prime Minister said before the election on Channel 9 on 25 February 1996: I will adopt a system of having a completely independent Speaker who can be just as tough on me and my ministers. The trouble for Speaker Halverson was that believed the Prime Minister when he made that commitment. The problem for Speaker Halverson was that the Prime Minister had no intention of honouring it. I guess the worse example of this, Mr Deputy Speaker-because you would have been aware of it at the time-was the incident on 3 December 1996 when an outrageous allegation was made by the Leader of the House (Mr Reith), which required one of our members to seek a withdrawal. The Speaker ruled on two occasions-two occasions, mind you, and this debate takes place over six full pages of Hansard-that the Leader of the House-you know, the guy who played snooker with him, the best mate-withdraw the allegation in accordance with what he believed current standing orders were. The Leader of the House refused to do it. The Prime Minister quizzically said, 'I can't even understand what the ruling is.' This was a ruling to withdraw a statement where a member felt personally aggrieved. Not only did you have the Leader of the House refusing to withdraw it, but also you had a Prime Minister who said he could not understand what the ruling was about. It was only. because the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) stood back from the brink that Speaker. Halverson was not forced to resign on 3 December 1996. Let there be no mistake about that. If anyone needs to be reminded of it, let us have a look at what the newspapers were saying the day after. 'How speaker forced to back down' was the comment in the Australian. It stated, 'The independence of the Speaker of the House of Representatives was diminished yesterday when Bob Halverson was forced into a humiliating backdown on one of his rulings.' Who forced it? The government did. Who was prepared to back the Speaker? The Labor opposition was prepared to back him. Again, if you look at the Age of the next day, you see the words, 'Riot tactics split Libs from their speaker' and, 'Speaker threatens to quit parliament'. This is on Tuesday, 18 February. According to the Canberra Times of that day, 'The Speaker of the House of Representatives has hit out at his critics and threatened to resign from parliament, exposing Prime Minister John Howard to a potentially damaging by-election if he is forced out of the job.' We all know the concern that the Speaker had for the way in which he was not being treated properly by the government. We all know that he came in with the firm conviction of really wanting to be an independent speaker. He said he was going to take no more part in the party room meetings of his own party. He was going to be available to both sides of the House and he was going to try to restore an order and dignity to this place. He kept requesting, pleading even, for both sides of the House to give him the support that he needed. The next step in this sorry saga was on 26 March, again after what had been a particularly damaging period for him, because again the government at every step of the way, from the Prime Minister down, was critical of rulings that he was making in' any attempt he made to become more even-handed-everyone from the Prime Minister down. We could run through them: the Prime Minister, the Leader of the House, the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Dr Kemp), the Treasurer (Mr Costello); these were people who turned their backs on him when they were answering questions. These are people who were repeatedly asked to come back to the point of the question. They all ignored him. They humiliated him. So on 26 March he said that he wanted to set out at length the way in which we should proceed in future to address the length and relevance issues associated with questions and answers in the parliament. That resulted some two months later in a statement by the Speaker which set out what he expected. Again, who were the people who cooperated? We shortened the questions. We asked the supplementary questions only in the context in which he had outlined them. But we said that we would do it if the government would do it. Yet we have had this tawdry episode every time we have come into question time where they refuse to make any answer to a question, where they go on forever and where they ignore the Speaker when he asks them to come back to the relevancy of their point. That is what the Speaker was confronted with, and we know it. We did give the Speaker a hard time, but it was out of frustration that he was not able to get the cooperation of the party that put him in the seat. What we are saying today is this: we regret the fact that the Speaker has left, but we know the circumstances that drove him to it. Any objective person that has watched the way in which this parliament has operated would know that. Let me come to the second point, and that is the way in which the government handles itself in this place. What we have found again is another example of the government, when confronted by a crisis, looking like the rabbit caught in the spotlight. We now have the Leader of the House admitting today that he knew last night Speaker Halverson was going to resign. We know that the Prime Minister did. What did he do? He flew out for good reasons to a funeral today. But we all know this: if the Speaker of the House of Representatives tenders his resignation, the parliament cannot proceed. Yet we had the spectacle today where we were given 20 minutes notice of the intention of the Speaker to go to Government House to tender his resignation. When we sought to get an explanation here, we saw again I think a pretty revealing circumstance: the Speaker came only to this side of the House to shake the Leader of the Opposition's hand. He did not go to his billiard partner's side. He did not shake the hand of his snooker mate, because he knows that that same mate snookered him. He was part of the exercise that drove him and hounded him from office. But what sort of government is it that, knowing this was the mind of the Speaker and knowing he was going to announce his resignation today, does not take steps to ensure that the parliament can still run smoothly? If the resignation was going to be submitted, where was the process by which it had put in train the procedures to elect a new speaker? Again, our contention is this: this another example of a government incapable of governing, a government which is incapable of managing affairs in the place and a government that is not prepared to honour the commitments that it has made to make the speaker a more independent person. Mr Reith-You can't even keep a commitment to speak for 10 minutes.",50
205,Mr CREAN,SPEAKER,"The Leader of the House interjects that we cannot keep a commitment to speak for 10 minutes. He was given the opportunity to get up and speak about his mate that he used to play snooker with, and sat down after five minutes. Mr Reith-No, 10.",52
206,Mr CREAN,SPEAKER,"No it was not; you sat down. What you did today was to demonstrate that you knew not one bit about the implications of the Speaker's resignation, yet you are charged with the responsibility of managing the orderly conduct of this House. This is a tawdry episode. We wish the Speaker well. But what we do express is our severest concerns at the way in which he has been driven from office-driven from office by the people who promised to uphold the standards of this place. They have failed and they ought to be condemned for it.",52
207,Mr CHARLES,SPEAKER,"I move: That all words after ""resignation"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""and records its appreciation of his distinguished service to the Parliament"". On 30 April 1996 I had the honour in this place of proposing the Hon. Bob Halverson as Speaker of this distinguished House of Representatives. I was proud to have that honour because I believed that he would bring to the chair an independence that this place had not seen certainly in my time in this parliament-since March 1990. Today's contributions from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and, indeed, the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) do somewhat disappoint me because, as I reflect on my time in this place and the activities of this House, I would have thought that all of us would agree that the chair acted in a more is balanced and impartial manner since 30 April 1996 than it had done certainly in any time since I took up my position in this House .. The Leader of the Opposition talked about brief questions and supplementary questions. I think the Speaker has accomplished his objective of shortening the length of questions. I am not about to stand here and say that the opposition are perfect. They never will be. It is their job to be in opposition. I know more about that than any of those sitting opposite because I was in opposition for six years. I know what it is like to be in opposition. I understand it. Do members recall what the questions were like in the last parliament and the previous one with Leaping Leo and Honest Steve over there?",52
208,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPEAKER,"Mr Nehl)Order! The honourable member will refer to members by their correct titles. . Mr CHARLES-I withdraw that. Mr Crean- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I understand the member for La Trbbe has moved an amendment-and I must say I find it extraordinary that the Leader of the House did not move it. In accordance with the requirement of us and the procedures of the House, I would ask that the amendment be tabled. We want to see the detail of it.",53
209,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPEAKER,I thank the member.,53
210,Mr CHARLES,SPEAKER,"I was commenting on the fact that in previous parliaments we had very few questions in question time. As I recall, we had a split front-bench. We had half the front-bench here on one day and the other half on the next day, so we did not have a full question time. We did not have the full examination of government priorities and actions that has happened since 30 April 1996. Perhaps I am biased because I did propose Bob Halverson as Speaker. I did so because I thought he would bring to the chair some dignity, some sincerity, good humour and balanced judgments, and in my view he has accomplished those things. I think it is less than fortunate that the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Hotham have not shown the good grace to compliment the outgoing Speaker on the fine job that he has done and on the dignity he brought to the office and to the chair. I have known the Speaker for a good time. Casey is a neighbouring electorate of La Trobe, and the two of us have worked closely together. I know that he is dearly loved by the people in his electorate and was in 1996 disappointed that the redistribution took from him so much of that broad reach of what the electorate of Casey used to be and contracted it into a smaller area. He had made many friendships with many people across all bounds of political life. I think his prior experience in the armed services and serving this country put him in good stead in this place. He was a terrific whip in opposition and I think he has brought dignity to the office of the chair. I think we will miss him, and I think the opposition do themselves a disservice when they try to paint a picture of there being some conflict between the Speaker and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). From my viewpoint, I saw no such conflict. In fact, if the opposition are honest they would admit that during the 13 years they were in government never did the opposition-us-have a supplementary question, never were there 20 questions at question time lI;nd never was there the degree of making sure that ministers stuck to the issues, stuck to the point, of the question that Speaker Halverson has insisted happen in this parliament. He has acted independently. He has not attended Liberal Party meetings or functions, and he has acted in a truly independent spirit. I congratulate him on that. Very briefly, his press release today deserves to go into the Hansard. Dated 3 March 1998, it states: Speaker of the House of Representatives The Hon. Bob Halverson OBE MP Resignation as Speaker At the commencement of proceedings in the House this afternoon I informed Members that later today I will be tendering to His Excellency the Governor General my resignation as Speaker of the House of Representatives. It has been a great honour to serve the Parliament as Speaker-and I would like to thank everyone who has supported my endeavours in this role. Although I have been endorsed as the Liberal Party candidate for Casey I will not contest the next election. In the meantime I will continue to fulfil my obligations to the electors of Casey by serving as their federal parliamentary representative. By taking this action at this time, it will not only enable the Liberal Party to pre-select my successor for the seat of Casey but also will allow me to be available to assist in the transitional period to ensure continuing effective representation for the electorate. I would like to reiterate my comment in the House that this is not a decision I have taken lightly or without careful consideration. It is my decision, and mine alone-and I am entirely comfortable with it. I believe that the motion, as amended, should be supported by all honourable members in this House for an honourable man who has done a great job in dignifying the office of Speaker of the House of Representatives of the parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia. Mr Truss---I second the amendment moved by the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles). I endorse it wholeheartedly. I would like to speak on the amendment but I will not do so out of respect for the agreement made with the opposition that we limit speakers to two a side. I endorse the amendment and commend it to the House.",53
211,Mr FILING,SPEAKER,"Having not been a party to this agreement, I am not sure what on earth it is. As a member of this place, I am interested in makingMr Reith-Hang on! Two a side!",54
212,Mr FILING,SPEAKER,"I just point out, perhaps for the interest of members, that in the House of Representatives Practice there is a passage which says: The chequered history of the Speakership shows that a number of Speakers died violent deaths by way of execution or murder while others were imprisoned, impeached or expelled from office. This record is reflected in the custom of a newly elected Speaker showing a token resistance on being escorted to the Chair. I acknowledge the fact that the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) pointed out that he was one of those people who actually helped guide the then Speaker-elect, the member for Casey (Mr Halverson), to the chair to take up his position as Speaker. There are a number of questions which have still not been answered in this debate. I would like to know the answers as a member of this House because the Speaker is a person who has as his primary duty the defence of the rights of the members of this place. This is an extraordinary event. I cannot think, other than during the days of the Whitlam government when Speaker Cope resigned, of anything of a similar nature in the history of the speakership of the House of Representatives. Given the seriousness of this particular event and given the fact that there will be an election within a reasonably short timecertainly between now and March 1999-it seems extraordinary that the Speaker should have chosen this particular point to resign his office. Given the fact that he sought and accepted the preselection for the seat of Casey, it is also a matter of some note and I as a member would like to know the full circumstances of his resignation. What I would really like to know-this is the $64,000 question arising from the resignation of the Speaker-is whether the government still endorses the change, albeit a small change and a change that was very much welcomed by the Independent members of this House, that Speaker Halverson brought to his functions. That is the question that needs to be answered. Mr Reith-Such as?",54
213,Mr FILING,SPEAKER,"For instance, in the case of supplementary questions, where ministers have been chided for overly long responses or where, for instance, they have not stuck to the . relevance of the question or in the case, for instance, where there has been perhaps a more even-handed approach in dealing with disorderly conduct on either side of the House. As a consequence of today's events, as a member of this place, I would like to know whether or not the Speaker felt in any way that his independence or the functions of his office· were being infringed by the executive of the government-whether or not, for instance, anybody from this government had tried to stand over him or tried to influence him in his job to such an extent that he felt that he had no alternative but to resign. If those sorts of questions are not answered, they beg other questions from all members in this place. The member for La Trobe said that he was one of the sponsors of the Speaker. I can recollect the member for La Trobe-I was alongside him in those days in the Liberal Party-when in opposition there was a great deal made about the role of the Speaker. I will not reflect on any of the previous speakmake ers other than to sayMr Leo MCLeay interjecting",54
214,Mr FILING,SPEAKER,I was going to say that feels perhaps I will reflect on the other speakers. was going to point out that one of the differI ences in this particular sorry sagaMr Reith-What's sorry about it?,55
215,Mr FILING,SPEAKER,"It is sorry for the fact that we have a situation where an honourable person, a person who has served this place well, who has been a good Speaker and has brought elements of independence to role, finds that he has no other choice but resign from his office. Mr Reith-That is an insult.",55
216,Mr FILING,SPEAKER,"Is that an insult? If that is an of this place. insult, whyMr Reith-Why don't you have the guts to go and say it to his face?",55
217,Mr FILING,SPEAKER,I am saying it right here in a the chamber. Mr Reith-Why don't you do the decent thing and go and make your snide and sleazy remarks to him? Not even the Labor Party was as low as that.,55
218,Mr FILING,SPEAKER,"The Leader of the House protect talks about sleazy and snide remarks. I sat and watched his body language very carefully when he made his comments. All I can say is that if he chooses to reflect on my personal approach to this, with friends like him, who needs enemies? He has chosen to reflect the reasons for my making a contribution. have made this contribution and asked those questions on the basis that at this particular point in time. I do not know why the Speaker has chosen to make this decision. Mr Truss-Read his media release.",55
219,Mr FILING,SPEAKER,We have had the media know release read to us by the member for La Trobe. It does not illuminate the situation in prepared toany way.,55
220,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPEAKER,Mr Nehl}-The honourable member for Moore will ignore the interjections.,55
221,Mr FILING,SPEAKER,"That is what I am asking concern now in this place. This is the place where the contribution to make those particular requests. If, at the end of the day, we are faced with a situation where the Speaker of this place is placed in a situation where he obliged to resign, then obviously the I rights of members are likely to be infringed. ask the government if it will respond by saying whether or not it firmly endorses the directions the Speaker took- If so, I will be pleased at that response because I think the changes Speaker Halverson brought to his office have been of benefit to this place. What who I want to know is: will the government his support the subsequent Speaker if those to particular changes are continued and enhanced? I think it is incumbent upon the government to make the office of Speaker more independent and to raise the standards After having been attacked by the Leader of the House for merely asking the question of what has happened, I would have thought, as member of this place, that that is a perfectly straightforward, understandable and logical question to ask. All I can say is that if this is the attitude, then I am concerned at the future of the role of an independent Speaker. As an Independent member of this place, I wish to have someone in the chair who is there to my rights as a member and my right to be able to properly represent the interests of my constituents in this place. . Mr HOLDING - Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: it seems to me that there are on two problems here. One is that the motion I before the House raises matters of deep concern to members of this parliament in terms of a situation unparalleled in the history of this parliament, where the Speaker has come in and simply announced his resignation. Those of us who know him well know that he would not do that lightly, but we also that his loyalty to his own party is such that he followed a course where he was not Mr Reith-This is a speech.",55
222,Mr HOLDING,SPEAKER,"Just let me finish. He was not prepared to bag his own colleagues. There are two concerns here. There is the deep of the opposition about what occurred you in this parliament today in terms of the position of the Speaker and the events that may have led up to it, which we do not know much about. I would be concerned to vote for that motion, but I also want to vote to express my confidence and satisfaction in the role was performed by the Speaker. Mr Reith-Just put the motion.",55
223,Mr HOLDING,SPEAKER,"You see, this is the point, Mr Deputy Speaker. There are members in this House, and I am one, who are deeply concerned about the process that led to these events. We are not in a position to learn fully of them. If there were anybody who wanted to move a motion of confidence in the Speaker-and it has been moved-it would have been open to the Prime Minister, but he did not follow that course. What do we do when we want to register concern in a motion at the same time as it is being suggested that the House substitutes that expression of concern with a motion of confidence in the role of the Speaker? I would suggest that the proper process is for a motion to be put separately and, if the government wants to defeat it, it can use its numbers. Then a motion expressing our feelings for the Speaker and the role he has played ought to be put separately and be unanimously carried by this House. The procedure that is being put is sleazy and is a further disgrace to this House. Mr Allan Morris-I have a question to you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I thought that my colleague raised with you a proposal, which I am more than prepared to second, that consideration be given to the amendment being put separately as a procedural motion. Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER { Mr Nehl)-I thank the honourable member for Newcastle. We have a motion and an amendment to the motion. I certainly note that the member for Melbourne Ports was talking about that and was making suggestions, but he has not moved any formalMr Holding interjecting",56
224,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPEAKER,"I would just like to think for a moment. Thank you very much, member for Melbourne Ports. I refer you to standing order 175, which states: When the proposed anien!iment is to omit certain words, the Speaker shall put a question, ""That the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question"". that As far as I am aware, we have a motion, we have an amendment and, at this stage, all we have is a suggestion that this is not appropriate. At this point",56
225,Mr HOLDING,SPEAKER,"On a point of order: I put it that the terms of the motion are such that the amendment that is moved by way of, virtually, a vote of confidence is not consistent with it, and it ought to be put separately to the House, in fairness to the processes of the House and in fairness to the former Speaker.",56
226,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPEAKER,"I thank the honourable member for Melbourne Ports and I am sympathetic to the point that he makes. However, I am bound by the standing orders and the Mr Martin Ferguson-You are going to get your instructions now.",56
227,Mr MELHAM,SPEAKER,Do it by leave! Mr Reith-On a point of order,56
228,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPEAKER,"Order! The Leader of the House will resume his seat, and the honourable member for Batman will withdraw that. Mr Martin Ferguson-I withdraw the suggestion that you are going to get your instructions now.",56
229,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPEAKER,"Thank you. Resume your seat. The Leader of the House. Mr Reith-We are required to deal with these motions in accordance with the standing orders. I understand the comment that is being made, but the reality is that the motion drafted by the opposition is an unfortunate one because of the sorts of reasons that the member has put. We have put an alternative but the standing orders require that the first motion is put, and there will have to be a division on it. It is most unfortunate that, on the day that the Speaker has announced his intentions, you should be moving such a negative proposal, but that is the way of it. You are captured by the rather unpleasant nature of your own motion. Question put: That the words proposed to be omitted (Mr Charles's amendment) stand part of the question. Lindsay, P. 1.

232,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," Mr Speaker has received a letter from the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The increasing public concern about the cost of private health insurance and the inability of the Howard government to admit that its tax rebate policy has failed. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",59
233,Mr LEE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Speaker Halverson should not have been the person who resigned today. The member for Chisholm, the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge), should have resigned today. He has deliberately deceived the Australian people in what he has been saying about private health insurance. He has wasted $1.7 billion of taxpayers' money on their failed health insurance tax rebates, which, as every person out there with private health insurance knows, have been swallowed up by premium increases that have been approved by this minister and this government. Yesterday morning, five million Australians woke up to learn that their health insurance premiums had increased by an average of eight per cent. Some of the older, loyal, long term members of health insurance funds have been hit with increases of up to 15 per cent in some funds in some states. That means that most families will be paying an extra $200 for their private health insurance premiums each year. Contrast that with what the member for Bennelong, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), promised the Australian people before the last election. He said that he would offer cheaper premiums for health insurance through the tax rebate. He said that would deliver an increase in membership for the funds and would take the pressure off the public hospital system. But what have we seen? Premiums have gone through the roof and membership has gone through the floor. This government, under John Howard, has slashed federal funding for public hospitals by $800 million a year. This government has delivered the lowest level of private health insurance membership Australia has ever seen. We are now down to 31.6 per cent after this governmerit has spent $1.7 billion of taxpayers' money, and it has nothing to show for it. The tragedy is that the $1.7 billion that government squandered on the rebate was raised by cutting federal funding to public hospitals, by abolishing the Commonwealth dental health program and by forcing ordinary Australians to pay more for their essential medicines. That is how they raised the funding for this measure, which Jeff Kennett rightly said has been 'money down the drain'. It is money down the drain because there has been no increase in private health insurance membership as a result of these changes. The minister for health might be the person who is taking the rap, even if he is too much of a coward to present himself in the chamber this afternoon for this MPI. This is not the first time that the minister has squibbed a debate on health issues. It must be embarrassing for members of the government's back bench to be asked to come and fill in for a minister who is not prepared to come in and defend his own ideas. You can understand why Dr Wooldridge is embarrassed to come in here and defend this government's policy. The person who should really be getting the blame for the disaster with this government's policy on private health insurance is John Howard, the member for Bennelong. It is the Prime Minister who deserves the blame. The Prime Minister, knowing that there was to be another tidal wave of health insurance increases to be announced yesterday, in a deliberate, sneaky John Howard type strategy got into the papers last week and said that the reason for the failure of this government's health insurance policy is that the former Labor government did not take some action seven years ago. But, Mr Deputy Speaker, you have to ask yourself: if John Howard knew at the last election that the position of private health insurance was irretrievable, why did he go to the last election with a policy which said he would spend $1.7 billion on a policy that would not make a difference? A week ago the Prime Minister's excuse for the failure of his rebate policy was that the Labor government did not do enough seven years ago. If you knew that in 1976, why did you squander the $1.7 billion on tax rebates if you knew it would not make a difference, if you knew you the could not tum around the level of private health insurance? If you knew that in 1976, why would you have this exchange with a journalist at the launch of the Liberal Party's health policy in February 1996: Journalist: What is your target for the number of people who will take out private health insurance? Howard: Well our target is that by the year 2000 it should be 40 per cent. . The journalist goes on to ask: Sorry, is that 40 per cent moved back in or 40 per cent? Howard: No, no, by the year 2000 it will be 40 per cent. So if John Howard was right when he said a week ago that he knew all along that the Labor government's decisions that were taken seven years ago meant that private health insurance could not have been turned around, why did the Prime Minister deliberately deceive the Australian people-using those words that we are allowed to use, thanks to the ruling of Deputy Speaker Nehl-and claim that he could get the levels of private health insurance back up to 40 per cent by the year 2000? When the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) puts the acid on the Prime Minister here this afternoon and asks him whether he stands by that 40 per cent target by the year 2000, the Prime Minister squibs it again. Knowing that there is no chance in the world that his failed tax rebate policy can hope to tum around the level of private health insurance membership to 40 per cent by the year 2,000, is the Prime Minister strong enough, is the Prime Minister man enough, to come in here and admit that he cannot achieve the target he set himself in 1996? No, the Prime Minister still tries to slip and slide all around the dispatch box, all around this table, refusing to admit what every person out there who has private health insurance knows. They know-as the Prime Minister is not prepared to admit-that this tax rebate policy has been a complete and utter failure. But it is not just the Prime Minister who has been telling porkies. We had this exchange between the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) and Fran Kelly on Radio National a few weeks ago: Fr-n Kelly: So Minister if I can just clarify MIchael Lee the shadow health spokesman is wrong, is he, when he says that your portfolio budget statement of 1996-97 claimed that you said coverage of private health insurance will increase to 34 per cent in 1997-98? Dr Wooldridge, Minister for Health: No, he is wrong, he's lying. He knows he's saying a deliberate untruth. We asked the minister for health about this yesterday; we asked him how he explains the fact that his own name appears on the health department budget portfolio statements, these statements which on page 145 contain the following statement: The funding estimatesthis is for the private health insurance tax rebateare based upon the assumption that the coverage of private health insurance will increase from 32 per c.ent of the population to 34 per cent of the populatIon. That is what Dr Wooldridge's own health portfolio budget statements say. But we have got to the stage under John Howard where parliamentary standards are so low that a minister of the crown can claim--even though he is responsible for the department of health's budget portfolio papers; even though his name appears on the portfolio papers; even though this minister has approved them, signed them and submitted them to the Presiding Officers of the Parliament of Australia that in some way he is not responsible for them. 'I only approve them,' Dr Wooldridge says. 'I only sign them,' the minister for health says. 'I only submitted them to the Parliament of Australia,' the minister for health says. It is some bureaucrat who drafted them; it is some bureaucrat in the Department of Finance and the Department of Health and Family Services who is responsible-for Dr Wooldridge's signature appearing on this document, which states that their estimates are based on a two per cent increase in private health insurance. But, if that is not bad enough, in some ways it is to be expected from ministers in this government. When the DIFF scandal was exposed, we had the Downer defence-'I didn't read it.' Then, when we had the travel rorts exposed, we had the Howard defencethat, 'I know nothing.' Then, when this minister is caught out with his own name on the budget portfolio statements, he says, 'I only signed it, I didn't write it.' What are we getting to? What sort of standards of ministerial behaviour do we have in this parliament? But it gets even worse than that. It is not just the budget portfolio statements. Jennifer Byrne, on the 7.30 Report last night, put a very pertinent question to Dr Wooldridge. I quote from the transcript of that program: Jennifer Byrne: As recently as last year when you announced this financial package, you said you expected 70,000 single people and 65,000 couples to join health funds, an increase of 1Y2 per cent. What we've seen is a substantial drop. . Dr Wooldridge: Well I didn't say that. Dr Wooldridge claims he did not say that.",59
234,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Mr Jenkins)Order! The honourable member will refer to members by their titles.,62
235,Mr LEE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The minister for health claims he did not say that, and yet this is a press release issued on budget night by the minister for health. I will quote from a paragraph, and see whether the words sound familiar-and this is the minister for health, Dr Wooldridge: We are expecting about 70,000 high income earning single people and 65,000 couples and families to join health funds as a result of this measure. This alone would increase the tion rate by 1.5 percentage points. So, having raised this press release in the parliament here yesterday, Dr Wooldridge goes on the 7.30 Report and deliberately deceives the viewers of that program and claims that he did not say something which is in his own press release. I do not know whether we are going to get the defence that in some way he is not responsible for his own press releases because someone else has written them, but this is a pretty sorry state ministerial accountability. The other thing to point out is that the minister for health claims that these increases are less than the average increases for the last decade. I always think it is interesting to compare the last two years of the former Labor government with the first two years of this government. If you look at the real increases in the cost of health insurance, what did we see in 1994-95, the second last year of the Labor government? We saw 0.9 per cent. What did we see in 1995-96? We saw 1.5 per cent increase in health insurance premiums in real terms. What did we see in the first full year of the Howard government? A real increase of 5.8 per cent. We are facing real increases this year of 10 to 15 per cent. Under the last two years of Labor we had increases of 0.9 per cent and 1.5 per cent. Under the first two years of the member for Bennelong and the member for Chisholm we have had 5.8 per cent and in excess of 10 per cent real increases in the cost of private health insurance. Is it any wonder that ordinary Australians are questioning whether they are getting good value for money from their private health insurance? The government is floating a few ideas around about how it might fix this crisis, about how it might address the fact that its policy has been a $1.7 billion flop. We have the government claiming that it might look at lifetime community rating. You would not want to be in a hurry waiting for the government to make its mind up on lifetime community rating. John Howard established a public inquiry. He set up the Industry Commission inquiry into private health insurance participa18 months ago. Twelve months ago the Industry Commission reported; it produced its draft and its final report. In February 1997 Dr Wooldridge put out a statement saying that the government approved in principle the introduction of lifetime community rating. The minister for health said that he would carry out some modelling but that within six months of February 1997 he would have legislation in the parliament. A year has gone by and the of government is still looking at, contemplating and dithering over whether or not it will bring in lifetime community rating. The only other idea that seems to be on the table is the government's plan to force middle income earners to pay the Medicare levy surcharge if they do not have private health insurance. We have already seen that the government has predicted that it would get a 1- per cent increase in private health insurance membership from the Medicare levy surcharge. That has not produced a 1- percentage increase. If you have been unable to force high income earners to take out very expensive private health insurance through the Medicare levy surcharge, why would you expect that forcing middle income earners to take out private health insurance through the surcharge would be any more successful? All that lifetime community rating will mean at the end of the day is that older members of health funds will be forced to pay more. Younger members might get some reward, and we on this side of the House have no difficulty with coming up with rewards for long-term members of health funds, but we certainly do not believe that older Australians should be penalised for the policy failures of this government. Surely older Australians have been hurt enough with the nursing home debacle, with the increases in the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, with the government's cutbacks and the abolition of the Commonwealth dental service. Surely older Australians deserve to be out of the target sights of this government and this Prime Minister. At the last election a lot of Australians their trust in John Howard, the member for Bennelong. They believed him when he made a few promises before the last election. He said that he would make health insurance cheaper. Premiums have gone through the roof. He said that he would get the level of private health insurance up to 40 per cent by the year 2000, and instead we have seen membership go through the floor. The member for Bennelong said that he would not cut Medicare rebates. What have we seen? GP rebates have been squeezed, forcing a reduction in the level of bulkbilling for ordinary Australians. The member for Bennelong said that pensioners would retain their benefits. What does he do? He causes turmoil in nursing homes, abolishes the Commonwealth dental program and increases the cost of essential medication. Is it any wonder there is such deep disillusionment amongst those Australians who trusted John Howard, who trusted the member for Bennelong? Is it any wonder that they are waiting for the day that they can toss this government out at the earliest opportunity?",62
236,Dr SOUTHCOTT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have heard the opposition minister for health, the member for Dobell (Mr Lee), put up MPI after MPI on private health insurance, and it is always the same thing. I have never heard him offer one constructive solution for private health insurance. I have never heard him address the problems that private health insurance is facing. He has just spent 15 minutes criticising the government's private health insurance incentives. This is the ALP's 1996 policy document. The member for Dobell has just spent 15 minutes criticising the government's private health insurance incentives. What would Labor have done if it were elected? If it were elected, Labor was going to offer a $350 family payment, a flat rebate, for the cost of private health insurance. Labor was offering incentives for private health insurance. Labor was committed to the same policy as the government. You have to ask the Australlan Labor Party what they would do with the incentives for private health put insurance. Would they scrap them? They would not say. At the ALP conference in January the shadow minister for health would not say whether he would scrap the private health insurance incentives. Are you going to scrap them to pay for public hospitals? The Australian people want to know. At the moment he has $6 billion of unfunded health policy promises. It is important to reflect on some of the benefits that we have in the Australian health system. Australia spends between eight and nine per cent of GDP on a health system that is more comprehensive than that of the United States. The Labor Party has never been committed to private health insurance. Perhaps they would like to see a system more weighted towards public hospitals. That certainly seems to be the thrust of their policy from their national conference. If you look at what country has the greatest predominance of a public system vis-a-vis a private system, it would be the national health service in the United Kingdom. That is the sort of system that the Labor Party wants to work towards. The latest figures on participation rates show that at present 31.6 per cent of Australians have private health insurance. You have to ask: what would be the levels without private health insurance incentives? The premiums would still rise. The insurance funds cannot raise the premiums just to add it on to the bottom line. They have to add it if it is actually contributing to reserves. The point to make is that these fund increases average about eight per cent. During the term of the Labor government the average was 12 per cent. There was a period in 1986-88 when insurance premiums rose by 40 per cent. During that period it was direct Commonwealth government decisions relating to the reinsurance pool and the Commonwealth bed day subsidy that contributed to those rises. What the opposition would like to do is put all of our money into public hospitals. That su.ggestion wi!l not - ork because the premIUms are gomg to nse. The premiums are risi-g due to increasing technology, due to the agemg of the Australian population and due to the fact that there are more people to care for and there are more expensive methods to use. Premiums are going to rise for those reasons. The funds cannot add the premiums to the bottom line. That is why there is a com.mittee of the Treasurer (Mr Costello), the Minister for H-alth and Family Services (Dr W ooldndge) and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to actually review that. Also, it is important to ask: do the opposition want to scrap these incentives? Will the member for Dobell tell the 13,000 people in his electorate that have taken up the private health insurance incentives that he wants to take it away f-om them, or will the Leader of the OppositIon tell the 12,000 people in Brand that he wants to take away those private health insurance incentives? Australia has a health system with a public and private component. Most people would agree that you need to efficiently utilise both parts and you also need to offer the community the choice and security that they require in healt- care: Regarding the policy that the ALP IS saymg has been a failure, there have been over 1IA million people in January 1998 who have actually taken up the benefits of the government's incentive scheme. I notice that in Boothby, my own electorate, over 20,000 people have taken up the private health insurance scheme. People who want to apply-some people think it is just a tax rebate--can receive it through the tax system. - lot of pensioners and people on lower mcomes, self-funded retirees-I know there are a lot of self-funded retirees on the Central Coast in the member for Dobell's own elec!orate who. are - eceiving this private health msurance I.ncentIve-and other people who are not paymg much tax can also receive it by applying through the fund. There is also the point to make that this has been the carrot but there has also been the stick in the government's policy relating to private health insurance; and that means that single people on incomes above $50,000 and couples on incomes of over $100,000 need to take out private health insurance, otherwise they pay an extra one per cent in the Medicare levy. People need to be aware of that. Regarding private health insurance, the opposition mentioned the Industry Commission report. The government has already re-p0.nded to that report; it did so in August. It IS Important to make private health insurance value for money. Some of the important reforms you could see in private health insurance are just simplified billing. There is an example at the Melbourne Private Hospital where you have simplified billing-and it is paid for by the funds-so that people do not need to receive a bill. That is one of tlte most commo? complaints that you get about private health. msurance, that people are receiving sometImes up to 60 bIlls after a stay in a private hospital. If adopted by hospitals, this would allow people either to receive one bill after the hospital stay or, in the case of Melbourne Private Hospital, to have them paid totally by the funds. The ALP had their conference in J anuaryand we have had the Industry Commission around for a year. What proposals do the ALP have for private health insurance? What is their p.olicy .on lif-time community rating? W-at IS theIr pol-c- on adjusting waiting penods for pre-exIstmg ailments? What is the-r policy on reviewing the regulations which go around health insurance? What is their policy on looking at the reinsurance pools? .'Yhat is their policy on enhancing competItIon between the funds? What is their policy on the role of Medibank Private? What is tlteir policy in areas like integrated billing? It is important to remember that' when Medicare was established by John Deeble it was established to go hand in hand with a strong private sector. When it was established in 1984 private health insurance levels were initially at 66 per cent. They dropped to 50 - per cent very quickly after the introduction of Medicare and they have been dropping by about two per cent per year ever since. There were some Labor members who recognised that. Graham Richardson recognised about four or five years ago that there was a real crisis in private health insurance. Unfortunately, most members of the caucus were ideologically opposed to private health insurance and when he left nothing much was done about it. As I have said before, it was the previous Labor government's directly removing, initially, the rebate for private health insurance when they first got in and the abolition of the Commonwealth bed day subsidy-the removal of the Commonwealth's contribution to the private reinsurance pool-which led to an explosion in premiums of over 40 per cent. Between 1986 and 1988 there was an explosion of 40 per cent. As well as those actions, things like the Medicare rebate, which was reduced from 85 per cent to 75 per cent for in-patient stays, and the 1993 Medicare agreement, which encouraged public patients to be put through in public hospitals, forced private patients into private hospitals. It has been that shift to private patients being treated in private hospitals which has contributed to a lot of the increase in insurance premiums in the 1990s. There has also been a vicious cycle in private health insurance whereby what you have had is that, as each cycle comes around, the premiums rise and the young, fit and healthy assess their own risk and decide to drop out, which is changing the risk pool of those people who are in private health insurance. This is adverse selection and what it means is that the policy of community rating-whereby you do not discriminate against people who are more likely to claim-is now a farce because it is not even a balanced pool in private health insurance. Adverse selection means that it is actually tilted towards people who are more likely to claim. One of the problems in the health system is that you have Medicare, which is a universal health system available to all, operating side by side with a private system which has regulations operating on it which are trying to achieve some of the same social objectives as the Medicare system. It is a problem that needs to be addressed. I have never heard the Labor Party come up with a solution to that. As I mentioned before, Access Economics have estimated that every two per cent drop in private health insurance contributes something like 325,000 hospital bed days. That is two teaching hospitals per year for each two per cent drop per annum. It is often interesting to go back to what previous health ministers have said. Back in August 1996, Graham Richardson said: As health minister I sponsored a number of measures to stop the drift from private health insurance which was increasing sharply at the time. I steered a package through the cabinet but resigned before I could sell it to the caucus. Practically the whole package died when I left as the Labor Party had always been a bit biased against private health insurance, and without a sponsor any proposal to help the industry was doomed. One idea I had which had no chance of ever being accepted by my caucus or cabinet colleagues was to charge an increased Medicare levy for highincome earners who refused to take out private health insurance. I was never comfortable with the thought of wealthy people elbowing battlers out of queues in public hospitals. That is the coalition's policy. Going back a bit earlier, I reviewed the speeches of Dr Blewett while he was health minister. He was Labor's-and the Commonwealth' s-longest serving health minister. The abolition of the Commonwealth bed day subsidy back in 1986 was estimated to have directly contributed to a blow-out in private health insurance premiums of 40 per cent. This is what he said in August 1986: The abolition of the Commonwealth private hospital subsidy is not of itself expected to have a major impact on private health insurance premiums, despite what has been said. He was wrong. Earlier when the Medicare legislation was being discussed he showed what is, essentially, Labor's view when it comes to private health insurance. He said: I should emphasise that there will be no need for anyone to take out hospital insurance if they are satisfied with the care provided in public hospitals by doctors employed on a salary or sessional basis by the hospital. This shows Labor's agenda. Labor would like an NHS type scheme. It is sometimes a bit contradictory. The current Labor spokesperson for conceded that the Australian health care system works best when there is a mix of public and private. He would probably like see a two-to-one balance; it is not even that now. He has also recognised that whatever difficulties we have in our health care system we are in a better position than countries. He has also gone on to say: ... before the last election we offered a tax for people with private health insurance ... Once again, that is coalition policy. By the to make. end of last year the member for Dobell had committed spending promises in excess of $6 billion. These are unfunded spending promises of $6 billion. He is the big spender of the Australian Labor Party. Here are some examples of his promises. The abolition of therapeutic goods premiums for PBS medicines. Is that Labor Party policy? Do you oppose it? You are silent. Restore savings from forward estimates agreed by the Premiers in costing $800 million: he opposed it at the time, and presumably he will not reverse Restoring funding for the dental health proministers gram-$400 million. Are you going to do that one? Support the states' demand for an extra $1.1 billion a year in base funding under the next five-year Medicare agreements. That would be $4Y2 million. This makes Kim ever Beazley look quite economical. And what about full indexation of the MBS standard consultation fee for GPs? That is another $160 million. In total it is over $6 000 million. Another policy the ALP has rec-ntly co-e up with has been to say that they will deliver a budget surplus. How? Are you going to produce a cos ted health policy? (Time expired) Mr Lee- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: the honourable member for Boothby at one stage q.uoted a figure of 12,000 or 13,000 people 10 my electorate receiving the tax rebate.

239,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"'This matter of public importance is about the lack of credibility in the human services and health portfolio because of the lack of credibility of the person who occupies the position of minister'-a quote from Dr Wooldridge, the member for Chisholm, in November 1995 in this chamber. I have been 1996in this place with a number of health ministers and I have seen in the community it. a level of discomfort with Labor health amongst the medical profession. But I have not often seen a speech as nasty and vindictive as the one the current minister gave in November 1995 in this chamber. I have not heard speeches as nasty as that. Nor have I found the level of angst and animosity to a federal health minister in the medical profession that I am finding now. I am finding life-long members of the AMA absolutely vilifying the current minister. The sense of betrayal is enonnous. This minister, in speech after speech after speech and MPI after MPI after MPI, attacked the previous government and said what he would do and what wonderful things they would achieve. The results are the opposite. We now have to work out what words in his speeches are his and what are not. I am concerned now as to whether or not what he said in the parliament were his words, either. I am a bit apprehensive about quoting his speeches because they may not have been his words. They may have been written by somebody else, as were his press releases and the departmental projections. We are finding Dr Wooldridge has a way with words. He weasels his way around them. You suddenly find that words do not mean what they say. And he used to do it so plausibly. We can go back and look at some of the examples-and the shadow minister made some comments earlier about his press release on the 1996 budget talking about the participation rate increasing by 1.5 per cent and the departmental figures at the same time. We go back to a speech in May 1995 in which he said that, if Labor stayed in power and things were not dramatically and massively changed, we would see this massive decline in health insurance; we would get to as low as 30 per cent by December 1997. He was warned at the same time by the then minister that if you spent your $1 Y2 billion subsidising and tax rebates you would not get a result; it would not make any difference. He was told that three years ago and two years ago, but he insisted on bringing in a rebate and ended up with much the same result, as he said, that we would have got with nothing. Let us look some more at his words. He is in here constantly talking about the average increase of four per cent over the last 10 years. That is a very clever way of putting it. Let us go back year by year and look at the increases. Over the four years up to 1996, the average is six per cent per year and for the previous three years, it is seven per cent per year. He is misusing the figures, and he knows it. This is a man who, in opposition, purported to be the honest doctor telling the truth: he knew the business; we were all politicians and amateurs, and he was a professional doctor-'You should trust me because I am a doctor'. What is he saying now? The weaseliest words of all, and that is why the animosity is so high. I think it will get worse because even with his prescriptions for his own problems he can still not cure them. Just over a year ago he was being very modest. He was saying, 'I am going to make modest promises'-this is February 1997'and we will see what happens.' He said, 'I have been consistent in doing that since before the last election.' So he says in February last year he had been making modest promises since before the last election. We have to remember that in the same month last year he said: Before the election we had these initiatives independently costed by an independent finn of economists. They predicted 40 per cent would be the level of coverage because of these incentives. This is in the parliament. This is in the Hansard on page 1326. He then said: I never thought that was right. Here he is in February 1997 saying that what they went to the election with in 1996, a year earlier, he never thought was right. Why didn'the tell us that then? The honest doctor in 1996 went to the people with the economists' predictions which he never thought were right, and he based the credibility of his party and a would be government on on his professional standing as a doctor-as someone who knew what he was talking about, unlike us who did not. That came through all the time when he was a shadow minister: he was the doctor; we were the politicians. We got it week in, week out and day after day-all that lecturing and hectoring from the honest doctor-and here he is saying just a year ago: I never thought that was right. I never - used that figure as any sort of public undertaking. The Prime Minister did. But perhaps that was not a core promise; perhaps that was not a core undertaking. So we have the Prime Minister saying today he did not deliberately deceive the Australian people, yet the minister is saying in the Hansard he did-because he knew they were not right and he did not correct the Prime Minister. In other words the professional, the expert, the guy who un'derstood the business, ""knew the economists were wrong but he did not tell the Prime Minister the people or the parliament. He finally fessed up to it last year. The unfortunate part is that he also actually says on the same day that he is not a pessimist; he thinks that they will put a floor under the decline-as of last year-and, further on, he says there and elsewhere that is going to increase. The fact is it kept on falling. So not only has he misused words to deceiveamong all the things that he has done-but he has also been wrong. That is what he should be judged for. He has not got a cure. He is a Dr Frankenstein. He has created a monster. He has cobbled together ideology with what was an effective working system. When we were bringing in legislation, Mr Deputy Speaker-and you will recall it wellin which we were shifting to allow the health funds to engage doctors as a way of providing 100 per cent coverage to try to give the health funds a product they could truly sell, he said, 'That is a waste of time because people are dropping out'-and this is what is so interesting--'not because of the gap but because of the price.' Back in May he referred to: . . . the main reason people drop out of private health insurance; and that is cost. Therefore we were wasting our time worrying about the gap. What are we hearing now? What were people telling us last night on the 7.30 Report and what do our constituents tell us every day? 'Why should I be insured when, if I have surgery, I have this massive gap to pay?' We understood the problem back in 1994 when we proposed the changes. He fought tooth and nail all the way through. When we had a chance of persuading the medical, hospital and insurance professions to work out a way of giving a person a product that protected them-if they were insured, they were fully covered-who opposed it? The current government. Who brought in last year a watered down version? Our legislation is still there; it has been watered down but it is still there and, let's face it, it is the chance he has got. You watch the next few months; you will see a road to Damascus conversion. The honest doctor will suddenly find the answer and-Io and behold !-he knew it all the time. It will be the previous legislation of the Labor government to give 100 per cent protection so that people insured with health funds will know that if anything happens to them they will be protected in first-class hospitals with first-class doctors, because Australia does not have two classes of doctors or hospitals; we have only one class. We have a first-class health system at the moment and we want to keep it that way. Because it is one class, we can be confident that people will be treated well by their doctors and their surgeons. When we set out to deceive deliberately-as he has clearly done by letting that 40 per cent figure go out-at elections, we undo ourselves. The doctor is undone. (Time expired)",66

241,Mrs STONE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I welcome the opportunity to speak on this government's performance as it wrestles with the legacy of more than a decade of Labor's mismanagement of Australia's public health sector. The member for Dobell (Mr Lee) referred to the public's concern about the costs of private health insurance. He implied that the decline in numbers insured is a recent trend. If only Labor was in government, he seems to argue, the community would happily line up to pay their private health insurance premiums. Let us look at the legacy of Labor. Let us consider the shape that Australia's health services were in after 13 years of Labor's efforts. Let us begin by looking at Labor's record of health care funding over the last 13 years. In the 1994-95 Labor budget, $51 million was cut from general practice programs, authority prescription changes meant a further cut of $42 million, $22 million was cut from aged care and funding to reduce hospital waiting lists was cut by some $20 million. Labor's 1995-96 budget saw a massive $540 million slashed from right across only the health portfolio. This included over $132 million cut from aged care. There were across the board cuts in the administration of health schemes, crippling many. And what about rural health and the chronic shortage of doctors that anyone representing a rural seat in Australia knows is the No. 1 issue when it comes to keeping families and attracting new business? The social infrastructure is essential and the shortage of doctors, nurses, pharmacists and paramedics of every description is a chronic problem. Apparently Labor did know of the problem. They heard about it, no doubt, on a very infrequent trip into the bush, because in 199293 they introduced a doctor relocation incentive scheme where some $20,000 or so was offered to help doctors remove to a regional area. The trouble with that was that they did not understand exactly what non-metropolitan Australia was all about-nor do they now. For example, you could not get the $20,000 if you shifted from Melbourne to the regional centre of Shepparton. Shepparton is indeed only two hours from Melbourne, but it has a chronic doctor shortage and it has been that way for decades. If, however, you were in a one-doctor town in northern Victoria in another part of the electorate of Murray, say, Kerang, you could get that relocation allowance to go to an even smaller no-doctor town a few kilometres down the road. So it was a case of just shifting the deckchairs on the Titanic as it slowly sank. Since that time, there has been, fortunately, a massive public rejection of the Labor Party and its policies. No doubt, one of the most seriously concerning parts of Labor's policies was the impact of their health budgets and their health policies. In particular, let me talk about what we have done since we inherited this very parlous situation. We have addressed rural health issues in particular. There is a whole series of initiatives now going to the heart of the problem. Too frequently the young men and women who choose to study medicine come from metropolitan Australia. They have no consciousness or understanding of the bush. So when they do finally graduate, they choose to practise in metropolitan areas as general practitioners or, indeed, as specialists. But government has set up five departments of rural health, and I am very fortunate in Murray to have one of those departments because, unfortunately, we have one of the most chronic shortages of health practitioners of all descriptions across Australia. These departments of rural health are innovative. They are a strategic alliance between a university department of medicine and a local regional hospital. We are expecting to see young doctors, specialists, nurses or paramedics do some of their training in these regional centres. We hope that, while they are there, they will learn extra skills necessary to practise in the bush. But we hope they will also become enculturated, and they will not be fearful of bringing their families to live in areas beyond the tram tracks of the capital cities. Our government has a range of such initiatives. They include scholarships for young rural students-the John Flynn scholarshipsand scholarships, for rural nurse practitioners. We will make sure' that over the years we address the chr()nic health service provider imbalance. Let us look at other initiatives that go beyond regional Australia. For example, we have tackledthe.imrtlUnisation rates. After 13 years or so' of Labor, we' had Third World levels of immunisationofoul' young children. We were looking at whooping cough, measles and rubella outbreaks that were a scourge of our country in, the,1950s.'We have had to set about educating a whole generation of young mothers about the significance and the importance of immunisation- 'This government is taking this very ,seriously and we are putting millions of dollars towards giving incentives to heIp 'generakpractitioners spread the word and to,make sure parents understand the need for child immunisation. We are tackling problems associated with the harm done by illicit drugs. We hive put some $87.5 million into a national illicit drug strategy. We are tackling the problems associated with the differences between the bureaucracies administering health services-in the states and' the C()mmollwealth. III particular, our nationalpliblic health partnerships are this designed to cut through the bureaucracy to make sure the dollars go to service provision and not to ted tape. A number of these strategic partnerships .have already been signed between' the Commonwealth and the states and they continue to be signed. It is a major step forward. ' Of course, most people here will have been celebrating the !;u-cessful introduction of the therapeutic gn;>uppremiums to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. This, isa very reasonable balance between what taxpayers and the individual are going to be asked to pay. We had an incredible system' where the cost to taxpayers of pharmaceuticals in this country had blown out to more than $2.5 billion in 1996-97. This government is tackling the problem in a w-y that the previous minister for health under Labor could only dream about. She understood the problem, she attempted to address it, but all we saw was the further ballooning of the costs of pharmaceuticals. We are tackling the mental health issues in this country. In fact we are putting $28 million over the next four years into a national mental health strategy. We are not just putting dollars towards projects; we are insisting on, 'Projects with outcomes'. We are measuring those outcomes. No more will we sit back and say, 'We put $28 million towards the problem. That's okay; we can walk away.' We are identifying what outcomes are needed for the people in this nation who need special mental health services. We are doing the same for our indigenous citizens who have major health issues. No more do we simply say, 'There are so many millions of dollars thrown at the problems.' We are talking about identifying and monitoring improved health outcomes which we negotiate with the providers of those health care options and with the people who are suffering from the health problems in those communities. There are a whole range of initiatives. None of them in the past was addressed in a way that was ever going to deliver a better health service in this nation. Yet all the member for Dobell, the shadow minister for health, can talk about is how come the public is concerned about the cost of private health insurance. Of course the public is concerned. It is a major issue and a major problem. It is no good simply describing the problem. I strongly recommend to the Labor Party that they watch closely and see what this government is doing in terms of funding the health needs of this nation, making sure that people can access health services no matter what their income is. I invite them to watch how we are addressing the imbalance between medical services provided in the cities and medical services provided in the country. It is not fair that, because this nation is so huge, those who live several hours from a metropolitan city can expect to see their young children suffer because they have no access to preventative health regimes or ready access to a local general practitioner. To continue to have these issues brought up as matters of public importance which never address the real problems associated with health service in Australia, but simply try to politicise and score points over people's concerns in the public domain, is a very cynical exercise. I invite the Labor Party instead to participate in helping us form better health service provision for the nation from this day on.",68
242,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The discussion has now concluded. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1997 [No.2] Second Reading Debate resumed.,70
243,Mr MAREK,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"In continuing my speech from before question time, I think there are a few points that we need to go over to kick-start the debate in the best part of the right direction. As I was saying prior to question time, the Labor Party had the pilots strike many years ago under the Hawke government. The pilots paid their dues for years. They did the right thing by the union movement and of course the Labor Party. What did the Labor Party do? They sacked them. That is right; they put them down the road. We hear in this debate the Labor Party saying that employers want to have the ability to sack their employees. This is the height of hypocrisy; to think that the Labor Party believes employers just want to be able to sack people. Ultimately, people just want a job. You cannot get sacked before you get a job. Commonsense prevails. You have to give small business the opportunity. As I was saying before, it was not just the pilots who suffered under the Labor Party. The mining industry copped a hiding as well. But what about the meat industry union people who lost their jobs from AMH meat works in Rockhampton? They not only lost their jobs but also their holiday pay, leave entitlements and long-service provisions. What did the Labor member for Capricornia do then? Absolutely nothing. What a poor show. In the past I have talked about the credibility of the Labor Party, particularly in relation to industrial relations. I think it is important, on reflection, to talk about just what exactly is unfair dismissal. Is it putting someone off because they have been stealing from the cash register or sacking someone because they have been stealing plant and equipment from your business? In both cases, because you did not tell your employees in writing that they were not allowed to do it, you could not let them go. This situation is, what I would consider, legislation gone wrong. If somebody in your employ is obviously doing the wrong thing, you have caught them red handed, you cannot let them go. It is absolutely crazy. Can you imagine, if you caught somebody thieving out of the till, keeping them on and having to go through the process of giving them letter after letter before you can let them go? It is absolutely crazy. If that is not the square peg in the round hole material, I do not know what is. It certainly goes to show that the Labor Party has no idea of what this unfair dismissal legislation is all about. I was talking earlier about Bob Hawke. Somebody mentioned to me the other day that Bob Hawke should have the opportunity, under the Labor Party's unfair dismissal laws, to claim unfair dismissal by Labor. After what the Labor Party and Keating did to him, he would probably be well worth a payout. Digressing slightly, I was listening with interest to the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) from the ALP last night. He was rattling 101 to the dozen about the legislation, that we want to change the material from December 1996 of the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith). Even if this were the case, that we wanted to rehash Reith's legislation, I would consider Chery I Kemot, the new member of the Labor Party, as having responsibility for it, because it is actually Cheryl Kemot's workplace relations bill. As I believe it, she will probably end up being the next leader of the opposition anyhow. So, as far as I can see, Labor would have to take the brunt for that as well. One could say that she and the Labor Party are doing nothing more than selling the unions out again. More to the point, since she jumped ship to you guys, you must have had a hand in the Cheryl Kemot workplace relations legislation from the start. So, once again, it is your problem, not ours. I have broached this issue from the workers' side. Now let us look at it from the point of view of an employer-someone like me, who owned my own panel beating and spray-painting shop for nine years in Central Queensland employing four people on a full time basis. This legislation we are trying to introduce here is a shot in the arm for small business and a significant kick-start for employment. It is a sensible initiative, and it will apply to new employees only· and will not affect apprentices. The vast majority of small business people I have spoken to since being elected to office have told me that, if there is one thing that is significantly holding back new employment opportunities, it is this unfair dismissal law. Small business would rather lose some business or pay someone overtime than take on new staff. All that the young unemployed people in my electorate want is a job. They want a chance to prove and improve themselves, but they are not getting this chance because of the current laws which relate, as I said before, to the square peg in a round hole theory. Most young people in Capricornia could not care less about dismissal. They just want a job. Dismissal, to them, is something that happens if they do something very wrong after getting a job-not before. As far as we can see, the youth of this great nation just want a job and the Labor Party is denying them this opportunity. More to the point, under this legislation employees will be protected by other provisions of the Workplace Relations Act, such as section 170CK, which protects employees against dismissal for any discriminatory reason. Sections 170MU and 170WEprohibit dismissal because the employee engages in protected industrial action, in seeking a certified agreement or in an AWA action. Section 298K, in the freedom of association part of the act, prohibits dismissal on grounds contrary to the principle of freedom of association. Section 170CM prohibits dismissal without one to five weeks notice, depending on length of serviee and age, or pay in lieu except in cases of serious misconduct. This indicates employees·· will· . have . plenty of protection working forthel,l1 arrd they will not have to be concerned about changes to the Workplace· Relations Act. Facts speak better than rhetoric, so I will provide the opposition with sufficient facts which support small business exemption froin federal unfair dismissal provisions. A Morgan and Banks survey in 1996 indicated that 16 per cent of businesses with fewer than 30 employees had be(:Q adversely ·affected in their hiring intellti.ons by the previous federal unfair dismissa.1laws.· A Recruitment Solutions survey in 1997 indicated that 32 per cent of businesses in Sydney; Melbourne and Brisbane had been the subject of unfair dismissal claims in the previous 12 months. The Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia said that small business would create 50,000 jobs i(this bill were passed into law. A New South Wales Chamber of Commerce survey shdwed that unfair dismissal claims had disc6uraged 56 per cent of businesses from recruiting additional staff. The Yellow Pages Small Business Index Survey of 1997 indicated that 79 per cent of proprietors thought small businesses would be better off if they were exempted from unfair dismissal laws, while 33 per cent of small businesses said that they would recruit new employees if they had been exempted and 38 per cent reported. that they .would be more likely to recruit new employees if they were exempted from the unfair dismissal laws. We see the material. People have been out there and have done. the· hard yards. They have done surveys and spoken to people in the community. The consultation has been done and we know where we stand. So why haven't we passed the law? I think it is absolutely imperative that the· Labor Party work with us on this, rather. than against us, for the benefit of· the. youth ·of this great nation. .... This coalition government ·has listened, as I said, to the concerns of the small business sector. It has implemented a number of initiatives to reduce the paperwork burden and to cut red tape imposed by the former government. The coalition government has untied the hands of small business people all over the country and given them more time to devote to their businesses instead of filling in forms. But the icing on the cake is exemption from unfair dismissal laws. If this passes into law we will have addressed the majority of concerns of small businesses, which will transfer into more jobs and a more productive business sector and less interference from bureaucracy-a win-win situation for everyone. The Labor Party's platform on small business says Labor will seek the means of giving small business a greater incentive to provide jobs. The biggest incentive Labor could give the small business sector is passing this legislation without amendment. Ultimately, give our legislation a shot. If you do not think it is any good and the people put you into power at the next election, you can try to change it back.",70
244,Mr ANDREN,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"The member for Capricornia (Mr Marek) alludes to the sacking of Bob Hawke. I wonder how unfair is the demise today of our respected Speaker. Let me repeat from the outset some words from my contribution to this debate the first time round: The unfair dismissal law was a disincentive to employment, and that was made patently clear to me . . . in the course of the last election campaignand in discussions with small business ever since. I recently had a working breakfast with Bathurst business operators. Unfair dismissal laws remain a problem but far from the problem for small business. I put it to the House then, and it still applies, that, while unfair dismissal has been an important issue impacting on small business, it certainly is not the major one. My new independent colleague, the member for Lowe (Mr Zammit), asked yesterday about action on the Reid report into fair trading and in particular action on the renewal of leases for sitting tenants. That is more germane to the problems of small business than unfair dismissal. The exploitative rental regime in regional shopping centres and overheads for small business, including payroll tax and workers compensation-these are the major issues affecting small business. I spoke last time of the need to regulate franchising and, in particular, the petroleum industry's franchise system, with the benefits all in favour of the oil companies. That is another area needing urgent reform. Small business operators want to be in a position to employ before they worry too much about the terms and conditions of employment. That goes in a regional sense to the sort of incentives and support that govern to ment might offer to small business in regional areas of Australia. I have no objections with this bill exempting businesses employing no more than 15 workers from the unfair dismissal provisions of the act. I say this because the unlawful dismissal provisions of the act remain intact. This includes dismissal for discriminatory reasons such as sexual preference, age, union membership and family responsibilities. Let me revisit some of the comments made last night by government and opposition members on this bill. The member for Robertson (Mr Lloyd) convincingly detailed the protection for employees unlawfully dismissed, as contained in this bill. None of the protections under the unlawful dismissal provisions will be removed by the passing of this '-Jill. The member referred to his experience in small business and the disincentive for a very small employer from the unfair dismissal provisions and how expensive and time-consuming such action could be. That is true and that is why I have no problems with this particular bill. The member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) pointed out-I gather, from the remarks in the Hansard-the unfairness of the three months period of grace in which an employer can work out if their employee is up to the mark. Such a process has been in place in my former occupation in the television industry for many years. As I said in my previous comments on this bill late last year, such a three-month period, after which either party could part company without prejudice, worked perfectly well. I as a manager had absolutely no problems with it, nor did any of my employees. There are many exaggerations in this debate on both the advantages and drawbacks of this particular piece of legislation. But it is certainly not 'everyone to the barricades' stuff. n is not the end of the world as we know it for the workers of this country or the employers, although you would be forgiven for thinking otherwise judging by the rhetoric we have heard from both sides on this. So it makes me wonder why this particular bill becomes the first trigger for the double dissolution we have to have. It does not seem me to excite the passion of the electorate but it does add up, with the Wik bill and the charter of budget honesty, to make a trifecta of bills likely to founder on the rocks of the Senate. The passion of the electorate of course would surround the native title billlargely bitter and divisive passions. The charter of budget honesty and the unfair dismissal bills on their own would hardly excite the gatekeeper at Yarralumla, let alone the electorate. So one does not have to be very smart to realise that if the government seeks a double dissolution, it will be doing so on the basis of native title. That is a divisive and tragic route to take. To hold this parliament to ransom over a bill amended to the satisfaction of even some of the government's own members with a conscience is tragic. This debate on this bill is really an academic exercise. I do not propose to go through the arguments I gave on 27 August last defending the legislation in the interests of small business and employment opportunities, particularly in country and regional areas where jobs are so scarce and where trust, not mistrust, should be the basis of the mutually acceptable employment contract-not a contract in a formal sense, I might add, but that special understanding between a country town employer and his staff. I would suggest that in a business of fewer than 15, that sort of trust still exists in that market-driven mania. The opposition has made it very clear that it will maintain its opposition to this bill, and I suppose that the vote in the Senate is likely to remain unchanged. But I would suggest to Senator Harradine, the Democrats and the opposition that there is nothing so sinister in this Workplace Relations Amendment Bill 1997 [No.2] to warrant its being a manufactured part of a three bill trigger to bring on a double dissolution. I think the Senate should pass this bill and call the government's bluff-defuse the trigger so there are fewer grounds for a double dissolution. The key to microeconomic reform is micro reform of our constitution, and fixed four-year terms for federal parliament should be part of that. The Senate and its right to amend legislation is a fact of life consistently delivered by the electorate of Australia. There is no escaping it, whichever party is in government. Get real, get with the reality of the Senate, get Prosser, G. D. real about its right to amend within reason, get real about the amended Native Title Act and 7Y2 out of 10 is not a bad mark starting from such polls to reach such an agreement. A race based election in this country will be far more a tragedy for the cohesion of Australia, especially rural and regional Australia, than the perceived effects of this particular piece of legislation on the workers of Australia. I urge the opposition, I urge the Democrats and I urge all of those senators in the other place to think long and hard about this and remove one of those triggers.

SOCIAL SECURITY AND VETERANS' NA AMENDMENT (BUDGET AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 1997 Second Reading Debate resumed from 3 December 1997, on motion by Mr Ruddock: . That the bill be now read a second time.",72
245,Ms MACKLIN,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"I want to say at the outset that the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measurers) Bill contains a number of different measures, some of which are positive, which we welcome, and some of which appear to be simply budget saving measures. On the positive side, there are the measures which will help carers. The time during which a carer may cease their caring activities whilst still qualifying for the carer payment has been increased from 52 days to 63 days a year. This brings the carer payment provisions into line with existing provisions relating to the child disability allowance, the domiciliary nursing care benefit and the Commonwealth's respite programs. This is a very welcome change. It will enable people caring for sick or disabled relatives or friends to get a an extra break or maybe take up some extra work. It is a very positive measure. The treatment of income streams in schedule 3 is designed to simplify the current very complex system and to stop people who have sizeable assets parked in what have been short-term, asset-test-exempt income streams from also claiming the age pension. The majority of people who invest in income streams will not be affected by these proposals, but some 2,100 people will lose their pensions because they have sizeable amounts of money invested in certain fixed-term superannuation and other schemes. In the interests of a more streamlined income stream system and a consistent retirement incomes policy, the opposition is broadly supportive of the government's proposal. However, while the bill will provide favourable asset test treatment for certain income stream products which are underpinned by fixed interest assets, it does not practically allow for products which are underpinned by a balanced portfolio. Fixed interest based products may result in lower returns than balanced portfolio based products and hence lower retirement incomes. There are some other serious problems with other parts of the bill, particularly the way in which it proposes to extend the carer payment to carers of certain under-16-year-olds and the way in which the government proposes to introduce a period of non-payment for certain seasonal and contract workers. I will deal with these issues in some detail. First, I will deal with the payment to carers of people under the age of 16. Although the extension of the carer payment for those caring for children with a disability who are under the age of 16 sounds like a positive move in principle, it is difficult to see from the material that has been made available who will actually benefit from this proposal. Most of those who might qualify for the payment under the proposal are already in receipt of the parenting allowance or special benefit. This may help to account for the fact that anticipated outlays in respect of the measure are just a little over $1 million a year up to the year 2001. It means that no more than bit of about 100 people-maybe slightly morearound Australia will be eligible for this payment. I would be grateful if the government could provide some guidance to the opposition about who and what type of family will be better off under this proposal. The number of people who would benefit under the proposal is further restricted by the fact that the criteria in respect of under-16year-olds are much more restrictive than the existing criteria for older people. At the moment, over-16-year-olds must be severely handicapped for their carers to qualify for the carer payment. To be severely handicapped, the person's disability must be such that they require frequent care in connection with their bodily functions or require constant supervision to prevent injury to himself or herself or to another person. That is the current definition for over-16s. Under the bill, a child who is under 16 must be profoundly disabled for his or her carer to qualify. The definition of that term is far more onerous than the current definition of 'severely handicapped'. I must say it is difficult to see the logic behind the distinction in definitions between disabled people under 16 and those over 16. Does it mean that the burden of caring for a disabled child changes on their sixteenth birthday? I doubt it. Under the proposed definition of 'profoundly disabled child', what must be satisfied, if the carer is to qualify for the payment, is that the child's disability must give rise to at three of the following seven specific circumstances: that the child must be tube fed; that the child has a tracheotomy; that the child requires a ventilator for at least eight hours a day; that the child has urinary and faecal incontinence; that the child cannot stand without support; that the child's condition is terminal and palliative care has replaced active treatment; and that the child requires personal care on at least two occasions between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. each day. There are a number of other conditions which most certainly render a child profoundly disabled but which would not satisfy the required three circumstances. For example, some children suffer from severe epilepsy which cannot be adequately controlled by medication. This condition leaves them prone to frequent severe fits, and their safety may depend on the constant and vigilant supervision of the carer. Similarly, some children with severe psychiatric conditions need constant intensive care and supervision to prevent them from injuring themselves, other people or property. Some children who suffer from profound intellectual disabilities need help in relation to most daily activities, including feeding, dressing and toileting. Some of these children must be spoon fed highly processed food, and yet they may well not satisfy three of the seven conditions. A more comprehensive list of circumstances than the seven provided for in the bill is needed to ensure that it covers the kinds of cases I have outlined. There may, of course, be other conditions which render a child profoundly disabled which would not fit neatly into the proposed criteria. I would suggest that there is a need for a general discretion to regard as relevant other circumstances which have not been anticipated. The second area I want to talk about tonight is the preclusion period for seasonal and contract workers. I particularly want to draw attention to the proposal in schedule 4 of the bill to impose a non-payment period upon certain seasonal and contract workers. This means that seasonal workers who earn above average weekly earnings during the six months before claiming social security will least have to wait an extra period before they can be paid a benefit. For example, a seasonal or contract worker who earned $37,000 in 26 weeks, and whose earnings were uniform over that period, would have to wait six months before he or she could claim benefits. I have some concerns about the fact that this bill seems to penalise seasonal work. A worker who earned over the relevant average earnings figure that is defined in the bill in any six-month period and then lost their job would not face an extra waiting period-that is, a normal worker who earns the relevant average weekly earnings figure in any sixmonth period. If they lose their job, they are not going to face an extra waiting period, but a seasonal worker earning the same amount over that period would. What I would like from the minister is some rationale for this change. We should be encouraging people to participate in the work force, not penalising them. The bill contains a formula for determining the length of the non-payment period. This focuses on the question of whether the person earned above average weekly earnings-and this is the important point-during the weeks in which they actually worked over the six months prior to claiming a social security payment, rather than whether they earned above average wages over the whole period. The period starts on the day after the person stops work. Seasonal work which commences prior to the six-month period but continues into that period will also be taken into account. This is likely to lead to unfair results in cases where the claimant has engaged in seasonal work during a number of discrete periods during the relevant six months and lived on their savings without claiming a social security payment during the intervening periods of unemployment. The proposal fails to take account of the periods during which the person lived on their savings. For example, a person might have seasonal work for the first two of the six months prior to claiming a newstart allowance and might then live on their savings from that work for the next three months before finding seasonal work for a further month. If they applied for the newstart allowance after completing that month's seasonal work, their preclusion period would begin on the day after they completed that work and its length would be determined on the basis of all the work they did in the six-month period and the income they received while working, without regard to the fact that they were without income for three of the six months. We are also concerned that the proposed start date is 1 July this year, which means that people currently engaged in seasonal work will be affected-only they do not know it yet. The opposition will be moving amendments in the Senate to address these issues. We will be moving amendments to both the definition of a 'profoundly disabled child' and the seasonal worker sections of the bill. We will not be moving amendments to the income streams sections but, as far as we are concerned, there are some issues which require further debate and discussion, particularly as they relate to the asset test treatment of certain income streams. We are proposing to send a reference to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation to examine this particular issue. As I said at the outset, the opposition welcomes the positive changes in this bill, particularly for carers. We also welcome the improvement in the treatment of income streams. Carers do an outstanding job in our community, looking after the elderly and the disabled, and this will enable people to have a greater amount of respite and still qualify for the carer payment. That is a very positive move. As I said, however, there are a number of areas of concern, particularly in the extension of the carer payment to under 16-yearolds because it is not clear to us that very many people at all will in fact benefit from this payment. It seems so tightly constrained that very few people will benefit. In fact, the government's projections of how much it intends to spend in this area-only about $1 million per year-would lead us to believe that only about 100 carers throughout all of Australia-and I am sure that there are many more than 100 people caring for profoundly disabled children-will be entitled to this new payment. If the government is serious about extending a carer payment to those caring for profoundly disabled children, it needs to get serious about making sure that those who are carrying out that very important function will in fact be eligible for that payment. As far as seasonal workers are concerned, we do recognise that it is important that people who have the capacity to support themselves as a result of seasonal work do so. Nevertheless, as far as the opposition is concerned, we do not think the current formula proposed by the government in this bill will be fair and that it will penalise some seasonal workers-and we will propose some amendments in the Senate when the time comes.",75
246,Mrs ELIZABETH GRACE,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"I rise to support the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Bill currently before this House. Today, political parties are frequently accused of not adequately demonstrating, through their policy, what they stand for .. This accusation cannot legitimately be made of the Liberal Party. I am pleased to say that the measures proposed by the government in this bill represent a contemporary interpretation of long standing Liberal philosophy. They are, in effect, a restatement of the basic Liberal tenets of commitment to individual freedoms-freedom of choice, freedom of opportunity-and provision for those who are disadvantaged. Furthermore, these principles are to be delivered within the framework of a small but effective and efficient government. The bill currently before the House amending the Social Security Act 1991 and the Veterans Entitlement Act of 1986 contains a number of innovative initiatives. It will introduce for the first time a payment for carers of profoundly disabled children under the age of 16. Whilst historically there has been a recognilosing tion of the selfless and tireless work of carers for profoundly disabled adults, there has been no comparable recognition of the same sacrifice made by parents and carers of profoundly disabled children. Certainly, parental care is born out of natural love and affection for children and an instinctive duty to provide for them. It is care that is not contingent upon the availability of monetary compensation. But the demands upon the lives of parents to provide this full-time care are no less challenging than the demands placed on carers of disabled adults. The enormous stress on the lives of full-time carers of disabled persons, regardless of age or relationship, cannot be overemphasised. Therefore, I am pleased to advocate the government's intention to recognise the valuable contribution made to our community by parents and other carers of profoundly disabled children. We propose that the carers of profoundly disabled persons under the age of 16, caring for that child in a private residence, be eligible for carer payments, subject to an income and assets test. We are concerned to ensure that carers have adequate levels of income, and that their opportunity to participate in society is maximised. In regard to maximising the opportunities to participate in society, the bill also builds upon our previous initiatives to increase the number of days that a carer can have in the form of a break from caring for disabled persons and still remain eligible for domiciliary nursing care benefit, carer payment or child disability allowance. The period has been extended from 52 to 63 days. These measures are confirmation of the Liberal government's commitment to social justice-a concept that the Labor Party would like all Australians to believe is something they have a mortgage on. But, in truth, responsiveness and innovation in the social justice field is a founding feature of Liberalism. The Liberal way of giving individuals \ Tuesday, 3 March 1998 more freedom, allowing them to make more of their own choices, contrasts with the collective emphasis of Laborism. This bill proposes to increase the scope for the unemployed to provide care without their payments. The newstart allowance activity test for carers will be extended beyond the 13-week limit in special circumstances. We recognise the existence of individual circumstances and the value of private care, and have therefore built into the social security system flexibility and responsiveness. Our aim is to create an environment for the best possible provision of services, satisfying the varying needs of individuals. This is in contrast to Labor's traditional broad-brush approach that can only deliver mediocrity. At this point it is pertinent to refer to the initiative of this government in 1996 to establish the Commonwealth service delivery agency, Centrelink. This major organisational change made the role of the social security administrative arm of the government much smaller. We have a commitment to small government and the belief that government should only be involved in the provision of services to the public where the private sector cannot better deliver those services. We, therefore, believe that the primary role of government in regard to social services should be the policy development: the charting of strategic directions facilitating change, leadership and advice. Thus, the major alteration to the service delivery vehicle for social services has been the dismantling of the inflexible and unresponsive bureaucracy and replacing it with simplified arrangements, best practice and a focus on quality and simplified service provision. A strong managerial culture is now committed to protecting the integrity of the social security system. It is our duty to be accountable and responsible to the electorate. Therefore, we will ensure that, as far as possible, the hard earned taxpayers' dollar will be well spent and that the rorting of the system does not occur. We propose to make well-targeted payments, to have clear and easily understandable rules and a strong emphasis on compliance. Those in genuine need of assistance will receive it. But we will diligently pursue action to recover social security fraud and overpayments, and close any loopholes. Pursuant to budgetary measures, this bill prohibits the disposal of assets for the purpose of obtaining a benefit in the form of a carer's payment. It also addresses some loopholes in current social security legislation. For example, seasonal workers, who earn relatively high incomes for part of the year and are then technically out of work for part of the year, have been able to claim benefits. We intend to retain the safety net for those in genuine need. However, the proposed changes will make it difficult for highly paid seasonal workers to claim, unless they satisfy a financial disadvantage test. A preclusion period will prevent a worker from obtaining benefits straight away. The amount of work done in the previous six months, each individual's income and the partner's situation will be assessed. Not only is this a flexible approach; it is a fair and respon-ible course of action for the government. Similarly, preclusion periods will apply to seasonal workers seeking other benefits such as widow allowa,nce, parenting allowance, news tart allowance, mature age allowance and partner allowance. Again, there is the flexibility to consider each case individually to assess financial hardship that may be caused in a number of ways, including inability to realise assets or where it is unreasonable to expect certain assets to be sold. I emphasise that the proposed legislation is not, as ill-informed critics may charge, a case of economic rationalism. It is the embodiment of social justice in the context of responsible government. Finally, I wish to refer to proposed amendments that refine superannuation or other self-funded financial arrangements. This bill will give greater incentives to retirees to take a long-term income stream, it will encourage the use of superannuation and other investments to provide income in retirement and it will provide for the consistent treatment of lump sum payments. Furthermore, it will introduce a fairer assets test, it will ensure transparency of assets of the very wealthy and it will allow for exemptions where there are contractual arrangements or where significant penalties may apply to products purchased prior to the budget. For social security purposes, exemptions will be extended under the income test and may include things such as lottery wins and one-off gifts. Furthermore, private savings will be encouraged through the introduction of the deferred pension bonus plan and the simplification of means test treatment of income streams. I believe this package of reforms is significant and positive as well as being appropriate for these times. Not only is a strong thread of liberal philosophy woven through this proposed legislation; it will be delivered through efficient workings of the Westminster system of responsible government. We have listened to constituent stakeholders, seen the need for change and responded to that need in a way that maximises the delivery of service to the public. This is done through employing sound managerial practices, the avoidance of waste and over-bureaucratisation and maintaining high standards of accountability to all Australians to whom we are responsible. The initiatives in this legislation now before the House deserve support. I commend the contents of the bill to the members of the House.",77
247,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"We have just heard all the usual slogans: social justice, innovation, accountability, concern with rorting, the tireless efforts of carers, et cetera. However, in reality, as the shadow minister indicated, there is a bit more than targeting at stake here. For instance, if we look at the seasonal workers situation, we are not talking about national grand scale corruption and evasion. We are not talking about the kind of emphasis that the taxation office should be placing on family trusts, which has virtually become a qualification to be in the government at this stage. It is a qualification in this country now to be a minister that you must be involved in family trusts. Today the real emphasis of this government is on squeezing people at the margins of society, squeezing people who are involved in the seasonal employment by this formula. Who are we talking about? We are talking about people who are involved in cotton picking in Wee Waa, people who are fruit picking around Mildura and people who are droving in the Northern Territory. We are talking about people who are usually outside the trade union movement and who have minimal protection from it. We have this rhetoric about accountability to taxpayers, but it is very questionable as to whether these should be the matters that the government should be emphasising in regard to evasion and social security tightening in this country. As the shadow minister indicated, this formula means that people could be denied up to six months of benefits and it is hitting the weakest elements of society. There are very good and fundamental reasons for opposing it. After the sanctimonious statements about the tireless efforts and the unrecognised endeavours of carers over many decades, the fact is that for those who are granted this benefit for children under 16 years of age it is accompanied by a very hard and very strenuous test. It will be interesting to hear the speakers who follow me justifying bringing into this parliament and to the Australian people profound reasons why there should be a distinction between people over 16 years of age. As the shadow minister indicated, there is a very strong difference in definitions·. As she also pointed out, the amount of money involved in this measure is about $1 million, as I understand it. That has been calculated as possibly helping out 100-odd people in Australia-less than one per electorate in the country. All of the heralding of this measure and all of the trumpet blowing should be seen in that context. It is welcome that some people will receive it. As to those people that this government so grandly praise, those people that they say are so much of a benefit to this country-they might already receive perennial or special benefits-there will not be many more of them picking up money through this change because of definitions. The opposition is on firm ground by saying that, while there is a variety of worthwhile measures in this legislation, on these two specifics there is a need for amendment. The Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Bi111997 also seeks to amend the Social Security Act and Veterans' Entitlements Act to clarify the income and assets test treatment of income streams, particularly retirement income streams. It is this last aspect of the bill and its impact on veterans that I wish. to particularly address in my contribution tonight. In essence, the bill seeks to ensure that income streams received by veterans and social security pensioners are assessed according to set and consistent criteria rather than according to whether they are paid by a bank, a superannuation fund, a friendly society or a life insurance company or whether they happen to be labelled as an annuity, a pension, an allotted pension or an allotted annuity. The object is to achieve a greater degree of consistency and neutrality in the income security systems treatment of the growing market for income stream products. Income streams are defined as a regular series of payments made for life or fixed term that either a person purchases with a capital sum or is made directly from an accumulated superannuation account. It is estimated that there are around 65,000 Veterans' Affairs pensioners who receive an income stream on top of their pension. Most of these are service pensioners in receipt of a superannuation pension from a public sector superannuation fund. The figure of 65,000 also includes veterans who have purchased an income stream using part of their lump sum retirement benefit. As the service pen&ion is a means tested payment, income streams are potentially affected by the income and assets test. Under the income test most financial investments are subject to extended deeming rules and are deemed to produce a set rate of return as determined by the government. If a pensioner's deemed investment income exceeds the income test free area, their pension is reduced on a 50c in the dollar basis. A parallel process applies with the assets test, with the important proviso that the value of a person's home is excluded, unlike some other measures the government has recently tried to enforce. Which test-incomes or assets-results in the lower rate of payment is the one that applies. In introducing this bill the government has highlighted two difficulties with the current system of assessing income streams. Firstly, there has been a proliferation of income stream products in the marketplace. Undoubtedly, this is due to the growing importance of retirement income savings and particularly to the success of the Labor government's policy of widening access to superannuation coverage throughout this country. In particular, the private market has developed a number of new products which have a fixed, often short-tenn, duration and which provide access to a substantial lump sum pay-out at the end of this tenn. This means that lifetime pensions with no residual capital are no longer the norm in the retirement incomes market. The second and related reason lies in the difficulty in detennining whether such products, particularly newer products, should be mainly treated as income for pension purposes or primarily as an asset that is gradually being depleted over the years. The government has also cited evidence that some newer products have been specifically designed to take advantage of loopholes in the current rules. For example, some providers of financial products have begun selling annuities for periods as short as one year-products which allow rich people to temporarily evade the assets test because annuities have traditionally been exempt assets. In other cases mentioned in the explanatory memorandum, financial advisers have helped wealthy families circumvent the means test by developing contracts under which parents allegedly sell assets to their children in return for the children agreeing to pay them an annuity. In such cases, annuity payments are never actually made, thus suggesting that the true nature of the arrangement was to hide substantial assets for assets test purposes. There are also clear inconsistencies in the present system where essentially similar products are treated differently for pension purposes. For example, currently, fixed tenn superannuation pensions are exempt from the assets test whereas fixed term annuities are not. This is clearly inconsistent. There is no doubt that there were grounds to review the treatment of financial products to identify any such inconsistencies and to close off avenues for evading the pension means test. As a result of an in-house review, the government has essentially decided to institute a system whereby all income streams will be classified as falling into one of three categories. Life products or other long-tenn products which prevent access to the original capital investment will be exempted from the assets test and will receive concessional treatment under the income test. Other long-term products which do not totally prevent access to the original capital investment will be included in the assets test and will receive concessional treatment under the income test. Finally, short-tenn financial products which are for five years or less will be included in the assets test and will be income tested under the general extended deeming rules. The changes come into effect in September and apply to pensioners under both the Veterans' Entitlement Act and the Social Seduity Act. An essential element of the classification system is that concessional treatment under the pension means test is provided to income streams that are structured so as to provide a genuine and long-term retirement income. This is a worthy objective. In practical tenns, maximum concessional treatment will be given to products that produce a lifetime income stream or a life expectancy income stream purchased at or over pension age. These products must be non-commutable and must not provide a residual capital value. These products will be completely exempt from the assets test amJ, for income test purposes, the resulting income will be reduced by an amount equal to the purchase price provided by either the term of the product or the person's life expectancy. The second category of long-tennproducts that may allow some access to the original capital investment receives similar treatment under the income test but will be included under the assets test. The process by which this is to occur is somewhat complex. The third and final category of products which cover investments for a term of five years or less are to be assessed under both the income and assets tests, as such investments do not provide a genuine, long-term retirement income. They will be brought within the extended deeming rules and be treated in the same way as a bank account or similar investment. According to the explanatory memorandum, the overall budgetary impact of the changes is essentially neutral. The changes do not appear to be driven by the obsession with reducing spending that has characterised so many other of the government's changes to social security and veterans' programs, including, as I said, aspects of this bill. This does not mean that the bill will not produce significant impacts, either positive or negative, on individual pensioners. I have not seen a detailed estimate for veteran pensioners but for social security pensioners it has been estimated that over 80 per cent of those with income streams will not be affected one way or the other, about 11 per cent will be better off, about six per cent will have their rate of pension reduced and one per cent will have their pensions cancelled. The opposition is not opposing this area of the bill but will be closely monitoring its implementation to ensure there are not unintended adverse effects on veterans and pensioners generally. We are aware that there is evidence of a need to be vigilant in this policy area. We have seen a minister who has failed to take any real action in regard to controversial aged care measures in this country despite their deep impact upon the people in his portfolio, people with an average age of 71 years. All we have seen with regard to his efforts to have some say in social security measures and aged care-his total contribution throughout the whole debate-was his statement that a minute part of the client population, people who were POWs in the Second World War, are protected. Quite frankly, ly a very minor part of the department's clients would be protected by that particular assurance from the minister. As we have said with regard to this aspect, the opposition is suggesting that it goes before a committee. With regard to the two other measures there must be deep concern about a government that has essentially tried to strip away people's rights to union representation. We have seen it earlier tonightthis very evening we have seen a situation where ideological justifications are trotted up essentially to take away people's rights to fight unfair dismissal. With regard to seasonal workers this measure is another attempt aimed not at the big end of town or at people like the those in the ministry opposite who are so acclimatised to and experienced in family trusts and other measures like this, but aimed at people who are at the bottom of the barrel, who have very few rights with regard to their occupation and who have to move throughout this country, often living in second-rate conditions for part of the year. That is the kind of emphasis this government has; they are the kinds of people that this government believes should be targeted. With regard to the other measures, as we have said before, they come here this evening and they come around the country saying to the Australian electorate, 'We feel so deeply for these carers. We are really out there trying to do something vital for them.' But when you come down to the nitty-gritty of this legislation there is a very good question to be asked of the speakers opposite: why have they decided that there should be this far tougher definition for those people they are extending this to-those people caring for under-16year-old handicapped people?",79
248,Mr LINDSAY,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"In speaking briefly to this Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Bill 1997, I would like to concentrate on the changes which relate to carers. One of the effects of this legislation amendment bill is to extend the qualification for carer payments to those caring for profoundly disabled children under the age of 16. This policy change is a very big deal! Certain- welcome one. I have remarked on a number of occasions, both here in this House and out in the Townsville and Thuringowa community, that home carers are some of the most isolated people in our community. The same is true for the carers of people living with severe handicaps and mental illness. Only last Thursday I had the opportunity to visit the office of the Schizophrenia Fellowship of North Queensland in Townsville. The Minister for Health and Family Services, Dr Wooldridge, only just recently granted a funding package of about $46,000 for the operation of a support and information program for mental health carers called 'Help for Rural Caregivers of the Mentally Ill'. The program may have a long and ungainly title but it is one which has delivered a level of support, advice and assistance vital to the carers of the mentally ill in regional and rural Queensland, particularly in North Queensland. As I affirmed recently in the media in Townsville when the federal government announced that it would assist the Schizophrenia Fellowship, this is an important program and I am pleased the minister recognised this and acted very quickly in approving funding support. The Schizophrenia Fellowship of North Queensland President, Mr David Donohuy, has welcomed the funding approval, saying people with serious mental illness in rural areas were principally cared for by their families-mainly women-for whom there has been minimal, if any, regular assistance in the past. Mr Donohue said: The program aims to provide care-givers with the information, skills and support necessary to become more competent in their role as carers, while sustaining a quality lifestyle for themselves and their family. For years carers have been calling out for recognition and support. Unfortunately for those carers it took a change of government at the last election before carers started to get the level of assistance and support they need and deserve. The level of support available to all carers has improved significantly under the federal coalition government, particularly in rural and regional areas. This was recognised by the Carers Association of Australia back in 1996 after the first coalition budget was delivered. The Executive Director of the Carers Association of Australia said: The Government will establish a National Respite for Carers Program which will operate over the next four years and will also see the establishment of Carers Resource Centres across Australia. In context of this budget, $36.7 million above the 1995-96 expenditure is quite a lot of money. I was very proud to open last year in Townsville, my home city, one of those carer resource centres. The Executive Director, Ms Anne Marie Mioche, said: The fact that the Government will be establishing Carer Resource Centres sends a direct message to all carers that this Government cares about them. This government does care about our carers, and we will see this concern and care in the detail of this bill currently before the House. The qualification for the carer payment will be extended to the carers of profoundly disabled children under the age of 16. Further, this bill also allows a person to stop caring for a another person for up to 63 days in a calendar year and still continue to qualify for a carer payment. This is an increase on the 42 days of respite leave carers were allowed under the previous Labor government. It is a simple change which should have been made years ago. As I said in the House back in October 1996, home care more often than not means close to full-time care and people invariably lose touch with other aspects of their lives, such as friends, work and study. Home care, particularly for someone suffering an acute or terminal illness or for someone living with a profound disability, is a very physically and emotionally tiring task. It is, in my view, an act of love. A few years ago a member of my staff was closely involved in the home care of his grandmother shortly before she passed away. He was only helping to care for her for a relatively short time but he said that those days were some of the toughest and longest of his life. Part of the measures of this bill will help ensure that carers sustain as good a quality of life as they can. The contribution carers make to Australian society cannot be underestimated. There are about 1.5 million carers in Australia looking after and assisting people at home. This is a substantial number of people. Without carers, without the sacrifices they make and the time they put in caring for people at home, our health system would be groaning at the the seams, if it did not collapse altogether. Indeed, I think the latter would be more than likely the case. I have seen estimates that state that home carers help save our economy about $8,000 million a year--quite an enormous amount of money. This pales in comparison with the amount of money spent on carer payments29,558 people received the carer payment in the 1996-97 financial year at a cost of almost $230 million. There seems to be quite a difference between the estimated number of carers in Australia and the number of people who receive some form of carer support payment, and I think this comes back down to a communication problem at the local level. I have tried to work hard with local carer respite workers to get the message out into the community that there are support services and mechanisms carers can access. Even so there are still times when people contact my electorate office quite literally at the end of their wits. Sadly, these same people are quite shocked when I tell them that there are support organisations and government financial assistance available to help them. They have simply not been aware of the support groups or services which are available. Australian author Bryce Courtenay said back in July last year: Carers are the most unsung and under-appreciated angels in our society. They are the glue that so much of society'S structure together. We cannot thank them enough for what they do. They are the selfless ingredient. When one takes a careful look at the work home carers perform, I do not think anyone would disagree with the sentiments expressed so genuinely by Bryce Courtenay. This government has taken big steps in the right direction, particularly in regional and rural centres like my home city of Townsville, to try to make life a little more easy for carers. Increasing to 63 days the period of respite leave a carer can take in a year is not only a reasonable and sensible decision of this government; it is also a compassionate decision. Extending the qualification for the carer payment to the carers of profoundly disabled children under the age of 16 is, likewise, an act of compassion and understanding on the part of the coalition government. Tonight I would certainly like to wholeheartedly support the measures in this bill.",82
249,Mrs DEANNE KELLY,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"I rise to speak on the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Bill 1997. There are a number of significant measures in this bill: amendments relating to income streams such that they are classified for means testing on the basis of their characteristics, rather than where the income came from; amendments relating to seasonal worker preclusion periods such that some high-income seasonal and contract workers have a period following the completion of their work or contract when they are unable to claim benefits; and lump sum payments received by social security recipients will be treated as either income over 12 months or as a deemed asset by aligning the treatment of lump sums with the previous ordinary income test. But the most important measure is that related to extending the carer pension to families with profoundly disabled children under the age of 16 years. The Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) must be congratulated on her sound management of her portfolio. While Labor was soft on social security fraud, our minister has been able to stamp it out to the tune of $28 million a holds week. At the same time she has been able to extend benefits to those who are most needy in our community and who have been dealt the most difficult of lives: the profoundly disabled. I would like to give an overview of the situation facing those looking at disability services. I refer to the 1997 edition of Australia's Welfare-Disability Services. There are three dimensions of disability recognised in the international classification 'disabilities and handicaps': impairment, which is loss or abnormality in body structure, physiological or psychological; activity, the nature and the extent of functioning at the level of the person; and participation, the nature and extent· of involvement in the following domains-personal maintenance, mobility, exchange of information, social relationships, education, work, leisure and spirituality, economic life, and civic and community life. The prevalence of disability was also studied in this report in the 1993 survey disability, ageing and carers. Disability presence of one or more of 15 restrictions, limitations or impairments. In 1993 there were a total of 3,176,700 people with Of these, 2,031,900 were under the age of 65 years. The predominance is with males, who make up 54.4 per cent; females constitute 45.6 per cent. The age and sex standardised rates of severe and profound handicap have remained steady since 1981 at four per cent of the total population and 2.5 per cent of population aged 15 to 64 years. There have been a number of analyses of trends in disability in Australia, usually determine the trends in health status and to ask the question: are we living longer but to them. sicker? This has been examined and while life is extended the disability is found usually to be mild or moderate. Data is umeliable on effect of disability related to injury. Mortality due to road injury has declined, though, over the last few years. Peri-natal data on congenital malformations, brought from the National Peri-natal Statistics Unit, show that rates of congenital malformation have been declining in the 1990s. This is certainly encouraging news. As for peri-natal deaths due to congenital malformations, since 1973 there were 35.9 deaths per 10,000. That figure has now which declined, as of 1994, to 17.5 per 10,000. Similar results are found with other defects such as spina bifida and congenital heart defects. Sadly, the number of induced aborannual tions performed before 20 weeks has in the creased over the same period of time. The trend to examine quality of life and allocation of resources, the increase in mediValley, cal technology, pregnancy testing and the trend to abortion will promote the idea of 'perfect' or 'normal' human being. This puts enormous pressure on disabled people to justify their existence and their share world and its resources. They, like every human being, have an equal right to life and to quality of life. I would like now to briefly dwell on the need for services. This was studied by the AIHW in 1995-96. It is going to be exacerbated by two factors: the ageing of those with of a disability and the ageing of those who care is the for them. Those aged 45 years to 64 years with severe or profound handicaps are predicted to increase by 18.9 per cent between 1995 a disability. and the year 2001. As I have said, the ageing of carers is already of severe concern. For those with a severe or profound handicap, there were 7,700 carers who were over the age of 65 years. I am sure we all see them in our electorates, as the I do---parents who are in their 80s often caring for a disabled child who is now in their 50s. It is a great strain on them. When they inevitably either become too ill to go on and to move into a home or perhaps pass on, what will happen to their child is of great concern The numbers of those with a profound or severe handicap are also predicted to increase. the In 1993 there were 721,000 people. By the year 2001, there will be 861,500---anjncrease of 13.2 per cent. The challenge is certainly ahead for everyone of good intent to deal with the increasing number of disabled people. I would like to mention some of the very positive changes that the government has made. In the 1996-97 budget there was $36.7 million provided in funding over four years for a national respite for carers program proposed the establishment of one carer resource centre in each state and territory and 57 regionally based carer respite centres, one of which was placed in Mackay. It receives funding of $61,168 and is attached to Uniting Church division of aged care and domiciliary services. The service covers all of the the Mackay region, including the Pioneer Mirani, Nebo, Belyando, Broad Sound and Proserpine shires. It has one goal: to the support the maintenance of the caring relationship. We are very proud of the efforts that it has made and certainly commend those who of the work in the Mackay Respite Centre. I would like to tum again to a particular measure in the bill, which is the extension of the carers pension to those families with a profoundly disabled child under the age of 16 years. The member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) earlier asked a number of questions. She also said that, firstly, it would be of little benefit because many of those families already receive parenting allowance and special allowance. This is not so. The new carers pension is in fact a pension. There will be more benefits attached to it. There is a pensioner concession card and pharmaceutical benefits scheme. Also, such an allowance will be reviewed less often, so there are considerable advantages for those families who will be eligible for the carers pension. The member for Jagajaga said that only 100 families would be eligible for such a payment. This is not so. She has not taken into account the differential-the difference between the special allowance or the parenting allowance and the carers pension. In fact, some 400 to 500 families will benefit from this provision in the bill. Who are they? They are the 400 to 500 people who received nothing under the Labor Party government in terms of a pension. One of those families is in my electorate. I see the daily struggle that they have with a 14-year-old profoundly disabled boy. Any additional benefit to them is going to enable them either to buy some more services for their son or to perhaps assist with some additional respite. But it is going to be a very welcome addition to what is one of the most difficult jobs demanded of any parent-that of caring for a profoundly disabled child. The member for Jagajaga mentioned that the criteria are restrictive for under 16-yearolds compared with older profoundly disabled children. They are not as restrictive as the ones Labor put on it, because they did not extend the carers pension to people in this situation. It is really a case of saying, 'We didn't do it, but we don't like the way you've gone out compassionately and done it.' I am very proud that the government is going to extend an additional pension to 400 to 500 families, some of whom are in my electorate and desperately need any additional assistance they can get. The member for Jagajaga also mentioned that there might be particular cases, such as severe epilepsy, severe psychiatric conditions and so on, which may render a child ineligible to be classified as profoundly disabled. Looking at the criteria which make up the designation of 'profoundly disabled', it would not be difficult to see that some of those conditions would certainly come into that category. Again, that is something that Labor did not do. There will be 400 to 500 families, undertaking the most difficult and demanding job any parent could, who will be far better off under the proposals in this bill. They will have a pensioner concession card, additional pharmaceutical allowances and a more generous assets and income test so they can earn more income. They will be reviewed less often and there will be some easing of the tremendous load under which they are burdened. I agree with the member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) that there can be few tasks as demanding as being a carer in our community. Those 1.5 million people who choose to care for somebody they love or somebody they know are people we should all respect. I know I certainly do. I see many of them who come into my electorate office, and they bear a burden that, I guess, God has saved the rest of us from having to undertake. I commend· this bill to the House. It contains some very compassionate measures, particularly this one. I would certainly like to see the bill supported by those on the other side of the House.",84
250,Mr RUDDOCK,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"Berowra-Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs) eU7 p.m.)-I thank the members who have contributed in this debate-the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), who spoke for the opposition, the member for Lilley (Mrs Grace), the member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay), the member for Dawson (Mrs De-Anne Kelly) and the member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson). I welcome the general support that has been given to this legislation by the opposition and the indication that they have concerns limited to a number of areas, which I will focus on in my own comments. But I do want to thank the members who have very correctly focused on the positive and beneficial nature of this . legislation. I take honourable members to the amendments that extend the qualification for parent payment to the carers of profoundly disabled children. It is a positive measure. It is a very significant advance. It flowed out of the commitment to assist carers that was given by the coalition in opposition. While there are some specific matters that have been raised in the debate which I will address, obviously the beneficial nature of these matters is positive, as are the need to provide consistent treatment for lump sums which are part of this legislation; the amendments relating to income streams, about which I will have something to say; the amendments relating to seasonal workers; the amendments to hardship rules for income maintenance periods; as well as some technical matters relating to the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency, the change of name of the family payment to a family allowance and those amendments to the Farm Household Support Act. As I said, the latter three matters are largely technical. I want to focus on the need for changes in relation to the income streams area, which the member for Reid focused on and which the member for Jagajaga raised in her comments. The fact is that many customers whose payments will be changed will be amongst the affluent individuals using anomalies in the current means test to receive an assets test exemption on short-term investments. The measures are designed to put in place what is, in fact, a fairer and more appropriate system. Many people should be able to satisfactorily restructure their financial arrangements to invest in income stream products that meet the government's objectives of minimising loopholes whilst allowing for an orderly drawing down of capital that provides a steady stream of income for retirement. In order to ensure that people are not disadvantaged in a way which is unintended, the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) will have the power to provide an exemption from the new treatment for people who are significantly financially disadvantaged by the new arrangements and who cannot rearrange their affairs without facing a significant penalty. These exemptions will be decided on a case by case basis. But I think they ought to satisfy members generally as to the nature of the changes that we are intending here. They are to ensure that the impact of the assets and income test is to be as it was intended and that those people who have the funds to be able to arrange their affairs in such a way as to use anomalies ought not to be able to continue to do so. That is a matter on which I welcome the indication of opposition support. I note that they have said that in the other place they may invite some committee deliberations in relation to these matters. But, obviously, we believe the legislation in that sense is a positive measure, given the nature of the scheme which we operate in Australia. In relation to the matters that were raised by the member for Jagajaga which relate to the care and support of a child under the age of 16 years, the fact is that the government recognises that the care of children under the age of 16 years is seen as a parental responsibility. While in appropriate cases support should be given, there needs to be a continuing recognition of the commitment that parents normally make to the upbringing of their children. Payments such as a child disability allowance provide assistance to carers in recognition of the special situation where additional care and supervision are required from a parent or guardian. One difficulty in extending the carer payment to a person providing care for a profoundly disabled child under the age of 16 years is encountered in distinguishing what would be considered to be a child's normal level of dependence on their parents and the required level of additional care provided by a parent in direct response to the child's disability. The care requirements outlined in this measure clearly distinguish and support the intensive and constant assistance provided for children with profound disabilities, over and above what would be considered a normal parenting role. This is consistent with the aim of this measure to target assistance to those people providing a high level of attendant care to maintain comfort and sustain life or attend to a bodily function that the profoundly disabled child cannot manage by himself or herself. It, was asked why the number of carers of profoundly disabled children would be limited to about 100. The advice I have is that it would be something in the order of 400 to 500 carers who would be able to benefit from this measure. Carers are generally already receiving a special benefit or parenting allowance. For some people with profoundly disabled children, it is desirable to give them more assistance by way of the carer payment. The carer payment will be subject to the pension incomes and assets test, which is more beneficial than the special benefit or parenting allowance test. In addition, there better pharmaceutical concessions and less reviews for carer pensions. However, this is a highly targeted payment for those most in need. People with disabilities or disabled children who do not qualify for the new payment can still qualify for other social security payments, such as the special benefit parenting allowance and child disability allowance. So I think it needs to be seen in that context. In relation to children under the age of 16 years being considered to be a parental responsibility, I think I pointed out the basis upon which the age of 16 years was chosen for this measure. The other matter that was raised was in relation to the measures that relate to the income of seasonal and contract workers. It is suggested that these measures treat them more harshly than other high income full-time employees who lose their job. The fact is that it needs to be recognised-and I think the honourable member for Jagajaga did in her comments; she used the figure of $37,000that what we are dealing with here are levels of income earned by seasonal workers that can be quite unusually high for the nature of the work that is being addressed. Where you are dealing with people with much lower incomes, this measure will not operate. The measure has to be seen, rather than discriminating against seasonal workers, as being aimed at removing the current advantage that seasonal workers have over other high income permanent employees who become unemployed. It better aligns the treatment of higher income seasonal workers with existing provisions that apply to other high income employees who become unemployed. The permanent employee, unlike the seasonal worker, will most likely have to serve an income maintenance period, so this measure is about evening up that balance. Other workers who become unemployed generally receive a payment for any accrued or unused annual or long service leave. This amount is maintained as income for a period following cessation of work and in most cases will result in the social security payment being deferred for the period covered by the leave. Higher income seasonal workers do not are receive normal leave entitlements, which are generally cashed out in salary. Currently, therefore, the only preclusion period that can be applied to a seasonal or contract worker is the liquid assets test, and generally this has not been effective. Seasonal workers will generally have a regular pattern of employment which is governed by seasons or other regular patterns of work. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that the workers would be able to budget for breaks between employment more readily than a worker in permanent employment who has lost their job. Where workers with high annual incomes are seen to be receiving an employment payment between seasons or contracts, the integrity of the social security system is compromised. I think members can see from the comments I have made that the measures are not unreasonable. Obviously the government intends to press on with the bill in its present form. It is seen as being largely beneficial and, where it is not, it is dealing with anomalies that do undermine the integrity of the system and which demand of a responsible government measures to address those concerns. We do have a targeted system of benefits, which I know you, Madam Deputy Speaker Crosio, are very familiar with and have on other occasions supported very forcefully. These measures are designed to ensure that that system remains targeted and appropriate. I commend the bill to the House. Obviously, we will see how these matters progress when the bill reaches the other chamber. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Ruddock) read a third time. MANAGED INVESTMENTS BILL 1997 Second Reading Debate resumed from 3 December 1997, on motion by Mr Miles: That the bill be now read a second time.",86
251,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"I welcome the opportunity to finally debate the Managed Investments Bill 1997 in the House this evening. As everyone in the industry and many investors would know, reform of the regulations governing nonsuperannuation collective investments has been a long time coming. It has been in excess of two years since Labor released an exposure draft of its own collective investments bill and indeed some six years since the Law Reform Commission report into the regulation of collective investments was handed down. That is a long time for those in the industry to wait for new regulation, but no doubt it would seem an even longer time for investors and potential investors in collective investments who will be most affected by this bill-particularly those investors who suffered a loss in their hard-earned savings because they invested in certain collective investment schemes back in the late 1980s and early 1990s. I guess that is the most important thing to remember about why we are here today debating this bill: the protection of investors. The bill is called the Managed Investments Bill 1997. I personally would have liked to have seen the subtitle 'protection of investors' added to that title because that ought to be key reason why governments get involved in regulating financial markets in the first to protect investors. So the fundamental question which all participants in this debate need to be considering is: does this bill better protect investors and at what cost? That is certainly the question with which Labor will be concerning itself during the passage of this bill through the parliament. I say at the outset that Labor gives its inprinciple support to the application of the single responsible entity concept to the nonsuperannuation managed investments industry in Australia. That ought to come as no surprise, given that it was a Labor government which sought to introduce the SRE concept to the non-superannuation collective investments industry through our draft collective investments bill in December 1995. Now, as then, we consider the SRE concept to be a sensible and logical extension of the highly successful superannuation regulatory regime established by Labor which should lead to greater protection and greater benefits for investors. However, while the government's Managed Investments Bill does introduce the SRE concept to the managed investments industry, the regulatory model which is proposed here differs from Labor's regulatory model which we released for discussion back in 1995. It differs in a fundamental area-that of custodial separation of assets and the protection of investors' assets. Unlike Labor's model, under the government's bill custodial arrangements for scheme assets will not be mandatory. Under the government's model, an SRE will not be compelled to engage an independent custodian in which the scheme property will vest. Because of that difference, Labor will support the referral of the bill to the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities-a reference which I understand the government and indeed other parties support-for full public hearings into the differences between Labor's collective investments regulatory model and that proposed by the government in the bill before the House. We will be taking particular care to examine any areas where the Managed Investments the Bill weakens investor protection in managed investments. On the face of it, the governplace: ment's managed investments model may not weaken investor protection. Indeed, it places onerous responsibilities on the single responsible entity to meet stringent compliance regulations prior to being registered and licensed as an SRE and also during its operation as a single responsible entity. The government's model does change the mandated requirement for an independent custodian. That is a significant change which does need to be investigated through public hearings. I would think that all the parties involved and interested in managed investments-parliamentary colleagues from all parties, representatives of the managed invest the ments industry, trustee organisations and the individual investors-would welcome such a move given the size of the regulatory changes that the government is proposing. I think it is necessary by way of background to take the House through some of the history to this issue. Managed investments are currently regulated as prescribed interests under the Corporations Law. The system involves two separate entities with responsibility for the operation of the managed investis ment-a funds manager and a compulsory trustee. The roles of both the funds manager and the trustee differ across various schemes and it is often not clear in law who has ultimate responsibility for the prudential regulation of investors' deposits. This problem came to light in its most stark form following the collapse of two high profile managed investment funds-Estate Mortgage and Aust-Wide. Following the collapse of those funds, there was a great deal of confusion concerning exactly who was responsible to investors-the funds management company or the trustee company or the legal advisers to both. Following that and an investigation into those collapses, a Law Reform Commission review recommended that managed investments ought to be regulated by requiring a single responsible entity. The single responsible entity concept was designed to increase investor protection by ensuring that the funds manager is the only entity legally responsible to investors should a fund fail. In December 1995 former Attorney-General Lavarch released a draft bill for comment which introduced the SRE concept for managed investments but also required a mandatory separate custodian of the scheme's assets. Before the final version of the bill was introindependent. duced into the parliament, we had an election and a change of government. Things then went rather quiet on the government side from March 1996 until August of last year when an announcement was made outlining the government's proposed managed investments model. The recommendation of the financial system inquiry-that is, the Wallis inquiry-was that regulation of superannuation and managed investments ought to be harmonised by bringing managed investment regulation into line with superannuation through the single responsible entity concept. The Wallis report, however, was silent on the question of a mandated independent custodian. This bill was finally introduced by the government on 3 December last year at the very end of the spring parliamentary sittings. What it does in terms of its main provisions to change the regulation of managed investments by amending the Corporations Law, the Australian Securities Commission Act and the Pooled Development Funds Act 1992 to require funds managers to become a single responsible entity, or SRE. It imposes onerous duties and responsibilities on the SRE who will most likely, though not certainly, be the funds manager by providing for civil action against the SRE by any scheme member who suffers loss or damage because of conduct contravening those duties and responsibilities. To become a single responsible entity, the entity must apply to the Australian Securities Commission, the ASC, for a special licence and, if the managed investments scheme has more than 20 investors, seek ASC registration as an SRE. It has to lodge a compliance plan with the ASC stating how it proposes to fulfil its custody of assets responsibilities, which are to ensure that managed investments scheme property is clearly identified and that the property is held separately from the property of the SRE or of another managed investment scheme. The entity has to satisfy compliance regulations by either having a board of directors, with at least half of the directors being independent, or establishing a compliance committee with at least half of its membership being It has to hold all scheme assets in trust for scheme members, thus imposing trust law obligations on the SRE. It has to enter into legally binding undertakings with the ASC if it is directed to-for example, to agree to have a separate custodian. It is also required to assist the ASC to carry out surveillance checks on whether the scheme is complying with its compliance plan and the law. In the area of the ASC and its powers, the bill also confers a significant vetting and compliance role on the ASC, which will have a number of powers. It will be able to refuse to issue a licence or to register the managed investment scheme if it considers that the arrangements in the compliance plan are inadequate. It can require appropriate capital adequacy amounts depending on the circumstances of each fund, and there is no mandated amount. It can revoke an SRE's licence without hearing in certain circumstances. The ASC can also examine, investigate and gather information concerning the operations of an SRE to ensure compliance with the scheme's constitution, compliance plan and applicable laws. It can accept enforceable undertakings from an SRE in relation to any matter concerning a registered scheme and it can apply to the courts for any order against the SRE that the court thinks is appropriate. The bill specifies a two-year transitional period beginning 1 July this year-and it is the opposition's intention. to cooperate with that time frame-for current managed investment schemes to move to an SRE scheme. Any entity may apply to become a single responsible entity. According to the explanatory memorandum, the bill is not expected to have any significant financial impact on the Commonwealth. The Labor opposition has a number of concerns about the government's model, which we hope can be addressed at the public hearings into the bill. Labor has already stated its support for the SRE concept, believing that it will boost consumer protection by clarifying which entity is legally liable for investors' funds. Like the government's model, Labor's draft Collective Investments Bill of 1995 enlarged the ASC's role to enable it to vet applications from the SRE and ensure that all compliance requirements could be met and would be met. However, our model also required a statutory, separate, independent custodian which we determined, at the draft bill stage, would provide added consumer protection. The government's model differs from Labor's in that it does not require a mandated independent custodian. This places an increased importance on the capacity of the ASC to undertake a vetting and ongoing compliance role which, while being a departure from Labor's model, does not necessarily mean a lessening of consumer protection. However, the capacity of the ASC to fulfil that vetting and ongoing monitoring role has been severely restricted by 1996 budget cuts, which have impacted particularly heavily on the ASC's compliance section. The Chairman of the ASC, Alan Cameron, stated in the ASC's 1996-97 annual report: Our Parliamentary appropriation for running costs in 1996/97 was $118.5 million and a $4 million loan to fund staff redundancies which we must repay. Our base funding was therefore significantly lower than previous years, and we must expect to live within this lower base going forward. I asked the Treasurer (Mr Costello) a couple of questions on notice concerning the issue of funding for the ASC, in light of the annual report of the Australian Stock Exchange-the ASX. I asked about page 26 of the 1996-97 annual report, which talks about cuts in funding for the Australian Securities Commission from $104 million to $74 million, and I referred to the impairment of the ASC's ability to investigate cases of market malpractice and to initiate prosecutions where appropriate. Recently, the Treasurer responded to these questions on the Notice Paper, saying that the figures in the ASX report are not correct. He went on to say that budget documentation for 1997-98 indicates an appropriation for the current year of $119.398 million and an anticipated appropriation for 1999-2000 of $104.9 million. Notwithstanding his correction of the ASX, what we see here is a $14'12 million budget cut. So the Treasurer has essentially fessed up to the charge that the ASC will have diminished funding to carry out greater responsibilities. The government's decision to place more responsibility on the ASC with its new Managed Investments Bill while severely cutting its funding does seem to undermine the ASC's capacity to fulfil its regulatory role. I want to take this opportunity to thank the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator Campbell), who has responsibility for this bill, for his willingness to provide me and opposition staff with briefings on the bill. He has given verbal assurances that the ASC will receive adequate funding to fulfil its role. However, I cannot find anything in the budget forward estimates which suggests that the ASC will receive any additional funding at all. In fact, the opposite would seem to be the case, as Mr Cameron stated in the 1996-97 annual report. He also stated: Staff have faced a tumultuous year, as we made significant reductions to our overall staff numbers. Our total staff numbers have fallen from 1398 at 30 June 1996 to 1191 at 30 June 1997. That represents a 15 per cent reduction in ASC staff in only one calendar year. If the government is trying to give the impression to the market that it is interested in ensuring effective prudential regulation and investor protection, it is certainly going about it in a very strange way. In addition, Labor is concerned that the ASC is yet to release a series of draft policy papers describing exactly how it is going to fulfil its role in supporting the bill, although it is our understanding that this is to occur in March of this year. These draft policy papers to be issued by the ASC are to discuss seven high priority policy subjects which the ASC has identified as needing further clarification. After the papers are released, the ASC is to invite comments from the public for about four weeks from the day that they are released. A review of the public comments will take place after that time, and then the ASC will issue formal policy statements on these high priority subjects. These are to be actively reviewed during the course of 1998 to ensure that they are working properly. However, a glance at the list of the high priority policy areas which the ASC is proposing to cover suggests that it may be very difficult, without seeing this information, to form an opinion about the level of investor protection which the government's model offers. So, at the least, we are seeking assurances from the ASC that it will be able to fulfil the role which it envisages having. The first of the seven policy areas is licensing of the responsible entity. Some of the policy issues the ASC paper will examine include the criteria by which the ASC intends to assess the adequacy of the SRE's nonfinancial resources; management policies and procedures; character and accountability of directors or compliance committee members in order to assess whether the SRE is likely to carry out its duties honestly, efficiently and fairly; and the kind of licensing conditions which are appropriate for the ASC to set for approval of an SRE. The second policy area is financial resource suitability of an operator of a managed investment scheme. This goes towards the issue of what, if any, financial conditions should be imposed as a prerequisite to an entity's eligibility to operate a managed investment scheme. The issue of capital adequacy and the financial resources of an SRE will be discussed in this policy paper. The third paper involves contents of the compliance plan. This policy is to explain in what circumstances and according to what criteria the ASC intends to assess whether a compliance plan is adequate and/or requires modification. It will also address how much of this function is done at a licensing stage or by post vetting rather than on scheme registration. These are crucial issues which I would have thought needed to be determined before the parliament can pass this legislation. The fourth area involves appropriate arrangements for holding scheme property. This policy is to explain the basis upon which the ASC will expect-if not, require-a separate custodian to hold the assets of a scheme. Again, the issue of investor protection is crucial here. I am sure that many of us would have read a number of articles which suggest that it will be very easy for an SRE to escape to Rio or some other exotic location with a large amount of investors' moneys due to this provision in the government's model. While the opposition is not disposed to subscribe to the view that a $2 company could be formed to spirit away investor funds, it is important to know exactly what criteria the ASC will use to detennine when a separate independent custodian is necessary and when it is not necessary. The fifth paper is to deal with contents, of the constitution of the managed fund. Unlike existing Corporations Law, the Managed Investments Bill 1997 does not contain a requirement for the ASC to approve a scheme's constitution at the point of registration of the scheme. The policy paper will explain in what circumstances and according to what criteria the ASC intends to assess whether a constitution complies at the point of registration. The sixth paper concerns transitional arrangements. The paper is to examine what problems may arise in the transitional period from the current arrangements to the SRE scheme arrangements. The seventh paper deals with exemptions and modifications. It is intended to explain how the ASC will deal with any immediate policy issues not covered by any other policy papers. It ought to be clear to the House from the program that I have just described-the program that the ASC has mapped out-that without this information it is very difficult adequately gauge how well the ASC will be able to protect investor deposits. For example, I have a few questions: what capital adequacy standards will it require before it agrees to register an SRE? How will it measure whether directors or compliance committee members are independent? What costs will it impose for the registration process? What plans are there to ensure an ongoing monitoring and compliance function to ensure that investors are not protected just at the time of registration of the SRE but also during the operation of the SRE? These are crucial questions to which the parliament can reasonably seek answers. I have to say that I am surprised that the government is asking the parliament to pass a bill before all the relevant consumer protection information has been disclosed and before we have assurances from the government that it will adequately fund the ASC. In addition, we have seen a recent report from KPMG which claims that the cost efficiencies which the government has claimed will be gained by the move to its new model have been overstated and that there will be substantial transitional costs, such as state government stamp duty, resulting from a transfer of assets. It ought to be noted, however, that that report states that the information on which the calculations were based was obtained from only one side of the industry and that Mr Richard Gilbert from the Investment and Financial Services Association will also present information based on different assumptions, one would presume. Nevertheless, the costs of the new model are something worthy of further consideration. There has been a lot of public debate over the benefits of the bill occurring between those two industry bodies whose members' businesses will be most affected-the Investment and Financial Services Association, which has been very strongly supportive of the bill, and the Trustees Corporations of Australia, which has been highly critical of the bill. It ought to be noted that some quite spirited criticism of this legislation has come from several quarters. I might spend a minute to or two to go to some of that criticism. Against that background, it is appropriate that the parliament have the opportunity to hear arguments from both sides in an appropriate forum-that being the specialist Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities. We will not be opposing the bill here, or indeed moving any amendments here. It is a matter of agreement between the parties that this matter should go to that joint committee and some of these issues can be thrashed out there. From the opposition's point of view, we will certainly be keeping our powder dry in relation to some of these issues until we have had the opportunity to have the benefits of the deliberations of that committee. I mentioned that there has been some quite spirited criticism of the bill.· Without endorsing that criticism, it has been argued that it dismantles the system of safeguards for investors that has served Australia well for past 45 years. Those on the other side who were involved in what happened to Estate Mortgage and Aust-Wide would no doubt beg to differ about whether that system of safeguards has served investors well. It has been argued that it gives investors no say in whether their existing rights and protections are to be changed. It is alleged that a cost efficient system is being replaced with one which is more costly for investors but less effective and that it places excessive reliance upon the Australian Securities Commission to monitor and enforce private contract rights at public expense. I have to say that that is something we want to hear more from the government about, and we want to be satisfied that the ASC does have the capacity to do the things that are being expected of it. It has also been alleged of the bill that it fails to deliver world's best practice. The tax haven of the Dutch Antilles is quoted. The suggestion is that the trend in other major financial centres is to strengthen investor protection by strengthening the role of the independent trustee or custodian. So we have had organisations such as the international ratings agency, Standard and Poor's, and KPMG and so on producing reports expressing concerns and engaging in quite spirited criticism of the bill. As against that, MPs will have received correspondence from people opposed to the bill. They have also received a lot of correspondence from people who are highly supportive of the bill. You get into these 'doesdoesn't' sort of arguments concerning the level of investor protection and the answer, in those circumstances, is not easy for anyone to sort out. However, it ought to be appreciated that this matter has been considered by the Australian Law Reform Commission and it has been considered by the Wallis inquiry. I think they are things that all of us have a responsibility to take seriously, as we do things such as the collapse of Estate Mortgage. For those people who were the victims of that and who suffered, in the worse cases, the loss of a lifetime's savings, it is not appropriate that the these things should. happen without there being some government response to that. Government has an obligation to ensure that investors can have confidence in their investments and the level of protection and the level of regulation of those investments. This does represent for the opposition and for all of us in the parliament very much an on-balance judgment, but our position is one of support for the essential concept of the single responsible entity and a determination by the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities to look at the detail of the government's model and to examine the issue of whether the investor protections there are appropriate and adequate or whether there is a need for some further amendment.",89
252,Dr NELSON,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"I find occasionally it is very useful to put your mind around something that you do not actually know a great deal about and approach it with what I would like to think is an open mind. I think the Managed Investments Bill 1997, particularly from my perspective, is one such case. If I could go to some of the comments made by the member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) in terms of the lobbying done on both sides of the debate here, the more that I am lobbied by some people representing the trustees, the more convinced I am that the government is doing the right thing. This bill seeks to change the law to introduce a single responsible entity structure for the operation of managed investment schemes, including appropriate licensing, registration and compliance mechanisms. We are trying to achieve a balance between providing, on the one hand, effective investor protection and facilitating an efficient financial and investment market for Australian managed funds on the other. A single responsible entity structure, of course, was recommended by the Australian Law Reform Commission and the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee. It is interesting that the membership of some of those committees included some of the most knowledgeable and educated people in this area in the country, including Don Argus, Mark Burrows, Alan Cameron, Tony Hartnell, Jim Armitage, Justice Elizabeth Evatt and Justice John von Doussa. It was also endorsed, of course, by the Wallis quiry into the Australian financial system. Responsibilities for investors funds are currently split between the management delineation company and the trustee. The bill will address the issue of legal liability over responsibility for those funds, about which there is presently some degree of confusion. Under these new arrangements, the liability for any loss investors' funds through negligent or illegal activity will rest with a single responsible entity. The divided responsibility of trustee and management company to investors allows duck shoving and blame shifting when somecompliance thing goes wrong. The ALRC and the Companies and Securisibilities ties Advisory Committee review concluded that the law currently encourages a false sense of security because investors rely on what is the illusory supervision of trustees, instead directing more of their own efforts to protectbe ing their own interests. Under these reforms, the corporate structure for managed investenter ments will be more consistent with other corporate structures. It might even improve investor decision making. Critics of the reform should be reminded that the introduction of a single responsible entity structure will bring managed investment regulation into line with the regulation superannuation. It will therefore simplify the compliance task of funds operating in both the superannuation and non-superannuation investment fund sectors. As the requirement for a custodian for scheme to hold that scheme's assets is to removed, the bill will prohibit a responsible entity from mixing its own assets with those of the scheme. The collapse of a responsible entity will therefore not expose investors in scheme which it supervises. These reforms will also deliver significant ongoing savings to the scheme operators and better returns to investors. The costs associata ed with trustee supervision are also going to be removed. The question is whether or not this will reduce the current level of investor protection, which I think for most of members, goes to the heart of our responsibilities to our constituents. The new legislation actually imposes clearer inaccountability for the management of members' funds through direct statutory duties on the responsible entity. There will also be of accountability and responsibility that will be now much clearer to investors. Equally, the question of liability in the event of loss or damage suffered by a fund member will be put beyond any doubt. Investors' of interests will be f-lfther protected by the requirement for the responsible entity to provide independent monitoring of compliance with systems for the proper administration of schemes, and the penalties for nonare indeed severe. Removing the current third party between investors and fund managers will make the nature of the responowed to investors clear to both the responsible entity and to the fund manager. In terms of responsible entities, it is importof ant that the House be reminded that they must licensed by the ASC and most schemes must be registered by the ASC. The ASC will into binding agreements with the responsible entity of a scheme and back them up with court orders in the case of a breach. The ASC will also have express powers of surveillance; applicants for a managed investments licence must demonstrate financial capacity and an ability to perform their of considerable duties associated with being a responsible entity; and it will also have the power to require that a specified minimum level of resources be maintained by the SRE. Some people have suggested that the bill each will reduce opportunities for trustee combe panies to participate in managed investments and reduce the number of employees. But trustees can do one of a number of things: they can elect to be a single responsible a entity; they could fulfil the role of custodian for investors funds, if investors in the market consider a separate custodian has some merit-again, the consumers would be making choice as to what role, if any, they saw for trustees; and, thirdly, a trustee can become a single responsible entity itself. If in conflict with the management company, the scheme us, as members will then make the decision. There will be a two-year transition period to allow reorganisation and, during that period, incidentally, the resources available to the ASC will be assessed to ensure that it is able to adequately execute the new responsibilities conferred upon it. So the conterns of the member for Wills in relation to the budget allocations for the A,SC for 1997-98 are, in fact, going to be addressed in the process of implementation as the ASC changes its roles. One of the best commentaries, I think, on the government's Managed Investments Bill is provided by the editorial from the Australian Financial Review from late last year. Just to quote some parts from it, it said: It may sound prudent to require an independent trustee company to oversee what funds managers do with other people's money, but it's not clear that the trustee has actually improved on the manager's investment decisions or prevented untoward things from happening. When two heads are in charge, the lines of responsibility have blurred. . . . the two-headed model has promoted mutual finger-pointing and blame shifting which has ended up in the black hole of the litigation system. The single responsible entity idea was first put up by the Australian Law Reform Commission in 1993. It was then incorporated into proposed legislation put forward by the then Labor Attorney General, Mr Michael Lavarch . . . endorsed this year by the Financial System Inquiry chaired by Mr Stan Wallis. This is all the result of the explosion of collecThese tive investment schemes in the 1980s-mostly unleashed by financial deregulation-in cash management trusts, property trusts, and more exotic schemes ranging from yabbie farms to racehorse syndicates. But the trustees' inadequacies in protecting investors' funds were exposed when the property boom collapsed in the early 1990s. Last month, the 50,000 investors in the country's largest mortgage trust group, Estate Mortgage, finally received some good news when Bums, Philp & Company Ltd agreed to pay a $116 million settlement. Bums Philp Trustees, a former subsidiary of Bums Philp, was the trustee of the Estate Mortgage Trusts when they collapsed in April 1990, owing investors $620 million. And in May the 26,000 small investors who sank $145 million into the Aust-Wide Trusts finally recouped a $100 million settlement. In the Aust-Wide case, the Australian Securities Commission took legal action against Permanent Trustees, the trustee of Wide trusts. The ASC argued that Permanent Trustee had failed to discharge its duty under the trust deed and, in common law, to protect the investors in the trust. Without making an admission, Permanent contributed $26.6 million to the $100 million pool of funds that will be used to repay the Aust-Wide investors. Mr Costello's new model is not so much about deregulating the managed funds business as changing the form of regulation so that the fund's management entrepreneurs . . . can devise their own ways to act as they advertise they will do . . . stripped of their protected fee stream under the existing regulations, they now need to transform into funds managers themselves, or into specialist providers of compliance and custodial services to the single responsible entities. The funds managers will more clearly have a fiduciary duty to their investors and will not be able to abdicate responsibility to the trustee. No law will stop all crooks, but it should swiftly expose and punish them. A single responsible entity will put one head on the block. That should concentrate the minds of those who seek to profit by managing other people's money. The other point I would make is that each of the duties of the responsibility entity could be categorised in one of three ways: trustee style of duties, Corporations Law-like duties and responsible entity focus duties. The trusteelike duties are drawn from the law of trusts and reinforced by the Corporations Law. duties are to act honestly and carefully; to act in investors' best interests and to prefer their interests to its own; and to treat investors equally and fairly. I seek leave to finish my comments at a later date.",94

257,Mr ROBERT BROWN,ADJOURNMENT,"On Monday of this week at 2 o'clock what purported to be a debate by this parliament took place concerning a commitment which the government had made to send Australian troops to the Gulf together with forces from the United States. I say purported to be a debate by this parliament because there were four participants on the government side, four on the opposition side and one Independent. We have more debate in this chamber on pig bounty bills and the like than we had on that question. It was a disgraceful performance by the government, and I am sorry to say that it appeared to be an arrangement which was brokered as well with the opposition. On Monday this parliament committed itself to sending young Australians to what could have become a very serious theatre of war and, in effect, there was a decision made that, given certain circumstances, Australia would have been at war with another country. Australia would have declared war on that country, and we were treated in this way. Not only were this parliament and members of this to parliament treated in this way but all of our constituents, and that represents 18 million constituents right across Australia. It simply was not good enough. When a similar question was considered in 1991, almost 40 people in this chamber had an opportunity to give consideration to that, to express their concerns, to raise their fears and their doubts, to indicate their support, to adopt whatever position they thought was appropriate. That was not the case on Monday, and certainly the circumstances today are different circumstances from those which prevailed in 1991 when members of this parliament agonised-some more than others-over the question that they were called upon to participate in and to help resolve. Despite the fact that it hit the headlines on the front pages of the newspapers in 1991, you had to look to at least page 2 down the bottom after Monday to find any report of the decision ·and the consideration that this parliamentgave it. There were differences between the circumstances today and those of 1991. For example Iraq, in 1991, had invaded another country. That was not the case this time. A major proportion of the world's vital oil reserves was under threat. That was not the case this time. The United Nations had made a decision to intervene with a multinational force. That was not the case this time. There was a threat to the world economy. That was not the case this time. There was a cross-religious crossethnic alliance of Western and Arab countries in opposition to Iraq. That was not the case this time. There was a majority of the countries of the world in support of that intervention. That was not the case this time. The parliament did not consider this issue before Australian forces arrived at the Gulf as we in 1991. There was no direct threat then or now to Australia. ' One might ask what was the alleged strategic value of that exercise and what it was supposed to achieve. To my mind it defies logic. For example, if Saddam Hussein is the brute that he is painted to be-and I have no reason to believe that he is not-why would he not place all of those alleged biological and chemical weapons that people claim he has in cinemas, in hospitals, in schools or in child-care centres? Would we then go in and blast them? If he is the brute that he is alleged to be, that is precisely what he would do. Yet we thought we were going to go there and knock these things out of commission. It has been made clear that any bombing of Iraq would definitely knock out all of the ing devices that the United Nations has so successfully placed in Iraq. If Iraq is bombed and Saddam Hussein emerges from the rubble, what then? (Time expired) Companies: Protection of Employees' Legal Entitlements",97
258,Mr COBB,ADJOURNMENT,"I want to alert the House tonight to a gross injustice perpetrated by Ashanti Goldfields, an overseas mining company based in Ghana, West Africa. This company has walked away from operating Cobar Mines, which runs the CSA copper mine in Cobar in my electorate. As a result of that, 260-odd miners are out of work and are left being owed $10.4 million in liabilities-$1.1 million in wages and salaries which has now been paid through the Price Waterhouse administrator but, more importantly, in long service leave and holiday leave AS AT 2110211997 Depository Nominee, Inc. Lonrho Pic Government of Ghana $4.2 million of which they will probably see only 50 to 75 per cent at most and $5.2 million of which they will probably see did nothing. Some of those workers have been in that mine for up to 33 years and have accumulated six-figure sums. As well as that there are other creditors. Glencore, the Swiss commodity metals trader, has a secured loan of $16 million which has been defaulted on. But I particularly feel sorry for the unsecured creditors, the small businesses in Cobar and surrounding towns which will not see a cent of the $6 million owing to them. They have had to layoff 53 of their own workers. The fuel supplier to that mine is owed $171,000 and the brickworks that supplied the solid concrete bricks for the stopes are owed $145,000 and have had to lay off 18 of their workers. I know of a widower down in Dubbo who is owed several tens of thousands of dollars and has an unopened box monitdr- of $45,000 worth of bearings. This action by Ashanti has been very damaging to the town, to the business and family lives of the people who live in Cobar. When Ashanti bought this mine from Golden Shamrock in October 1996 they bought it at a reduced price because they took over the liabilities of the mine in long service leave and retrenchment payments, et cetera. This is the biggest African gold mining company outside South Africa.

Talking about the notice they may give if they ever withdraw the support, it says: Following this period, if Ashanti were to intend to cease to provide financial support to . . . Cobar Mines . . . it would give not less than 7 days notice of that withholding of financial support before doing so. This letter is to be interpreted in accordance with the laws of Victoria, Australiawhere they have their main officeand Ashanti irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to submit to the non-exclusive courts of Victoria, Australia. It is signed by a director, MarkKeatley, who is also the chief financial officer. In the middle of January, Trevor Schultz, who is chief operating officer and a director of Ashanti mines, also wrote a letter saying that the only expenditure which should be incurred on the mine was that which was essential to maintain continuing operations. We have these solid guarantees from a very profitable company and yet they have walked away and left people in the lurch. While they may be able to do it legally, morally and ethically what they have done is shocking. BHP or Pasminco could not have done that in Australia. They are getting away with this so far only because they are an overseas based company. I call upon the directors of Ashanti to fulfil the written promise that they have made. I am pleased that this federal government has sooled the Australian Securities Commission onto them. If the commission finds that they have been in breach of the insolvent trading conditions and other conditions of the Corporations Law of this country, such as not having had resident directors of this mine this year, then I think we should take them to whatever courts we have to to recoup these debts. (Time expired) Burwood Skillshare",100
260,Mr ZAMMIT,TWENTY LARGEST SHAREHOLDERS,"I draw to the attention of the House a very grave injustice that has occurred and which has mystified me and so many others in the inner west of Sydney. I refer to the inexplicable snubbing by the government of the Inner West Skills Centre at Burwood in my electorate of Lowe, under the government's radical reorganisation of the employment services market. I note that the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Dr Kemp) is at the table and I ask him to intervene and to investigate how it is that Burwood Skills hare, one of the best and most cost-efficient community based providers of training and job placement services, especially to the long-tentl unemployed, have failed to jurisdiction of the win a contract. I was there at the official launch of Burwood Skillshare some ·13 or 14 years ago and I have kept in constantcontact with them on a regular basis, firstly, as the local state member and now as the federal member. In fact, I do not think I have missed attending even one of their annual general meetings because I have always been so impressed with the work that they have done and I wanted to keep in close contact with them. I am fully aware of the· centre's strengths and achievements. Over the. past few yeats, out of some 6,000 people who have called into the centre an amazing 4,000 people·havefound paid employment. This has resulted in a huge financial saving to the government in welfare payments. However, the greatest benefit lies in the fact that this success has given so many of the centre's clients a new life, a life that has been turned around by a lift in confidence and a dramatic and newly found sense of selfworth and self-esteem. . The Burwood SkilJshare, by any criteria, has proven itself to be among the very best, yet it has been dwppep by the government despite repeated successes Year after year. Burwood SkilIshaI:e not orily has a demonstrated record that is enviable but also provides a range of training programs to people in the fields of c)erical and retail, training for handymen and women· as well as providing the skills necessary for community service work. . In the recentpast,·.DEETYA, on a number of occasions, has asked Burwood Skillshare to pilot innovative youth access programs. Even more recently, the centre has provided case management and the six-month period from July to December 1997 saw. the centre outperforrn the CES. Not only that, it also was well ahead of the national average in its performance. The decision by the federal government to dump the Burwood Skillshare has been very short-sighted. It has resulted in tremendous losses; and not justin staff losses. The loss to my local comlllunity is even more significant as it is a genuine loc.al community focal point which is open to everyone and provides use of its computers, newspapers and the Internet, as well as social contact. Additionally, the centre has always been proactive under its indefatigable manager, Patricia Robertson. In fact, twice in the past three years the centre has initiated general drives generating local jobs with employers. They have been particularly active in tackling youth unemployment in the inner west and have successfully found paid work for some 100 people in a relatively short period of time. Again I ask the minister to intervene and to reinstate the funding to Burwood Skillshare so that this very successful, highly efficient, profit centre can continue to provide much needed services in my area. Unless a very good reason can be given and it can be publicly explained as to why Burwood Skillshare's contract for funding has not been renewed, then the whole agenda of reform of the employment services market will fall into disrepute. Santamaria, Mr B. A.",101
261,Mr ABBOTT,TWENTY LARGEST SHAREHOLDERS,"Warringah-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs) (10.46 p.m.)-Bob Santamaria's state funeral today was a great national as well as Catholic occasion. It should not pass unnoticed in this House. For the record, it was attended by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer), the Treasurer (Mr Costello), the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts (Senator Alston), the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Dr Kemp) and the members for Warringah (Mr Abbott), Mitchell (Mr Cadman), North Sydney (Mr Hockey), Menzies (Mr Andrews), Gippsland (Mr MCGauran), Hinkler (Mr Neville), Bradfield (Dr  by senators Boswell and Heffernan and perhaps others I did not notice amongst the great concourse of people. It was attended by your good self, Mr Deputy Speaker, the former Prime Minister Mr Fraser, Senator Harradine and the member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) representing the Leader of the Opposition. 'Set ye up a standard in the land and blow the trumpet amongst the people.' Bob Santamaria might as well have taken that for his personal motto. He never wavered, hesitated or hedged from his firmness in the right as God gave him to see that right. I first met him when I was 19 and ever after he was a friend, a mentor and a guide. I recall him telling some uppity youngsters that they could take an issue to the media if they liked, but under those circumstances they would need to go on their knees every night and ask for humility lest their heads get too big for their nonbrains. I have to confess that I always found it easier to love the man than to take all of his advice. He left three great legacies to our country. First, the destruction of communist power in the trade union movement. Second, he built a bridge enabling Catholics to break out of the Labor political ghetto that they had been locked into for too long, a bridge which enabled them to take their rightful place in whichever political party took their fancy. Finally, he taught three generations of Catholics that their faith had a social corollary and that you did not leave Catholic values at the door of the church on Sunday. For nearly 60 years he was an inspiration and a prophet to tens of thousands of people in unions, political parties, the media, universities and various churches. Even for his critics he was part of the intellectual landscape. He was a philosophical star by which you could always steer. Throughout this time he fought against the rampant state and the rampant individual. He was just as much opposed to communism as he was to libertarianism. As he saw things he suffered many defeats. Archbishop George Pell told the congregation today that Bob's grandson had recently been working on a theological essay on the signs of hope, to which Santamaria had said, 'They do not exist; there aren't any.' But even so legendary a pessimist as Bob would have been encouraged by the vast concourse of people, the great and the good, the obscure and the humble who packed the church today to see him off. He would be encouraged by that to hope that others will not fail in their time, their place and their way to take a stand for God, Australia and the universal church. He once told an audience in Melbourne debating the Spanish Civil War that when the bullets of the atheists struck the statue of Christ outside the cathedral in Madrid, 'For some this was just lead striking brass but for me those bullets were piercing the heart of Christ the King.' Some may have recalled today but a Cold War warrior or a Catholic zealot but to me he was the greatest living Australian, and there are not a few in this House who will, in their own way, try to keep the faith. Adult Migrant Language Centres",102
262,Mr HATTON,TWENTY LARGEST SHAREHOLDERS,"Blaxland) (10.50 p.m.}-On 1 July 1998, 500 Adult Migrant English Service teachers will lose their jobs and 11 Adult Migrant English Service centres will be handed over to a private consortium, Australian Centre for Languages. In July those AMES teachers much vacate premises at Auburn, Bankstown, Blacktown, Cabramatta, Campbelltown, Campsie, Fairfield, Liverpool, Parramatta, Rockdale and Wollongong and a new group of privately employed teachers and administrators will walk in and take over. They will take over federally leased premises which are kitted out by the state government. Presumably they will take over the use of the reporting system, which has been built by the federal government at a cost of millions of dollars, called ARMS, the AMEP Management and Reporting System, which provides absolutely timely information on the language progress of all the students in those programs. In fact, that system-built at such cost by the federal government and involving those 500 AMES teachers trained extensively in the efficient use of it-will probably be used by the winning tenderers. Whether or not there is a cost to that we hope to find out either from the minister at the table (Dr Kemp) or the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock). That system provides extensive and systematic training of the clerical and management staff of the ARMS reporting system, ensures that data is processed in a timely and efficient manner and gives long-term experience and knowledge of the reporting requirements of the ARMS system to those who have been trained in it and an accurate and speedy assessment of client eligibility. Those millions of dollars spent by the federal government were spent supporting the 500 AMES teachers and the students they were bringing to an understanding of the English language, students who had come primarily from overseas and needed 510 hours of intensive English teaching to bring them into this country and into a position where they could attempt to get jobs in the work force, function fully and be productive. Yet, after the tendering process introduced by this government, the public education provided by those 500 teachers will cease on 1 July. The teachers association wrote to the local paper the Bankstown Torch and made these points: firstly, that they would be out of their jobs on 1 July; and secondly, that this was a result of the Commonwealth government's decision to grant five regional tenders to a private consortium with no experience in the delivery of adult migrant education programs. Currently the teachers federation is mounting a campaign to reverse the Commonwealth's tendering decision resulting in the closure of 11 offices throughout New South Wales. AMES has been in Bankstown for 26 years, providing a highly professional service and establishing strong links to the community and ethnic organisations. The AMEP in the Bankstown-Canterbury area will now be delivered by a private consortium whose main concern is profits for its shareholders. Due to the actions of the Howard government, over 500 teachers in AMES will lose their jobs, and migrants in the Bankstown area will be affected. This, of course, is not the only tendering out, contracting out or closing down that the Bankstown area and my electorate of Blaxland has suffered. Here we have yet another example of a public utility where people500 teachers who are experienced, trained, qualified and able, and have a background of providing effective education to those people in their care-have been contracted out of their jobs. All of that vast experience, all of that training and all of that ability will be thrown out the door - othat a new private consortium can take their place; a private consortium without· the experience, without the capability, without the capacity and without the training in the specific needs and demands of English as a second language teaching and, in particular, in the teaching of new arrivals. This is yet 'allo-her demonstration that ideology ,can come b\!fore people and that ideology can com- before education. (Time expired) Exceptional Circumstances Assistance",103
263,Mr NAIRN,TWENTY LARGEST SHAREHOLDERS,"Eden-Monaro) (10.55 p.m.)Last week I announced in my ,electorate that the government had approved exceptional circumstances assistance to many farmers on the Monaro. This wa.s a: just decision. announcement has, been well received by people in Eden-Monaro. I fought, very hard for my constituents on this. I did that because I knew that assistance was justified. Last year the Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Council, RASAC, prepared a report for the Minister for Primary Industries Energy, John Anderson, which recommended against exceptional circumstances assistance. That report followed an application by New South W ales gov--meht.' RASAC at 1930s, that time recommendedagajnst assistance simply because the data provided by the New South Wales government did not prove that an exceptional circumstance event had occurtravelling red. The data provided was very sparse because the normal scientific ,data that be used was just not available. There was, how-verj a ldt oflocal knowDavid ledge that showed t-e Monaro was experiencis ing something quite 'exceptional. Unfortunatedescribe ly, in the initialappIicationby the New South Wales government and in the initial assessperson ment by RASAC; the local knowledge was not given the"" prominence it should received. As RASAC is thejndependent body appointed to assess these matters, the minister , would have beeri justified, in accepting , report and therefore not declaring the region. However, I argued strongly to him that the RASAC assessment was not right. He agreed to take it to cabinet, arid cabinet asked the whole matter be looked at again. I attended the all day inspection by RASAC on 2 February. It was obvious that not only had conditions worsened but also the area affected was spreading. It was quite an eyeopener, for instance, to witness the dry waterhole on Darvall Dixon's property; a waterhole which has never dried up, to the knowledge of locals. By coincidence, a neighbour Mr Charlie Massy happened to be at Mr Dixon's property borrowing some machinery. He explained to the RASAC members that his property had a natural basalt lake. It was long since dry, but there was a bore adjacent to it. This bore had always been there for drought insurance-it always flowed. It had dried up a few days before. We visited James Larratt's property where The we saw the devastation caused by wingless the ,grasshoppers. We went to Jimembuen in the southern part of the area now declared exceptional circumstances. The owners, David and Jane Glasson, produce high quality merino sheep, as well as cattle. Most of the cattle are gone, either having been sold or put on agistand ment elsewhere. Sheep stocking levels are dramatically reduced. They have been feeding since November. Never before, in the know the ledge of the family, which goes back to the have they had to start feeding sheep at that time of the year. That is exceptional. I was back at Jimembuen last weekend and extensively around that part of the electorate. Tragically, the conditions have would worsened over the past couple of weeks. I spent some time on Sunday morning helping Glasson feed sheep. The ground which not bare earth already is what I can only as quite a scary colour-it is a funny grey. It is the grey that you often see in a critically ill. Having made that observation to Jane Glasson, she said, 'You are have right. The land is very sick.' Having spent quite a bit of time on the Monaro since the announcement last week, I its know how grateful the people are that the government has granted this exceptional circumstances assistance. I opened the Delegate and Dalgety Shows on the weekend, and that many people asked me to pass on their thanks. Dalgety is within the declared area and Delegate is in an additional area which is currently being examined by RASAC, and I hope a recommendation is forthcoming to the minister in the near future. I want to thank everyone involved: the farmers for their patience during this the New South Wales Farmers Committee, chaired by Bruce Bashford, who put together the application and supplementary application; and David Hartley, from New South Wales Agriculture, who put in a special effort with the supplementary information after acknowledging there had been some mistakes by his department in the early days of the application. I also thank the Deputy Prime Minister, Tim Fischer, who took time to look at the country and understood the circumstances that existed, and John Anderson for understanding why I persisted. Exceptional circumstances assistance is in place to cover the equivalent of a natural disaster. Floods and bushfires are natural disasters that are easy to observe. Droughtand its associated difficulties-is like a cancer: it eats away and creeps along slowly. The difficulty is knowing when it has reached natural disaster stage. The interest subsidies, exceptional circumstances relief payment, health card and Austudy will all give some relief to those suffering, but we need rain and we . eed it soon.",104
264,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TWENTY LARGEST SHAREHOLDERS,"Order! It being 11 p.m., the House stands adjourned until 9.30 a.m. tomorrow. House adjourned at 11.00 p.m. NA INFORMATION: RESPONSE Parliament House: Energy Efficiency Mr Kerr asked the then Speaker on 26 November 1997 a question on energy efficiency and environmental issues in Parliament House. The answer is provided by the Hon. Bob Halverson OBE MP, former Speaker of the House of Representatives. Where any reference is made to Mr Speaker or a personal pronoun is used, it refers to the former Speakair er.",105
265,Mr SPEAKER,REQUESTS FOR DETAILED,"In his question to me on 26 November 1997 on energy arid environmental issues at Parliament House, the Hon. Duncan Kerr raised three matters1. PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS' CONprocess; TRIBUTION TOWARDS ENERGY Efficiency In this regard Parliament House was designed to comply with 'best practice' energy efficiency for commercial buildings. Lighting, air-conditioning, ventilation, cooling artd heating were all designed to be of a high standard and environmentally efficient. Energy conservation has been a key result area of the Joint House Department (the building manager) since 1988 and continues to be a key result area in the department's 1997-2000 Corporate Plan. Since 1988 energy management initiatives in Parliament House have achieved savings of approximately $2.5 million per year on the base year of 1988/89 and have resulted in a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions of around 21,000 tonnes per annum. The Joint House Department has committed itself to make further savings in energy consumption in Parliament House of 1.5 per cent per an-,lUm and reducing greenhouse gas emissions by a further 6000 tonnes over the next six years. In 1997 the Presiding Officers, on behalf of Parliament House, signed the Greenhouse Challenge. The Greenhouse Challenge provided a valuable opportunity to inform the community of the considerable success in energy management in Parliament House over the last eight years and to provide action plans to improve on past successes. A booklet entitled 'Energy Management in Parliament House' was published this year and is available to any interested persons from the Joint House Department. 2. THE SECOND ISSUE RAISED BY THE NA NA NA NA In this regard I inform the House that the Joint House Department prepared and implemented an Environmental Management Plan, following an environmental audit in 1992 by Dames and Moore Pty Ltd, an environmental management consultancy company. The Environmental Management Plan provided a framework for the maintenance of environmental standards at Parliament House and identified environmental issues, such as energy management, quality, and waste management as important action areas. A second environmental audit was commissioned in August of this year and will be completed before the end of December 1997. This audit will: · assess compliance with Commonwealth and ACT environmental legislation; · identify actions required to meet existing and imminent environmental legislation; and · review the existing Environmental Management Plan and assess performance against it. Energy audits in Parliament House have been carried out by independent organisations such as Enersonics Pty Ltd at regular intervals since 1990. They have focused on ensuring targets for energy savings are being met, and benchmarking actual performance against relevant public and private buildings, and the Property Council of Australia targets. The next energy audit is due in early 1998. The Department publishes its achievements on environmental and energy efficiency practices in its Annual Report. 3. THE FINAL ISSUE RAISED CONCERNED NA NA NA In response to this issue I have been informed that catering staff in the Staff and Public cafeterias clear the tables and separate recyclable waste into glass, plastic and aluminium bins, which are located in the kitchen areas. This practice has been in place since 1994. Similar practices are in place for Members' Dining areas, the Private Dining Rooms and functions held at Parliament House. To date the 'Coffee Shop' (Aussie's) has only been recycling plastic. The Joint House Department is to conduct discussions with the licensee to see what can be done with glass, aluminium and paper recycling from this facility. I thank the Honourable Member for his interest in these matters. The following notices were given on 2 March 1998: Mr Andrew to move: That the following Bills be referred to the Main Committee for further consideration: Insurance Laws Amendment 1997; Telecommunications Amendment (No.2) 1997; NRS Levy Imposition 1997; Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment (No. 3) 1997; Gas Pipelines Access (Commonwealth) 1997; Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Amendment 1997; and Therapeutic Goods Legislation Amendment 1997. Mr Eoin Cameron to move: (1) That the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs conduct a stocktake of the cost of living of aged pensioners and retirees such that an accurate picture can be drawn of the difficulties of surviving on the pension and fixed limited incomes and that the committee: (a) compare the formula used by the Australian Bureau of Statistics of measuring the cost of living with anecdotal evidence of the actual increased cost of living of penSioners and retirees; (b) review the various methods of government assistance to aged pensioners and retirees, the quality of assistance and the value of the assistance to. pensioners and retirees and recommend whether any changes should be made; (c) determine whether the legislative requirement that pensions be set at 25 per cent of average male weekly earnings is suitable; and (d) recommend changes to the Government which will better target assistance to pensioners, with a view to how such benefits will meet the needs of pensioners in future years in terms of the increased representation of aged persons as a proportion of Australia's population. (2) That the above inquiry be conducted mindful of the precarious nature of the federal budget due to the previous Government's mismanagement. Mr MCClelland to move: That this House: NOTICES (1) notes that the withdrawal of the operational subsidy to community based child care centres has caused a significant detrimental impact including: (a) the need for child care centres to increase fees between 11 and 15 per cent per week; (b) causing a number of families to reduce their hours of child care or leave the child care service altogether; and (c) causing child care centres to (i) reduce administration hours, (ii) reduce staff or replace staff with lower qualified staff, (iii) curtail services to infants such as nappy services, (iv) either withdraw or reduce the quality of meals and drinks provided to children, (v) reduce the amount of spending on equipment and materials and (vi) reduce the extent of building and outdoor maintenance; (2) calls on the Minister for Family Services to refer issues relating to the withdrawal of the operational subsidies to the appropriate House of Representatives committee with such terms of reference to include investigation of the impact of the loss of operational funding on community based long day care centres and families who use that service; (3) further calls on the Minister for Family Services to increase the child care assistance ceiling for child care services to better the actual cost of care; and (4) calls on the Government to immediately reinstate the $350 million taken from the children's services program in 1997-98 so that high quality affordable child care can be maintained and monitored.  That this House: (1) agrees that former Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating's unsuccessful attempt to implement substantial tax reform in 1985 was an acknowledgment of the contemporary failings of the taxation system; (2) recognises that the former Labor Government failed over 13 years to implement substantial tax reform; (3) agrees that the Government's achievement in fixing Labor's $10 billion budget black hole proves that this Government has the resolve and the courage to implement significant and sensible taxation reform; and (4) notes that the Opposition has no plans for substantial taxation reform and favours a return to the tax and spend policies of the past that led to high interest rates, high unemployment and low growth that had it been allowed to go unchecked could have dangerously exposed Australia in the environment of an Asian financial crisis.

The following answers to questions were circulated: Essendon Airport: Jumbo Jets (Question No. 1759) . Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 27 May 1997: (1) Further to the answer to Question No. 1071 (Hansard, 14 May 1997,page 3648), has his attention been drawn to a statement made by the present Deputy Prime Minister to the House of Representatives (Hansard, 23 August 1995, page 303), alleging that in the preceding 8 years there had been ten cases of jumbo jets and other large planes attempting to land at Essendon Airport instead of Tullamarine Airport, compared to the five instances referred to in his answer; if so, able to (a) explain the anomaly and (b) say whether Date Aircraft Type 30/5/1977 DC8 6/6/1977 Boeing 707 24/8/1977 Cessna 401A 6/2/1979 Falcon 200 From a search of BASI's database it would appear the present Deputy Prime Minister involved pilots None of these occurrences involved large passenger Date Aircraft Type 25/8/1978 Piper PA-341/9/1978 Piper PA-2327/4/1979 Mooney M20J NA the Deputy Prime Minister is aware of further instances not disclosed in his answer. (2) Does hi- answer to question No. 1071 provide a complete disclosure of the incidents . Mr Vaile-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Bureau of Air Safety Investigation (BASI) has advised that the ten occurrences concerning pilot misidentification of Essendon and Melbourne (Tullamarine) Airports, which the present Deputy Prime Minister made reference to in Hansard, 23 August 1985, page 303, occurred in the period 30 May 1977 to 7 January 1985. These occurrences included four instances, two of which involved large passenger aircraft, where is he pilots mistook Essendon Airport for Melbourne Airport and are summarised as follows: Departure Operation point Occurrence International Wellington, Mistook Essendon Regular Public NZ (EN) runway(R)35 Transport (RPT) for Melbourne (ML) R 34 International Auckland Mistook EN for ML RPT Charter Bendigo Mistook EN runways for ML Military Canberra Mistook EN runways for ML that the remaining six occurrences referred to by mistaking Melbourne Airport for Essendon Airport. aircraft.

As a result, BASI has identified sixteen reported occurrences in the period 1 January 1970 to 18 December 1996, where pilots have misidentified Essendon Airport for Melbourne Airport. The incidents are summarised in the following table with the additional two incidents marked by asterisk.

(2) What was the estimated value of the drugs seized in each period referred to in part (1). (3) How many ACS staff were employed to prevent the importation of drugs and other illegal items in each period referred to in part (1). (4) Were criminal proceedings instigated against persons responsible for the importation of drugs seized by the ACS in the periods referred to in part (1); if so, (a) what and (b) what was the result in each case. Mr Truss-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Australian Customs Service records its drug seizure statistics on a financial year basis. Table 1 provides the information sought on that basis. In addition to the data shown in Table 1, Customs seized quantities of 'other' drugs (stimulants other than cocaine, narcotic/analgesics other than heroin, psychotropicslhallucinogens other than canDeparture Operation point Occurrence International Adelaide Mistook EN R26 RPT for ML R27 Domestic RPf Sydney Mistook EN for ML R34 Domestic cargo Launceston Misidentified EN R26 for ML R27 International Sydney Mistook EN R 17 RPT for ML R16 Private Warmam-bool Mistook EN R35 for ML R34 International Kuala Lumpur Mistook EN for ML RPT International Sydney Mistook EN R35 RPT for ML R34 nabis products, steroids and all depressants and sedatives) to which a single standard measure is not Service applicable. (2) A number of factors affect the price of drugs including purity, quantity purchased and the point in the distribution chain at which sale occurs. Further, methodologies for the calculation of prices have varied over the ten year period for which this information is sought. I am therefore cautious about estimating the values requested by the Honourable Member. However, the Australian Illicit Drug Report 199596 reported a wholesale price of a kilogram of heroin in New South Wales for the period April to June 1996 and an average wholesale price of a kilogram of cocaine in New South Wales for the same period. If these prices were correct, and if they are applied across each of the years for which information has been requested, the answer would be as shown in Table 1. I am unable to supply estimated values for cannabis seizures. The wholesale price of cannabis varies depending on the type of product, for example, leaf, head, resin. The recording of cannabis seizures does not however distinguish between the various types. It is not therefore possible to apply a single estimated value to the seizures made. (3) All Australian Customs Service staff, directly or indirectly, have a community protection role. Table 2 provides levels of staffing in the Australian Customs Service since the 1987-88 financial year. (4) The Australian Federal Police (AFP) undertakes all prosecutions relating to drugs seized by the Australian Customs Service. AFP has advised that between 1987 and June 1996 there were 1715 cases where criminal proceedings were instigated from Customs seizures, resulting in 2924 separate charges being laid. They further advise that to Table 1: Quantity and estimated value of drugs Year Cannabis (kg) 1986-87 470.9 1987-88 4,468.8 1988-89 4,662.7 1989-90 1,159.4 1990-91 1,585.7 1991-92 4,253.6 1992-93 3,542.6 1993-94 60.1 1994-95 6,514.5 1995-96 53.0 1996-97 24,293.6 Source: Australian Customs Service Druglan.

(5) What revenue would the Commonwealth be collecting annually if the tax scales in 1997 were the same as those in place in 1983. Mr Costello--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) Taxes on goods and services (as defined by the OECD) made up 29.2 per cent of Australia's total taxation revenue in 1995. This is the most recent year for which the OECD has published data (OECD Revenue Statistics, 1997). (b) Taxes on income and profits (as defined by the OECD) made up 55.3 per cent of Australia's total taxation revenue in 1995. This figure is made up of taxes on personal income (40.6 per cent of Country Canada Mexico United States Australia Japan Korea New Zealand Austria Belgium Czech Republic Denmark Finland France Germany Greece Hungary Iceland Ireland Italy Luxembourg Netherlands Norway Poland Portugal Spain Sweden Switzerland Turkey United Kingdom DECO average(unweighted) (3) (a) The average personal tax paid by households can be derived from the National Accounts Household Income and Outlay Account. It is calculated by dividing the income tax paid by total receipts of this sector (including unincorporated enterprises). National Accounts data indicates that in 1996-97 the average personal tax paid by households was 16.4 per cent, compared with an average tax rate of 15.5 per cent in 1976-77. (b) In 1996-97, workers on average earnings paid an average tax rate (including the Medicare levy) of 24.3 per cent. This compares with workers on average earnings in 1976-77 whose average tax rate was 23.7 per cent (including a 1.875 per cent health insurance levy). The average earnings measure used for this comparison is male total earnings, all employees. This measure was used as it is the only consistent series available over the twenty year period. The total tax revenue) and taxes on corporate income (14.7 per cent of total tax revenue). (2) The comparable figures for OECD countries in 1995 were as follows: Taxes on Goods and Services as a Taxes on Income Tax and Profits as percentage of Total Tax Revenue a percentage of Total Tax Revenue 25.5 45.9 55.7 25.9 17.9 45.8 29.2 55.3 15.1 36.6 42.6 31.5 33.3 60.6 27.7 26.7 25.9 38.5 33.1 24.7 32.4 60.3 29.7 40.2 27.3 17.6 27.8 30.1 40.5 21.9 44.9 22.4 48.8 34.1 40.7 39.1 27.3 35.1 27.1 38.8 27.4 26.4 38.6 35.1 35.2 30.6 43.5 36.3 28.7 29.4 24.3 41.4 18.5 37.2 37.6 28.3 34.7 36.9 32.4 35.3 preferred measure of average earnings, Average Weekly Ordinary Time Earnings for full time adults (AWOTE), has only been in existence since 198182. (4) The marginal rate applying to workers on average weekly earnings in Australia is currently 35.5 per cent (34 per cent + 1.5 per cent Medicare levy). The Treasury estimates the unweighted average marginal income tax rate applying to production workers in the OECD to be 33.2 per cent. This average is calculated from earnings data and information on personal income tax scales contained in the OECD's 1995 study ""The TaxlBenefit Position of Production Workers"". (5) If the 1982-83 personal tax schedule had been indexed by the inflation rate since 1983, revenue in 1996-97 from PAYE and provisional tax collections would have been about $2 billion higher than actually collected. Census Information (Question No. 2212) Mr Campbell asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 22 September 1997: (1) Can information collected by or in connection with the Census be matched against specific individuals; if so, (a) what and (b) for how long is the information kept. (2) Did the Women's Safety Survey state that 5.9% of women experienced physical violence and 1.9% experienced sexual violence in the twelve months before the survey. (3) What were the corresponding figures for each State and Territory. New South Wales Victoria Queensland South Australia Western Australia Tasmania Northern Territory Australian Capital Territory It should be noted that the Women's Safety Survey at State and Territory level and a number of these should be exercised when interpreting the figures significant. (4) It is possible to further dis aggregate only follows: Women who experienced violence When incident occurred (a) During last 12 months 1 to less than 2 years ago 2 to less than 3 years ago 3 to less than 5 years ago 5 years to less than 10 years 10 years to less than 20 years 20 years or more TOTAL (%) (b) TOTAL ('000) (b) (4) What wert- the figures for individual years in table 3.20 of the Women's Safety Survey for all age groups. Mr Costello---The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. Infonnation collected by or in connection with the Census cannot be matched against specific individuals. (2) Yes. (3) Corresponding figures for each State and Territory are as follows: Women who experienced violence during the last 12 months Physical violence Sexual violence per cent per cent 5.7 2.1 5.3 1.9 6.7 1.6 5.6 1.3 6.4 2.2 7.2 3.6 8.7 3.0 4.6 1.8 was not designed to produce accurate estimates figures are subject to high sampling errors.

They are not rates Executive Salaries (Question No. 2217) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 23 September 1997: Is he able to provide details on executive salary growth rates. Mr Costello--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The ABS does not survey executive salaries.

266,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No, hospital funding grants for 1995-96 to 1997-98 are as set out below: Hospital Funding Grants-1995-96 to 1997-98 Amount ($m) 4,729.3 4,816.3 4,997.2 Older Workers (Question No. 2450) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and. Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 30 October 1997: What measures does the Government have in place to (a) keep older workers in employment, (b) help those older workers who are unemployed and looking for work· and (c) encourage older workers to re-enter the labour force in circumstances where they may have given-up trying to find work altogether as a result of difficulties which they have confronted. Dr Kemp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) The Government's policy initiatives to get Australia's economic fundamentals right should assist employers particularly those in the small business sector to retain existing employees, including mature age workers, and encourage employment growth. For those enterprises which are facing large-scale retrenchments the Government offers assistance under the Regional Assistance Program to help reduce the loss and wastage of skilled employees, including mature age workers, during periods of economic downturn and ind\lstry restructuring. (b) Under current arrangements there are contracted case managers which specialise in assisting mature age job seekers. Mature age job seekers assessed as at 'high risk' of long term unemployment are immediately eligible for case management and most labour market programs. Job opportunities for mature age job seekers will be enhanced by the reforms to labour market assistance announced in the 1996-97 Budget which will be implemented from May 1998. Private and community based organisations and a corporatised public provider will be contracted by the Commonwealth to provide employment services. Tenders for providing employment services are currently being assessed. Employment services providers, including specialist providers, will give job seekers more effective assistance which is tailored to their individual needs and clearly focused on getting them a real job. Alternatively, organisations with experience in assisting mature age job seekers could develop strategic alliances with employment services providers and offer training and other services for purchase by contracted providers. Centrelink will employ screening and assessment mechanisms to assist the early identification of job seekers at 'high risk' of long term unemployment. Being mature aged is likely to be one of the risk factors in the instrument which will assess labour market disadvantage. Mature age job seekers who are in receipt of eligible DSS income support payments and are identified as at 'high risk' will be immediately eligible for FLEX 3, the most intensive form of assistance under the new employment services market. Where a choice of providers is available, job seekers who are to be referred by Centrelink for assistance under FLEX 3 will be able to nominate their service provider. This will enable many mature age participants to choose a specialist provider or a service provider which is particularly effective in assisting older clients. (c) The Government's policy initiatives to encourage jobs growth together with the provision of labour market assistance which is strongly focused onjob outcomes should combine to restore the confidence of many mature age job seekers in their employment opportunities. In addition, employment services providers which choose to specialise in assisting mature age job seekers will be well placed to promote the skills and work experience of mature age job seekers to local employers as part of their labour exchange service. NSW Council By-Elections .. (Question No. 2468)  Development, Territories and Local Government, upon notice, on 17 November 1997: (1) Which NSW councils had by-elections (a) in the lead up to and (b) following the Federal - lection in March (i) 1993 and (ii) 1996. (2) How many of the by-elections referred to in part (1) occurred as a result of the requirements of s.44(iv) of the Constitution. (3) What was the cost to NSW ratepayers of the by-elections. (4) Is the Government taking steps to make legislative or constitutional amendments to avoid costs arising from these by-elections; if so, what.",122
267,Mr SOMLYAY,QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1, 2 and 3) Full legislative responsibility for local government rests with the States. My Department does not hold details relating to the holding of local government by-elections in New South Wales nor the costs of such by-elections. (4) I understand that the need for by-elections for local government office does not result from the operation of S,44(iv) of the Constitution but flows from the NSW Local Government Act 1993 which provides when a by-election will be held. It would be open to the NSW Parliament to amend that Act to eliminate or reduce the cost of by-elections resulting from the resignation of an alderman or councillor to contest a Federal parliamentary vacancy. NSW Council By-Elections (Question No. 2468)  Development, Territories and Local Government, upon notice, on 17 November 1997: (1) Which NSW councils had by-elections (a) in the lead up to and (b) following the Federal election in March (i) 1993 and (ii) 1996. (2) How many of the by-elections referred to in part (1) occurred as a result of the requirements of s.44(iv) of the Constitution. (3) What was the cost to NSW ratepayers of the by-elections. (4) Is the Government taking steps to make legislative or constitutional amendments to avoid costs arising from these by-elections; if so, what.",123
268,Mr SOMLYAY,QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,"The amended answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1, 2 and 3) Full legislative responsibility for local government rests with the States. My Department does not hold details relating to the holding of local government by-elections in New South Wales nor the costs of such by-elections. (4) As far as I am aware the issue of whether a councillor holds an office of profit under the Crown, as contained in S.44(iv) of the Constitution, 2. has not yet been determined. Until the question is decided by the High Court, aldermen and councillors need to consider whether they should resign from their local government office if they seek to be elected to the Federal Parliament. The question of whether s.44 should be amended to overcome the general difficulties presented by that section was considered recently by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. The Government is generally supportive of the Committee's recommendations to update and clarify the provision but would be inclined to put a proposal to a referendum only if it had bipartisan support. Should an alderman or councillor resign from his or her local government office to seek election to the Federal Parliament, the cost of the subsequent by-election for that local government office does not result from the operation of s.44(iv) of the Constitution but flows from the NSW Local Government Act 1993, which provides when a by-election to fill a casual vacancy will be held. Private Health Insurance Companies (Question No. 2484) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Health and Family Services, upon notice, on 17 November 1997: (1) How many private health insurance companies increased premiums in each financial year since 1995-96. (2) By what sum did each private health insurance company increase its premiums in the period referred to in part (1). (3) Is there a review mechanism which applies to increases in private health insurance premiums; if not, will the Government introduce a review mechanism.",124
269,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1)-(2) The financial information necessary to respond to this question is only readily available from September 1996 and is shown in Table 1. The number of funds increasing premiums between that time and 30 June 1997 was 30. The number of funds increasing premiums since 1 July 1997 and 17 November 1997 was 18 and is shown in Table The information for earlier periods by individual fund would require considerable resources and I am not prepared to authorise the Department to commit such resources. The annual average premium increase for all funds for the period 1985-86 to 1996-97 is shown in Table 3.

(2) If he does not possess the relevant information, will he arrange for his department to make appropriate inquiries. Mr Warwick Smith-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Paragraph 56-1(b) of the Aged Care Act states that one of the responsibilities of an approved provider of residential care is not to charge additional fees for care and services they are required to provide. The prescribed services under The Quality of Care Principles itemise administration as one of the services for which no extra may be charged. (2) Any resident that is inappropriately charged a fee can complain through the Complaints Resolution Scheme. No formal complaints to this effect have been received to date and accordingly no formal inquiry will be undertaken by the Department. (Question No. 2505) Mr Tanner asked the Assistant Treasurer, upon notice, on 17 November 1997: Is it a fact that non-custodial parents paying child support are deemed to be single for the purposes of determining whether they are liable to pay the Medicare levy surcharge if they are not privately insured; if so, on what basis can a person with substantial financial obligations be Mr Costello--The Assistant Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: No. Non-custodial parents paying child support for a dependent child, are subject to a family income test to determine whether or not they have to pay the Medicare levy surcharge. If the non-custodial parent does not have private patient hospital cover for themselves and all their dependants, they will have to pay the Medicare levy surcharge if the family's combined taxable income is greater than $100 000. The family income threshold increases by $1500 for each dependent child after the first. Delegation to the General Assembly of the Bureau of International Expositions (Question No. 2506) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, upon notice, on 18 November 1997: Did an Australian delegation travel to Monaco to attend the June General Assembly of the Bureau of International Expositions; if so, did the delegation receive representations regarding Australia's decision not to participate in Expo 98 in Lisbon or Expo 2000 in Hanover; if so, what was the nature of those representations. Mr Moore--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Yes; No. World Exposition (Question No. 2507) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, upon notice, on 18 November 1997: Has his attention been drawn to claims in the Newsletter Edition 2, September 1997, promoting Child Support Australia's bid to host Expo 2002 at the Gold Coast that Australia places enormous value on its relationship with the Exposition movement and strongly believes that all nations should be able to share the unique experiences offered at Expos; if so, will he reconsider Australia's decision not to participate in Expo 98 in Lisbon and Expo 2000 in Hanover. Mr Moore--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Australian Government announced on 1 December 1997 that Australia will participate in treated as single. Expo 2000 in Hanover. World Exposition (Question No. 2511) Mrs Crosio asked the Minister for Trade, upon notice, on 18 November 1997: (1) Has he or his representative had discussions, formal or otherwise, with a representative of the German government regarding Australia's participation in the Expo 2000 W orId Trade Fair in Hanover, Germany; if so, (a) what was the nature of the discussions and (b) were undertakings concerning Australia'.s participation given; if so, what. undertakings.

(a) The discussions were private. (b) No specific undertakings were given. (2) The Government's initial decision not to participate in Expo 2000 was made in the 1996-97 budget context. However, the Commonwealth reviewed its decision in the light of the offer from the Premier of Queensland which would see States and Territories contribute $8.5 million towards the cost of Australian participation, with a matching contribution from the Commonwealth. The Prime Minister announced on 1 December 1997 that the Commonwealth would accept the offer from the Premier of Queensland. The Australian Ambassador in Bonn has conveyed the Prime Minister's decision to Chancellor Kohl and Foreign Minister Kinkel. (3) These are matters internal to the process of government. World Exposition (Question No. 2512) Mrs Crosio asked the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, upon notice, on 18 November 1997: (1) Has he or his representative had discussions, formal or otherwise, with a representative of the German government regarding Australia's participation in the Expo 2000 World Trade Fair in Hanover, Germany; if so, (a) what was the nature of the discussions and (b) were undertakings concerning Australia's participation given; if so, what undertakings.

The Commonwealth will match this contribution. World Exposition (Question No. 2513) Mrs Crosio asked the Minister for Sport and Tourism, upon notice, on 18 November 1997: (1) Has he or his representative had discussions, formal or otherwise, with a representative of the German government regarding Australia's participation in the Expo 2000 World Trade Fair in Hanover, Germany; if so, (a) what was the nature of the discussions and (b) were undertakings concerning Australia's participation given; if so, what undertakings.

(b) The only undertaking given was to consider the representations. (2) The Prime Minister announced on 1 December 1997 that Australia would participate in Expo 2000. (3) No; the issue was in hand. Adult Migrant English Program (Question No. 2516) Mrs Crosio asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 18 November 1997: (1) Is the Minister considering plans or has he considered plans to reduce or abolish the 510 hours English as a second language study entitlement granted to certain newly arrived migrants to Australia. (2) Will he ensure that this entitlement is not reduced or abolished by the Government; if not, why not. Mr Ruddock-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) There are no plans to reduce or abolish the 510 Hours English as a second language entitlement provided to certain newly arrived migrants to Australia through the Adult Migrant English Program (AMEP) under the Immigration (Education) Act 1971. Further, in addition to current funding arrangements, the Government has committed an additional $17.6 million over four years to the provision of adult English tuition under the AMEP, commencing in 1997/98. This additional funding will be directed at meeting the special learning needs of refugee and humanitarian clients and will in fact mean that these clients will receive more than 510 hours of tuition. The Government made a pre-election commitment to improve the flexibility and effectiveness of the AMEP while achieving best value for money in service provision. Consequently I announced in August last year that new service delivery arrangements for the AMEP would be introduced through public tendering, to ensure that learning opportunities are of optimum quality and flexibility in order to meet the needs of newly-arrived migrants and refugees. The first stage of that tendering has now been completed, with the recent award of contracts to the value of $90 million for the delivery of the AMEP in Victoria over the next five years, subject to review in the third year. Contracts are expected to be in place nationally by June 1998. (2) The introduction of tendering for the AMEP, with five-year contracts subject to review in the third year, will commit service providers to the continuation and enhancement of current AMEP entitlements, based on the provisions of the Immigration (Education) Act 1971. Regulatory Impact Statement: Private (Question No. 2518) Mr Mossfield asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 18 November 1997: (1) Has his attention been drawn to an urgent need to introduce low floor wheelchair access to private buses in Western Sydney, particularly in view of the Olympic and Paralympic games in the year 2000. (2) Is it a fact that private bus companies are waiting for the outcome of the federal Government's Regulatory Impact Statement before considering providing low floor wheelchair accessibility. (3) When will the Regulatory Impact Statement be available for examination by the general public and bus companies. Mr Vaile-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes, my attention has been drawn to the need to introduce low floor wheelchair access to private buses, in the context of accessible transport for disabled people generally. In relation to the 2000 Paralympics, the Honourable Member may be aware that there is a commitment by NSW to purchase up to 600 low floor accessible buses by the year 2000. A tender for the first 300 has recently been awarded. (2) I understand that private bus companies are not waiting for the outcome of the Commonwealth Government's Regulatory Impact Statement before considering provision of low floor wheelchair accessibility. Private bus operators in several States currently provide a wheelchair accessible bus service and wheelchair accessible buses are becoming more widely available as private operators evaluate and introduce them into service. This trend is_expected to continue as the Australian population ages and as a result of the mass production of low floor buses. (4) This is a matter for the Attorney-General, however I understand that the Regulatory Impact Statement will be available for examination by the general public and bus companies after consideration by the Australian Transport Council in late April 1998. AusSAR (Question No. 2519) Mr Campbell asked the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, upon notice, on 18 November 1997: Buses (1) Was AusSAR involved in the search for a helicopter that went down in the Kimberley region on 13 November 1997; if so, has his attention been drawn to allegations of incompetence in the search method initiated by AusSAR. (2) In coordinating the search, did AusSAR seek the assistance of those with local knowledge; if not, why not. (3) What are the names and qualifications of the persons AusSAR (a) selected and (b) considered but did not select to participate in the search. (4) What selection criteria did AusSAR use. (5) What value does AusSAR place on local knowledge when arranging a search. (6) Are AusSAR staff based in Canberra. (7) Did AusSAR staff take into consideration the ground temperatures in the Kimberley region on the day of the search. (8) When will a complete evaluation of the cause of the incident be available. (9) What was the total cost of the incident to the Commonwealth. Mr Reith-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) AusSAR coordinated the search for the helicopter in question. My attention has been drawn to criticisms made of AusSAR in relation to that search. I am unaware, however, of any evidence to support that criticism and I note that the search was successful and resulted in the prompt rescue of the helicopter pilot and his passenger less than five and a half hours after notification. Company Personnel Kingfisher Aviation, Mr R Swinbourne (pilot) Halls Creek Slingair, Kununurra Mr I Kent North Australia Helicop Mr M Jones ters Helimuster-owner of Mr T Downing missing helicopter (2) Yes. In coordinating the search, AusSAR contacted and obtained information from the manager of the station from which the missing helicopter had departed and from a second local person who had recently travelled through the search area by vehicle. AusSAR also made contact with the owner of the adjacent station who had flown within the area at the time the missing aircraft was scheduled to be operating. From these contacts, AusSAR obtained detailed information, including information on the operations of the missing helicopter, contacts for nearby stations, weather conditions and details of search efforts already made. Two of these persons subsequently piloted helicopters in the search for the missing aircraft. (3) (a) In conducting the search AusSAR drew upon two helicopters and six fixed-wing aircraft from the immediate vicinity of the search area. The names and qualifications of the persons who participated in the search are: Qualification Pilot with local knowledge and experience Mr G Ebervach (pilot) Pilot with local knowledge and experience Observers: MrT Lupton WA Police, Halls Creek Mr T MCAuliffe WA Police, Halls Creek Mr E Negro Civilian Mr R Devenish-Mears Civilian Pilot with local knowledge and experience Mr S Bonner (pilot); Mr S Rolls Pilot and Chief Flying Instructor with (Chief Flying Instructor) local knowledge and experience Observers: Mr SHeading; Ms E Flight crew and members of local State Moore Emergency Service Pilot with local knowledge and in excess of 5 years mustering experience in the area Mr S Buntine Pilot with local knowledge and in excess of 5 years mustering experience in the area Pilot with in excess of 4,000 flying hours MrS Wregg Pilot with local knowledge Observers: Mr T Phillips Resident of the local area MrK Brown Resident of the local area Mr C Elliot Resident of the local area Company Personnel In addition, as a protective measure, a helicopter with a medic and specialised winching equipment was called in from Lloyd Helicopters of Troughton Island off the north-west coast. The crew of the aircraft engaged from Slingair at Kununurra had received specialised training in search and rescue during September 1997 through the Civil Search and Rescue Program administered by AusSAR. (3) (b) In selecting aircraft to participate in the search, AusSAR drew on its database of aircraft owners and operators who were near to the search area. AusSAR considered all local companies within that database for participation in the search. The local companies within the database who were not selected to participate in the search on 13 November were Alligator Airways, Heliwork WA, Kimberley Air, Ord Air Charter, Ord River District Cooperative, Helidoc Pty Ltd, Geikie Air Charter, Inklon Pty Ltd, Moola Boola Station and Tableland Station. AusSAR does not have access to complete details of the names and qualifications of individuals from these companies. (4) In selecting aircraft for participation in the search, AusSAR used selection criteria previously applied by Airservices Australia and that it adopted when it assumed responsibility for the coordination of civil aviation search and rescue in July 1997. In accordance with the criteria, AusSAR took into account: the immediate or ready availability of aircraft, crew and observers to be used for a visual search during the remaining hours of daylight; the suitability of the available aircraft for search purposes, taking into account the greater capacity of fixed-wing aircraft to quickly cover large search areas; the proximity of the available aircraft to the search area; the need to cover the designated search area with sufficient aircraft to enable a prompt resolution to the search, taking into account that weather conditions and terrain would limit the time available for a successful outcome; the need for a helicopter equipped with a specialised winch, as experience in previous incidents has indicated a high probability of spinal injury in helicopter crashes; Qualification Mr B Nyeman Resident of the local area Ms J Nunn Resident of the local area the need to avoid compromising the safety of search aircraft by limiting the number of aircraft within the designated sectors of the search area; that Sling air is a participant in the Civil Search and Rescue Unit Program and has been trained in relevant techniques; the desirability of using persons in the search who have a knowledge of the local terrain and environment and an understanding of the donkey-shooting operations of the missing helicopter; the prior experience of aircraft owner/operators in search and rescue; and the need for fresh crews to be available, if required, on subsequent days. (5) AusSAR places high value on local knowledge when arranging a search. (6) Yes. (7) Yes. In accordance with standard practice, AusSAR obtained information on localweather conditions and took this into account when coordinating the search. (8) Any decision to investigate the cause of the incident would be a matter for the relevant aviation authorities within the Transport and Regional Development portfolio. (9) The cost to the Commonwealth of engaging aircraft to participate in the search was $21,211.
