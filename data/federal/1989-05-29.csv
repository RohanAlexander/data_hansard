1,Mr HAWKE ,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Wills-Prime Minister)Madam Speaker, I preface my comments by warmly welcoming you back to the House. As a matter of courtesy, I inform the House that the Minister for Social Security, Mr Howe, continues to be absent on sick leave. In his absence the Minister for Community Services and Health, Dr Blewett, is the Acting Minister. I also inform the House-in case it has not been noticed-that the Treasurer, Mr Keating, left Australia on 26 May on Government business overseas. He will return on 12 June and in his absence the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Dawkins, is the Acting Treasurer. . QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE NA EmptyHere press the same good wish to you on behalf of the Opposition. I am pleased to see you here. Notwithstanding what the Prime Minister just said, my question is directed to him. Will he give an assurance that he will recall the Treasurer immediately the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development Council meetings have concluded?",10
2,Mr HAWKE,TREASURER,No. NA,10
3,Mr LANGMORE,SOCIAL SECURITY,Can the Acting Minister for Social Security tell the House what has been the Government's approach to restructuring social security expenditure? What are the alternatives to this approach and . what are the implications of these alternatives? Mr Beale-A hypothetical question.,10
4,Dr BLEWETT,SOCIAL SECURITY,"There is nothing hypothetical about the Government's approach to social security. It has been based on maintaining the integrity of the system while ensuring that assistance goes to those most in need as well as breaking down the barriers to employment. Programs such as the jobs, education and training (JET) and new start programs are aimed at helping sole parents and the long term unemployed overcome the barriers to work force participation and get jobs again. They should be seen as part of the social welfare program. At the same time, the Government maintains its strong commitment to those groups in the community for which there is an accepted level of dependence, such as the aged and disabled. That is the Government's policy. It is targeted; it is balanced; it integrates benefits with incentives; it is compassionate. What is the alternative? The alternative approach has been heralded by those who do not understand the nature of the social security system. Quite clearly, it would include a tightening of eligibility rules, a toughening of the income and assets test, and the abolition of the indexation of pensions, benefits and family allowances. This latter approach, this alternative approach to the Government's social welfare policy, has emerged as the Opposition's major policy platform during the past three weeks. We are all aware that the Opposition's shadow Treasurer has made it quite clear that a coalition government would slash social welfare expenditure. But the honourable member for Wentworth has very conveniently refused to state in what specific .areas he would make those cuts. I am glad he has promised an answer, because we are entitled to know just whom the honourable member for Wentworth will target for his cuts. Let me mention a few of the major areas of social welfare. Will his target be Australia's 1.7 million age and service pensioners, will he target the family allowance payments made to nearly two million families with more than 3.8 children, or will he target the payments for the 1.2 million children of those 530,000 low income families who have been very much the beneficiaries of this Government's social welfare policy? Is the honourable member for Wentworth actually proposing to tighten the assets test to which Opposition members were so strongly opposed some time ago? Mr Tim Fischer-Madam Speaker, I raise a point of order.",10
5,Madam SPEAKER,SOCIAL SECURITY,"The honourable member for Farrer will wait till the Chair calls him. I now call the honourable member. Mr Tim Fischer-Thank you, Madam rected Speaker, and welcome back. My point of order is that the Minister is now raising series of rhetorical questions concerning honourable member for Wentworth: He is no longer answering the original question was asked. In accordance with standing der 145, I ask that you direct him either answer the lingering parts of the question yet to be answered or to resume his seat.",11
6,Madam SPEAKER,SOCIAL SECURITY,"The Chair will be fact making a statement on this matter later. the moment, I find the Minister in order.",11
7,Dr BLEWETT,SOCIAL SECURITY,",-Madam Speaker, I raise these questions, in the interests of the tralian people, to get answers as to whether the Opposition intends to tighten the assets test. Will the honourable member for ious Wentworth target it through the back door by abolishing tax and fringe sions - hich go to age pensioners? The honourable member for Wentworth has a duty to spell out to the electorate what means by these specific cuts because anyone who makes these sorts of claims is totally ignorant of the targeting of social welfare this Government. . Let me just point out that since. 1983 social security outlays have fallen from 6.9 per cent of gross domestic product to 6.2 cent in 1987-88, and we expect that they will be at 6 per cent in 1989-90. Social security has also declined as a proportion real Budget outlays from 24.1 per cent 1983-84 to 23 per cent in 1987-88. Perhaps the most significant statistic of all is that since 1983 the proportion of pensioners and beneficiaries has fallen from 41.9 per 100 people in the labour force to 35.2 June 1988. The Hewson solution would destroy the past seven years of repair work and targeting by this Government since we inherited the social welfare problems can say with confidence that the basis of the honourable member for Wentworth's call for more social welfare is simply a yuppie combination of prejudice, ignorance and opporsort tunism. NA NA",11
8,Mr HALVERSON,TREASURER,"My question is dil to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. Is it a a fact that the Treasurer's trip to the Soviet the Union was privately organised by his ministerial office and not by any government dehe partment, including Treasury? Can the orMinister confirm that the Department of to Foreign Affairs and Trade first learned of the Treasurer's Soviet visit from the Australian Embassy in Moscow, which has expressed its frustration and concern about the that the itinerary and arrangements were At organised without its involvement? Can the Minister also confirm that besides Moscow and Leningrad, the Treasurer will also be visiting a number of towns and city areas Auswhich hold no relevance for any Australian Government business? Is it a fact that the common link between the Treasurer's varports of call in - he Soviet Union is th-ir significance as tradmg centres for empIre benefits concesperiod antiques?",11
9,Mr DUFFY,TREASURER,"In relation to the latter parts of the very long question from the honourhe able member, I must say that I have no knowledge of any' outrage or the indications that he said exist in the Embassy in Moscow. of Further I have no knowledge whatsoever of the arr-ngements for the Treasurer's trips. I would have thought that the Treasurer, who has served the country as well as he has in per the last six years, is more than capable of organising his own overseas trav-l witho.ut consulting the Department of ForeIgn AffaIrs of and Trade. Because of its stupidity, I shall in ignore the last allegation made by the honourable member of there being some relevance in relation to certain ports of call of the Treasurer. However, as to the couple of small matters of substance that the honourable member raised, I will obtain information per 100 in and provide him with advice. NA",11

11,Mr BILNEY,ARMS CONTROL,"I do not respond to that of sexual innuendo, Madam Speaker. My question is on. a much more serious matter and is addressed to the Prime Minister. What is the Australian Government's attimore tude towards recent encouraging developthe ments on arms reductions between the superpowers? Do those developments have any implications for the Asia-Pacific region? "" Mr HAWKE-I thank the honourable note member for Kingston for his question. very pleased to say that certainly very portant and very positive moves in arms control are under way between the United States of America and the Soviet Union. As a result of the improvement in the relations between the United States and the Soviet Union, which were initiated during of the presidency of President Reagan through his relations with Mr Gorbachevforemost they have been continued under the new enormous presidency in the United States of President Bush-I believe that unprecedented opporand tunities do now exist to reduce decisively military competition and to build in the of that escalating military competition structive and cooperative sets of relationflexible ships between the two superpowers. As we know, the intermediate-range nuConsistently clear free agreement was concluded last year and the strategic arms reductions talks, are aimed at a 50 per cent reduction in strategic missiles, are due to resume next month. In addition to those achievements and the programs firmly in place, statements by Soviet and United States leaders in recent ferred. days now make it clear that thereÂ· is a very promising convergence of negotiating positions on conventional forces in Europe which, as I think we all know, goes to the heart the whole post-war East-West conflict. There is the prospect now of understandings being reached on troop numbers, tanks, armoured personnel carriers, combat aircraft and helion copters, as well as deployment from one country to another. Obviously, we do not, and nor would one who has any knowledge in this area, interest payments? understate or underestimate the difficulties that remain and, indeed, the long course negotiations which obviously still lie ahead. But we are very much encouraged by and two look forward to the outcome of this week's North Atlantic Treaty Organisation summit. What proves to be possible in Europe we believe will be an invaluable precedent for other regions, including the Asia-Pacific gion, where Australian interests are even directly engaged. We have noted that unilateral reductions announced by President Gorbachev at the United Nations in December of 1988 include a cut of about 200,000 troops in the SQviet far east, and we also that some Soviet forces have alI am ready been withdrawn from Mongolia. At imthe Sino-Soviet summit earlier this month President Gorbachev indicated other force reductions planned by the Soviet Union in this region. I look forward to discussing these issues with President Bush and leaders in France, Germany, Britain and Hungary durthe period ing my forthcoming visit. This Government has been among the of those which have recognised the potential for positive change in the Soviet Union's program of internal reform the new and constructive attitudes that it shows in foreign and defence policy. We place have taken the view-and have taken it conclearly and consistently-that a firm but Western posture is the most likely to take the best advantage of that potential. we have said in those circumstances that we will judge and continue to which judge the Soviet Union not just by words but by deeds. We believe that the approach that we have adopted now over a considerable period has been justified and vindicated by the turn of events to which I have reNA",11
12,Dr HEWSON,INTERNATIONAL CREDIT RATING,"I ask the Acting Treasof urer: In view of the decision by Moody's Investor Services Inc. to consider downgrading Australia's credit rating, what was the impact of the downgrading to AAI in 1986 our international reputation and on the servicing costs on our foreign debt? In the event of a further downgrading of our credit anyrating, what effect will this have on our",12
13,Mr DAWKINS,INTERNATIONAL CREDIT RATING,"The honourable memof ber's question follows the announcement by Moody's Investor Services Inc., one of the credit rating agencies in the United States of America, to review Australia's credit rating. The statement released by Moody's reads more like a political pamphlet than a reputable statement by a credit rating agency. reThe important thing is that Moody's is not the only credit rating agency. Indeed, in this morning's Australian Financial Review, Standard and Poor's, the other leading credit rating agency in the United States and a larger agency than Moody's, is reported as saying that it has .no new concerns. abo-t Australia's economic outlook, that It disagrees with the decision by Moody's and that it has reaffirmed its views about Australia's credit rating being AA plus only a couple of months ago. The honourable member has asked about the decision by Moody's a couple of years ago. It is perhaps worth mentioning that a variety of observations have been made about the Australian economy. Not all of those would gel with the view which Moody's - ook a couple of years ago or which Moody's seems to be concerned about now, Mr Ian Kerr of Kidder Peabody International said recently that it was 'ludicrous' that Australia's credit rating had been downgraded from AAA to AAI in June 1986 when in comparison many near bankrupt savings and loan institutions in the United States were rated at AAA. It is not a clear-cut case. The Government's own view is that any review at this time is certainly not warranted. Perhaps it is worth referring to the comments of Mr Nye, the map who apparently runs the Australia desk for Moody's in New York. He says: Nothing in particular in the last day, week or month we can put a finger on has triggered this review. It is the whole set of things and trends which have been. in place for a while. Perhaps in not looking at what has happened in the past few days, weeks and months, Mr Nye has overlooked very important decisions that this Government has taken in response to what is admitted as a problem confronting Australia. The Government is far from being complacent about the issue of our international debt or about problems with our current account. Indeed, the Government's whole stance of policy is directed towards correcting those circumstances. Perhaps Mr Nye overlooked the - ajor tightening of fiscal policy at the Premiers Conferenc,e. There was a $2.7 billion tightening as a result of the decisions that were taken in relation to grants to the States and the borrowings of both the State and Commonwealth entities. Perhaps Mr Nye has overlooked the fact that there has been a tightening of monetary policy as recently as in the last few days. We have a situation where fiscal policy is as tight as a drum' and where monetary policy is certainly very tight. Perhaps Mr Nye also' overlooked the fact that a very important decision has now' been taken by the Industrial Relations Commission which gives the go-ahead for the award restructuring process which will hold wages in aggregate to 6.5 per cent. These are important questions which Mr Nye might direct his attention to: important events which have occurred in the last few days, weeks and monthsmatters which he seems less interested in than what he would see as long range issues. The other point to bear in mind is the extent to which this review has been occasioned by the national accounts figures which came out last week. It is very important for all those who are observing those figures to realise that those figures rep()rt on a piece of history which ended two months ago. What the Government has done in the last couple of months and has reaffirmed in the last few days, weeks and months, was de-igned to reduce the growth in demand which those figures in the national accounts reported. Perhaps I can come closer to home and report on what Don Stammer h.!ld to say, . He, J think, is recognised as being a very reputable economics commentator in Australia. Bearing in mind that what Moody's ,is doing is rating our sovereign debt-that IS, the Commonwealth debt, which, when our own debt and that which we guarantee is included is around $12 billion and our reserves a;e nearly twice that at $20 billionone really does wonder what Moody's is talking about when it talks about the capacity of the Commonwealth to repay debt. Of course, the Commonwealth has been repaying debt arid has not borrowed for 2t years. Don Stammer said this morning on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that the anomaly with the Moody's rating arrangement is this: in three or four years' time the Commonwealth Government could have repaid all of its offshore debt, yet Australia could still have a rating that is well below AAA. The most surprising thing is the attitude of the Opposition when there are other international commentators--'-whether one considers Salomon Brothers; Standard and Poor's or Kidder Peabody or, looking closer to home, people such as Don Stammer; Who is it that the Opposition chooses to quote? Who has the voice of opprobrium as far as Australia's performance is concerned? I must say that it is a commentary which, when one reads the comments of the man from New York or his representatives in Australia, is far from convincing. But that does not matter to the Opposition. The Opposition will seize on any unfavourable commentary on Australia. It is not interested in taking up the cudgels for this country. It is just interested in being an opposition which looks at any form of criticism, whatever its source-whether it is local or whether it be from someone in New York who has not even observed, on his own admission, what has been happening here in the last days, weeks and months. None of that matters to the Opposition. So long as it can latch on to some criticism or some unfavourable commentary of Australia, that is all the Opposition is interested in. NA",12
14,Mr OKEEFE,HEALTH FUNDS,"My question is directed to the Minister for Community Services and Health and concerns the question of the targeting of health funds. Is the Minister aware of remarks by the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Wentworth, that health spending should be cut through better targeting of funds? Does he agree with him? Can he inform honourable members of what action the Government has taken to ensure that health spending is targeted to Australians most in need?",14
15,Dr BLEWETT,HEALTH FUNDS,"I am aware of the issues of the targeting of health expenditure which have been raised and which, I believe, will be important matters for debate in this country in the months ahead. It is true that the Opposition's fifth health spokesman has not yet produced its seventh health plan, so we are not really clear about where the targeting will be, but the shadow Treasurer has assured us that health will be high on the list of expenditure cuts. As usual, the shadow Treasurer has not told us where those cuts will take place and who will be targeted, but we can get some idea of this targeting from the Opposition's current tactics in relation to measures that are now before the other place. What is clear from those tactics is that money is to be taken from the elderly and poorer Australians in order to maintain the profits of the new private health profiteers. The very basis of the Government's health policy has been the opposi- of that. Our policy is intended to refuse to allow market forces to dictate in this area-to dictate who gets care-and to make sure that resources are properly targeted to those in need. With its private health insurance proposals, the Government is committed to the community rating principle, which is supported by the overwhelming number of non-profit making private health insurers. These proposals are designed to create a fairer playing field so that particularly the elderly and the aged will obtain better protection againstÂ· exces, sive increases in health insurance. Every major health fund, covering about 90 per cent of all those who are insured, supports the Government's proposals, as do all the major age pensioner groups in the society. Yet the Opposition wants to block these changes, not only preventing the creation of a fairer playing field for all the funds but also depriving the contributors of some $20m of government money put into the reinsurance pool in order to ensure that the transition goes through without difficulty. If the Opposition succeeds, about 85 per cent of insured people will face increases in contribution rates rather than benefiting from reductions in charges that have already been promised by one major fund, that is, the Hospital Benefits Association Ltd in Victoria. As I said, that is completely contrary to the interests of theÂ· elderly and the aged in our society. We are trying to create a fairer playing field to benefit those people in particular across the board. Mr Donald Cameron-What about the $450m that is involved each year?",14
16,Dr BLEWETT,HEALTH FUNDS,"I am quite prepared to tackle the question raised by the honourable member for Moreton. We do not intend to put taxpayers' money continually into the reinsurance pool for the very reason that the honourable member for Wentworth advocates: it would be a most inefficient and untargeted way of providing health benefits. Again, the Opposition is putting at risk $21Om in increased Medicare rebates to patients next year. I must point out clearly to the House that the Opposition's efforts to stop the new general practitioner arrangements threaten not only the extra payments for GPs but also the increase in aU medical rebates across virtually all medical specialities thatÂ· are proposed for 1 August because of the enormous administrative difficulties that would flow from this delay. But not only does the Opposition threaten those changes; clearly, it opposes Australian families receiving up to $136m in extra rebates for general practitioner services. The Opposition seems to be taking this action for no other reason than because the specialist driven Australian Medical Association (AMA) wants it to do so. The Opposition is now supporting the AMA's extraordinary argument. The AMA is telling all doctors to charge the extra rebates, but it is also telling the Opposition to stop the Bill that will enable us to cover those rebates from 1 August. Millions of ordinary Australians will have to pay more for health care, because the Opposition simply wants to play puppet to the AMA. If the Opposition believes that its playing puppet to the AMA is the way to target health expenditure, God help this country. NA",14
17,Mr MCGAURAN,URANIUM MINING,"I direct a question to the Prime Minister. In view of the dramatic need for Australia to improve its export performance, I refer the Prime Minister to his answers last week on uranium policy wherein he cited current oversupply and low spot prices as the reason for retaining the Government's three-mine policy. I now ask the Prime Minister whether he is aware that the world's leading industry consultants have forecast a massive increase in demand for uranium in the 1990s as present stockpiles dwindle. Does he acknowledge that new Australian mines will be prevented from bidding for long term contracts when they are renewed by foreign power utilities in 199293 because of the lead time of two to three years in developing new uranium mines?",15
18,Mr HAWKE,URANIUM MINING,"I have nothing to add to my previous answer other than to say that it is well known that within my Party a committee of the National Conference is examining these issues. I have no doubt that those who want to put this sort of information before that committee will take advantage of their opportunity to/do so, and that is something that will be taken into account in the considerations of that committee. When the time comes for the Government to take account of all that is put before it, that will be one matter it will consider. However, I have nothing further to add to what I said previously. NA",15
19,Mr CAMPBELL,PATENT RIGHTS FOR CHEMICALS,"Is the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy aware that the American chemical company Monsanto Australia Ltd is threatening legal action against an Australian company making a product. called glyphosate, which is generiCally the same as its product Roundup? The case rests on the assertion that Davison Industries has breached the copyright of the label used by Monsanto on its identical product. Does the Minister believe that the action is a de facto extension of the patent rights for chemicals? Would this undermine the system for labelling and control of agricultural chemicals in Australia? Would current legislation prevent Monsanto from pursuing this course of action and, if not, would he be prepared to act to amend the legislation to retain the status quo with respect to the application of patents on chemicals?",15
20,Mr KERIN,PATENT RIGHTS FOR CHEMICALS,"This is a rather complicated matter. I am aware of the action being taken by Monsanto against Davison Industries in which Monsanto claims that the directions for use booklet and the label of Davison's glyphosate herbicide product are in breach of copyright. Glyphosate is a chemical which is now out of patent in Australia and is sold by Davison Industries and other companies as an image orÂ· generic product. Pesticide labels must be approved by government authorities before marketing is permitted. In respect of out of date or image chemicals, as in this. case, it is current practice on the part of pesticide assessment and registration agencies to approve products which are identical in respect of features such as composition, pesticide claims, application rates, directions for use and labelling without the need for duplicate information to be provided. I believe that Monsanto is attempting' to prevent this practice by requiring Davison to amend the design and content of its product label to the extent thilt it may not be acceptable to all government. regulatory authorities. The availability to Davison Industries of scientific data to support label statements also' appears to be at issue. . As the honourable memher infers, this aCtion could be construed as a new attempt to obtain the de facto introduction of proprieta,ry rights to pesticide registration data (PRRD), which seeks to prevent proprietary information' being' used by government authorities to support generic or image products once the patent has expired. My State ministerial colleagues, through the Australian Agricultural Council, have investigated the agro-chemical industry's case for PRRD and have recommended against its introduction. The issue is really one of patent life, which I believe is the appropriate mechanism to recognise and reward the risks and efforts of the chemicals industry in researching and developing new products and bringing them to the marketplace. I acknowledge that a lengthy approval process does'erode effective patent life during which development costs can be recouped. This should be looked at on its own merits. I have also Â·referred the issue of PRRD to the Senate Select Committee on Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals in Australia. I am strongly opposed to the actions initiated by Monsanto. They could lead to an anti-competitive situation, to the detriment of our small indigenous chemicals industry, primary producers and consumers who will pay higher prices for agricultural and veterinary chemicals and food products. ,If the action is successful, I would consider seeking a revision of the relevant provisions of the Copyright Act. NA",15
21,Mr BURR,DOMESTIC AVIATION SERVICES,"My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Does the Government regard the domestic air services as an essential service to the nation? In view of the industrial action planned. by domestic airline pilots to be conducted in July, has the Government prepared contingency plans that will ensure that domestic air services continue to operate regardless of action by pilots or any other group involved in the airline industry? EmptyHere the honourable member refers to some newspaper reports of information that has been circulated to the membership of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots by its executive. To my knowledge, they have not yet put forward a claim. There is a proper procedure for members of that organisation to follow, like all other employees within the Australian industrial relations system in this country. I ask them to bear in mind the responsibility that they have to the travelling public of this country and to adhere to the proper, formal industrial relations procedures that are available to them to put their claim, the same as any other employee or worker in this country.

22,Dr KLUGMAN,ENVIRONMENT,"My question, completely without notice, is to the Minister representing the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. Is he aware of the apocalyptic view of our future, regrettably accepted by significant sections of our population and encouraged by media, non-scientific teachers and populist politicians? Rhetorically, which of the last three scare ,stories-nuclear radiation, the so called hole in the ozone layer and the greenhouse effect-is currently likely to destroy the planet in the foreseeable future? More seriously, 'will he encourage the Government, when providing money for research to reduce these problems, to encourage also rational discussion and provide spokespersons for the media to provide scientific arguments and explanations?",16
23,Mr HOLDING,ENVIRONMENT,"The answer to the, first part of the question of the honourable member is yes; and the answer to the second part is, of course, we will all benefit by rational scientific examination of these very important problems. NA",16
24,Dr HEWSON,CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT,"My question is directed to the Acting Treasurer and I refer him to his answer to the last question he answered. In that regard I draw to his attention the statements made by Senator Walsh on the Face to Face program on 9 October when, in describing the worse case scenario, he said: . . . if the current account deficit continued to run at much higher levels than had been anticipated, sooner or later one would expect that would have an effect on the price of the dolJar. And, if that happened, and depending on how severe it was, the government would respond to that as it has done in the past and that probably would entail doing thing further on the outlay side of the budget. In view of the fact that for the months of October, November, January, February and March we have had the worse current account deficits on record for those months, are we not living through Senator Walsh's worse case scenario?",16
25,Mr DA WKINS,CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT,"When it became clear earlier this year that the estimates of the current account deficit were running ahead of the Budget forecast, the Government decided to act. A number of things can be done to try to contain the acceleration or expansion of the current account deficit, but the most important thing, in the Government's view, was to rein in demand. We realised that demand was running too strongly-more strongly than we had predicted and more strongly than almost every economics commentator in Australia had predicted. When it .became clear that demand was running too strongly, ahead of our forecasts, and having the effect of expanding the current account deficit, the Government decided to act. It took a number of actions, of which I should have thought the honourable member for Wentworth would have been well aware. In the first instance, during the early part of this year we decided to tighten monetary policy. As the honourable member would be well aware, monetary policy was significantly tightened during the early months of this year. But it is not just a matter of relying on tightening monetary policy; we looked very carefully also at fiscal policy and we did a number of things. In theÂ· first instance, in the April statement the Treasurer announced that the forthcoming year would be another year of declining real outlays; that the surplus would be of the same order as it was in this current year; and that the public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR), as he said in April, would be around zero. Since April we have taken further action. As a result of the meeting with the Premiers, the Treasurer said that the PSBR would be further constrained; indeed, there would be a positive on the PSBR, so that the public sector savings would be in the order of one per cent of gross domestic product. There has been a significant tightsome- ening of policy. But, of course, the major policy arm which this Government has to employ, which our opponents do not have to employ, is a wages policy which is well established; which is underpinned by funded tax cuts which will come into effect from July this year; and which will be further underpinned by the decision of the Industrial Relations Commission to endorse the process of award restructuring. As I have said, the impact will be a wages outcome in the course of the next year of around 6.5 per cent. It is probably worth spending a moment to explain what we intend to achieve as a result of this tightening of policy. We want to see, as a result of a tightening of policy and, therefore, a reduction in demand, a very substantial and sudden fall in the level of imports, especially those nearly 90 per cent of imports which are price sensitive. If we look at what has happened over the last few years to the sensitivity of endogenous imports, or imports which are price sensitive to growth in national expenditure, we see that the consequences are great and sudden. Looking back to the period around 1982 we find that, when there was a contraction in demand-in our view a too severe contraction-there was a very sudden and marked reduction in the level of imports. Again, during the period from 1984-85 and into 1986, as a result of curtailing the growth in demand, there was a very marked reduction in the level of imports. That is what we intend to achieve on this occasion. There will be a significant slackening in demand, but not, as the Opposition would want, to force this economy into recession, where we would see ballooning unemployment. We are trying to take the top off demand but, as a result, there will be a much more marked reduction in the level of imports. It might be useful if I were to table a chart which explains very clearly what has happened in recent experience and what we intend to happen in the future. But the important question which has to be addressed, and which the Opposition refuses to address, is that, in dealing with this problem of demand, it is important to look at the components of that demand. The national accounts statement that came out last week reported very clearly that we are not dealing with a consumption binge; we are dealing with a situation where there is very strong investment-the kind of investment that we need in order to turn around or rebalance the economy in the way in which we have proposed. The fundaJl!.ental weakness which was revealed in the national accounts was that we were growing too fast and our own domestic capacity was insufficient to meet that growth in demand. The investment phase is ensuring that, in the . future, the Australian economy will be better able to deal with these kinds of matters than it was before. The Opposition wants to have a restructuring process forced upon the economy via a recession. We will not get sensible restructuring of the economy in that way. We will have sensible restructuring of the economy if we have the kinds of changes which we are encouraging. We have the right policy settings to address those problems and we will stick with them.

27,Madam SPEAKER,RAIL SERVICES,Thank you.,18
28,Mr ONEIL,RAIL SERVICES,"My question is directed to the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support. I preface my remarks by stating the obvious: railway freight operations provide obvious national benefits in linking our great centres of population and economic activity. In view of the frequently heard complaints by users, what is the Government doing about improving the quality of inter-system rail freight services?",18
29,Mr ROBERT BROWN,RAIL SERVICES,"I understand the extreme importance of the whole question of rail freight and rail systems and services generally. The honourable member for Grey has within his electorate Port Augusta, which is one of the great rail centres of Australia. It also happens to be one of those centres which provide an interface as far as the inter-system generally in Australia is concerned. I realise that there .have been some indications of concern on the part of railway facility users and various interests in Australia about the quality of some of the services and some of the developments that have taken place. Those concerns relate essentially to the changes that have taken place in the development of the inter-system arrangements for railway services. They are largely at centres such as Kalgoorlie, where the Australian National line plugs into Westrail, and Broken Hill where the same system plugs into the New South Wales State Rail Authority arrangement. A couple of years ago, in about 1986, the present Government, together with the Australian Council of Trade Unions, undertook an initiative to establish what is known as the Rail Industry Council to bring together all the government, authority, union and industry interests and consider the type of medium and longer term rail planning that needed to be undertaken. I have been particularly pleased with the amount of enthusiasm and commitment that all of those people have brought to it. It has not been without its problems. I am expecting a report to be brought down towards the end of this year by the Rail Industry Council when it completes that charge with which it was provided when we established it in the first place. I hope that, as a result of that, it will be possible for State rail authorities, together with us, to identify the types of develop- . men'ts and improvements that can be undertaken, and that we will be able to Â·undertake them. The types of concerns that the honourable member has brought to my attention, particularly the questions of staffing, the labour force and the retention and development of Australian National services in Port Augusta, we will be able to look at more closely. I am sure that the types of expectations that the honourable member has in connection with the development of those services will be realised. NA NA",18
30,Madam SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On Thursday, 13 April the honourable member for Tangney ( Mr Shack) made a number of comments about standing order 145 and asked me to consider its status. Standing order, 145 provides that an answer shall be relevant to the question. I remind the House that the matter of relevance of answers has been raised repeatedly in recent years. I have made a number of statements on the matter, and so have various preceding Speakers. I draw the attention of the House to two of those statements, made on 22 October 1986 and 28 September 1988. The Chair has no power to require a Minister to end an answer, - or to require a Minister to answer in a particular way. However, on occasions when I have been convinced that a Minister's answer was clearly out of order, I have required the Minister to conclude the answer. Examples can be found in the House of Representatives Hansard of 24 May 1988 at page 2863 and 25 August 1988 at page 3824. As all previous Speakers have found, reladvised evance is generally a matter of opinion judgment at the time. Selective quoting of past rulings does not diminish this, and I continue to exercise my judgment as the need arises. The honourable member quoted a ruling of Speaker Snedden to the effect that a Minister should not engage in irrelethe vancies such as contrasting the government and the opposition. It will come as no prise to honourable members to learn that there are many precedents to the contrary. In other words, previous Speakers have perthe mitted Ministers - in their answers ment on government and opposition policies. In response to a point of order raised on 10 September 1981, Speaker Snedden ruled as follows:, The honourable member for Newcastle must underwhen stand that the Standing Orders make provisions about, whether a question is in order. For the question be in order it must be a question that relates matters for which the Minister in this House responsible. The question was put. but the restriction does not under the Standing Orders to the answer. The requirement is that the answer be relevant. It is relevant to contrast the action the Government with another point of view. That what the Minister is doing. He is contrasting, action with a different point of view. Therefore relevant and therefore it is in order. I remind the House that the Procedure Comwithin mittee in its 1986 report on Question Time recommended, inter alia, that standing order 145 be, amended. I suggest that, if honourfore able members are still concerned about - the problems in this area, they take steps to bring the Procedure Committee report on for consideration. This would also enable all aspects of Question Time to, be considered and the House could make decisions for the future. I would welcome the opportunity to apply any new ground rules or provisions the House might see fit to set. As I said before, the remedy is in your own hands. NA",18
31,Madam SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"On Thursday, 25 May the honourable member for Corio ( Mr Scholes) raised the broadcasting of proceedings from committee rooms and the need to ensure the confidentiality of private or in camera meetings of committees as a matter of privilege. The issue is one of administration and not for privilege as such. I am that the design brief for speech reand inforcement and Houst( broadcasting from committee rooms specified an isolate facility will which, when operated, would prevent the, transmission of the sound from the committee room but permit the continued operation of the speech reinforcement system within committee box. This facility is installed and commissioned and can be activated only surfrom the control booths in each committee room. No provision was made, however, for a sign which would indicate to the users of room when proceedings are being transto committed from the room. After discussions with the Serjeant-atArms, a system was developed and installed on a trial basis in three committee rooms which visibly indicates by an 'On air' sign the proceedings are being broadcast on to the House monitoring system. Committee to secretaries were advised of the rooms with is this facility and it was recommended that same particularly sensitive meetings be held in apply those rooms. Progressive installation of this of feature will be undertaken in remaining comis mittee rooms during the winter adjournment. his It is possible to turn off all microphones in it is any of the committee rooms, but this would also result in the loss of sound reinforcement the room. I suggest that the effectiveness of the 'On air' signs being installed in the committee rooms should be assessed beany further action is contemplated. NA",19

The Committee met. on 25 May and agreed to recommend specific guidelines to apply to the use of file footage of parliamentary proceedings by television stations. I table the guidelines and I suggest that it might suit the convenience of members if they were incorporated in Hansard. The guidelines read as followsGuidelines to Apply to Recording of Vision Footage for File Purposes, and Subsequent Broadcasting by Television Stations I. Recording must take place only with the express approval of the respective Presiding Officer and following an announcement in the respective Chamber. 2. Footage must be recorded only from Channels I and 2 (House of Representatives and the Senate) from the Parliamentary Audio Vision Unit. 3. Recording must take placeÂ· only during questions and answers. Any other proceedings including points of order .are not available for broadcast. 4. Footage must not be altered so as to destroy continuity. 5. Footage must be broadcast at normal speed without use of freeze frame. A separate still frame may be used. 6.

47,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"In the House on Thursday night, the honourable member for Hinkler ( Mr Courtice), in the course of a debate on the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No.3) 1989, made six personal reflections against me. Firstly, he said that I was a backwoods regulator and partly quoted from a press release. The quotation he made did not include that part of the press release where I said that the industry was being deregulated by the Australian Labor Government but that the Labor Government was not turning its attention to the deregulation of the l-bour market or the proper freeing up of the exchange rate and the interest rate. Secondly, there was a suggestion that I was told what to do by Sir Robert Sparkes. That is not true; The comments I made were as a result of the people actively involved the industry. His third comment was that I would be responsible for the deterioration of of Mr Hunt. the living standards of all the miners in my electorate and that members of the Opposition would seek to deregulate the labour market with their policy. The honourable member for Hinkler misunderstood the fact that deregulation in that sense has more to do with productivity than the loss of living standards. His fourth comment, which is similar to his second comment, is that I was being told what to do by Premier Mike Ahern and also Neville Harper. That is not the case. Fifthly, he said that there was a complete lack of response to my submission to the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology inquiry. In actual fact, the Senate inquiry found mainly in favour of the submission that I had made. His last comment is a little indefinite. On page 3034 there is a veiled suggestion that I had bought my way into this place with a payment of $250,000. I wish to deny that quite categorically.

50,Dr HEWSON ,ECONOMY,"Wentworth) (2.58)-The matter of public importance before us today-namely, the mismanagement of the Hawke Government which has called into qUe&,tion. Australia's interna-ional credit standing and thereby threatening even higher interest rates-is a very important issue. I think t""'e House should focus for a moment on how signiijcant it is when an issue of that order,of magnitude is raised by a reputable body such as Moody's Investor Services Inc. It goes to the very heart of the economic sovereignty of this cQuntry, yet members of the Government have no idea that this is an important issue. In fact, .the Acting Treasurer, the Miriister for Employment, Education and Training ( Mr Dawkins), at Question Time today set out with a series of prepared quotes and so on to downplay. the significance and to attack the credibility of Moody's, following his remarks yesterday which directly sought to impug- its professionalism, and to build on earlier attacks by the Treasurer ( Mr Keating), who has referred to Moody's, I gather, in terms of 'monkeys who make incompetent judgments'. It is the fate of anybody who dares to disagree with or criticise' this Government that he is thrown out the door and treated in a quite disparaging fashion in relation to the comments he made. His only fault in most cases is simply to raise a question about what is happening, to disagree or to criticise. This Treasurer has gone out of his way to quote in his support people such as Kidder Peabody and Salomon Brothers. What else would one expect organisations such as that to say? Their job is marketing Australian debt interriationally. They are hardly objective when it comes to an assessment of our international credit standing or to the arguments raised by an agency whose particular job it is to assess that credit standing. Equally, today the Acting Treasurer ( Mr Dawkins) made the statement during a doorstop interview that everyone should get hold of himself. He says that it would be a good idea if everyone just settled down, took a deep breath and realised that the Government had the appropriate settings for dealing with Australia's current problem-. The point of the matter of public importance is that Moody's Investor Services Inc. in particular does not agree with that. Many honourable members opposite do not agree with that, and if one went around the financial community and took a less selective list of quotes, both here and overseas, one would find that there are many others who certainly do not agree with that. It is no response just to heap' criticism on the credit rating agency. It is up to the Acting Treasurer to answer these criticisms, and the onus of proof is clearly on him to do that. He might sit there and giggle or he might laugh, as he apparently did yesterday, but I can assure him that in due course the laugh will be on the other side of his face when the emerging magnitude of our economic problems is fully recognised in this country. The Treasurer is, of course, overseas. He prefers to duck debate rather than meet it squarely in this House. For two of the last four weeks of this parliamentary session we have had the atrocious situation of the Treasurer being overseas. This has involved two separate trips and there is a substantial amount of evidence to substantiate the view that this most recent trip iri particular is little more than a 'holiday and has little to do with any genuine contribution that he intends to make or should be making to international fora. The Treasurer is simply ducking debate at a time convenient to him. That is his form, of course-he has a glass jaw rather than the capacity to meet these criticisms head on. Today I want to look briefly at what Moody's has said and to go through some of the Government's responses. By way of history, Australia lost its AAA credit rating in September 1986, when Moody's downgraded us to AA 1. A few months later, in December 1986, the other rating agency to which the Acting Treasurer referred, Standard and Poor's, also downgraded Australia. It is essential t6 recall some of the reasons that Moody's and Standard and Poor's offered at the time for those downgradings. Moody's specifically' cited, for example, the rapid build-up in Australia's foreign debt, an inflation rate that was running at twice the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development average, and industrialÂ· and labour market rigidities. Standard and Poor's cited similar factors and warned that, because of our huge foreign debt, Australia: . . . is much more subject to shocks, to nal pressure . . . there are some fundamental problems and the solutions will take some time to be reRected. Clearly, at that time the agency was simply echoing what the Treasurer himself had said in May 1986, when he made his famous banana republic statement: If this Government cannot get the adjustment . . . and a sensible economic policy then Australia is basically done for. We will just being a third rate economy . . . a banana republic. The first point to recognise in Moody's current assessment of the Australian economy and its prospects, as evidenced in the document it released in New York last week, is that effectively it .is referring to three lost years,Â·three years of lost opportunity in this country since 1986 when that statement was made by the Treasurer. There has been little or no policy adjustment since that time, despite the brave face that the Acting Treasurer sought to put on the issue today. The Government has had every opportunity to make these sorts of adjustments, but it has not don- so. During that period it has had a couple of political mandates; It has had a very strong commodity price boom; it has had a substantial improvement in Australia's terms of trade; and it has had a continuing strongly growing world economy. It has had end1ess opportunities to make the policy adjustments, but the Government has not chosen to address those issues at all. Rather, it has compounded the problem by playing politics with monetary policy in 1987 and 1988. It has simply stalled in any semblance of micro-reform. It has bowed to pressure from the left wing of the parliamentary Party and from the Australian Council of Trade Unions, which has stopped the Government from taking any of the necessary policy decisions that would have Moody's right now not calling into question the possible downgrading of Australia's credit rating. As we know, Australia's balance of payments has deteriorated further. Inflation is now accelerating again. Our debt is blowing out and is indeed set to explode, given the recent weakness in the exchange rate, which has plummeted and remains particularly volatile, as we have seen in the market today; Financial markets are at a loss to know exter- where the Government is going, apart from anything else. There is a very real risk inherent in this Government's policy response of relying solely on interest rates that higher and higher interest rates will ultimately drive this economy through the floor. High interest rates are a blunt instrument. A recession is a very real risk as the Government has now locked itself solely into that instrument. I refer to a press report of last Friday of what end up Moody's said, and it is important to recognise the significance of the point: Moody's said that due to its concern about the pace at which internal economic decisions are proceeding in the light of past opportunitieS and anticipated external trends, it is foreshadowing a review. It said a closely related concern is the high and growing level of foreign currency debt which makes the currency volatile to international interest rate and exchange rate movements and the servicing which constrains poli-y. In effect, Moody's emphasise those three years of lost opportunities. It also points to the dangers of a deteriorating world situation with the uncertain outlook for commodity prices, the fact that the pace of our restructuring of domestic industry has stalled and failed to develop a more internationally competitive posture, the rigidities in our labour market and certain political factors that constrain fiscal, monetary and wages policy. Against that background, Moody's simply says that a rerating is required. The onus of proof is clearly on the Government to come clean and answer a number of specific questions. Before posing those questions, let us briefly look at the povern-ment's strategy over the last few years in relation to just one aspect of this problemthe balance of payments. We have had a series of separate explanations, justifications or models upon which the Government has pinned its hopes. There has never been an effective, integrated economic strategy at any time over the last three years, just a series of arguments none of which in the end have been seen to hold water. For ex:ample, there was the J-curve argument-do honourable members remember that one?-that the deterioration in our trade balance would be temporary and would be followed by a sustained improvement as the effects of devaluation flowed through to new exports and to import-competing industries. Whatever happened to the J-curve? It bottomed out all right, but it now looks pretty much like a used J strap. It never continued its upward course. It just dawdled along. So that model was discarded. We have not heard about the J-curve for 18 months. Secondly, there was the twin deficits explanation. Do honourable members remember that one? That was the nice, close, oneto-one relationship between the public sector borrowing requirement and the current account deficit where, if the public sector borrowing requirement is brought down, the current account deficit will also come down. What happened? The public sector borrowing requirement has been brought down but the deficit has gone up. The reason the deficit has gone up is that the Government forgot some other parts of that simple little model. When monetary policy was stimulated, the private sector was also stimulated. That sustained the current account deficit to which the Government is now. addressing its concerns. The twin deficits model was discarded as well. The third explanation that was given last year was the so-called seasonality of exports. The Treasurer said, 'Don't worry. Everything will be fine. Exports will turn around. The latter part of 1988 and early 1989 will bring a strong seasonal push in exports'. Two things were wrong with that argumen,t: firstly, imports were a lot stronger than the Government anticipated; secondly, there was no seasonality in exports. In the circumstances that the Government has created with its taxation treatment of income and the prospect of a falling exchange rate, I guess that a lot of the exporters are stockpiling now until the latter part of the year to take advantage of some other inadequacies in the Government's policy. Not surprisingly, the seasonality argument has been dropped as well. Finally, there has been the classic investment boom argument: 'Don't worry about it. All the import goods are investment goods which will create additional export capacity and import replacement capacity'. The Treasurer said, on 20. February: The investment which is presently being put in place will pump out sufficient export and import competing output to restore the trend improvement in the current account. He is a bit confused. While he says that about investment from the point of view of the balance of payments, today the Acting Treasurer echoed the statement that has been made a number of times by the Treasurer that the aim of monetary policy is to slow demand and, in particular, as he said today, to slow investment demand. Which way is it? Is the Treasurer encouraging investment or, is he pulling it back? Are we to get the export capacity and import replacement capacity or not? I feel the discarding of another model coming on. Of course, these have all been diversionary tactics to get away from the basic problem that the Government has no basic policy response. Let me set some questions to be answered in relation' to this Government's policy response, the sorts of questions that Moody's will be putting to the Government in the course of its review in the next few months. Concerning fiscal policy, the Government claims to have cut expenditure to the bone, yet Senator Walsh said some time ago: I can think of 200 programs that are not justified on social justice or equity grounds, but will not be abandoned because the Government does not have the political courage to do so. Where does the' Government stand? Secondly, the Government claims to have a substantial turnaround in its fiscal po-ition. How much of it is structural and how much is ephemeral? How much ofit will disappear when the economy moves into recession and unemployment begins to rise? The Government claims to be concerned about savings, well why is it not doing anything about them? That is the third question. Why is the Government not doing something about savings? Why does it rule out measures to encourage private sector savings? Why does it run down public sector savings? Fourthly, why does the Government persist with a tax system which encourages debt when our fundamental problem, and the basis of the Moody's reassessment, is the level of oudnternational debt? How is it that the Government is going to get incentive back into the Australian electorate-the Australia working population-when it leaves the average income earner paying nearly 40c in the dollar in tax? Where is the Government getting its incentive from? On wages, for example, how is the increasingly centralised wage fixation system going to deliver improvements in productivity? What are the Government's policies to improve productivity? Can it explain how the union movement and the left of the Australian Labor Party will not continue to prevent the Government from taking the micro reform decisions it has prevented the Government from taking over the last six years? On monetary policy, how high must interest rates go before they will ultimately slow demand? How will the Government know when it is just enough and not too much? How will it guarantee that demand will fall, and imports will fall sharply, as was said today, modate this Government's expansionary policies down the track? Equally, how will it avoid throwing the economy into a recession as a result of those high interest rate policies? Finally, in the area of micro reform, the onus is on the Government. There are substantial benefits to be had, as the Industries Assistance Commission has estimated in terms of coastal shipping, and as the Business Council of Australia has estimated in terms of the waterfront, but the Government has to demonstrate how it is going to make some of those decisions, when it has a union movement and the left wing of its Par.ty which is not the slightest bit interested in helping Government to make any of them. The Opposition's position in all of these areas is very clear. Firstly, we will have a tighter fiscal policy based on cuts in government expenditure and a larger fiscal surplus. Secondly, we will tie wages directly to productivity under our industrial relations and wage fixation policy. Finally, we have an exhaustive process of micro reform in coastal shipping, the waterfront, domestic transportation, privatisation, deregulation of the labour market and measures to stimulate productivity and efficiency. We already have detailed policies in those areas, and the Government has nothing. The bottom line is that the Government is devoid of solutions and relies entirely on monetary policy-a high interest rate policy. It has this simpleton economic strategy: Something goes wrong, up go interest rates. Something else goes wrong, up they go again. Ultimately, those interest rates will bite, I can assure this Government, and the economy will dive into a recession.",22
51,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,ECONOMY,Mr Leo MCLeay)-Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,25
52,Mr DAWKINS ,ECONOMY,"Fremantle-Minister for Employment, Education and Training and Acting Treasurer) (3.13)-The amazing thing about the speech we have just heard is that it decided to focus for the whole of its justification on the remarks of one person from one credit rating agency in New York; a person who, by his own admission, has not been observing what has been occurring in Australia over the last days, weeks and to accommonths. The honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) quite deliberately, I suppose, decided not to refer to the remarks of the other credit rating agency-a larger credit rating agency-which, as recently as last Friday, reaffirmed the current . rating for Australia and said that ""it had no new concerns about Australia's economic outlook. There we are. We have two clear choices: two credit rating agencies. One says it wants to have another look at the situation, notwithstanding the fact that its representatives were only here in February and have not been observing the economy very closely in the days, weeks and months since then; and the another credit rating agency, a larger one of at least equal repute, which says that it has no concerns about the Australian economy. Which one does the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Wentworth, decide to latch on to? Of course, he decides to pick on the critical one. The times may not have suited the honourable member for Bennelong ( Mr Howard), but, my goodness, the honourable member for Wentworth hopes just as passionately that the times will suit him. What the Opposition wants to do is latch on to any piece of data or adverse commentary which might unsettle the international community, as far as Australia's performance is concerned, and unsettle the domestic situation as well. But the other point, of course, is that the gentleman from Standard and Poor's went on to say that the economic strains referred to by Moody's were not new and that the Australian Government was putting in place policies to deal with them. If the honourable member did not like my references to Kidder Peabody or Salomon Brothers Inc., he might at least have taken some notice of that and seen that another independent credit body was saying that the Government was taking action to deal with these problems in the economy, which we acknowledge exist. We have never tried to hide the fact that these problems are there and must be dealt with. But I suppose the most telling thing in the remarks made by the honourable member for Wentworth was his statement-and he misquoted Moody's-that Moody's had decided that a rerating was. required. The honourable member might wish that Moody's had come to that conclusion but, ever since Moody's made its announcement a couple of days ago, it has been moving away at 100 miles an hour from any inevitable conclusion that there will be a rerating and a downgrading of Australia's rating. The honourable member referred to microreform and the question of debt, but in the process he asked me some sorts of first year economic questions about what the Government is doing. Let me very quickly discharge those eight questions that he asked. First, we say that spending has been cut to the bone and yet, the honourable member stated, Senator Walsh said that there are a number of other programs. Of course, Senator Walsh made that remark and referred to those programs years ago, long before the Government finished the major process of reducing expenditure. And, indeed, on many subsequent occasions Senator Walsh has said that many of the. programs on his original list have been dealt with and that the savings he believed could be achieved have already been taken. If the honourable member wants to quote my good friend Senator Walsh, he might at least use a contemporary quote and some not prehistoric one. I wonder why the honourable member for Wentworth did not quote the most recent of Senator Walsh's. remarks which were directed quite clearly and centrally at him. The second question involved the claim of a fiscal turnaround. No other country has been able to sustain the kind of share of gross domestic product (GDP) taken by the Government and to reduce it as we have done. We have actually taken off between five and six points of GDP from both outlays and the public sector borrowing requirement. We have made that quite clear and structural change which has not been equalled by any other Western democracy. Thirdly, the honourable member asks what we are doing to encourage savings. Of course, the most important thing we are doing to encourage savings is to make a bigger contribution to public savings, that is, we have turned around a big public sector borrowing demand into a modest public sector saving. The public sector borrowing requirement, whichÂ· was hugely in defiCit when we came to office, will be modestly in surplus next year. That is what we have achieved on the public savings side. Again, on the private side, we have made a drastic reform to corporate taxation in terms of dividend imputation, and that, of course, is a direct encouragement for companies to invest. Indeed, that investment is occurring. I hope that the honourable member does not require me to point out to him the massive increase in investment that has been achieved in the private sector, as was revealed in the national accounts that came out just last week. The total private investment increase over the 12 months to March was a massive 18 per cent, or 25 per cent if we are looking at the all important area of re-equipping Australian industry. So, of course, the investment is taking place, and that is being supported by taxation reforms which have encouraged investment within the company structure. In relation to saving, expressed as a proportion of household expenditure, we are not amongst the low saving countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. We are about in the middle of OECD countries. Indeed, our saving ratio is not going down; it is going up on the basis of recent measures. The honourable member went on to talk about the taxation system favouring debt. I referred to that a moment ago in relation to dividend imputation and I will return to the matter in a moment. The honourable member then mentioned wages and productivity and asked how a centralised system can bring about that kind of link. Our centralised system has built into our wages system the capacity for a great degree of flexibility which was not anticipated or contemplated several years ago. Over the next couple of years, by adopting the principle of structural efficiency, we see at the workshop level-in factories,plants and offices all around the country-a massive concentration on how work can be done better, more efficiently and more productively. But the honqurable member carried on with the facile nonsense that when productivity is at about one per cent, as at the moment, it can be linked to wages. He totally ignores that productivity in the aggregate is greatly influenced by. the fact that there has been a huge surge,in employment in the hospitality and tourism industries, dustries which will always have low productivity because they are highly concentrated on providing human services to people. What is going to happen under the structural efficiency principle and the award restructuring is that there is going to be an emphasis on paying people for what they do and how well they do it rather than on what they are described as. We will see a major revolution in wages policy and wages outcome as a result of this new approach. The honourable member asks whether monetary policy is now too high. He asks how much higher it has to go. The honourable member cannot really have it both. ways on monetaryÂ· policy; On the one hand he seems to be arguing forÂ·a reduction in interest rates; on the other hand he seems to be arguing for a curtailment of demand. What the Government has done, quite carefully and systematically, is to increase monetary policy to the point thought necessary to curtail demand in order to stem or cut off the demand for imports which we quite 'clearly predict will happen as demand comes off. The honourable member asks how we can avoid recession. Well he might ask. In 198283 the coalition Government was unable to avoid recession. It put the economy into reverse. But it was not interest rates policy which had the major effect then, as will be the major capping off of demand on this occasion; the major problem with our opponents back then was that they had no wages policy. We had a wages explosion, and it was the wages explosion which caused the recession. What we are saying is that, because we have got a wages policy, we are able to be far more sensitive and systematic in the way in which we reduce demand without causing a recession, a .recession which the honourable will member dearly wants and is pursuing. I suspect that is what Moody's wants as well. The honourable member then went on to talk about coastal shipping and the waterfront. I need not mention anything more on that except to say that asÂ· recently as today the Cabinet has been refining and finalising our approach to that illsue. The Minister for Transport and Communications ( Mr Willis) will be making a statement on that soon. I must say that it ill becomes those from the Liberal Party of Australia to criticise us in in- relation to coastal shipping .and the waterfront. They were the ones .who deregulated the waterfront in a way that allowed the unions and employers to get together and put in rpany of the ramps and rorts we know ate there and which we are now seeking to get out. Tile coalition Government's failed deregulation put the two sides of the employment equation into cahoots and allowed enormous inefficiencies to grow' up over recent years. 'I want to refer briefly to the question of micro-economic reform. A lot of nonsense has been spoken about the lack of activity of the Government in that area. The fact of the matter is-and this is the thing which the Opposition simply cannot understandthat we have been able to achieve very significantreform in the micro-economy as a result of being able to secure agreements. We have not had to go into a period of massive confrontation with the unions or with anyone else; we have been able to secure change by agreement. Let me just give the example of genuine tariff reform 'which was secured, essentially by agreement, and announced just over a year ago. There have been massive reductions in the levels of tariff protection for the most highly protected industries outside of the plan industries. We have seen that all industries will have their tariffs set at between 10 and 15 per cent by 1992. As well, the revenue duty of 2 per cent was abolished at a cost of $240m. Australia had been waiting for that kind of change for years and years. We were able to secure that change, and I think that in itself will be the most enduring monument to this Government. We were able to bring down the embarrassingly high levels of tariff protection which had persisted for years. We were able to make that change in a quite short time frame; unfortunately for the Opposition, without the chaos which would attend any attempt by it to do the same. Look at the aviation reform: the end of the two-airline agreement, the liberalisation of international passenger charter policy and the liberalisation of air freight policy. The honourable member had the cheek to talk about the absence of tax reform when we have reduced personal rates from over 60 per cent to some 40 per cent. He talked about our failure to act on the company level, yet those opposite were into double taxation at very high rates. We have not only eliminated double taxation through dividend imputation but also lowered the company rate. Look at the changes in oil and gas marketing. In the area of communications, there has been a major deregulation in the telecommunications industry. I have already mentioned award, restructuring. The list is long and will be extended by decisiQns we will take. The lastÂ· point I want to m-ke relates to foreign debt. A lot of nonsense has been spoken about our exposure in relation to foreign debt. This has arisen because Moody's says that it wants to look at us as a sovereign borrower, even though we have not borrowed for 2t years and are paying back the debt. It is a curious time in which to judge our capacity to repay debt when we are doing it ahead of time and are not borrowing in our own right. Another very important point which is overlooked is the extent to which the private sector has been able to amass very considerable assets overseas. The holding of assets overseas by Australian companies now stands at around $40 billion, compared with a gross private debt overseas of some $63 billion. The $63 billion must be adjusted to some extent, if not in total, by the $40 billion of assets held by Australian private borrowers overseas. As I said earlier, the public sector gross borrowings, and those which we guarantee, stand at around $12.5 billion, compared with our reserves of some $20 billion. Where is the crisis? We are concerned-we are not complacent-about the growing debt, but it is important to keep that in context and it is particularly important for the Opposition not to start scaremongering and selling Australia short. It is about time the Opposition joined us inÂ· backing Australia to win. . Mr LLOYD (Murray) (3.28)-Today's debate highlights one of the inevitable implications for Australia of the Government's continuing economic mismanagement; that is, even higher interest rates. The reply by the Acting Treasurer ( Mr Dawkins) indicates once again that this Government is not addressing the real issues. We have so far in the debate on these record interest rates, as has the media generally, concentrated on housing interest rates-at a level of 17 per cent, which may even go up to 18 per cent. That concern is natural, becauseÂ· home ownership is one of the bases of our society. It highlights the dramatic increas- in interest rates due to the Government's mismanagement, but it tells of only part of the damage that record interest rates are causing. ,Higher interest rates on government borrowings will be a direct result of any change in credit ratings. That will have implications for the standard of living of all Australians. The impact will be even greater on other sectors of the economy. We have not really yet heard about, or had properly exposed in the media, the impact on economic industries. It is the interest rates paid by businesses, large and small, and the impact of these interest rates on the investment necessary to improve our trade balance which, after all, is the core of our problem. As Senator Walsh said as recently as last week, the biggest problem that this country faces is the increasing net foreign debt that that trade deficit creates month after month. So it is not surprising that, with all this happening, our credit position is again at risk. Let us look at the interest rates that those businesses that are so important for our future are now paying. They are now paying 20 to 23 per cent. Interest rates have never been higher. Generally, the smaller the business the higher the interest rate. Generally, the greater the risk-there is some risk where somebody is starting out on a new venture, such as a new export industryÂ· or import competing industry, or somebody is in a difficult farming position-the higher the interest rate. That risk would put interest rates above even 23 per cent. On top of these already record interest' rates there is speculation about out credit rating, and that must 6nly push interest rates higher. What a dramatic impact that is having on investment, on our major export industries, on our agricultural, - mining aridÂ· import competing industries, on our manufacturing industries and our new export industries, and on tourism and other forms of diversification. I just want to use agricll:1ture as one example but the other sectors: pf our, economy are equally important. Everyone per cent increase in interest rates adds $120m to the rural debt of this country. That means that $120m is not available for improved productivity, for diversification and for the investment that is necessary to retain .our market share, let alone improve it. More specifically; let tis look at some wheat farmers. Because of droughts in other countries, for the next two years world stocks will be at their lowest. Therefore, there will be good opportunities for Australia to increase production and exports, to reduce our trade deficit and to. put, an end to: any speculation on our credit ratings. No""one. IÂ· have. spoken to in the wheat industry will invest in new equipment and there has been no investment in significant sectors ofÂ· that industry for over seven years. So the opportunity to maximise a section of this industry to improve ourÂ· trade performance will be, lost. Who can blame these wheat farmers? Interest represents a significant cost. It is the single most significant factor which will determine whether new investment will take place. In 1985-86, which' is still very much in the minds of the rural community, average farm incomes were one-third of average weekly earnings and interest rates were almost as high as they are today. A 5 per cent reduction in interest rates would .. have' doubled farm income. So that is the significance ofÂ· interest rates on investment decisions. Fortunately for this Government, since then commodity prices increased, in some cases they peaked, and now they have fallen. In sections of the wool industry prices have fallen by up to 30 per cent. But'in that time, when we had better commodity prices, no action was taken to correct, weaknesses' in our. economy, as highlighted by those international credit agencies who ,reduced our credit rating in 1986. Instead of reducing our trade deficit it is increasing month by month. In turn, this is increasing the self-defeating nature. of this Government's economic policy. The central aspect of this Government's failu.r:e to improv.e our position is that it. is not realistic about our. international position for the sake of all Australiansi Apart from micro-economic reform and expenditure control, we need to encourage savings .. For example, in the'agricultural area, by not allowing for income equalisation deposits in this financial year' when we have had some of those good prices, there has been no encouragement .to save and to invest. Rather, 'we; have short term consumption expenditure. Short .term consumption expenditure and pressure on imports, Â·in turn, adds to the volatility of our trade balance. It affects the level of our trade balance, therefore interest rates,and therefore our credit ratings. tet us look at our agricllitural trade position in the near future. Wool, which is this country's No.1 export earner, is facing a $1 billion to' $lt billion reduction in exports next year. What impact will that have on further trade uncertainty and interest rate pressure? Our, level of interest rates is the highest in the world. What are our competitors haVing to. pay overseas? That is vital for any investn1ent' decision in export or import competition. Our interest rates are double the level of that of our competitors. Even New Zealand now has lower interest rates than we do. That, in turn, means a disincentive to invest. in this exposed sector of our economY' When honourable members opposite point to the level of interest rates in the early 1980s under the coalition Government they conv-niently forget that the comparable innetÂ· terest rates in those countries which compete with us were on the same level as burs. Our interest rate level is now twice the level of those countries. This all adds up to the Government's economic policy not only being self-defeating but also undergoing a downward vicious cycle. The weekend news services and today's news services have speculated on our credit rating. On Wednesday we will have the trade deficit and the fact that our net foreign debt for the quarter will be back to over $100 billion. As Senator Walsh has already said, that it our greatest economic problem. That will bring with it further pressure to downgrade oilr credit rating and reduce us to a banana republic. If the Government is to reduce this d-bt and interest rates and improve our trade deficit this vicious cycle has to be terminated. Industries must be encouraged to invest. But they cannot and will not invest with interest rates as high as they are or even higher. So the vicious cycle will go on, particularly once that inevitable downturn in commodities comes, as it must, within the next few years-and with it more credit uncertainty. All of that is obvious to everybody. It is certainly obvious to Moody's. Once those sorts of organisations question that, it must make us more and more moody in relation to our ultimate economic future. Mr MCGauran-Depressed, you mean.",25
53,Mr LLOYD,ECONOMY,"Depressed, if you like. Even if it was a Poor's joke it was standard. The Government's economic mismanagement continues. There is no micro-economic reform; there are no incentives to save; and there are no incentives to invest. This Government must stand condemned for making Australia more uneconomic internationally and domestically; for making it more difficult for home buyers and businesses large and small; and for making more inevitable a further decline in the living stan.dards of all Australians.",30
54,Dr THEOPHANOUS ,ECONOMY,"Calwell) (3.38)Today and in the last 48 hours the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) has disgraced himself by attacking Australia's currency and by setting a run on the Australian dollar. He has stated that we are facing a financial crisis. The argument that he has put forward is based simply on the statement by Moody's Investor Services Inc. that it is looking into Australia's credit rating. On that basis, he has jumpedÂ· on it and, instead of defending this country and our currency, he has actually added to the speculation. He has added fuel to the fire. In my time in this Parliament I do not ever remember a senior politician actually encouraging a run on the Australian dollar in the way in which the honourable member for Wentworth, the shadow Treasurer, has done. He ought to be ashamed of himself. He then comes in here and pretends to put forward a number of solutions to problems. However, his analysis of the problems is exactly the same as the analysis - nd the ideas that we have been hearing from the conservatives for the last 6t years. He then has the impertinence to say that this Government is devoid of solutions. Rubbish! If anyone were devoid of ideas or solutions it would be the Opposition and, in particular, members of the New Right of whom the shadow Treasurer is one. We know that he identifies with them. We know what they stand for. Let me illustrate what they stand for. Yesterday, the honourable member stated very clearly what they stand for. He was asked where he would make fiscal cuts. He said that $26 billion a year is spent on social security and on welfare. He went on to say: I""mean. how many genuine needy people are there. Mr O'Neil-He would have no idea.",30
55,Dr THEOPHANOUS,ECONOMY,"Of course, he would have no idea, as the honourable members says. Where would he make those cuts in social security and welfare spending? For example, does he want to abolish the family allowance that is paid to nearly two million families with over 3.8 million children? Is that what he wants? Does he want to abolish the family allowance supplement that is paid to over 165,000 low income working families? Is that what he wants? Does he want to deny indexation of pensions to 1.7 million age and service pensioners? Is that what he wants? Of course, he was not prepared to answer those queries either to the media or here in the House. There is a very important reason forÂ· that. He would not know when people are needy or not. Look at the background from which he comes and at the lifestyle that he leads. Yet he has the impertinence to come in here and say that we have to cut social security and welfare spending even further. That will be the solution of the conservatives to the current economic crisis. What nonsense! That would create massive poverty in this country. It would create circumstances such as those that - ere created in Britain-the Thatcherite model which those opposite have usedwhere there are people begging in the streets. That is the situation that the shadow Treasurer would like to create in this country. As the Acting Treasurer, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training ( Mr Dawkins) has said, the suggestions that the shadow Treasurer puts forward in respect of the macro-economic situation would create a recession. What does a recession mean? A recession means increased unemployment; that is what it means. The Opposition's only solution is to increase unemployment. The shadow Treasurer threw a series of questions at us. For example, he asked: 'What will you do about the fiscal situation?'. We already have a very tight fiscal we will not cut genuine benefits from people in order to deal with our current problems. On the contrary, we' are putting forward positive strategies to deal directly with the current account and other problems that we face. The issue here is: what is the correct analysis of the situation? Certainly, the conservatives' analysis of the situation is completely and utterly mistaken. Those remedies which the shadow Treasurer has put forward have already been tried overseas and are not working. For example, we can look at the current account deficit in Britain. What are Britain's policies of fiscal cuts and cuts in welfare doing for Britain or for its current account deficit? The answer is nothing. The fact is that the problem has to be attacked in the proper fashion. The correct fashion is to deal with investment; that is, to get a turnaround in investment. One of the reasons that the figures appear to be bad is that we have a massive investment surge. A lot of equipment and machinery are coming into this' country because we are starting to see the impact of previous policy in terms of the build-up of investment. That build-up of investment will create new jobs. It will also mean' that more goods will be produced in Australia and that, therefore, we will need to import fewer. But we need a certain amount of patience for that situation to occur. What do we get from the Opposition? Members of the Opposition are saying that. they do not want us to proceed with this investment boom. They do not want us to. proceed with increased investment. They would bring in recessionary measures and the economy would slow down dramatically to the point where unemployment would be increased. What would happen if their measures were put into place? Do honourable members believe that those opposite would be able to sustain the kind of moderate wage increases (Quorum formed). It is outrageous that those opposite have had to call a quorum in debate on a matter of public importance because they do not want to hear the real meaning of the comments by the shadow Treasurer-MONICA",30

59,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,PAIRS,"Mr Leo Mcleay)-Order! The honourable member's time has expired. The discussion on the matter of public importance is concluded. Nehl, O. B. (Teller) Pratt, M. P. INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT (TAX AGENTS' FEES) AMENDMENT BILL Reith, P. K. Robinson, Ian 1989 Rocher, A. C. Ruddock, P. M .. Bill received from the Senate, and read a first time, Second Reading",32
60,Mr ROCHER ,PAIRS,"Curtin) (4.07)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to make a minor amendment to section 69 (I) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to permit a taxpayer to receive a deduction not only for the cost of the preparation of a tax return, but also for the fees charged by a tax agent for the preparation of additional information required under the principal Act and under the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act. Self-Assessment Self-assessment is now a major part of the Australian taxation system and it has radically altered the bases for the preparation of tax returns. Post-assessment checks, whether by way of a desk audit or a field audit, have become a regular part of the assessment process. In addition, objections and appeals are now an intrinsic part of the self-assessment system. Accordingly, it is reasonable to allow a deduction for the preparation of additional material required under the Income Tax Assessment Act and the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act as part of the assessment process. Provisions have bC(en included in this Bill to deny a deduction of costs incurred through a registered tax agent in circumstances where the taxpayer has been engaged in a tax avoidance scheme under section IV A of the principal Act. Provisions have also been included to preclude the amended section 69 being used in contesting a dispute or resolving a disagreement through tpe courts. The Reason for the Bill Traditionally,. fees paid by clients for servof ices of taxation professionals, when directed towards their business activities, have been deductable against the assessable income of the taxpayers concerned, tax litigation excepted. Doubts about the deductibility of fees for income tax return preparation caused by the decision of the High Court of Australia in 1950 in Green v. Federal Commissioner of Taxation were overcome by the introduction ,in 1963 of section 69 into the Income Tax Assessment Act. More recently, however, doubts have been raised about the scope of deductibility of fees for professional taxation services in certain situations by particular court decisions. Further concern has arisen as a result of what appear to be inconsistent approaches to the deductability of fees for professional taxation services that have been taken by officers of the Australian Taxation Office following routine tax audits. This amendment Bill has been made even more critical by a judicial decision of 29 March this year. In the case, His Honour Mr Justice Northrop of the Federal Court of Australia overturned an Administrative Appeals Tribunal. decision where the taxpayer claimed legal advice in the preparation of a notice of objection on the basis that the essential character of the expense was to obtain a reduction in the amount assessed and therefore this legal expense incurred was not deductable under section 51 of the principal Act. Accordingly, inconsistencies appear to exist in the deductability of disputation fees as they relate to income tax assessments and fringe benefits tax assessments even though the payment of both income tax and fringe benefits tax is nondeductable. This Bill seeks to remedy that anomaly. Disputations fees, should be deductable, irrespective of whether they are incurred in pursuance of income tax assessments or fringe benefits tax assessments, except where they involve State, Territory' or Federal Court action. Expenditure relating to professional fees incurred through registered tax agents should be wholly deductable except to the extent to which it is private, domestic or capital in nature. As the recipient of professional tax fees will declare those fees as assessable income, so the taxpayer should obtain a full tax deduction for the payment those fees since, in reality, such outgoings cannot readily be described as expenses of a capital, private or domestic nature. In summary, the Australian taxation environment is in a very different state to the position in 1963, when section 69 of the Act was introduced. In particular, there has been the move to a system of self-assessment. The Commissioner no longer relies on the tax return as lodged and has instigated and upgraded measures seeking to ensure that taxpayers properly meet their liabilities. Those most obvious to honourable members will be desk audits and field audits. The new system of self-assessment increases the importance, time and resources attributed to compliance, planning and, on occasion, tax disputation. The importance of the role of tax advice in legitimate business administration strategic planning has increased significantly. Today, tax is just one of the many important costs of operating a successful business. There now. exists a much broader tax base, particularly with the inclusion of foreign source income and capital gains, and there have ,been added further tax burdens, including fringe benefits tax. There is a recognition by the Australian Taxation Office of the cooperation of agents in the administration of the' Income Tax Assessment Act and the very substantial role played by tax agents in assisting taxpayto ers to meet their obligations as well as, indireferred rectly, to assist in the revenue collection on process. It is interesting to note that statistics show that over 50 per cent of appeals against decisions and assessments of the Australian Taxation Office are resolved in the taxpayPublic er's favour. Several other jurisdictions permit deductability of taxation fees for taxation services. These include the United States America, Canada, West Germany and Jastruction pan. The circumstances which 25 years initiated the limited concession embodied section 69 no longer prevail. Senator Watson, the initiator of this in the Senate, recorded thanks to the officers of the Taxation Institute of Australia, Australian Society of Accountants and memReporting bers of the individual accounting firms their valuable advice on this Bill. I echo that expression of appreciation. In acknowledging his presence in the gallery, I pay tribute Senator Watson, whose initiative in presentand ing his private member's Bill is of both his expertise and his legislative aptitude. While many accountants and lawyers would like the amendment to be wider than that which is proposed, the Bill will address many of the anomalies that have been idenin tified. The Government has indicated that will make amendments to the Bill so as widen its scope to address some of those concerns. As it stands, this simple Bill will remedy an anomaly which exists in the comviding plicated area of taxation. Given that the out measure has been passed with the support the Government in the Senate, a speedy passage of this Bill through the House might reasonably be anticipated. I commend the and Bill to the House.",33

The estim!!.ted cost of the proposal is $42.5m, at October 1988 prices. Bill The new building will provide accommodation for the Sydney registry of the Family the Court of Australia and the Commonwealth Service, and will include space for for the Chief Justice, Deputy Chief Justice, judges, masters, and their, respective staff; the Registrar, deputy registrars and their staff; to counselling, library and registry functions; 15 courtrooms, with provision for inan example crease at a future date. The building will replace existing accommodation which at present is spread over three separate buildings elsewhere in Sydney. Those buildings were originally built for use as commercial office space and are deficient a number of important aspects that imit pinge on the efficient functioning of the to Court. These include acoustic and environmental problems in courtrooms, which arise from low ceiling heights, difficulties in prothe necessary physical security, withcontravening fire regulations, of inappropriate lift services, and inadequate flexibility to cope'with variable air-conditionspecifically ing loads. The dispersal of court functions between the buildings has confused and inconvenienced clients, caused problems with file movement and control, and has damaged communication links between staff. This, together with space inadequacies, has led to considerable staff dissatisfaction in recent times. The problem was further increased when it became necessary for the Family Court to vacate the La Salle Building last March. and to set up temporary accommodation across the road following the sale of the building and the termination of the Family Court's lease. Given the high cost of court fit-out requirements in leased premises and the consequent exposure to unreasonable rent escalation, purpose-designed buildings are not only more economical in the longer term but they alone provide the full level of facilities and security necessary for the administration of the Family Law Act. The site selected for the construction of the court is located on the corner of Goulburn and Castlereagh Streets. This location was chosen after numerous other prospects had been rejected. A submission by the New South Wales Bar Association expressing the view that the location was inconvenient to the legal profession was not supported by the Public Works Committee. The site is conveniently served by public transport and is close to a number of public car parks. It is also situated in a rapidly' developing part of the central business district of Sydney, which also includes a developing legal precinct. It will therefore complement the Mark Foys building, which is undergoing major refurbishment by the New South Wales Government for court purposes. I thank the Committee for its prompt report and I commend the motion to the House.",34
63,Mr TUCKEY ,SYDNEY,"O'Connor) (4.20)-The Opposition does not oppose this motion to declare that 'it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the Committee has duly reported to Parliament: Construction of a building for the Family Court of Australia, Sydney'. We are talking about the construction of a building in which marriage breakdown and some of its related tragedies will be dealt with. Unfortunately, it is a responsibility of government to arbitrate in these matters. We can only express our regret that an additional $42.5m has to be spent in this area. Nevertheless, we recognise that, as the Government has pointed out, existing facilities are unsuitable. In particular, I take note of the comments of the Minister for Administrative Services ( Mr West) about the difficulties in providing the necessary physical security without contravening fire regulations in' the existing building. Physical security has also become absolutely necessary in the arena of family law jurisdiction. The Opposition totally supports all efforts made by the Government to ensure that those people who are charged with the task of arbitrating on the tragedy of broken marriage are given maximum protection in the carrying out of their duties. In that regard the Opposition sees this as a positive move. As it frequently does, the Opposition disagrees with the Minister when he says that, given the high cost of court fit-out requirements in leased premises and the consequent exposure. to unreasonable rent escalation, purpose-designed buildings are not only more economical in the longer term but they alone provide the full level of facilities and security necessary for the administration of the Family Law Act. In making that statement, the Minister presupposes that tenders could not have been called for the provision of a purpose-built building for rent. The Opposition is still of the view that is held very strongly by private enterprise that if one is in the business of delivering a particular service then it is much better' that the building be provided by someone else. Today, big business no longer believes the message that the Minister has given. Nevertheless, the Government has taken that particular decision and the Opposition does not intend to stand in its way. I also wish to point out, as I did in debate the other day-and I think you, Mr Deputy Speaker, were in the chair-that broken marriage today is as much due to economic pressures on our community as to all the old reasons that have been stated in the family law courts over many years. It has to be recognised, as it was over the weekend in many publications-the Marriage Guidance Council, among others, made this pointthat financial pressures, particularly the current interest rate regime and high taxation, are putting pressure on marriage, and will cause a greaterdemand for these facilities. No doubt I would also find in the Public Works Committee's report support for the Minister's view that the Goulburn and Castlereagh Streets is the most convenient location. It is interesting that much consideration was given to the convenience of the professionals in the business. I wonder whether continuing to locate these sorts of facilities, which are used by the general public, in the business districts of our capital cities is the wisest thing to do. That is not a criticism; it is purely a view that I have that it is time that decentralisation, which we frequently talk about, need not only be sending something off to a country town but also it might be moving out of the highly concentrated areas of our cities where we more and more direct the public. One wonders whether there is some statistical evidence available that suggests that it would be more convenient to the public to locate facilities such as family court buildings within the suburban areas of capital cities rather than in the central business districts, notwithstanding public parking and public transport. The Opposition does not oppose this motion.",35
64,Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,SYDNEY,"Kingsford Smith-Attorney-General) (4.25f---As the Attorney-General, I appreciate what the honourable gentleman has just said. But the location of the new Family Court building is outside the central business district; it is on a main transport route. The legal professiqn has been thinking that the building ought to have been located in the central business district.",36
65,Mr TUCKEY ,SYDNEY,I take that point; I just say that it is still very close to the centre of Sydney.,36
66,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,SYDNEY,"It is outside the central business district. It is a good site and on main transport routes. The only objection I had was from the legal profession. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA TERMINAL, OPERATIONAL AND COMMERCIAL. SITES, BRISBANE NA Reference of Work: Public Works Committee Act",36
67,Mr WEST ,AIRPORT,"Cunningham-Minister for Administrative Services (4.26)-I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Sandfilling of international terminal, operational and commercial sites, Brisbane Airport. Since completion of the domestic terminal building at Brisbane airport in 1988 the need has arisen for the Federal Airports Corporation to prepare for further developments, including a new international terminal, aviation industry requirements and commercially lettable sites. Honourable members should appreciate that the need for a new international terminal has been the subject of considerable agitation in recent times. The proposed development sites are located on low-level salt marsh or on open grassed land. The underlying subsurface soils comprise 24 to 30 metres of soft saturated soils. As was the case with preparations for. the new Brisbane airport, it is necessary that, prior to any, facilities being constructed, the area be filled and surcharged with !!and to avoid flooding and minimise differential settlement of the saturated subsoil. After undertaking feasibility studies into possible sources of material for fill, it was decided to use the same source as employed for construction of the new Brisbane airport. Discussions have been held with the appropriateÂ· State Government authorities and approval in principle has been received to draw sand from middle banks in Moreton Bay. The sand will be dredged from middle banks using one or two cutter dredges and then transported to an existing handling basin adjacent to the airport site. This basin will be redredged and the sand pumped through an overland pipeline to the development sites. As the sand accumulates, earthmoving equipment will shape the fill and surcharge sand as required. The $44m project, at January 1989 prices, is to be financed from internal sources and supplemented, if necessary, by commercial borrowings. It is expected to take a little over two years to complete: 16 weeks to establish the pump and servicing infrastructure; and 30 to 40 weeks for sand dredging. A period of 12 months will then be required to allow settlement of the subsoils before final shaping can be completed and the proposed developments can commence. The environmental aspects of this project have l1een examined in detail and studies have indicated that development works will have no adverse effects on the eQvironment. The project will, nonetheless, employ the same environmental protection measures as were used during the construction of the new domestic airport. 1 table the drawings of the proposal and commend this motion to the House.",36
68,Mr TUCKEY ,AIRPORT,"O'Connor) (4.29)-Unlike the first motion, this is a motion to refer a matter to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, which I hope will look at it in detail. The Opposition does not in any way oppose the motion, particularly as it concerns a reference to the Committee, but some comments need to be made. The Minister for Administrative Services ( Mr West) has already told us that it will cost $44m, a substantial amount of which will be for re-establishing dredges and dredge pipelines that obviously were in place at the time the Government erected the Brisbane airport domestic terminal. The documents provided with this motion show that the sandfill is to go immediately alongside the existing terminal and that the international terminal will be an extension of the existing terminal. Of course, had the Government chosen, at the time of constructing the domestic terminal, as was the original proposal, to go on with this, the establishment cost- which are now having to be met again in getting this project up and running could have been avoided. As an administrator, the Government does notÂ· stand in a very good light in regard to this proposal. At the time, it ignored all the evidence and even its own efforts in trying to establish increased tourism, particularly the northern areas of Australia which have become very popular because of films such as Crocodile Dundee. Here was the very airport that was most needed in regard to the development of international tourism being denied a decent international terminal, forcing their airlines to taxi nearly as far as they fiew-l0 kilometres or somethingwhich was absolutely ridiculous. More importantly, there are obviously very large costs involved in the Government's neglect of, if nothing else, providing the necessary sand and base fill for the obvious extension of the terminal which would be required. Nobody in his right mind would accept that the circumstances at the completion of the domestic terminal would continue, and huge amounts of public money will now be wasted in re-establishing facilities that were already there.' . 1 hope that, in conducting its inquiries, the Standing Committee on Public Works will take all of these matters into account and bring government administrators and the Government itself to task. It is not right that the Committee should just look at the good things which are coming forward; it should also look at the mistakes which have been made and criticise governments for making such bad decisions as those which have been made, generally, concerning our airports. The same proposals, of course, apply to the Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport, as we know. This will take two years and it is another two years which the tourism industry can ill-afford. Generally, the Opposition sees this as being too little too late, but we certainly do not oppose the reference to the Joint Committee on Public Works.",37
69,Mrs DARLING ,AIRPORT,"Lilley) (4.32)-1 also have a particular interest in the provision of the sand fill for the operational and commercial sites proposed for the new international terminal at Brisbane Airport, which is within my electorate. I would like to answer the most recent comments made by the honourable member for O'Connor ( Mr Tuckey) because many of them are highly hypocritical As the next speaker is probably aware, in 1981, when 1 was in opposition, 1 was trying to persuade the Fraser Government to set in place the bringing in of sand-fill for the domestic terminal and the international in terminal at the same time. I also wished for that Government to make a decision to commence phase one of that operation for the domestic and the international terminals at the same time as it was deciding whether to upgrade the interim international terminal which then existed. There has been a tremendous amount of hypocrisy regarding this very matter. I note criticisms, in recent years, of' the dat-ng of our planning and construction of the new international terminal. In fact, at the time when the Fraser Government made the decision to upgrade iheexisting international terminal it set' down the date for initiating the action which is being initiated today at about 1990. In other words, the tying in of the budgetary process in 1981 to upgrade the existing international terminal and to put the money into the domestic terminal set back the building of the new international terminal at Brisbane Airport until abbut 1990. Here we are, right on schedule in 1989, having put an enormous amount of money into the wonderful project of the domestic terminal-in fact, before schedule-:-now looking at the building of. the international terminal. It is time that members of the Opposition reverted to fa,cts when they comment on the operations of this Government, particularly under the specific conditions which have been pertaining to Australia since we came to power and inherited the very bad economic situation which we have been facing since.",37
70,Mr TUCKEY ,AIRPORT,"Don't give us the inheritance talk. """,38
71,Mrs DARLING,AIRPORT,"One can inherit, I can assure the honourable member. I was there in 1983 and I heard comments from the then Government, before 1983, in which it denied a number of different c1aims- It denied that unemployment existed. There were a number of areas' into which it did not put any planning ot funding. Our action to meet all of the problems in those areas in whiCh the previous government failed has taken a lot of money and ,a lot of planning; and we are still carrying out the necessary tasks. That is not what this motion is about. I am sorry,",38
72,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,AIRPORT,"I was diverted; I was just , answering thatinterjection. In 1981 I was making the very point to the Public Works Committee that the honourable member for O'Connor ( Mr Tuckey) was making. We are looking at $44m. If the Government had brought in the fill for both projects at the stage of expanding the 'interim terminal, we would have saved hundreds of millions of dollars for the Australian public. It was the Fraser Government that: made that initial decision. When this Government came to power, it became aware of the amount of money that had to go into this project and perhaps was in a more sym,pathetic frame of mind towards the problems that had faced the previous government. People on this side of the House are not leading the unjust, unwarranted and unsubstantiated attack; those on the Opposition side are doing that. I happen to have been on the ground in the electorate when these things were occurring. I could not get the Fraser Government to budge on that p,6int. "", J certainly welc-me the assurances by the Minister for Administrative Services ( Mr West) that the environmental aspects have been examined in detail and studies have indi9ated that the development works will have no adverse effects on the environment. However, I make the point that I will be approaphing Mr Brian Lee, the, Queensland Direct9t of the, Fed,eral Airport Corporation, because it is so very important that these environmental aspects are looked into thoroughly. I would like to se,e an environmental impact study. I feel there was not enough preparatory work done on some aspects of the domestic terminal; and we most certainly have to get our act straight on the international terminal. I would not like to see us go ahead with construction and planned expenditure until we have checked with other levels of government, spoken to the airport corporation, and ensued that all of those environmental aspects, which are so important, are considered. Of course, we are looking at Moreton Bay and the dredging of the sand there; we are also looking at the environmental aspect of noise. There are a number of different aspects which are most important and which certainly have been heightened in my mind over the years as,have become more aware of the importance of ensuring that these concerns of the public-quite rightly expressed-are met, and ' considered before steps ,are taken to initiate operations such as the one under discussion tod;lYÂ·",38
73,Mr JULL ,AIRPORT,"Fadden) (4.39)-1 agree with the comments made by the honourable member for O'Connor ( Mr Tuckey) on the cost blow-out which is now a result of the Government's decision to delay the construction of the Brisbane terminal. I wish to take up a couple of the points made by the honourable member for Lilley ( Mrs Darling). I, too, was at the forefront of the construction of the new Brisbane international terminal. I, too, was at the forefront of trying to get some sense into the decision of the Joint Committee on Public Works in 1981 to proceed with the whole project of the new international terminal at that time. I know that tpe present Public Works Committee may consider this matter a little more thoroughly, but may I say that the initial decision of the Committee in 1981 was wrong. Every other decision regarding the construction of the new Brisbane international terminal has been wrong. The projections on tourist growth and traffic growth into Brisbane by the former Department of Aviation were wrong. The projections by the Australian Tourist Commission were wrong and the projections by Qantas Airways Ltd were wrong. The plain facts of the situation are the: the Brisbane Airport has encountered the fastest growth in international traffic of any international airport in Australia; and by 1995, the projections now show, it will be the second busiest international airport in this nation. What worries me about the Minister's referral of this inquiry to the Public Works Committee-and I hope that the honourable member for Throsby ( Mr Hollis ) and his team will pick up this issue during the hearings-is the point that has been raised about the two-year program to complete the fill works. The greatest understatement of the Minister for Administrative Services ( Mr West), who moved for the reference this afternoon, was that the terminal has been the subject of considerable agitation in recent times. In actual fact, it has been more than that in the State of Queensland: there has been almost civil war between the government agencies, the Brisbane City Council, the Queensland State Government and the tourist industry, because it has been quite obvious for some time that the present terminal facilities are almost farcical and that we must go ahead and build this new terminal as fast as possible to ensure that we can handle future growth. One of the very real propositions that has been put to the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) by th- Opposition, the State Government, the Brisbane City Council, the Queensland Tourist and Travel Corporation, Tourism Brisbane and most of the local tourist bodies has simply been that this project should be let out to private enterprise. While the Government makes a lot of noise about privatisation, indeed this is one project in regard to which it could really come to the party. At least five consortia in Queensland are prepared to take on the construction of a new international terminal and, surprise, surprise, at no cost to the taxpayer; but provided they can run the terminal and build the associated hotel. Not half an hour ago I confirmed with two of those consortia whether they still thought that the project was .viable and whether they were still prepared to become involved, and the answer was that, yes, they could get the site works and the terminal completed in two years and that work could start in July. At this stage we are looking at two years for the initial dredging works and the settling period, and I do not know how much longer we are looking at for the construction of the terminal. If a period of 18 months to two years is determined, you can bet your bottom dollar that, if the Government is involved, it will be three years. The proposition that must be considered by the Public Works Committee is simply this; it would seem to me to be almost a physical impossibility to have the new international terminal up and running and looking' after the tremendous growth that, is occurrjng in Queensland within. five years. And that is despite the fact that there has been tremendous growth in international traffic into Brisbane and despite the fact that in only a couple of years in the future-in 1991-the Lions Clubs International will hold their world convention in Brisbane. In one weekend no fewer than 43,000 people will pass through Brisbane Airport. That will be the biggest operation ever undertaken in this country, and 43,000 people will pass through that airport-that tin shed-in that weekend. Charter flights from all over the United States of America will arrive, and special flights are being arranged from Asia and other points around the globe to handle this amount of traffic. 1 trust that the Public Works Committee will look very closely at this proposition that has been put by the FAC, a body which, 1 might say, appears to me to have had ,yery little interest at all in the proposition of private enterprise being involved in this terminal. That is one thing that we could look at very closely indeed; there wQuld be a saving of $44m to the taxpayers of Australia if private. enterprise became involved.",38
74,Mr SCIACCA ,AIRPORT,"Bowman) (4.45)-1 thought, in listening to the words of other honourable members in this debate, that it would'. be wrong of, me not to contribute something more to the debate particularly with respect to the problems being suffered in Brisbane as a result of flight paths from the new Brisbane airport. We .are talking about the construction of an international air terminal, and there is no doubt that Brisbane require!! a new international air terminal. 1 believe everyone agrees that the existing terminal is not exactly up to scratch and should be fixed up. I hope that the Standing Committee on Public Works will look closely at theenvironmental aspects, not only the dredging aspect and whether or not sand will be transported from Moreton Bay and so on but also whether in due course' the new international terminal will be the second busiest airport in Australia in the near future, as is projected. 1 suggest that the Committee look closely at the question of increased traffic into the airport and the increased noise that will result, particularly after the growth in traffic. 1 hope that more care and consideration will be taken by those who are planning this new international terminal and the subsequent runways that might be needed in Brisbane so that the mistakes that occurred in regard to the domestic airport are not repeated. 1 believe it has been said many times.in this place that many of the projections and estimations of the Federal authorities from 1979 to 1981, during the Fraser Government years, were simply wrong,' and the honourable member for Fadden ( Mr Jull) referred to that. Those authorities were never so wrong than with respect to the effect of noise pollution, given the siting of the. runway. Obviously, 1 support the motion. It is all right for the honourable member for O'Connor ( Mr Tuckey), who comes from Western Australia, to whinge and say that we have made a mistake and that we should have done certain things. The fact is that after much agitation from tourist lobbies and others, such as the Brisbane City Council and so on, at the very least we have done something about the situation and, as the honourable member for Lilley ( Mrs Darling) said, we are within the schedule and doing something /!.bout the situation. My personal position has always been that 1 would not like to see an international air terminal in Brisbane completed until the noise pollution problems were solved. The Government has decided to construct the terminal, and 1 therefore support that decision. But 1 hope-and 1 say this quite sincerelythat proper notice is taken of the care and comfort of those people who live around that airport. If the airport is to become as large as everyone expects it will, consideration must be given to the people who live around it. There is a horrendous problem. Those who live in Sydney would know of the problems experienced there, and the noise pollution problem is just as 'bad for the people in my electorate and in the electorates of the honourable member for Lilley and the honourable member for Griffith ( Mr Humphreys). I hope that the Public Works Committee will look at that question seriously. Question resolved in the affirmative. STAGE 2 DEVELOPMENT, NA SCHOOL, HMAS STIRLING, <;ARDEN ISLAND, WESTERN AUSTRALIA Reference of Work: Public Works Committee Act",40
75,Mr WEST ,INCLUDING NEW SUBMARINE,"Cutminghani-Minister for Administrative Services) (4.48)-I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969 the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works forconsideration and report: Stage 2 Development, including new Submarine School, HMAS Stirling, Garden Island, Western Australia. HMAS Stirling is located on Garden Island in Cockburn Sound, about 60 kilometres by road south of Perth. The original development of HMAS Stirling was complete largely in 1978 and the base currently has seven surface ships and one submarine home ported there. It is also the site of the submarine escape training facility, which is one of most advanced facilities of its type in world. The need to further build up HMAS Stirling derives from the Government en1996. dorsement of the 1987 defence White Paper and the establishment of the two-ocean Navy concept. Development is proposed in two further stages between 1989 and the end the century to progressively enhance and exyear pand the operational and support capabilities of the base to eventually provide for about half of the Royal Australian Navy's major fleet units being home ported or based at Stirling. The proposal now before the House is the stage 2 works covering the base develto opment from 1989 to 1996. The role of Stirling is to provide maintenance, supply and operational support for ships as well port, berthing and ship-side services. The proposed stage 2 facilities will enhance these services and allow the home porting of adthere ditional ships and submarines. The stage proposal consists of over 30 individual projThis ects. These range from additional accommoAdministrative dation and recreational facilities to new workshops, technical service facilities and wharf facilities. The base presently 1,500 naval personnel-that is, 520 area and base staff and 980 ships' crews. This is expected to increase to approximately 3,000 personnel over the next 10 years. Also included in the proposal is a new submarine school which is required as part of the new submarine project. The school to be built to train qualified submarine sonnel to operate and maintain the fleet new type 471 submarines. There is insuffidore cient space in the existing Oberon class trainDr ing school at Sydney's HMAS Platypus and there are operational and training advantages in having the training school near the subpublic marine west coast home port at Stirling. new school will provide classrooms, simulaway. tors and demonstration equipment for 40 staff and from 50 to 120 students undertakbit ing specialist training for up to six months prior to posting to a submarine. The estimated cost of these proposed 2 works, including the new submarine school, is $135.6m at April 1989 prices. It is inand tended that tenders will be called for some components of the stage 2 development immediately following parliamentary approval the to proceed. The bulk of the stage 2 works the will be constructed in separate contract packages, with completion of the works by As I said earlier, there is a future stage 3 development being planned. This will provide additional facilities to meet the further progressive increase in basing and operations of at HMAS Stirling between 1996 and the 2000. I table selected plans of the proposed stage 2 development at HMAS Stirling and I commend the motion to the House.",40
76,Mr TUCKEY ,INCLUDING NEW SUBMARINE,"O'Connor) (4.53)-I am pleased to advise the House that the Opposition does not oppose this. motion to refer for the stage 2 development at HMAS Stirling the Joint Standing Committee on Public Works. It is of special interest to me that these will be further works in my State of as Western Australia. For many years Western Australians have wondered why we had defence facilities on that side of Australia where is least fear of attack. The facilities 2 include the provision of a submarine school. is clearly aimed, as the Minister for Services ( Mr West) advises, at the new submarine projects and a number of those submarines, if not all, will be ported supports at HMAS Stirling. The matter will be referred to further by my colleague the shadow Minister for defence, the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Carlton), so I do not want to say a lot about it. But I would like to put on record .that amongst the established facilities at Garis den Island is a decompression chamber. On peran occasion not long ago members of the of Royal Australian Navy staff there, CommoBaird and two doctors, Dr Loxton and Robertson, assisted my youngest daughter when she suffered decompression sickness. The Navy's facilities there have been a great facility. I am aware that it is not only The my daughter who has been assisted in that Unfortunately, people who go scuba diving in Western Australia seem to place a too much confidence in that facility; too many of them end up with decompression sickness. I am sure that the Navy could do stage without the demands - hey put upon them, but from our personal experience my family I could not have asked for better cooperation and assistance than we received from those people at a time of great worry to ourselves. I will be relying on my colleague the shadow Minister for Defence to make some more specific remarks regarding this facility. I just wish to inform the House that there is no opposition from the Opposition on this matter.",41
77,Mr CARLTON ,INCLUDING NEW SUBMARINE,"Mackellar) (4.55)-1 welcome the opportunity to make a return to the crease in my new role as shadow Minister for defence. My only regret in this is that my dear old friend from univerthat sity days, the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support ( Mr Robert Brown), will have to be displaced from the position to which he has been recently elevated if economy and the Government continue to gt> in the way that they areI support what my colleague the honourable member for O'Connor ( Mr Tuckey) has said about the motion moved by the Minister for Administrative Services ( Mr West). We welcome the motion. I just want to raise one or two issues-I will not take much of the time of the House-relating to our capacity to refit our Oberon submarines in the period refits. before they are fully replaced by the new fleet of type 471 submarines. As the Minister has said, the build-up of the Western Australian Garden Island installation, which cludes HMAS Stirling, a new submarine school and operational and logistic support facilities, is part of the continuing program to establish the concept of a two-ocean as outlined in the 1987 Defence White Paper. The Opposition hopes that the build-up Garden Island and the development of the two-ocean Navy concept of the Minister for Defence ( Mr Beazley) is not the paper ger-or White Paper tiger-it has been proven to be in the Pacific. The report of the Dibb Review of Australia's Defence Capabilities said that we would need an increase of about 3 per cent in real money terms to implement his proposals-and these were extended by the White Paper. That would have meant 9 per cent over the three years since Dibb. The actual increase has been only about one half of one per cent. Whilst we certainly support the moves by the Minister to establish a two-ocean he will want a good deal more support from his colleagues in the Cabinet in terms of resources to make this a reality. A particular issue relating to the development of Garden Island is the proposal to base an additional number of Oberon submarines in the west. This raises the question as to where future maj9r refits-which take two years-of those Oberons which will supplement the introduction of the new type 471 will take place now that Cockatoo Island in New South Wales is to be closed. all The Cockatoo Island management estimates at least two Oberons will require major refits prior to the new fleet of type 471s, accounting for our total submarine force. I understand that a Western Australian conthe tractor recently conducted an intermediate level maintenance program on anÂ· Oberon which took twice as long and cost twice as much as it would have done at Cockatoo Island. The Minister therefore ought to advise the House whether the capability exists outside Cockatoo Island to conduct major refits on the Oberons. In addition, he needs to explain the rationale behind his decision to close Cockatoo Island before it has fully served its purpose with regard to submarine This stage 2 development proposal is a central component in capital facilities exinpenditure in the short term. The proposed stage 3 development will project into the longer term. This reminds us of the disturbing finding identified by defence consultant Navy Robert Cooksey in his review of defence facilities. At the time of his report Cooksey found that no long term facilities policy exof isted within the Department of Defence. Unless the Minister has done something to rectify this in the last couple of months, we timust assume that this is still the case. EmptyHere tralia's Defence Capabilities, also alluded to the need for a coherent facilities review and policy which reflects Australia's strategic considerations. We believe that the Minister must turn his attention to developing a CQherent, rational and long term approach to facilities management. This must better utilise the increasingly limited resources this Government is making available to the DeNavy, partment of Defence. Question resolved in the affirmative.

78,Mr NA BROWN ,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY,"Menzies) (5.00)The Opposition supports this motion, although the motion is curious because it incorporates what I suggested when this matter was last before the House.

81,Mr NA BROWN ,CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Menzies) (5.02)May I say at the outset that the Opposition supports the Crimes Legislation Amendment Bill 1989, which makes a large number of changes to the Federal criminal law. I suppose one could sum it up by saying that some of its principal provisions modernise aspects of that law to enable it to combat modern crime. As I have said, the Opposition supports the Bill but we believe that amendments need to/be made in some areas, and I will deal with those as we come across agreed to. them in the course of the debate. There are four principal areas in the Bill which I will deal with in turn. The first relates to what I might refer to as computer crime. For some time a committee of review, chaired byÂ· Sir Harry Gibbs, has been examining the Federal criminal law. At this stage I should pay credit to the work done by Sir Harry Gibbs and his committee. They have published-I have forgotten the precise number-a large number of papers on various areas of Federal criminal law. The reports that they have published have been a valuable repository of knowledge on Federal criminal law and have highlighted some areas where the law is in need of reform and amendment. I have no doubt that the work of Sir Harry Gibbs and his committee will be the foundation for all future study of Federal criminal law. The committee has published a number of worthwhile papers, one of which is on computer crime. There was a need for that paper and for the research the committee did, because at present there is virtually no Commonwealth law covering either the commission of old-fashioned crimes by modernÂ· computerised means or those activities of characters known as hackers who wreak havoc by introducing viruses into and generally ruining computers. Unfortunately this is becoming quite a habit in the United States, where people of an anarchistic disposition have sought to cause damage in Defense Department computers by getting into them. I am not sUJ;'e how people do this sort of thing, but apparently it can be done. They introduce what are known as viruses and let them run amuck, which in some cases has resulted in, as is their objective, damage to the computers and the programs in them. That is conduct which all of us would regard as very undesirable. The purpose of this part of the Bill is, firstly, to provide a framework of computer law to cover what might be called computer offences-that is to say, offences relating directly to the misuse of a computer-and, secondly, to provide for those cases where crimes such as embezzlement are committed using a computer. The Bill, in effect, establishes a number of new offences. Firstly, there is the offence of unlawfully obtaining access to data in a Commonwealth computer or to Commonwealth data in any computer; secondly, the offence of unlawfully obtaining access to data with the intention of defrauding, or access to data relating to security, law enforcement, personal affairs, commercially valuable information and such like, or continuing to examine it knowing that it relates to those matters; thirdly, the offence of damaging data in Commonwealth computers; fourthly, the offence of using a Commonwealth facility, such as Telecom Australia, for the purpose of obtaining access to data in a computer; fifthly, the offence of using a Commonwealth facility to obtain access to computer data with the intention of committing a fraud, or access to data relating to security, law enforcement or the other matters I have mentioned, knowing that it relates to such matters; and, sixthly, the offence of unlawfully using a Commonwealth facility to damage, alter or insert data into the computer. These are a series of offences which are related either to gumming up the works, as it were, by means of malpractices associated with the computer or to using the computer, at least in the Commonwealth area, for the purpose of committing a fraud or some other offence. All of that is outlawed by this Bill, as it should be. The penalties provided are imprisonment for from six months to 10 years, depending on the particular offence. We believe that should deter people from engaging in this type of conduct. There is a need to change the law relating to computers substantially, and this Bill is one part of it. There are other areas which have not beenÂ· fully rectified. For instance, all of those questions of privacy that are intimately associated with the use of computers have yet to be developed and dealt with. I would not be at all surprised if we find some further Commonwealth legislation introduced very shortly to deal with privacy in the use and abuse of computers. That is what the first area of the Bill deals with, and we believe that it is desirable and worthy of support. For that reason, the 'Opposition supports that part of the Bill. Likewise, the Opposition supports what I will describe as the second area of the Bill, relating to penalties. There is no point in setting out crimes in legislation unless there are hefty penalties to ensure that those tempted to commit those crimes know what is in store for them if they do commit them. The Bill will increase the fines that mayÂ· be imposed for the commission of Commonwealth offences where there is no fine expressly specified, only a maximum fine. The penalties are to be increased by means of a formula based on the term of imprisonment. The result of that, in practical terms, will be that fines for Commonwealth offences will be substantially increased. One example that is given in the second reading speech is the increase in fines which are currently $20,000 to $120,000. As there is a need to increase penalties substantially in many areas of the law, we support that reform. In this same area, the Bill will allow the courts to impose a fine not only as an alternative to imprisonment-and this is frequently done-but also in addition to imprisonment. If I am not mistaken, this already applies in some of the drug cases where we find not only a penalty of imprisonment but also scope for a very large pecuniary penalty to be imposed. For those reasons, we believe that this part of the Bill is also worthy of support. The third area of the Bill deals with what is known as the spent convictions scheme. I should say, for those who do not know, that a spent convictions scheme is one that prevents any use being made of convictions and punishments incurred by people during a wayward period of their lives-no doubt, in many cases in their youth---':""'when, departing from the straight and narrow path, they have committed an offence. The general view is that this should not be held against them for ever and a day. The purpose of the scheme is to prevent discrimination against someone with a record-to put it bluntly-when that person has served his or her time and paid his or her debt to society. Queensland has had such a scheme since 1986. Following that worthy and desirable reform, and following also a report by the Australian Law Reform Commission, there is now to be-I was going to use the word 'uniform', but that is not quite correct-a nationwide spent convictions scheme. It is not going to be uniform because, unfortunately, the provisions of the various spent convictions schemes between one State and another will not be identical; there will be variations. As I understand it, the States have not been able to agree amongst themselves and the Commonwealth has not been able to agree with the States. Indeed, we cannot blame the Federal Government on this occasion. As I understand it, it would be difficult for the Commonwealth to agree with the States because of the several positions they hold. Although I do not recall this being said the second reading speech, I think the view has been reached that it is better to have spent convictions scheme, albeit not a uninot form and common one, rather than not havshe ing one at all. Unfortunately, the schemes will differ between the States. Indeed, honourable members may have seen vertisement in the newspapers over the last few days concerning Western Australia, which is also looking at a spent convictions scheme. Apparently, that State does not yet know what should be contained in the spent convictions scheme and it is calling for missions from the public. However, that precise problem is not fore us today; we have other problems. day we have before us a Bill which deals with the Commonwealth aspects of the spent convictions scheme and sets out the views the present Commonwealth Government as to how a spent convictions scheme should operate, what offences it should apply how we are to put into practice the forgive and forget attitude which is at the basis of the scheme. A conviction is said to be spent where the penalty imposed was either not a term of imprisonment at all or where, alternatively, if it was a term of imprisonment, the term of imprisonment was 30 months in prison or less. A conviction is also said to be spent the person convicted has been pardoned for the offence for a reason other than that he was wrongly convicted. A period of 10 years in the case of an adult, or five years in case of a minor, must have passed since conviction before it is said to be a spent conviction. Let me recapitulate briefly: this part of the Bill implements, for the Commonwealth; a spent convictions scheme so that the convictions incurred by I people in their earlier lives are not continually brought up against them and used, for instance, as a basis for refusing them employment. Under the Bill, the scheme will operate as follows: if there is some attempt to use convictions against people which they had registered against them many years ago, that is said to be a form of discrimination and they are then able to take proceedings before the Privacy Commissioner. The Bill provides that where a conviction is spent, the person convicted is in not required to disclose to anyone the fact that he or she was convicted in the past. In a other words, under this scheme a person will be obliged to reveal the fact that he or has been convicted if more than five years in the case of a minor and more than 10 years in the case of an adult has gone by an adsince that person was convicted. As I have already said, one of the major uses that will be made of this scheme will be that, when a person is applying for a job and the disclosure of his conviction might subprevent him from obtaining the job, he is not obliged to disclose that conviction and it cannot be held against him. Furthermore, beno-one may disclose or take account of the Tofact that the person concerned was charged with or convicted of the offence. If that happens, such people are said to have disof criminated against that person and are at risk of being on the wrong end of a claim for discrimination brought against them beto and fore the Privacy Commissioner. It would be apparent to anyone that, obviously, there are cases where this general rule cannot apply. There are cases where we simply cannot forget and ignore the fact that a person has been convicted in the past. For instance, an obvious one which is specified in the Bill as an exception concerns an organisation or a body that has responsibility if for and care of children. That organisation may wish to take account of the fact that a person applying for a job was convicted of a sexual offence or of an offence where the the victim was a minor. It would be a very the strange scheme if the organisation-say, a school body-were obliged to employ such a person, despite the fact that that person had been convicted in the past of an offence against a child. So that is one example of an obvious exclusion. Another obvious exclusion, which is taken care of in the Bill, relates to the committing of later offences. Of course, we cannot simply expunge the, past. If a person is before the courts again in relation to another or, indeed, even a different offence, an earlier conviction can be taken into account in prosecuting that person or in sentencing him or her after conviction. Likewise, the spent conviction, even although it was 10 years ago, may be taken into account when decisions are being made in regard to migration or citizenship matters,. It may be taken into account by the Commonwealth in deciding whether to employ a person in a law enforcement agency or in areas relating to intelligence or security. In other words, although we are expunging the past and obliterating, as' it were, the fact that a person had been convicted of a crime, it does notas it clearly cannot-apply in all cases and it could effectively still be held against a person if it were proposed that that person be employed in a security or intelligence situation. With that background, our problem is that, whilst it is true that some of the obvious exclusions are set out in the Bill, others are not. Our problem arises from the fact that, inevitably, there is-as is very fashionable in Commonwealth legislation these days-a catch-all provision that the cases that cannot be thought of will be dealt with by regulation. Some of the cases that will not be subject to this spent convictions scheme are described as follows in paragraph (k) on page 20 of the Bill: a prescribed person or body, for a prescribed purpose, in relation to a conviction for a prescribed offence. In other words, I think the draftsman is conceding that there are other cases where it is fairly clear that a spent convictions scheme cannot operate but that those cases are not set out. We have some doubts whether that is a practical and sensible way of doing it. The very fact that one can think of other cases that should be exemptions or exclusions suggests that it is not good enough simply to leave it to a situation in the future where specific and additional exceptions will be set out by regulation. I will give one example and the Attorney General ( Mr Lionel Bowen) can tell me whetl1er I am right or wrong about this. Let us take, the case of somebody who applies for fire insurance but who in the past was convicted and sentenced to 10 years imprisonment for arson. Should the insurance company, when it discovers that fact, terminate the contract? Should it be allowed to terminate the contract? After all, the spent convictions scheme has already told us that, if 10 years has passed by, we should forgive and forget-as we should certainly try to do, and we support the general principle. But should the insurance company be prevented from cancelling the contract? Should it be obliged in effect to enter into a contract of insurance with such a person, bearing in mind-Mr Cleeland-Uberrima fidei.",43
82,Mr NA BROWN,CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Indeed, the ultimate good faith is a rough translation of what the honourable gentleman said. Let us not forget that the Privacy Commissioner would have power to declare that the insurance company should not have set aside that contract when it discovered the conviction for arson. Furthermore, it has a power to award compensation for loss and damage. I could go on all day with examples of cases. Let us take another case: Is a bank to be obliged to employ someone who was convicted more than 10 years ago of bank robbery? Is that the way the scheme will operate? There are 101 cases like that and it just seems to us rather pointless, especially when there has been so much dispute and disagreement between the States, between the States and the Commonwealth and within the general community which is interested in this issue, and very unwise to go ahead and leave it up in the air like this so that cases that can be thought of in the future can be covered by regulation. We will therefore propose an amendment so that the Bill will not come into operation until the full range of these exceptions has been set out and we all know where we are. Already the Bill on its terms will not come into operation for 12 months, and that is sensible. I presume the reason that this part of the Bill will not come into operation for 12 months after it receives the royal assent is so that these cases can be sorted out and employers in particular will know what they are being let in for and know within this 12month period whether they will be entitled to take past convictions into account. For instance, as I understand it, a bank today does not know where it stands if it rejects employment for a convicted bank robber. We believe that, first of all, we should start off, as the Bill does, with that 12months hiatus. But, secondly, we believe that this part of the Bill should not come into operation until the Privacy Commissioner has advised the Minister of the exemptions and exclusions. The Bill already provides for the Privacy Commissioner to advise the Minister on exclusions and exemptions. What we are saying is that it is one factor that should be dealt with before this part of the Bill comes into operation. Thirdly, after the advice has been given the Minister by the Privacy Commissioner, those exclusions should be prescribed by regulation. We are not saying that there should not be a regulation making power. We go on to say that there should additionally be that time within which the Parliament can disallow the regulations so that the Government can do it properly. If the Parliament believes that the Government has not done it properly, the regulation can be disallowed and the Government can go away and do it again-and keep doing it again, to put it bluntly, until we all know what these exclusions are to the operation of the spent convictions scheme. Then there should be the 12 months to allow things to settle down from the time of the royal assent. I foreshadow that the amendment we will move in the committee stage will not do any violence or damage to the scheme, which we say is worthwhile, it will have the effect not of stopping the scheme coming into operatidn but will draft the legislation in such a way that it will not operate until those exemptions and exclusions are set out and clarified and we all know where we stand. After all, this could have very serious consequences-particularly, but not only, for employers. It is important to know just what the extent of these exemptions is. When honourable members see the terms of our amendment, they will see that it has been properly drawn and in such a way that the scheme will certainly operate but not until those matters have .been attended to. We believe they should be attended to before this part of the Bill commences to operate. Without labouring the point, under our amendment the scheme will not come into operation until the exemptions and exclusions have been clarified and until there is general agreement in the community, or certainly in the Parliament, as to what the exclusions are and what they should be. The fourth area of the Bill to which I wish to draw attention is that relating to the Director of Public Prosecutions. The Bill gives the Director of Public Prosecutions a power to grant wider forms of indemnity to witnesses than he presently has. Our view is that those new powers are desirable and will assist in his prosecutorial functions. However, the Bill also gives one additional power to to the Director of Public Prosecutions which we believe should be amended. It is probably known that the Director of Public Prosecutions presently has a limited power to issue ex officio indictments, that is to say, indictments that will put people on trial without there being a committal proceeding before a magistrate. But the Bill aims to give the Director of Public Prosecutions an unlimited power to issue ex officio indictments. No explanation has been given as to why the Director of Public Prosecutions needs this additional power, although I must say from my own knowledge and experience that it is almost certainly justified to give him this power. There are SOfie strange goings-on in the course of committal proceedings. To take an obvious case, if an additional defendant is discovered or emerges, of if new evidence emerges at a later stage, there is no reason why there should be a recommencement of committal proceeding. A lot of committal proceedings these days in Commonwealth crime are very complicated. One wonders really whether during the committal proceedings everyone has a detailed grasp of exactly what is going on. In some cases, there may well because for saying that there is no need to go to the vast expense and take the inordinate amount of time that is presently incurred in wandering month after month through all the intricacies of Commonwealth offences that are dealt with in committal proceedings. In general terms, there probably is !l justification for the Director of Public Prosecutions having an' unlimited power to issue ex officio indictments. But these days that issue, and the involvement of the Director of Public Prosecutions in it, lights up a few warning bells for us. That is partly because of the debate that has been ensuing for several years on the War Crimes Amendment Bill. During debate on the War Crimes Bill, both publicly and in the Parliament, the Parliament and the public were assured ,that prospective defendants under what is now the War Crimes Act would be entitled to a committal to hear what was being said against them and to test the evidence. That right would be taken away by this Bill. It is all right in the case of the Attorney-General, because he can always issue an ex officio indictment under the War Crimes Act, as amended. But the Attorney-General is answerable directly to the Parliament and the Director of Public Prosecutions is not. In view of the almost inevitably dubious nature o( some of the potential evidence which is going to be forthcoming, as, I would understand things at the moment, in prosecutions under the War Crimes Act, it seems unwise to have those cases launched without committal proceedings. No doubt the Attorney-General will say that it is the intention to have committal proceedings. If it is the intention, it can do no harm to support our amendment, which will ensure that in the case of War Crimes Act prosecutions there is always a committal proceeding. It cannot do any damage at all. I know it is an exception and it is unusual to have an amendment covering only one case suchÂ· as prosecutions under the War Crimes Act, but those prosecutions are in fact exceptional cases. In view of the recent debate and the odd nature of the prosecutions, we believe that it is only proper that the law should say exactly what the Government has said many times will be the case-that is, that there will be committal proceedings and not ex officio indictments in prosecutions under the War Crimes Act. Subject to the amendments that I have outlined, we support the Bill. We believe that it makes a number of desirable changes. However, we also believe the amendments being proposed are certainly worthwhile. Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER' (HOD. J. D. M. Dobie }-Order! The honourable member's time has expired.",46
83,Mr CLEELAND ,CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"MCEwen) (5.32)-Regretfully, I cannot recall how to spell that wonderful old Latin phrase uberrima fidei, so I hope Hansard has a legal dictionary. That unusual phrase popped out of my mind from my legal studies long ago. I am happy to support the Crimes Legislation Amendment Bill as yet another piece of keynote legislation in the Government's attack on crime in this country. I strongly support the aim of the amendments in so far as they affect the misuse and theft of knowledge from computer systems. There may be some on the other side who would support the view that the common law is all things to all people and is that wonderful creature of the English legal system that creates protection for people, such as in the Bill of Rights area, or is capable of advancing into twentieth century legal systems. This is evidence of the fact that they do not really believe that either; that the Opposition also understands that today we need to pass statutory law and that the English common law does not have the capacity or the strength to cope with the rapid technological changes that are now occurring in our social and technological systems. I want to concentrate more on the amendments to the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1983, particulariy those areas which create the power for ex officio indictments under the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). The Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority has for some time in its deliberations been concerned about what the Committee sees as the misuse of committal proceedings in this country today. If one looks, for example, at the Cornwell case, at the infamous Cornwell-Bull pair, one sees that long before Cornwell was caught, he deposited in his solicitor's account in New Zealand $NZlOO,OOO with instructions to his solicitor that, should he be apprehended for any matter, that $NZI00,000 sitting in his solicitor's trust account was to be used immediately for his defence. That was some years ago and $NZlOO,OOO would have been a lot to set aside in a trust account where, one presumes, it earns no interest, in anticipation of a future legal defence. The reality is that the sort of money being made from the drug markets in Australia today means that the so-called Mr Bigs or the major crime players have almost unlimited funds to hire the best legal brains this country has to fight right through from committal proceedings to trial and to the appellate jurisdictions. Money is no worry to them. A large number of. cases in this country today evidence the degree and the extent to which those types of criminals are prepared to go, together .with their defence counselI might add that that brings no credit to some defence counsel in Australia-to delay and harass the judicial system and hold up the court processes to try to get a finding of innocence. One should not forget that committal proceedings are primarily an administrative function. They go back to very early English law, to a time when there was no such thing as an independent Director of Public Prosecutions or a structure of courts as we have today. I recall a case last year in Victoria in which four members of the Victorian Police Force, who are currently on indictment-so I will not talk too much about the case itself=--""'had a fighting fund arranged by police association, rumoured to be in excess of $1 m. Nine months after the committal proceedings commenced in Victoria, the Victorian Public Prosecutor said that he had had a gutful of it-nine months had elapsed and it was said that it would be another six months before the committal proceedings were finished-and just pulled the rug on the prosecution before the magistrate in the committal proceeding and immediately ex officioed them. They are currently awaiting trial in Victoria. We can look at the J etCorp committal proceedings in Victoria. That case was very complex, yet again the four people who were found not to have a case to answer before the Victorian magistrates court have now been ex officioed by the Victorian Director of Public Prosecutions, obviously because the Director feels that there is a sufficiently strong case to justify putting those people before a jury. One should not forget that committal proceedings are held before magistrates, not before a jury. They are held before a single person who has a particular and a very peculiar function. Without being too critical of magistrates I stress that as a young policeman I ekperienced justices of the peace sitting on the bench in Victoria. They had the same powers to commit as magistrates. Having had some familiarity with the quality and competence of those justices, I thank God that the day is long gone when they sat judicially in courts in Victoria. In those days, if a policeman told a justice of the peace that someone was guilty, he would be committed. Quite frankly, the system in those years was an absolute joke. I could tell some pretty hair-raising stories about justices of the peace and how they operated in the Victorian judicial system in those years. After that, we had stipendiary magistrates in Victoria, very few of whom were qualified in law. Mostly, they came through from positions of clerk of court. After a large number of years administering the court system, through seniority they eventually sat as fully qualified magistrates, Now in Victoria we are reaching the stage of having in legal terms fully qualified magistrates sitting, but it will be some years before that is fully implemented. Even with fully qualified magistrates sitting, one still has questions about their their degree of competence in very complex matters. It must be very difficult for a magistrate to preside over a committal proceeding which involves very complex commercial law matters. Many magistrates who have never had experience in those areas in their private practices or their previous occupations before gbing to the bench are being asked to be a trial judge-that is, to adjudicate on questions of law-and at the same time to be a jury and determine questions of fact. Members of my Committee and I had a good look at quite a few committals around Australia and seriously considered issuing a report. It is still potentially on the cards that we may examine the whole issue of committal proceedings and the way they work and perhaps make some recommendations on them. The Committee is not alone in expressing those concerns. As long ago as 1980, the late Mr Justice Murphy argued: The desirability of committal proceedings in modern times is doubtful, at least in certain kinds of cases. A trend has developed in New South Wales in which conspiracy, fraud, and various corporate charges become delayed because of committal proceedings which go on for months or years. These are often interrupted with excursions into the Supreme Court for rulings on points of law or procedure. This not only tends to improperly frustrate prosecutions, but also can result in embarrassment and oppression to defendants. While I do not criticise the magistrates who unfortunately have to preside over them, such committal proceedings have become a disgrace to the administration of criminal justice in New South Wales. In 1982 the former Chief Justice of the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court, the late Sir Richard Blackburn, told the Fifth South Pacific Judicial Conference that committal proceedings were 'a total waste of time'. In 1985 Mr Justice O'Brien, then the Chief Judge of the Criminal Division of the New South Wales Supreme Court, expressed the following opinion in Chid's case: Committal proceedings have in many cases, at least in this State, gone beyond their intended legitimate purpose in the interests of the community and the defendant and have degenerated into a prolonged contest, intended almost exclusively to design and set up a basis for the conduct of a trial regarded as inevitably justified. They have come to involve for this purpose persistent, repetitive and much irrelevant cross-examination as well as long debates upon the admissibility of evidence, the conduct of voir dire examinations, the exercise of discretions and the like, much of it appropriate only to an actual trial. The process has therefore come under/substantial criticism as subjecting the community to unjustified inconvenience, delay and expense and amounting in itself almost to an actual trial in which the fundamental role of the jury as the only constitutional tribunal for the determination of issues of fact and the role of the presiding judge in the determination of questions of law and of the issues to be left to the jury tends to be forgotten. More recently the former Chief Justice of the High Court, Sir HarryÂ· Gibbs, who in 1980 held that 'a trial held without antecedent committal proceedings, unless justified on strong and powerful grounds, must necessarily be considered unfair', supported moves to abolish committals, leaving the decision to prosecute in the hands of directors of public prosecutions. A number of recent studies have concluded that committal proceedings are not achieving their purpose of weeding out those cases which should not go to trial and that there are cheaper and more effective ways of informing the defendant of the substance of the) Crown's case against him or her. The Law Reform Commission of Canada recommended the abolition of committal proceedings in 1974, describing them as a cumbersome and expensive vehicles for obtaining discovery. The Royal Commission on Criminal Procedure in the United Kingdom recommended the abolition of committal proceedings in that country in 1981 and their replacement by a procedure whereby the defendant could make an application to a magistrate for discharge if dissatisfied with the strength of the case against him or her. In this country in 1984 the Queensland Law Reform Commission proposed a streamlining of committal proceedings, and in 1987 the New South Wales Law Reform Commission proposed their abolition and replacement. by a right to challenge the decision to prosecute at a pre-trial hearing. As I indicated, committal proceedings as we know them date from the nineteenth century when police forces began to take over from justices of the peace their previous role in the investigation of criminal offences. Magistrates had previously taken depositions in private in much the same way as the police take statements from witnesses today. The United Kingdom Indictable Offences Act 1848 established the right of the accused person to be present at the examination of the witnesses against him or her, to cross-examine them, to make a statement, and to present evidence. As a colony we inherited this ancient system of committals from England. Like many ancient systems of the old English common law, there are those today who still hang on to such outdated and, quite frankly, irrelevant notions today. That is not to say that there should not be some pre-trial proceeding, or necessarily that committals should always be thrown out, but on the evidence that I have and following the inquiry that my Committee has undertaken into several major committals in this country we, in this Parliament, should express concern at the actions of members of the Bar in some States. We should question whether they are properly acting as officers of the courts, which they are sworn to be, or are earning large fees and undertaking any necessary acts that they possibly can legally take to ensure that their client gets a committal at the committal stage before a magistrate so that he does not have to face a jury. Quite frankly, in some cases that I have looked at, one can really raise those serious questions and question the action of the Bar in some States and the action of barristers in some States as to what their real role and function is in the criminal processes of this country, particularly when they are acting for criminals involved in major crime, especially major white collar and drug-related crime. For a variety of reasons I am very pleased to see that the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions will have the same power as many State public prosecutors now have. As I indicated earlier, it is a power that John Coldrey, the State Director of Public Prosecutions in Victoria,' has had for some time. There is no reason at all why federally we should not give that power to our Director of Public Prosecutions. It has been suggested by many commentators that because the Director of Public Prosecutions is an independent person-let us take an example of a National Crime Authority prosecution-the NCA really should not prosecute. The NCA only prepares a brief of evidence. It is then passed over to the Director of Public Prosecutions, who examines the evidence and makes the decision whether to prosecute or not. The DPP undertakes the prosecution, not the National Crime Authority. So with this new style body now in existence, one wonders why an independent body such as the DPP canllot perform the same sort of function as a committal proceeding once historically did and why we need both the DPP to make decisions on prosecution or nonprosecution and magistrates to go through a pre-trial hearing. I think it is a question which really needs to be debated in this country and more examination should be made of the whole process of committals through the States and federally. I note with interest that, despite the I have in the independence of the Director of Public Prosecutions federally, members of the Opposition do not share my view. I find that regrettable. It is pretty obvious from amendment foreshadowed by the honourable member for Menzies ( Mr N. A. Brown) that members of the Opposition do not believe by the introduction of their proposed new subsection (2E) that the DPP is to be trusted in exercising a proper discretion on whether to use the power to ex officio a person or not. I frankly find it strange for the Opposition to say that in major drug trials, in major white collar fraud situations, in all areas other than the War Crimes Act of 1945-I am not sure whether it is a 1945 Act-MONICA",48
84,Mr NA BROWN ,CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,It was amended last year.,51
85,Mr CLEELAND,CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"It was amended, was it? I do not see why that bit of legislation should be seen in a totally different light. The honourable member for Menzies says that we can have the discretion to indict exercised by a political officeholder\ the Attorney-General. We say that the Attorney General, despite being a political officeholder, has that power. That is okay, but' I frankly find it strange that the DPP, who is totally independent of this Parliament and holds a statutory office, cannot be trusted to exercise that discretion. It does not quite gel with me. Either the DPP has an independent role, the independence and the strength of character to hold that office and is to be trusted with the power to ex officio generally, or he does not. I do not see how members of the Opposition can have their cake and eat it too. In the short time. I have, I am interested to comment on the National Crime Authority and the amendments to the .National Crime Authority Act which will strengthen and streamline the managerial role of the Chairman. That is not to say that I am ultracritical of the current management systems of the NCA, but I think those of us who have been privileged to have a deeper involvement in the National Crime Authority as established are aware that some years down the track there will be a need to streamline the system. We are aware that the managerial streamlining is essential, and faith I think it is good that the new Chairman, who will very shortly take up his position, is coming in with a clear understanding of his managerial position and his responsibility unthe der the legislation to introduce proper managerial relationships within the system. This amendment also reduces the need for meeting of the Authority wherever possible. At the moment the Authority has to have regular meetings but as many of the Authority members live in different States, inÂ· managerial terms it makes the effective operation of the Authority very difficult. I welcome this further streamlining of the operation. This legislation removes from the ambit of section 19A of the National Crime Authority Act those agencies which operate in the commercial sector. I notice that, unfortunately, I am very short of time. I would like to have spent some time discussing this matter but I guess to discuss section 19A of the Act one would have to give at least a fiveminute discourse. I will simply indicate to the House that 1 support this major piece of legislation. This landmark legislation, which has been introduced by the Attorney-General ( Mr Lionel Bowen), brings i.n-o t-e twentieth century legal system provIsIons 10 relation to new technology. It brings into effect law as it relates to the theft of knowledge stored in computer systems, and I welcome that initiative.",51
86,Mr RUDDOCK ,CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Dundas) (5.52)-1 welcome the opportunity to speak briefly on the Crimes Legislation Amendment Bill 1989. This omnibus piece of legislation covers a wide range of issues. In that sense, it may be landmark legislation largely because it draws together a number of major issues that ordinarily one would not have thought would be in one piece of legislation. The only fact that holds them together, I suppose;: is that criminals and criminal activities in one form or another are involved. Nevertheless, having regard to the way in which this Parliament works, we are often required to deal with legislation in this way in order to carry out our work in a timely fashion. I am very pleased to see that two of the major issues addressed in the Bill result from significant inquiries that have been u'!-dertaken in recent years. The first of these IS an inquiry undertaken by the form-r C-ief Justice of the High Court of Austraha, SIr H-rI)' Gibbs, who reviewed Commonwealth CrImInal law. He also produced a number of reports and papers and made recommen-ations dealing with the issue of computer CrIme, a matter briefly adverted to by my colleague the honourable member for MCEwen ( Mr Cleeland), who spoke before me in the debate. A second major issue dealt with in the Bill is spent convictions-convictions th-t have been incurred by individuals but WhICh, due to the effiuxion of time, are now regarded as being something that ought not to be held against them. Certain procedures have been developed as a result of advice and con-idÂ­ eration of these matters by the AustralIan Law Reform Commission. I am delighted to see a significant report of the Law Reform Commission being implemented in legislation. We spend a good deal of money in considering the framework of law that operates in this country. The Law Reform Commission has been charged with that task and it has worked in a large number of areas. In going through many of it- reports, - ne finds that it has not necessarIly been gIven the recognition in forms of legislative change that one might ordinarily expect. The spent convictions report-report No. 37-was presented in 1987. It has been before the Government for a time, but it is not as old as many of the other reports that are outstanding. Although we are suggesting certain amendments be made to the legislation, I am pleased to see that largely this report is being implemented, and I commend the Government for that. I endorse the comments made by the honourable member for MCEwen, who spoke previously in this debate in that I am pleased that the present Attdrney-General ( Mr L!onel Bowen):-who has indicated that he will not be go1Og on into the next Parliament with us-has achieved some further reforms of note and I think he should be given proper and due credit for that.",52

89,Mr RUDDOCK,CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"'He deserves one', says the honourable member. I do not know whether the honourable member is getting himself into trouble. I do not want to digress and infringe any rulings as to relevance, Mr Deputy Speaker. I must say, though, that I think a system of recognit-on of. ou.tstanding service is important. I th10k thIS IS a very laudable way of seeing the way in which individuals in the Parliament have been able to perform. I have digressed a little, and I now want to outline the purpose of the legislation. This Bill seeks to amend the Acts Interpretation Act by inserting a new definitionÂ· of 'record'. As I indicated, this fairly minor matter deals with certain major questions. The second matter that was addressed in the explanatory memorandum was the. need to increase and standardise pecuniary penalties, and to expand the scope of the Act to deal more adequately with computer crime. That matter has been mentioned by my colleague who spoke before me. Four new computer offences are provided for, namely: obtaining unauthorised access to data in Commonwealth computers and related conduct; deliberate conduct harmful to Commonwealth computers and data; unauthorised access to computer data throughÂ· Telecom Australia or a similar facility; and deliberate conduct harmful to computers and data through Telecom or a similar facility. People are very conscious of the need for privacy in relation to data that is collected and held by the Commonwealth. It is important that there be a determination to ensure that privacy, in view of the growing industry involving 'hackers' that we hear about in the United States. We are told that these operators have some sort of skill to break computer codes and security codes in order to obtain information. Also, because revenue implications are so often involved, it is important that security be a significant matter. Clearly, as is the case with all law, penalties can be imposed and they can be made significant, but at the end of the day the system can be protected only when the people involved in committing offences can be apprehended and dealt with. Also, a person needs to be apprehensive about committing an offence. The corollary of that is that if adequate penalties are not provided for, apprehension will not be of much use. The matter about which I want to speak and about which the Opposition has proposed significant amendments is the scheme to prohibit disclosure or discrimination against a person on the basis of a spent conviction, a quashed conviction or a conviction for which a person has received a pardon-a pardon which, as I understand it, does not go to the very fundamental issue of the conviction itself. The amendments also provide that, where a person is pardoned after having been wrongly convicted, he shall never be taken to have been convicted of the offence. I think that is appropriate. The amendments are designed to encourage and assist the rehabilitation of minor offenders who have not reoffended for 10 years, with the period being five years where the person is a juvenile, or where the person has had the benefit of a pardon or the quashing of a conviction. Except for that part of the Bill which deals with the Director of Public Prosecutions, in relation to which certain amendments are proposed, the legislation contains minor matters. The Bill deals with the Crimes (Aircraft Act) 1963 to ensure that airports owned by the Federal Airports Corporation are covered. It amends the Customs Act to harmonise provisions in relation to the Proceeds of Crime Act. It amends the Director of Public Prosecutions Act in several respects and the National Crime Authority Act to make the Chairman of the Authority more responsible for the general management of the National Crime Authority. As I indicated, the great bulk of this Bill has the support of the Opposition. My colleague the honourable member for Menzies ( Mr N. A. Brown) outlined that in some detail. I want to make some remarks about the concept of spent convictions, that is, those convictions because of which, it is suggested, people should not be discriminated against pecause of the effiuxion of time and in many cases because of the nature of the offences themselves. It is not it simple question to address. It was addressed over some time by the Law Reform Commission whose report maqe it clear that the Commission was concerned with the difficulties faced by former offenders arising out of their criminal records. But it recognised that any response needed to be appropriate and balanced because of the wider community interests that are involved. The Commission generally concluded that the difficulties it saw on both sides of the case could be addressed by minimising the negative consequences to attach to spent convictions so far as a criminal was concerned and by making it unlawful to discriminate unreasonably against a person on the basis of his or her criminal record. The Commission noted in the system which it formulated to deal with those matters that there should be certain exemptions in the public interest. This is the area in which the differences between the Opposition and the Government largely occur. These issues have been addressed over time. It is not the first time that the Commonwealth has dealt with them. If one looks at the Law Reform Commission's discussion papers and reports it becomes, clear that a number of countries-the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Canada, continental Europe, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and Pacific countries-have addresseq this question over time and have looked at ways of establishing schemes which limit the way convictions impact upon individuals. In some jurisdictions there are. requirements for records to be destroyed or sealed up-a significant change from that which is proposed here. Within Australia, Queensland, often seen to be behind other States in relation to legislation that might provide for rigllts of individuals, has been in the forefront. The Queensland Government has already introduced legislation to declare some convictions spent. In November 1986, the Criminal Law (Rehabilitation of Offenders) Act came into force, so the Law Reform Commission tells us. The Law Reform Commission of Western Australia has published a report for that State and the South Australian Attorney General's Department has issued a discussion paper. As I understand it, the New South Wales Privacy Committee has been active in this area also. So we have a background of experience, both abroad and here in Australia, where some attention has been given to this question. The Law Reform Commission, in its report Spent Convictions, raises these issues very clearly. Questions of privacy are involved, that is, the extent to which criminal records ought to be freely available within the community. The report notes that police forces throughout Australia often exchange criminal history information. With computerisation and centralisation of criminal records, a great deal of information about any offence committed, often many years ago, can be more readily available than people might imagine. With access to computers by hackers and the like, which we referred to earlier, there is always the possibility that even police records might ,not be altogether sacrosanct. We are aware that there are discriminatory practices very often based on race and gender. We have attempted to deal with those through Commonwealth and State. legislation. This is another area in which clear infringements of what some individuals might regard as their rights within a community can be affected because there still remains on their record, for criminal purposes, an activity in which they were involved many years ago where a conviction was recorded and about which any reasonable person would say, 'That is not a matter that ought to be taken into account'. When I was at law school I was very conscious that there were limits to the sorts of student activity in which I could be reasonably involved. If one Were to seek later to practice in the law, having a conviction recorded against one would most likely put at risk one's ability to practise. So sometimes even acts of youthful exuberance had to be constrained by the double jeopardy that might occur. It is not just in the area of young lawyers that this could happen. The Law Reform Commission's report states that taxi driving and various other trades might disqualify a person from being able to practise if it was discovered that an employee haQ a criminal record. The report mentions professioqal statutory bodies such as the Dental Board. The disqualification of people who are convicted of offences can sometimes be automatic, complete and unreviewable. These were the sorts of. issues that had to be addressed. There are other public issue questions which the Law Reform Commission report brought out. The need for freedom of expression is highly valued by all members of our community. People believe that they ought to be able to use information without undue interference or justification, particularly in the courts, the Parliament and similar areas. In the criminal investigation area there are law enforcement officers who believe that they need to be able to look at a person's record to be able to detect criminal activity and to look at people who might be likely to have committed offences in a particular area before. Records might be able to provide that information. Those records could also be the basis of making informed decisions about who are the best people to practise in a particular area. I have mentioned law but in other occupations and trades people believe that they have some right to look at people's antecedents in the widest possible sense to be able to make proper judgments about the suitability to work in those areas. Questions of administration of justice arise, that is, to what extent can the previous criminal activities of a person be taken into accountÂ· when it comes to imposing later sentences. These important issues were addressed by the Commission which attempted to put them in a meaningful way into the legislation before us. A matter that is of concern to the Opposition is that although in this legislation there is a system provided whereby, after 10 years in the case of an adult, or five years in the case of a minor, convictions will be said to be spent, there are a number of exclusions that quite properly have been taken into account. The first is the question of earlier offences. The point is made whether, if a person commits an offence at a later point in time, it is proper to take into account, when prosecuting or at sentencing, the earlier offences of which a person has been convicted. The second major exclusion relates generally to the whole. question of intelligence security or law enforcement bodies, in the area in which I have some responsibility for the Opposition, immigration and citizenship decisions, and in relation to Commonwealth employment where security assessments are made. Certain exemptions are contained in this legislation relating to those matters. question has been raised relating to bodies with responsibility to children being able to use spent conviction in assessing whether or not to employ a person to work amongst young people. It seems particularly relevant that if sexual offences or offences involving a minor are involved, even if they were a good while ago, some account should be taken of them. Then we had the general case of the regulations enabling further matters to be addressed. Knowing that there are a number of matters which ought to be addressed, some Of which were highlighted by the honourable member for Menzies, such as banks refusing employment to convicted bank robbers, the Opposition is saying that they might well be appropriate cases for consideration within the regulations. Rather than leaving a matter and waiting for people to find out later that they could have applied for an exemption, the matter should be given over to the Privacy Commissioner, as is proposed, but not on request; he should actually make the inquiry and identify those areas in which the Bill is too limited and put in place the appropriate regulations to prescribe these matters now. It seems to me that is not an unreasonable amendment as proposed by the Opposition. It ought to be supported and I hope, in the context of ensuring that we have the best possible legislation to give effect to the Law Reform Commission's report in this area, that the Attorney-General will look at the questions raised by the honourable member for Menzies and the specific proposals he will be making when we reach the committee stage, and give them the Government's support.",52
90,Dr CHARLESWORTH ,CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Perth) (6.11)I do not come to this debate on the Crimes Legislation Amendment Bill with any special credentials in the law. I suppose to many laymen like me the law is a very complex area and something that confuses them. Indeed, when we talk about computer law it becomes even more confusing because the mushrooming of computer technology and the changes that have occurred in recent years tend to bamboozle the mind. We are aware of the vulnerability of information in computer systems. Indeed, much of the legThe islation here relates to the widespread and growing reliance of modern society on computer systems, including computer systems for communication, and the need to protect those systems and, indeed, those communications. That the law be relevant to modern technology is something that is accepted on both sides of this House. That the expertise and the penalties should be appropriate in catching and punishing people who are involved in computer crime is something we would not dispute. My particular interest in this legislation came about because of the provisions for spent convictions. From time to time, all members of this place see constituents who have particular concerns. It was the concern of a particular constituent who was previously involved in an offence relating to drug use that brought this to my attention. This constituent has a conviction as a drug user, was trained as a medical technologist, and had particular difficulty in obtaining employment for a considerable period following this conviction even though there was no reoffending. I suppose it is that which brought this particular aspect of this legislation to my attention. The. question was raised by the honourable member for Menzies ( Mr N. A. Brown) of what happens in respect of the arsonist who wants fire insurance. I accept the proposal the hqnourable member put forward. Perhaps the arsonist was guilty of an offence for which the penalty was more than 30 months' imprisonment, which may mean that the legislation would not apply, but there are many other examples. I will be interested to hear the response of the Attorney-General ( Mr Lionel Bowen) with respect to this aspect of the legi-lation. My concern with my constituent was the discrimination that occurred as a result of the previous conviction. It is my hope that this legislation will go some way to redressing that undesirable situation. Clearly, in the area of drug rehabilitation, many of the people who are the best and most effective workers-many of them may be working for government agencies-are those who have previously been users and understand the very difficult problems involved in that area and the milieu in which the drug society operates. The National Crime Authority is also mentioned in the legislation. There are some amendments which will streamline its operation. During the time that this Government has been in office there have been considerable changes in the response of the Government to crime in this country. The establishment of the National Crime Authority in 1984 was a landmark in this area. Last year it was put on a permanent statutory basis. Indeed, the National Crime Authority has quite exceptional powers which are not permitted to police forces in this country and which impinge, in some ways, on the protection available to a person under common law. We might ask ourselves why this is the case. One aspect of the National Crime Authority's work is to assemble admissible evidence to secure convictions, and I suppose these powers are appropriate in that way. There has also been other legislation passed recently. The Proceeds of Crime Act 1987 imposed obligations on financial institutions and allowed for the pursuit of the money trail which is often involved in very intricate crimes and the sorts of crimes that we see being committed in this country day after day. The pursuit of the money trail is an important aspect of that. The Cash Transaction Reports Act 1988 followed the same process. We have a whole raft of legislation in this country that has gone through this place which is directed towards chasing criminals and punishing them for their crimes, but there has not being a significant amount of discussion on the policy which underlies some of the laws which seem to me, as a layman, indisputable in our system. The nub of what I want to say today relates to the activities of those who are involved in drug trading in this country. It is of concern to me, as a layman, that in a recent well publicised case in Western Australia one of the defendants was in receipt of legal aid. This was a very significant con-' spiracy hearing in Western Australia relating to heroin importation. It is a concern that we see in such cases significant delay, filibustering by defence counsel and the sorts of blockages that occur in our court system and the way in which it operates. When one looks at drug policy in this country one would have to say that our approach to the problem of drug abuse is very haphazard. In the nineteenth century all drugs were freely available and the knowledge that people had about drug abuse and drug usage was limited. It was not until 1905 that the importation of opium for smoking was outlawed in this country. That may have had a racial basis because it was seen as being the province of the Chinese who were in Australia at the time. For whatever reason, in 1905 the importation of opium for smoking was criminalised. Generally, after that, policy in Australia followed international conventions. After the First World War there was the Hague convention which outlined the usage of opium, morphine, heroin and cocaine. Those drugs were to be available only for medical purposes. It was not until 1953 that heroin was outlawed, following a recommendation of the World Health Organisation. Indeed, it was not even available in this country for medical purposes, and that remains the case today. There have been various conventions since then which have sought to bring together all of our approaches. Indeed, the United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs in 1961 was thought to do that. At the time, the only considerable problem of drug abuse existed in the United States. It was believed at the time that within the following couple of decades this problem would be brought under control. Of course, the evidence shows that is not the case. In fact, there has been a growing demand and requirement for all sorts of illegal drugs ever since then, and it is clear to anyone who looks at the problem that our policy has failed; that our policy of restricting availability of drugs and of declarsignificantly ing drugs to be illegal has been a failure. I am not carrying the flag for any particular position, but I would say that there is not a simple solution. I have heard it said that for every difficult problem there is a simple solution, but that is usually wrong. In the case of drug abuse that is clearly true. What we need is a more rational approach, a less emotional approach, and an approach that does not contain the mythology that presently crosses the debate about what should and should not be legal and what our policy should be. Clearly, the policy is sistent and its aims are unsure. One can be punished for being in possession of drugs and for trafficking. Some drugs are clearly dangerous and some are less dangerous. In fact, some of the more dangerous drugs may be legal and some of the less dangerous drugs may be illegal. Is there a moral difference between a person who seeks to make money from selling legal drugs and a person who seeks to make money from selling illegal drugs? In a sense, I do not think there is. The illegal drug seller may try to defraud the Commonwealth of taxation revenue and, therefore, that is an offence which should be pursued but, in the sense that there is damage to society, I believe that all these practices should be placed together. Clearly, the problems associated with legal drugs-alcohol and tobacco-in a health perspective are much greater than those associated with those drugs that we see as being illegal. The report of the Joint Select Committee on the National Crime Authority entitled Drugs, Crime and Society looked into these questions. Mr MACKellar-A good report. Dr CHARLE8WORTH-The honourable member for Warringah was a member of that Committee, and it is interesting to look at some of the Committee's recommendations. The summary of that report put forward a number of options, one being harsher penalties. It was recommended that we penalise more and enforce more; that we should chase those people. However, as I said, clearly 20 years of increased enforcement and increased penalties has not affected the supply of these substances. It has had some effect on the price-it has made the supply of drugs more profitable-but it is hard to see that supply or availability has been affected by those who want these substances. The harsher penalties option was discarded by the Joint Committee. It cited overseas experience, and I believe it was accurate in doing so. Five options were outlined, another of which was decriminalisation. Indeed, the Committee suggested that there were problems in that regard. Given my reading of the report, it does not appear that the Committee could come up with a good reason why that option should not be pursued with regard to cannabis. Regarding cannabis usage incon- in this country-and I will mention some figures in that respect later-I believe that the Committee's suggestion holds some credibility. It looked at the British experience and the possibility of making illegal drugs available on prescription and talked about some of the difficulties there. There was the option of licensing users, similar to the way in which we license those who wish to use firearms at present. The concern, of course, was that this would lead to an increase in the usage of these substances which, the mythology tells us, are very dangerous. However, much of the research and information acquired on a clinical basis suggests that some drugs are not as dangerous as people would suggest. The fifth option that the Committee considered was regulation involving availability under strict controls with a ban on the commercial sale and advertising of these substances. Again, there was concern that that might increase usage, and it raised difficulties as to where one draws the line. Does one draw the line at heroin or does one include cocaine and amphetamines and other substances? That is not clear, but what is clear if one reads the report and considers all the evidence is that what we have been doing has not worked and a considerable review of our policy in that area is required. We have been trying to increase the penalties and throwing resources into this area, but I do not believe we have been having success. The principal concern for some of us, including me, is - that a move by any government to legalise many of the substances that are presently illegal will lead to an increase in usage. I believe that that argument is valid in some areas but not in others. However, it is a concern, one that we must consider seriously. Perhaps we need more information in that area,. or perhaps trial studies are required, but one can see many benefits in such a policy. At present our legal system is blocked up with drug offences. We have large numbers of people in gaol as a result of drug offences. There is great concern about enforcement and the corruption of the judiciary and the police force. The Fitzgerald Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct in Queensland provides examples, but we find it everywhere. There is concern about the health problems associated with the habit of intravenous drug use. Indeed, it is the illegality of these substances which puts up the price and makes intravenous use almost essential if drug users are to get their money's worth. It makes chasing the dragon, or smoking these substances, less desirable and less possible. An enormous amount of petty crime and prostitution is associated with the need to support one's habit. So we can see many advantages from the move to make these substances legal. We can also see problems, and they are problems about which we require more information. We need an expanded amount of public information. The public debate need not be about who to blame; it needs to be about whether or not we can find a solution, and we have to try new and perhaps more radical things. If one-third of the population smokes cannabis-as has been suggested recently by an expert in that area-and if we have laws against that practice, we must ask ourselves, 'Why are these people flying in the face of the legal system?'. We must ask ourselves whether or not that law is appropriate. I think most people ask that the law be consistent and, indeed, see it as being inconsistent. It is clear that a great deal of money is to be earnt from making cannabis available. At present an ounce of cannabis is worth more than an ounce of gold. Considerable amounts of money are involved. Because this substance is illegal, the cannabis culture has been driven underground. Supply restrictions have increased the price and have made the profits more attractive, and those who are involved in growing and selling these substances are, of course, encouraged. Because cannabis is so expensive, it is likely that people will substitute other drugs. That leads to intravenous use, which we see as more dangerous. Dr Alex Wodak, the Director of the Drug and Alcohol Unit at Sydney's St Vincents Hospital, said: It is time to admit that our existing policies have not worked, are not working and will never work. As I said, whether one-third of the population or only 10 per cent, if one wants to be conservative, is using this substance, it is clear that our policy, our initiatives and our perspectives in that area are blurred and need to be changed. The West Australian of today, under the heading 'AMA backs heroin summit', refers to a more complex and difficult issue for some people, that is, hard drugs. We find the Australian Medical Association (AMA) of all bodies suggesting that a summit be held on this matter. I say that the AMA's suggestion that a summit might be appropriate is a landmark decision by such a conservative body. We find John Coombes, QC, the Vice-President of the New South Wales Bar Association, pressing for legalisation. We do not have here a group of ratbag drug users suggesting these reforms; we have people, I suggest, who have the qualifications and the understanding to make it a sensible and necessary reappraisal policy. It IS time for us, when we consider this legislation, to endorse enforcement and alties in a new area but equally it is time us to consider a new focus in an area that we have pushed aside and under the carpet and do not want to discuss, the area of drug policy. I hope that the debate can be informed and substantial and that we can push towards some sort of bipartisan apcomputer proach because it is my view that it is the effort. purpose of us in the Parliament sometimes to lead public opinion rather than follow For too long the easy option has been to follow the debate rather than lead it.",55
91,Deus ex machina,CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,Sitting suspended from 6.31 to 8 p.m.,59
92,Mr MACKELLAR ,CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Warringah) (8.00)In speaking to the Crimes Legislation corporate Amendment Bill 1989, I support my colaspect league the honourable member for Menzies ( Mr N. A. Brown), who gave general supwork port to the Bill, subject only to a number significant amendments he has proposed which are intended to remove possible injuslinks tices and improve the effectiveness of legislation. I hope that the Attorney-General ( Mr Lionel Bowen) will accept the amendcient ments in the spirit in which they have been proffered. The main provisions of the legislation to modernise aspects of the law to enable to combat modern crime. One of the fascicomputing nating aspects of modern crime is computer crime. When we look at computer crime we find that there is a low incidence of convicwas tions, and one wonders why that is so. Some people may speculate that this reflects rate of detection or disclosure. It could argued that the low rate of disclosure is because of corporate or agency embarrassacross ment when these things come to the fore. believe that increasing vigilance will be needed to combat this type of crime in the future. Well-publicised hacking escapades recent years and the ease with which called secure computer systems have been penetrated has left the general public and many people in the business community with the disquieting conviction that much of this crime remains undetected and undisclosed. I mention briefly some of the recent major examples of computer crimes. An article of the Age of 16 August 1987 reported that a young West German hacker had successfully broken into a top secret world-wide compenputer network connecting the National Aerfor onautical Space Administration centre with its counterparts in France, Germany, Switzerland and Japan. The youth in this case our admitted to using what the hackers call a 'Trojan Horse' program to penetrate the system and this had been used to access 135 centres world-wide-a fairly major The second instance was quoted in the it. Australian of 20 September 1988, when that newspaper reported that a major inquiry in 1986 by the Victorian Bureau of Criminal Investigation had found evidence that Australia's banking system may have been infiltrated by an international network of hackers. The particularly worrying of that inquiry was that., despite having found evidence of an international netof bulletin boards-these are the new of phrases that people have to get used toincluding a West German operation with into Eastern European countries, the the inquiry was said to have been wound down because the authorities did not have suffiinvestigative expertise. That is a very worrying aspect of these crimes. In many cases, the people carrying out the crimes are seek young people who have a much greater fait cility, expertise and understanding of the industry and its ramifications than have the people investigating the crimes. The third example I would like to mention reported in the Sydney Morning Herald of 7 November 1988, when it reported that a low a computer virus was launched by a New be York computer science student, who eventually infected and crippled 6,000 computers America, including defence facilities I and universities. In what might be a related matter, it is interesting to note an Australian National University report of 11 November of last year of a virus which had been found in soseveral of its computer programs. The Australian newspaper of 17 January 1989 reported on the concern of authorities world-wide of evidence of successful hacking into America's banks and strategic corporations. On 18 January it reported that bulletin boards-an aspect that I have already menin tioned-had been found in Victoria containing confidential details of more than 1,200 American Express, Mastercard, Visa and Bankcard holders. These examples largely relate to the hacking of information by computer buffs. But they also raise the possibility-in fact, the probability-that many Â·of these computer crimes may involve some degree of unauthorised disclosure by employees within targeted corporations and agencies. An example of unauthorised disclosure which has just come to my notice is particularly disturbing because it not only involves another case of maladministration of the Australian tax file number but also shows an unacceptable degree of carelessness by a Commonwealth employee. I quote from a letter from a constituent who wrote to me: This letter concerns the claimed confidentiality of our Tax File Number System. It also invites attention to the general efficiency of our Tax Office. On 13 March 1989 I wrote to the Tax Office with a request for copies of my 1982-83 and 1983-84 assessments. I stated I needed them by 5 April 1989 for use in my hearing before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal on 17 April 1989 in a matter. Despite a follow-up telephone call on 7 April 1989, I did not receive the information until 18 May 1989. So much for Tax Office efficiency. Whilst that is disturbing for the particular constituent, the next part of the letter really discloses the matter which I would like to bring before the Parliament tonight and which causes me a very great deal of concern. My constituent wrote to me in these terms: The main aspect that worries me can be seen in the enclosed copy of a computer print-out which contains not only the information of one of the years I sought, but also names, addresses, financial details and Tax File Numbers of seven other taxpayers. Apart from the loss of privacy involved, the potential for fraud if this got into the wrong hands is obvious. I have in front of me the computer printout, minus the names, which I have taken off, of the people involved. I would like to bring it to the attention of the Parliament because it is a very disturbing issue. The computer print-out deals with the individual's credit assessment. It talks about the job sequence, the file number, the issue date, the taxable income of the people named, the debits that they have incurred in the period until this paper was sent out, the credits that they have available to themthe Australian Taxation office knows all this information-the balances and adjustments, the arrears, the debit or credit, the final balance, plus the names and addresses of the people involved. This information was sent from the Taxation Office to my constituent. It is absolutely appalling that such information should be made available. I take it-I am giving a charitable view to the situation-that this was a mistake. But consider for a minute the ramifications of a mistake such as this. As my constituent, in his letter to me, says: Apart from the loss of privacy involved, the potential for fraud if this got into the wrong hands is obvious. This is the Taxation Office, the office which takes a very harsh view of individual taxpayers who in some instances fall into arrears to make some mistake. It is very hard to convince the Taxation Office that people can make a genuine mistake in any aspect of their dealings with that office. One can understand that but, having sought that sort of compliance from the taxpayers, one would expect that the Taxation Office would apply the same standards to itself and its officers. The tax file number has been t\1e subject of a great deal of criticism, and rightly so, because we have seen instances around Australia of tax file numbers being sent to people who have been dead for some time or to the wrong addresses. They have been sent in situations which have caused a great deal of concern. I have the evidence before me. I would seek permission from the Attorney General to table the document so that all honourable members can see the sort of information it contains.",59
93,Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Yes, I do not mind the document being tabled. But you do not want it printed?",60
94,Mr MACKELLAR,CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,I do not want to print it; I want to table it. Leave granted.,60
95,Mr MACKELLAR,CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I thank the House. I make the point that I have removed from the document the tax file details and the names and addresses of the people concerned. But it is a pluperfect example of the way in which this system can fall into disrepute. Apart from anything else, it is an absolutely classic example of the inefficiem;y of the Taxation Office. I can only say in relation to computer crimes that one would have some 'real concern that, with information such as this-and it is obviously a computer printout-people can get access to it even without seeking it. My constituent was not seeking information about other people; he was seeking information about his own situation. But what about those people who have mischief in their minds who seek details of other people's ,predit ratings; of other people's taxable ies; of the degree of arrears or credit in which they find themselves at any time? The point is that this is a classic example of a tremendous breakdown in the system which the ,Commissioner of Taxation and his office assured us would be administered in the very best of traditions, that privacy would be protected and that there would be no slip-ups, et cetera. The fact of the matter is that this is a clear demonstration of inefficiency, and I hope that it is nothing worse than inefficiency. As I have already stated, while the careless release of confidential information does not have the same criminal or mischievous intention of the hacker, the end result ,can be the same-the serious invasion and the potential for misuse of private and confidential information. Whilst computers have been a tremendous boon to civilisation, to people around the world, at the same time they have opened up the possibilities for crime and all sorts of aspects of anti-social behaviour. In this instance, with the degree of secrecy and confidentiality that must accrue to and be placed upon the Taxation Office, we have a clearly demonstrated example of a lack of confidentiality, of misuse of information, of an unauthorised release of unsought for information, of an invasion of privacy, and of an opening up of people to all sorts of aspects of criminal behaviour. From my readings of the Crimes Act and the amending legislation under consideration-and I am not a lawyer-it is not clear whether such disclosures by a Federal employee,are an offence under the Crimes Act. As the Attorney-General is seated at the table I would welcome his comments on this matter. But I certainly think the situation is serious enough for the whole matter to be investigated by some committee. I would like to see it investigated by a committee of the Parliament because more and more people are coming to my office-and we have reports from around Australia-expressing concern about the Taxation Office's administration of the tax file number system. Here is a clear example of how that system has broken down, and how that office needs to be sharply pulled into gear if it is to regain in any way the trust of the Australian people. I think some other aspects of the Bill salarbefore us deserve some comment. I note that Queensland has conducted a trial spent convictions program since 1986 and its success, together with an Australian Law Reform Commission report, is the basis for a broadly uniform Australian scheme. This legislation implements the Commonwealth's responsibilities. I support the Bill for that reason. I support the Bill for humanitarian reasons because I think people, having been convicted and having paid the price for their transgressions, should not be unfairly discriminated against in later life if they are genuinely rehabilitated. Of course, I point out that the coalition is seeking to make a number of important amendments because there is a 'proper concern that the legislation will 'allow a convicted person to claim 'on oath or otherwise' that he or she was riot charged or convicted with the offence. I think the exemptions are too limited and, of course, there is the - etail of the Privacy Commission. The other aspects of the Bill concern the Director of Public Prosecutions, with its war crimes implications; the Australian Customs Service, with similar provisions to those in the Proceeds of Crime' Act; and the National Crime Authority (NCA) where the Chairman of the National Crime Authodty is to have management responsibility over the National Crime Authority. There have been some problems with the National Crime Authority. I am sure that the Attorney-General, who is sitting at the table, would agree with me privately that the question of the choosing or the gaining of acceptance for the position of the Chairman of the National Crime Authority has been a difficult one. I make no comment about the eventual appointment, except to wish the next Chairman great success in his major responsibilities. But I think a lot of work has to be done in terms of the administration of the National Crime Authority. I think there are great opportunities for tightening the administration of that body. I hope that the next Chairman of the NCA-and this is no criticism of the present Chairman-will accept that position in the understanding, and with the commitment, that we have an extremely important body within Australia which needs close attention, strong management and tight administration. To see the Chairman of the NCA having that management responsibility, I think is a step forward. I come back to the question of the release of tax file numbers and individual financial details of Australian citizens by the Taxation Office. I consider it a major indiscretion, to say the very least, by the Taxation Office. I believe that it is worthy of the most stringent investigation because Australians want to believe that their personal details that they have been told are private will remain private. They want to believe, they should believe, and they should be able to expect, that personal details that they supply to the Taxation Office will be kept private. They should be able to expect that access to those details will be minimal and will be closely guarded. All the evidence suggests that none of those aspects of their belief can be taken seriously at present. One cannot expect the Australian taxpayer to be totally frank with the Taxation Commissioner if the Taxation Commissioner cannot protect the privacy of those monetary details which are so important and so much a part of an Australian citizen's everyday life. I think this is one of the most disturbing letters containing some of the most disturbing evidence of maladministration that has come before me as a member of parliament for nearly 20 years. I hope that the Attorney-General and the Treasurer ( Mr Keating) will take the matter as seriously as I certainly take it. Again I hope that this matter can be investigated by a parliamentary committee to make sure that nothing like this can ever occur again in the future.",60
96,Mr BRUMBY ,CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Bendigo) (8.19)-Tonight I will be speaking only briefly to the Crimes Legislation Amendment Bill as I think there has been a fair canvassing of most of the issues contained in it. I appreciate the broad support which has been indicated for the Bill. I take this opportunity simply to make a few brief comments about this Bill and about the Government's overall efforts in relation to its attack on crime and, in particular, organised crime in Australia. I think it is true to say that over the past six years the Hawke Government has developed a range of laws and strategies to tackle crime, particularly, as I say, organised crime. We have significantly increased Commonwealth resources in the fight against crime; we have toughened relevant legislation; we have created new legislative and enforcement agencies, and we have certainly better targeted the efforts of existing agencies. In addition, through legislation such as the Proceeds of Crime Bill and the legislation before us today, we have tried to affirm that expression, that aphorism, that crime does not pay. I shall take a few minutes to run through some of the initiatives that we have taken to tackle crime in Australia. I will start with the Australian Federal Police (AFP). Over the past few years the Government's clear aim has been to enable the Australian Federal Police successfully to discharge its role as the premier law enforcement agency of the Commonwealth. This has involved a gradual shedding of certain functions which do not either support or enhflnce the focusing on what we might call first-class investigative work. To that end, some 900 personnel involved in guarding consulates, Parliament House and other public venues have been transferred to' the Australian Protective Service. Uniform policing at certain airports is also in the process of being transferred to the States to allow a more integrated response by State police forces to any major incident. This refocusing of the Australian Federal Police nationally has allowed us to present both police and Public Service members with a challenge to engage in what could be described as a new type of policing. Perhaps the most innovative use of AFP personnel has been in the appointment of overseas liaison officers in such places as Buenos Aires, Bangkok, Manila, Hong Kong, Islamabad, Singapore, Washington and Cyprus. I am reminded that only last year Operation Clinker led to the interception of 43 kilos of heroin destined for Australia and the . arrest of seven persons in Australia in a joint operation involving AFP liaison officers in Manila, Bangkok and Hong Kong as well as the Royal Hong Kong Police. So in general I think we can say that we have shifted the Australian Federal Police towards a more pro-active policing. Certainly that is producing results. The second major initiative that we have taken in the fight against crime and organised crime was the establishment of the National Crime Authority (NCA). The National Crime Authority was established with a sunset clause in 1984, but by agreement of this Parliament and all State governments it was put on a permanent basis with a statutory charter last year. This was an important indication of confidence in this somewhat extraordinary national and Federal law enforcement body, vested as it is with exceptional powers which are not permitted to other police forces in this country. Certainly it is my view that the NCA has been a success, given that its special powers are activated only when a matter involving the most serious offences has proven intractable to other police methods and perhaps in many cases which have been unresolved for many decades. Earlier in the debate, the honourable member for MCEwen ( Mr Cleeland) referred to the Cornwell-Bull drug trafficking syndicate. I am reminded of a recent speech by the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) in which he pointed out that the National Crime Authority put the Cornwell-Bull drug trafficking syndicate out of business and that it also obtained convictions of significant figures under two of its other references. The terms of imprisonment imposed on Cornwell and Â·Bull of 23 years and 18 years respectively indicate the gravity with which the courts viewed their activities. Terms of imprisonment of 24 years and 20 years have been imposed on principals under another reference and the maximum term of imprisonment available for the tax fraud offence concerned, three years, has been imposed on the principal under a third reference. Numerous other matters are before the courts at the moment. The third way in which we have assisted the fight against crime in Australia is through the establishment of the Director of Public Prosecutions. That decision has streamlined the Government's prosecution system, overcoming deficiencies in earlier arrangements which were noted, amongst others, by the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union in its fourth interim report. The fourth thing we have done is better targeted the efforts of the Australian Customs Service. We have done that particularly in relation to intercepting illicit drugs entering Australia. Fifthly, we introduced the proceeds of crime and the cash transactions legislation which enable enforcement agencies in Australia not only to better track the money trail of organised crime, but also, having done that, to confiscate the ill-gotten gains of committed criminals. Overall, if we look through those five initiatives-they are not exclusive-we can see that the Government has set an impressive record in its efforts against organised crime. Those efforts are being assisted by the legislation before the House. There has been considerable discussion of the measure before the House and I do not propose to go into it in great detail. I simply make a few points about the question of pecuniary penalties, the question of fines, in this legislation. Clause 6 amends section 4B of the Crimes Act. The proposed amendment introduces a formula for the calculation of the maximum pecuniary penalty for an offence against the law of the Commonwealth where a maximum term 6f imprisonment only is mentioned in the section. So importantly, at the discretion of the court, on sentencing Â·the pecuniary penalty will be either an alternative to or an addition to the imprisonment. That is a significant change to be introduced by this legislation. The formula correlates a maximum financial penalty for natural persons of $3,000 for every six months imprisonment. In relation to the body corporate the existing five times multiplier applies so that the ratio is $15,000 in fines for every six months of imprisonment. Importantly also, where life imprisonment is specified as the maximum penalty, the maximum financial penalty will be $200,000. I should say in support of the amendments in this Bill that the proposed amendment contained in clause 6 certainly will enhance the sentencing discretion of the court byÂ· providing for a pecuniary penalty either as an alternative or in addition to imprisonment. At present it is only an alternative, so the Bill toughens the penalties by giving the court the option of an addition or an alternative. As I have said, this allows for a mixed custodial-pecuniary penalty. Section 4B simplifies for the Parliament any future adjustment of the ratio between the maximum term of imprisonment and the maximum alternative or additional pecuniary penalty, as only the formula needs to be changed. The proposal to provide for either an alternative or an additional pecuniary penalty is in line with recent legislative practice in this Parliament. I refer to the Crimes Act section 7A, relating to inciting; section 29D relating to fraud; and section 86A, in relation to conspiracy to defraud' the Commonwealth. The other point I would make in relation to this clause is that the tripling of the ratio of the maximum term of imprisonment to pecuniary penalty is recommended by the Gibbs Review of Commonwealth Criminal Law, in part to reflect the changes in money values since 1982 when the present ratio was set. I conclude by giving a couple of examples under the new legislation. For instance, under the present section 4B, if a natural person is given a maximum term of imprisonment of five years, his maximum financial penalty will be $10,000 and that for a corporation will be $50,000. Under the proposed amendment before the House, for a natural person, again with the same term of maximum imprisonment, five years, the financial penalty will be $30,000 and for a body corporate it will be $150,000, three times higher. I will give another example. Under the present section 4B if a person is given a maximum term of life imprisonment, the maximum pecuniary penalty is nil and for a body corporate it is nil. Under these proposed amendments before the House, if the maximum term is life, the maximum a penalty for person will be $200,000, and if it is a body corporate it will be $lm. So there is a significant toughening of those penalties and, as I say, this amendment pro-' vides that they can be provided in the future as an addition to a custodial sentence and not as in the past where they have simply been an alternative to a custodial sentence. This legislation is good legislation. It is broadly supported in the House. It is yet another piece of legislation introduced by this Government which certainly indicates the bona fides of this Government in its fight against crime and organised crime. It is one of a number of measures we have taken to step up the Commonwealth's activities against crime, particularly organised crime, in relation to the money trail. I support the legislation and commend it to the House.",62
97,Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Kingsford Smith-Attorney-General) (8.31 )-in reply-I thank all honourable members who participated in this debate, which has been wide ranging and very constructive. At the outset I pay tribute to the work of the Gibbs Review of Commonwealth Criminal Law. We invited Sir Harry Gibbs to participate in this exercise. He is a very skilful lawyer. It just shows the advantages of using people who, while they might be deemed to be in retirement, still have much to offer. I am indebted to the Gibbs committee, and in particular to Sir Harry Gibbs for his effort in computer crime definition. The matter has been before the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General, or SCAG, for some time. The States have considered introducing legislation and some have. There is the view that pormal offences or larceny, theft, forgery, fraud or malice could be deemed to be sufficient to deal with computer crime, but I think that this analysis, this definition, is very good and I am sure that it will be looked at with interest not only in Australia but elsewhere. The Opposition has raised other matters. The honourable member for Menzies ( Mr N. A. Brown) quite properly foreshadowed three amendments. I will briefly deal with the first amendment, although we will be going into committee. We are waiting on a report about what might be deemed to be exemptions. We expect that report to be available from the Privacy Commissioner within 12 months. Clause 2, subclause (2) states: Section 10 commences on a day to be fixed by Proclamation, but if that section does not commence within' the period of 12 months on the day on which this Act receives the Royal Assent, it commences on the first day after the end of that period. We are trying to say that the amendment, as drafted by the Opposition, is on the basis that there is a definite period of 12 months. We are of the view .that the Privacy Commissioner might well make his recommendations within a period of 12 months, so we want it proclaimed before that period. On that basis we are unable to accept the amendment because we feel that the sooner it can be proclaimed after the Commissioner, has reported, the better. We have received advice that he will complete his task within the 12-month period. The Opposition's amendment (2) is also not acceptable because it would not permit a person to say that he had not been convicted or charged. The honourable member for Menzies quite fairly said that there would be circumstances where people ought to be entitled to know what has happened to people with whom they are doing business. He particularly mentioned a bank employee who might have robbed a bank, or a person in the insurance area who might have been guilty of arson. We make the point that the scheme is related to what are deemed to be minor offences. In other words, the definition clause says those offences must be minor and not carry a sentence any greater than 30 months. So the examples that the honourable member mentioned, of bank robbery or arson, would attract penalties of 10 years or more. They are really not the same types of offences. I think that if the honourable member agrees 'with us on that basis he might not wish to pursue that amendment. As he said, there are exemptions outlined in the Bill. If a person is convicted of a sexual offence against children he would not be able to get certain employment because of the exemptions there; in other words, there has to be disclosure of those matters. We are anxious that the scheme be looked at on the basis that they are relatively minor offences. There is a period of rehabilitation of five years minors and 10 years for adults. We think that the purpose of that is adequately covered in the Bill. The third amendment which the honourable member foreshadowed relates to the question of ex officio indictments. He raises the issue in respect of the war crimes legislation and the fact that, notwithstanding anything contained in the legislation, the Di- tion. rector of Public Prosecutions may institute a prosecution of a person on indictment. I agree with him and I will accept the amendment. I make the point in terms of the war crimes legislation that we are the only nation that has produced legislation such as this which virtually guarantees committal proceedings. In other words, witnesses would be brought here and would be subjected to cross examination. The Americans have not done it but the Canadians will be following our precedent, as is the United Kingdom. I would not want people to think that if there are to be any trials in re-pect of the war crimes legislation-and that is still not known-it would not be in the normal course of committal proceedings and there would be no question of ex officio indictments unless the accused had another view about wanting to deal with it. At this stage I think the honourable gentlemen's proposition is quite fair and reasonable and I will accept it. Other matters were raised in the course of the debate such as what was happening in Queensland. Queensland introduced in 1986 a similar law to remove the convictions after a period in certain circumstances. Western Australia was also mentioned. It introduced legislation last year and has been advertising regarding submissions for exemptions. The Commonwealth Privacy Commissioner is seeking submissions from the public, including all employer organisations, as to what sorts of exemptions may be needed. I think we have a scheme which will meet the needs of what was deemed to be essential particularly by the Australian Law Reform Commission. Where people have been rehabilitated-honourable members will notice that the Queensland legislation talks about rehabilitation-there is no need for them to carry the burden of a conviction which might well be unnecessary because they have been rehabilitated. The Law Refor form Commission dealt with this matter on that basis. The Commission concluded that if we want people to disclose their previous convictions, it ought to be done by specific legislation. It stated: The Commission has concluded that the appropriate legislative response should be to provide that there be no obligation to disclose a spent conviction. If, for some particular reason, the obligation is needed, it should have to be established expressly by legislaWe are virtually doing that here by way of exemptions, and also the definition guarantees that the offences will be of a limited seriousness. We then had Ii wide-ranging discussion as to what is wrong with the world and problems generally. The honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth) was anxious to talk about computer offences, their extent, and the fact that they are increasing. We all acknowledge that. He also talked about the problems of drugs in society and whether cannabis should be legalised. These are issues on which society will eventually form an opinion. All addiction is probably deleterious, no matter whether it is just alcohol itself. I think society is generally concerned about young people whose lives have been destroyed and the fact that a criminal element might get them addicted for reasons that relate to the benefit of the criminal class. It is certainly getting more prolific, dangerous and damaging not only to .the people concerned but to society. It is not just limited to cannabis or heroin; it is an addiction that can relate to any form of drug, particularly cocaine and a number of pharmaceuticals. Having to service a habit leads to all sorts of other very serious crime-and this is quite apart from the destruction of the human being. Heroin destroys the body cells. Cannabis is not necessarily harmless, and one addiction can lead to the other. Studies of this offence have established that most heroin addicts started on cannabis. That does not mean that all people using cannabis will necessarily do that-and I am not here to preach what is right or wrong in relation to people's behaviour. However, this is a problem of, great concern to the community. Whilst the medical profession is now considering whether there might be a method by which drugs can be distributed to addicts, there is the concern that they might in turn encourage other people to become addicts. This is a very difficult area and I appreciate the concern expressed by honourable members. I known that society itself will continually have to deal with these matters. Suffice it to say that some praise must be given to people who do not succumb to addiction, as it is those people on whom we rely for society to operate in the way that it does. People addicted to drugs bring problems to society in terms of ill health, behaviour and integrity. This affects their ability to carrying out the normal functions that most taxpayers have to perform. One could say that if we could get rid of all these addictions we probably could reduce taxesbut that is probably oversimplifying the matter. The other matter that the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr MACKellar) mentioned is certainly of interest. He referred to the tax file number; I do not want to say that he is not correct. But what I think he tabled was a 1984 printout of the Australian Taxation Office. The matter should never have happened and the honourable member wants it investigated. I think the best thing for him to do would be to send the matter to the Privacy Commissioner who can look at it. Certainly, this may well be an offence under section 70 of the Crimes Act. However, I think this would have to involve intent and also whether there was any other offence under section 16 of the income tax Act. I respectively suggest that the honourable member draw this matter to the attention of the Privacy Commissioner. The appropriate legislation is not under my control; it is under the control of the Treasurer ( Mr Keating). However, the Privacy Commissioner is under my jurisdiction, to some extent. If the honourable member wants any assistance in this regard, I will be happy to give it to him. The honourable member for Warringah then expressed the view that the National Crime Authority needed to be effectively equipped with personnel, and particularly in regard to leadership. I place on record the commendable service given by all members of the Authority and to those who are due to retire, including Mr Justice Stewart, Mr Peter Clark and Mr Lionel Robberds. A valid point was made by the honourable member for Bendigo ( Mr Brumby) that it was necessary to give the National Crime Authority some permanency. It is certainly more confident now that Parliament recently removed what was called the sunset clause. Any authority that is set up on the basis of operating for, say a three-year trial period does not necessarily feel that it has a future. I might point out that the legislation was drawn on the basis that perhaps we can always attract a member of the bench to be a chairperson. 1 find that impossible in practice, for the following. reason: as the honourable member for Warringah said, there was some discussion in the newspaper about who might be chairperson. We approached a number of the judges. Many of them would have been interested, but their chief justices were not prepared to release any of them.",64
98,Mr NA BROWN ,CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Quite right, too.",67
99,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"The honourable member says that they are quite right-and 1 will not disagree. However, it means that the National Crime Authority Act is drawn on a premise that we will never be able to fulfil in the future. The answer to the question of whether we can get a judge to act as chairperson is no. So, we have obtained the services of a learned silk-and I am sure that the honourable member for Menzies ( Mr N. A. Brown) would not disagree with EmptyHere Faris, a distinguished member of the Melbourne Bar, has agreed to do the job for three years. This will involve a financial sacrifice. People in this position have to go back to the Bar and pick' up the goodwill in terms of practice which has been in some sort of limbo for three years. All of these people make such sacrifices-and that has to be understood. He will be a most excellent appointment, and two other vacancies are to be filled. As the honourable member knows, they will be filled as a result of recommendations made by Police Ministers and also the Attorneys-General. But it is still not easy to .attract personnel. The National Crime Authority has done a very good job, and I am sure that it will continue to do first-class work in relation to criminal detection, particularly criminal intelligence-this intelligence work relating to criminal behaviour, particularly through the money trail. That is the issue that ought to be looked at. Whilst the comments made in this regard do not really seem to fit within the ambit of this legislation, nevertheless the comments were valid in relation to what we are doing about crime. 1 hope that the remarks that 1I have made to some extent answer the concerns of honourable members. 1 think I have dealt with all the issues that have been raised. 1 thank all honourable members for their contributions to the debate. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee The Bill. Clause 1 agreed to. Clause 2 (Commencement).",67
100,Mr NA BROWN ,CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Menzies) (8.46)-I move: (I) Clause 2, pages I and 2, omit subclause (2), substitute the following subclauses: ""(2) Subject to subsections (2A) and (2B), section 10 commences on a day to be fixed by Proclamation. . ""(2A) For the purposes of subsection (2B), only, section 10 commences, only with respect to actions taken or events occurring pursuant to that section, on the day on which this Act receives the Royal Assent. ""(2B) The day fixed by Proclamation for the commencement of section 10 shall not be a day earlier than the day after all of the following have occurred: (a) the Privacy Commissioner has given advice to the Minister under paragraph 85zz (I) (b) of the Crimes Act 1914 with respect to those persons who should be excluded from the application of Division 3 of Part VIIc of that Act; (b) regulations have been made under paragraph 85zZH (k) of the Crimes Act 1914 prescribing those persons or bodies, to whom, for a prescribed purpose and in relation to a conviction for a prescribed offence, Division 3 of Part VIIc of that Act does not apply; (c) in accordance with section 48 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901, the regulations referred to in paragraph (2A) (b) of this Act have been laid before each House of the Parliament and the period during which such regulations may be disallowed or be deemed to have been disallowed has expired, without the regulations having been disallowed by either House or having been deemed to be disallowed; and (d) the period of12 months beginning on the day on which this Act receives the Royal Assent has expired."". This amendment relates to the spent convictions scheme. At the outset, 1 want to make it clear-if it was not made clear beforethat the Opposition supports the thrust of the scheme as set out in the legislation. The general notion of the spent convictions scheme is that convictions recorded against people in the past should not be held against them for ever and a day. In other words, there should come a point-which, in the case of adults, is 10 years after the event;where the line is drawn and the decision made that a conviction recorded against a person in the past should now not be held as an obstacle to that person's obtaining employment, or something of that sort. In other words, a person should be able to go free in the world without the stain on his or her character that might otherwise be said to be there. . The Bill acknowledges that exceptions must be made to that general rule. I mentioned during the second reading debate one of the obvious exceptions. For instance, it might be found that someone applying for a job with a child minding agency may have been convicted of a sexual offence or of an offence where the victim was a minor. In such circumstances, it would be very clear that one could not draw a line and forget about the conviction that is recorded against that individual. The child minding agency or the school would be quite entitled, both on general principle and under the terms of this Bill, to take that conviction into account when refusing to give employment to that person. Both under the Bill and consistent with common sense and general principle, the person, unfortunately for him or her, would not be able to mount a case of discrimination before the Privacy Commission. The point is that many other cases clearly should be the subject of an exclusion. It is not just those cases set out in the Bill that are justifiable and sensible exclusions. All of the cases that are set out in the Bill are, of course, reasonable and sensible exclu-ions, but there are others. One could have gone through the Bill and moved a succession of amendments to cover other cases that should be subject to exception or exclusion, but the problem is that it would be never ending. It is for that reason that the Opposition has put forward this amendment, the burden of which is simply this: it starts off from the assumption that the legislation will not come into operation until possibly 12 months after it received royal assent, and the idea is that in that 12-month period the Privacy Commissioner will give us all an indication of the sorts of exclusions and exceptions that he believes there should be in relation to the spent convictions scheme. It is difficult to know at this stage whether the Privacy Commissioner is going to cover the field. It is difficult to know whether he is going to include certain cases and whether they will be accepted by the Government and then embodied in regulations to the full extent to which some people might think they would be. For instance, I would imagine that employers would be very concerned about the operation of the scheme. Employers as a whole would be keen, I would imagine, to operate under the scheme. I know an employer who lives near me who started a spent convictions scheme of her own. She runs a fur store. She took on as employees ex-convicts to give them a start in life. Unfortunately, one of them knocked off the fur stock on one occasion. One has to accept that there will be problems of that sort when one implements such a scheme. One's faith should be renewed. One should give them another chance. The point is that employers will be concerned as to just how far this scheme goes. I mentioned the case before, which the Attorney-General ( Mr Lionel Bowen) has not accepted because the penalty would be much higher, of a bank faced with the question of whether it should employ someone whom it had found out had been convicted of a bank robbery. Surely the bank would not be expected to do that. The Attorney General says 'A bank robber is more likely to have got more than 30 months imprisonment'. I suppose that in most cases he would have. But what about a prospective employee who has 20 prior convictions for larceny as a servant and who got three months imprisonment for each? What is the bank to do about that? Is it to say, 'No, we are not going to take him on because he has had all these convictions.'? If the bank says that, it is really going to be in trouble because it would be in breach of this Act and there would be discrimination, presumably. It would admit it. It would assert it, It would say, 'The only reason we are not employing him is the convictions', I cite that as one example of how employers will be very concerned to know exactly where they stand before this scheme comes into operation. 1 mentioned another case, of someone convicted of arson who has entered into an insurance agreement. The insurance company has allowed him to take out insurance. It finds out that he was convicted of arson and them it rescinds the agreement on the ground that that was not disclosed. The Bill when it becomes an Act will not require the insured rerson to disclose the conviction. It says tha he did not have to do that. If the company then terminates the contract, as 1 understand it, the former arsonist would be able to haul the bank .off to the Privacy Commissioner who could order that the contract be reinstated and give the person an award of compensation to compensate for his wounded feelings as well. Clearly, that not the sort of case that should be covered by the scheme. Again, it is an area of exception that should be granted. So there is the whole employment area. There is the whole contract area. Another area which 1 did not mention in my speech during the second reading debate is the area of licence applications, people who apply for money lenders' licences and licences to trade on the stock exchange-1I have forgotten what they call them; dealers' licences, 1 suppose. They may have quite minor convictions. As the Attorney-General says, the scheme is aimed at minor convictions. But again it is not really appropriate, 1 would have thought, that people who have had convictions relating to commercial fraud, larceny and property offences should automatically be assumed to be suitable people to be issued with commercial licences of that sort. Without going on at too great length about it, 1 think that one way of resolving this is to follow the mechanism that we have set out in the amendment. It will keep the scheme intact but it will enable the Privacy Commissioner to come. back and to say to the Minister, 'We have consulted; we have called for public submissions; we have drawn on every source of community opinion that we can locate. The sum total of knowledge on this and the community sense is that there should be the following categories of exceptions. Then, when the scheme comes into operation, we will all know where we stand-employers, government bodies which grant licences, insurance companies and financial institutions. Everyone will know where he stands. We can then start to implement this worthy scheme'. If we do it the Government's way, not only are we relying upon the Privacy Commissioner to finish his work within 12 months-which for present purposes we can assume that he will-but also we will have to assume that the Attorney-General is prepared to accept his advice on all of the issues that he will undoubtedly put forward. If there is a difference of opinion-and it is an area where there will be differences of opinion-that will have to be resolved by some means or other. Regulations will have to be drawn. There is a potential for the regulais tions to be disallowed, anyway. We would have thought that on balance a more sensible way of getting this scheme into operation is to accept the amendment. We will not be dividing on it but 1 hope that the Attorney General, on reflection, will see his way clear to accept the amendment.",67
101,Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Kingsford Smith-Attorney-General) (8.55)-1 cannot accept the amendment, not that 1 Â·do not think that there is a lot of merit in what the honourable member for Menzies ( Mr N. A. Brown) has said. The notes 1I have say that our provision is to meet the Senate's concerns regarding unproc1aimed legislation. That is, the Senate is very concerned about legislation not being proclaimed. We are anxious to do it as soon as possible. We have said here this will force the Privacy Commissioner to complete his recommendations, and we expect them to be made within 12 months. If we were to accept the Opposition's amendment we could not do it within the 12-month period. That is just the technical side oUt. Again 1 advert to the fact that in regard to what the honourable gentleman has said a number of employers might express concern. The Privacy Commissioner is already seeking submissions from employers as to what might be deemed to be reasonable exemptions. The honourable member mentioned a number of offences. The point is that there has to be a waiting period of 10 years after the offence before we can do something about having it not disclosed. There is a fair gap. One would have to be a pretty reasonable citizen for a period. 1 suppose that there might be difficulty in the case of someone who had committed 20 larparagraph 85zw (a). ceny offences but if that person had been going straight for 10 years that fact might perhaps be considered. Let me make this offer to the honourable gentleman: Why do we not encourage the been Privacy Commissioner as and when he comfact. pletes his report in draft form to discuss matter with the Opposition? I am quite put happy about that. It is an intelligent thing do, rather than having regulations on which we do not agree. I think this is a matter which we can all agree. Two States already have legislation in place as a result of resolution of the Standing Committee of Atconviction torneys-General. They all promised that they would. do it. So it is not as though we initiating this scheme, or that there would not be other people looking at the matter. The whole concept is one of rehabilitation. Anybody who has looked at the prison sysis tem knows that it does not necessarily antee rehabilitation. In fact, as somebody has said, it often guarantees greater education. Our problem is to look at it from the point of view of citizens who are able to rehabiliing tate themselves, without having the burden of compulsory disclosure. Whilst the honourprovides able gentleman, as usual, has made a strong case, in this set of circumstances the Privacy Commissioner has the difficulty of coming to some conclusions. He is already seeking suboath missions from the public. I am sure that he would take into account the experience they Queensland has had for some two to three years. Western Australia is already seeking submissions. It has some experience in the area. I think the Privacy Commissioner, after completing his report, ought to discuss the matter with the Opposition and the business community as to what would be an effective method of regulation. I hope that would satisfy the Opposition's concern. But I canoffence not accept the amendment. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Clauses 3 to 9-by leave-taken together, and agreed to. Clause 10 (Insertion of new Part).",69
102,Mr NA BROWN ,CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Menzies) (9.00)-1 conviction move: (2) Clause 10, page 14, lines 15-17, omit proposed This amendment again relates to the spent convictions scheme. If all other definitions are satisfied, the operating point of the spent convictions scheme is that a per-on who has convicted is not required to reveal that In other words, he is not obliged to the concede it or admit it. I suppose one could it in different words by saying that it is to not compellable. However, the Bill goes further than that and provides two other conon sequences. The first, which we have no argument about, is that there is a proposition a to the effect that those who know of the must not disclose it orÂ· take account. of it without the consent of the person are against whom the conviction was recorded. In other words, if one knows that somebody else has such a conviction there is an obligation on one not to go around telling people about this person having a conviction. That the first situation, and we do not have any guarargument with that. It is the second situation about which we do have some concern. Although I am deal with it secondly, it concerns paragraph (a) of proposed new section 85zw. That that it is lawful for the convicted persQn to make a positive assertion that he or she was not charged with or convicted of an offence. That person is able to do that on or otherwise. It is not as if they are able to use it just as a shield, as it were, but are able to use it as a sword, positively to go forward and say, 'I have not been convicted of any offence!'. Not only are they able to do that, but they are able to do it on oath. When I drafted this amendment I was really motivated, and so is the Opposition as a whole, by the fact that we find it a little difficult to see how one can go that far. It is one thing to say that the disclosure of an should not be compellable. It is ariother thing to give a positive right to a person to go into the witness box, take up the Bible and say, 'I was not convicted of that particular offence, or, indeed, any offence'. I think it would be that broad, that a person could say that he was not convicted of any offence when, in fact, that is not the case; he was convicted and, presumably, the is still recorded on the 'register. I do not think it will have been expunged in a physical sense. Is it not nonsensical to pass a Bill which says, among other things, that a person can go into the witness box and swear contrary to what we all know to be fact? Therefore, we think that is going a bit too far. I suppose one could give a lot of examples, but one I was thinking of before concerned a person appearing before a town planning tribunal on an appeal, applying for a permit from the planning authority. Because it concerned a particular area of commercial activity, like a hotel or a casino, or some other activity where there is concern to keep out unsavoury elements from what is called the industry, such a person may put forward his submission and say, 'I have never been convicted of an offence.', or, 'I have never been convicted of an offence relating to property. Not only am I as clean as the driven snow, but I have never been in trouble with the police', as used to be said. Is that really what we want to happen? I would have thought the objective of the Bill is to give people a new start in life, so that their convictions are not held against them. Surely it is not intended to be used so that people who have convictions may claim positively that they have not and, indeed, assert it or trade on it, and even use it as one of the grounds for getting what they want-whether it is town planning, a rezoning application, a licence to run a money lending business, or whatever it might be. This legislation is that broad. It states: It is lawful for the person to claim, in those stances, or for that purpose, on oath or otherwise, that he or she was not charged with, or convicted of, the offence; The offence, of course, is the offence with which he was charged or convicted. We think, therefore, that this goes beyond the necessary ambit. We make the point that we are creating new law here, and branching out into a new field, and it would be wise to go cautiously and tentatively so we know exactly where we are going. To allow people to go into the witness box and swear on oath that they have not been convicted of offences in the past, or of a particular offence, really goes too far. We support and advance that amendment.",70
103,Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Kingsford Smith-Attorney-General) (9.05)-From the way the honourable member for Menzies ( Mr N. A. Brown) puts it, one would think that this amendment could not be declined, but we make the point that if that amendment is accepted it destroys this whole scheme, because everybody then can be asked to disclose whether he has a conviction, and there would be no way to stop that. The whole scheme is related to minor offences which carry a penalty not exceeding 30 months' imprisonment. It is related to a period of good behaviour of not less than 10 years. If one says that despite those conditions a statutory declaration is needed, most people would ask for a statutory declaration. We are trying to get a balance here. I acknowledge that there are circumstances already in the legislation concerning exemptions for special areas. The Law Reform Commission had this right when it said, 'Look, if you want to make certain that people are obliged to disclose these convictions put it in the legislation'. The honourable gentleman's example related to the town planning authority. The State should provide that if people are going to make applications to that authority pursuant to gaining a licence they should disclose all convictions. The States should put that in .the legislation. That would be the way to remedy the situation. We are trying to get a balance. Where there has been a period of good behaviour for a long period of time and the offence was relatively minor, if one is to say a person will have to disclose the conviction every circumtime, I put it to the honourable member, in what circumstances would he not want someone to disclose a conviction? I think most. people would say they would rather know. The remedy is to say, because of a review of the law, that, if someone wants to know, it should be put in the specific legislation. If someone wants to be a hotel licensee, or a financial adviser on the stock exchange, it should be in the legislation that he will be obliged to disclose all convictions, irrespective of this legislation. That would overcome the problem. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Clauses 11 to 30-by leave-taken together, and agreed to. Clause 31 (Functions of Director).",71
104,Mr NA BROWN ,CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Menzies) (9.08)There is no need for me to speak in support of this amendment at any length because the Attorney-General. ( Mr Lionel Bowen) has kindly indicated that the Government will accept it. Accordingly, I move: (3) Clause 31, page 33, lines 34-39, omit paragraph (d), substitute the following paragraph: ""( d) by inserting after subsection (2c) the following subsections: '(20) Subject to subsection (2E), in any other case where the Director considers it appropriate to do so, the Director may institute a prosecution of a person on indictment for an indictable offence against the laws of the Commonwealth in respect of which the person has not been examined or committed for trial. '(2E) Notwithstanding anything contained in subsection (20), the Director may not institute a prosecution of a person on indictment for an offence against the War Crimes Act 1945 unless the person has first been examined or committed for trial.'

105,Mr HOLDING ,ENVIRONMENT LEGISLATION,"Melbourne Ports-Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories) (9.10)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill amends 14 Acts and one ordinance within the portfolio as set out below. The amendments to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Act 1955 and the Supreme Court Ordinance 1955 of that Territory will restore criminal trial by jury in the courts of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. The Bill provides for a court to move the venue of a criminal trial indictment from Cocos (Keeling) Islands to a State or Territory and for jurors to be summoned at the new venue using the State jury list. The Bill also amends references to 'Chief Judge', in the Norfolk Island Act 1979 by substituting 'Chief Justice'. The amendments to the Australian Film, Television and Radio School Act 1975 will reduce the size of the council from 15 to 9. This will ensure more effective governance by the council and will reduce the cost of council meetings through reduced sitting fees and travel expenses. The Bill provides for the Australia Film Commission, the National Museum of Australia and the Australian Heritage Commission to conduct their meetings by telephone, closed circuit television or other methods of communication. The requirement to have members physically attend is no longer mandatory. Amendments to the investment powers of the Australia Council, Australian Film Commission, Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, Australian National Gallery and National Museum of Australia will free investments from the existing general requirement for these statutory authorities to seek ministerial approval for all financial dealings above a statutory limit. The range of available investments will, however, remain restricted to those specified in the respective enabling legislation. The amendments relating to the Sea Installations Act 1987 seek to improve administrative efficiency and to specifically provide that a representative of the Norfolk Island Government will be included in discussions concerning the granting of permissions and exemptions under the Act in waters off Norfolk Island. Amendments to the Australian Capital Territory (Electoral) Act 1988 will confer upon the Governor General the power to make regulations dealing with the means by which an elector may dispose of the matter of having failed to vote at ACT elections. The maximum penalty for failing to vote is presently set by the Australian Capital Territory (Electoral) Act at $50. The introduction of an infringement notice procedure is proposed to enable an elector, instead of being pursued through the courts, to discharge his or her liability for failing to vote by paying a penalty of $20 directly to the Electoral Commissioner. The Bill makes two further minor technical amendments which clarify the intention of the ACT (Electoral) Act. Parts 3 and 5 of the Bill contain amendments to the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 and the Australian Capital Territory Self-Government (Consequential Provisions) Act 1988. These amendments are largely technical in nature and are necessary to ensure that effect is given to the original intention of the legislation. I commend the Bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill.",72
106,Mr SMITH ,ENVIRONMENT LEGISLATION,Bass) (9.l5)- Mr Deputy Speaker-Mr Chynoweth-Tell us about Tasmania.,73
107,Mr SMITH,ENVIRONMENT LEGISLATION,I would not mind talking about Tasmania after what happened there tonight.,73
108,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,ENVIRONMENT LEGISLATION,Mr Andrew)Order! The honourable member has the call to address the legislation before the chair.,73
109,Mr SMITH,ENVIRONMENT LEGISLATION,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker; I was provoked. The Arts, Territories and Environment Legislation Amendment Bill 1989 covers a variety of areas, as the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories ( Mr Holding) has outlined in his second reading speech, and in all of those areas it is supported by the Opposition. I will refer to three of those areas that concern me as Opposition spokesman in this place on environment and the arts, and my colleague the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr MCGauran) will deal with issues relating to Australia's Territories-the Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Norfolk Island. I refer first to the arts bodies. ments propose a reduction in the size of the council of the Australian Film, Television and Radio School. From the information provided it is apparent that the reduction of the council from 15 to nine members will see an estimated saving of $8,000 per year, with $2,700 per annum on sitting fees and $5,200 per annum, on air fares. In the current economic climate in which we find ourselves anyone would welcome that, and we hope that the Minister will look closely at other bodies that come under his purview to see whether similar savings can be made. The teleconference sections are also being amended to allow the Australian Film Commission, the Australian Heritage Commission and the National Museum of Australia to conduct teleconferences by closed circuit television and by telephone. It is interesting that that amendment is being made. In 1988, when we were considering the Australia Council Amendment Bill, as Opposition spokesman on environment and the arts I made the point in relation to a similar amendment that such amendments should be made in relation to other statutory authorities. I am pleased to see that we are getting up with the modern age and that these amendments have been made. I raise one point which I made then, about which I am still a little ..:oncerned and which has not been answered. It is quite conceivable that some of these boards have already made decisions using teleconferencing techniques, and I wonder whether there should have been some consideration as to what the legal position might be. For example, a chief executive officer might have been dismissed on the decision of a teleconference when, in fact, the Act did not empower that decision to be made in that manner, and there could be a challenge in the courts in order to overturn that decision. Whilst that danger might not be realised, it indicates the importance of bringing before this place amendments that are necessary for the expedition of business by these bodies. If any statutory authorities under the purview of this Minister or other Ministers that do not have these powers hold board meetings or conferences by way of a teleconference, they ought to make sure that they get their Acts up to date, because they risk the very real threat The amend- of legal action. This Bill also makes amendments to the Sea Installations Act 1987. The Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly will be required to provide a representative to be part of the consultative process. This is another Act that I have had quite a bit to do with. It came before this House in 1987. At that time on behalf of the Opposition I went into considerable detail about the problems with this Act and the difficulties that we had to meet in ensuring that, in there was consultation with the States concerning offshore sea installations. Under the Act the States are given the authority to deal with matters on a day to day basis. I believe that Norfolk Island had already been consulted in this regard but I guess that this Bill formalises that practice and enables Norfolk Island to have a formal representative in the consultative process. Section 33 of the Principal Act is amended by this piece of legislation. The amendment inserts an additional requirement in the Act. It says already that there is to be an environmental impact report but now there is an additional requirement. The words that are inserted are 'or a public environment report'. There is no explanation of that in the second reading speech. I think the second reading speech is inadequate in another respect which I will come to, but I would like to ask the Minister if, in his summing up, he could explain the significance of the change to section 33 and the addition of the words 'or a public environment report'. All of us recognise the importance of publicly discussing environmental matters, but as it relates to the Sea Installations Act I think that is an interesting addition, and I would like it to be explained. I do not want it to be said that this is a watering down, that it gives a Minister an option to go to a lesser requirement in terms of meeting environmental needs. The reason I say that in relation to the Sea Installations Act is that this Act applies to things such as floating hotels. When we were discussing this Act last time, in 1987, there was a great deal of discussion about the floating hotel proposed for John Brewer Reef on the Great Barrier Reef. Interestingly enough, that appears to have been a financial disaster. I understand that now it is being towed to. Vietnam. Mr Chynoweth-It is a possibility.",73
110,Mr SMITH,ENVIRONMENT LEGISLATION,"There is a possibility thereof, at least. I find that interesting. The importance of looking at environmental questions when talking about the Sea Installations Act . is extremely important. I ask the Minister to expand a little on why that provision has been changed. I hope that it is strengthening the Act and putting greater emphasis on the environment, and not the contrary. At the time of the last debate there was also considerable concern expressed about Antarctica as it related to the Sea Installations Act and what would be the. requirements for environmental impact studies and statements. I think that this addition in the Act also might relate to that activity. The Minister at the table is also now the Minister for tourism. I congratulate him on that appointment and I am sure that he, like other previous tourism Ministers from the opposite side of the House, will concern himself not only with the tourism industry nationwide but with that place which is regarded as the gem of the tourism industry in Australia-Mr MCGauran-Gippsland!",74
111,Mr SMITH,ENVIRONMENT LEGISLATION,"I was thinking of Tasmania. I would ask the Minister to make it one of his priorities to go to Tasmania. It does have a relationship with Antarctica too. The stepoff point for tourism in Antarctica will be Tasmania, and all Tasmanians, rega,rdless of which way they may have voted recently, support the development of the tourism industry in that State. If tourism in Antarctica can be developed in an extremely sensitive way-and it needs to be-I think that. we would all want that, but there is a major concern that the Sea Installations Act will have an impact in that area. For example, if there are floating hotels or staging points of MCDonald Island or Heard Island we have to determine who is .going to administer the day by day rules lj.nd what the requirements will be for entry and tourism down there. The Sea Installations Act could have a real impact in that area. It is something that perhaps we have not considered. I know that the report of Professor Lovering from the Antarctic Science Advisory Committee talked about tourism. He is the expert and he recommended that tourism go ahead down there but in a very sensitive way. I just flag that the issue of the Sea Installations Act will have some impact. By way of aside, last time we came to this place the Act was amended to include airships. I raised that question then and we did not get an answer as to why airships were included in Sea Installations Act. The only reason I could think of was that someone might be wanting to anchor an airship somewhere in the sea to conduct a pirate radio station because of the policy that the Government has to charge such excessive amounts under the auction system for radio licenses that it is proposing. We still have not got an answer to that .particular point. In any event, the consultation with the States is important. I hope that will continue. The Sea Installations Act-and this Bill amends it-seeks a balance between the protection of the unique environmental and often fragile ecosystems and the development that is required. The point that I want to make-and this will be a shortish speech because this is not a major Bill and we are, as I say, agreeing with it-relates to the introduction Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Act 1981 and the amendments that are made by this Bill. The most amazing thing about it is that in the second reading speech the Minister made no mention of the Act. Looking at the environmental issues, I would have thought the most important change in this small Bill relates to the Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Act. Someone ought to set out somewhere in this debate what the Bill does, because the Minister has not done so in his second reading speech. I suggest he have a talk with the officers of the Department about exactly why it was left out. The first issue relates to amendments enabling the relevant States to control under their own legislation ,the loading of materials within State coastal waters for dumping within State coastal waters, thereby removing a present unintended anomaly whereby a Commonwealth permit has to be sought for such loading. The second amendment removes the time in which prosecutions can be brought before the court. That amendment is quite significant in the environmental context in relation to sea dumping. I would have thought that the attention of industry involved in sea dumping might be drawn by way of licence to the fact that there is no time limitation 'anymore. In the environmental context, I think that is a step in the right direction. The third area-and again I am surprised that the Minister did not bring it to the attention of the House and the communityis that the penalties for contravention of the Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Act have been increased. There is a whole range of penalties but, as a scale, it has moved from a $100,000 fine to a $250,000 fine. I think that is significant and I am sure that the community thinks it is significant. We know that the community has a concern about environmental issues, particularly about matters relating to the sea. I ask the Minister to tell us why it is that there has been no mention of that. It is certainly something that, we support but it would indicate that the' Minister does not care and that perhaps he is looking at environmental issues in a cynical way. The Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Act was brought to this Parliament by the Fraser Government some years ago. It grew out of the London Dumping Convention, which is an international attempt to control the dumping and incineration of hazardous material in both national and international waters. Australia became a signatory back in 1973 and the Convention came into effect in 1975. Australia ratified its membership of the Convention in 1985 through the Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Act 1981; which was amended in 1986. We have a strong commitment to wanting to, ensure that there is not an unlicensed or unsupervised dumping of toxic material in the sea. The Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act was another Act from the Fraser Gover-ment years. Given the Exxon Valdez episode, it is probably an opportune time to ask the Government exactly what would happen in Australia under this legislation. It is all right to say that the fines have been increased but, as we know from the Exxon Valdez, it is the clean-up that is important. What 'level of preparations are in place, what toxic substances other than oil are monitored carefully by the Government, what level of monitoring takes place and what are the levels of exemptions that are in existence at the present time that are required to be monitored by environmental monitoring mechanisms put down by the Federal Government. One example, which is well known to many, is EZ Industries Ltd in Hobart which for some years has been dumping jarosite. Some of us would have views as to whether-or not that is a good thing. Personally, I do not believe that dumping anything at sea ought to be tolerated for long, and we ought to develop better methods of dumping toxic substances. Mr Chynoweth-It will not with the new Tasmanian Government. Mr .SMITH-It might be interesting to see what might happen. We need to be looking at methods by which we can change the method of dumping at sea. This has been a vexed issue throughout the world. I think back in 1982 the incinerator ship Volcanus came to New South Wales and took away 5,000 tonnes of toxic substances, which were burned in the incinerator ship and subsequently dumped around the globe. The British and the Dutch have had similar problems. I think it is something we ought to be looking at much more carefully. The question is what we do with waste. In the Environment Review newsletter of December-January 1987-88 a proposal was put forward that the Australian National Line commission a ship to burn toxic waste. I do not know what has happened to that proposal but the interesting point was that the environment and planning Minister of New South Wales at the time, Bob Carr, who is now the Leader of the Opposition in New South Wales-and who I dare say will be in that position for a long time-was endorsing such a proposal. The important thing about dumping waste at sea is that it ought to be a very short term exercise. We ought to be developing alternative methods of waste disposal and looking at the best way of doing that. In my view, the removal of PCBs and jarosite or other liquid waste ought to be by way of incineration, if that is possible, but the results of that incineration ought not to be then dumped in the seas. The Commonwealth must get, its act together. When I was science spokesman, I spoke regularly about the need to develop a scientific approach to the disposal of toxic waste. Nothing has happened. People in this place have been talking about it since I have been a member of Parliament and it is time that we all took a stand to ensure that dumping at sea does not continue ad infinitum. The fines have been increased but that is a temporary matter and does not address the issue at all. The shipping of wastes overseas, where they are destroyed in land-based facilities, such as the Rechem incinerator at Pontypool in Wales, is an option but that is not necessarily satisfactory. Burning waste at sea poses a serious risk and is also technically difficult. That has been illustrated by what the Electrolytic Zinc Co. of Australasia Ltd is doing with jarosite. It is not burning it; it is dumping it; but it is heavy metal that is going into the sea off Tasmania. The London Dumping Convention stipulates that ocean incineration must be 99.9 per cent efficient to prevent marine contamination. This involves a stable platform on the high seas and a burning temperature of 1,200 degrees Celsius. In the event of a catastrophic accident, such as the Exxon Valdez oil spill, an effective clean up might be impossible. The Dutch are moving towards a ban on ocean incineration by the end of the decade, and the Americans say that is not a commercial reality. Not only is the cost of shipping waste to overseas incinerators very high but access is no longer assured due to increasing demand from northern hemisphere customers. Finally, there are the ethical questions, which are often worth consideration in the environmental context. Other disposal methods ought to be considered. I have said for some time that high temperature incineration on land is the best and safest environmental way to go. It is a shame that the Government has not answered, in the period it has been in office, this very vexing issue. It has been considered by different committees in different States that are governed by different political parties, but we still do not have an answer. If I could say only one thing during the debate, it is that this issue needs urgent attention. The community wants urgent attention. Any constructive proposals from the Government would certainly be supported by Opposition members. The Government needs to address those issues in a constructive manner after consultation with the States, because we need the support of the States. My colleague in New South Wales, the Minister for Environment, Mr Moore, would be particularly supportive of any method to dispose bf toxic waste by land incineration. The technology is available to us. We have scientists in this country, some of whom are not leaving but are staying to fight the fight and to develop Australian science. With their support and a bit of goodwill and a bit of constructive dialogue from the Federal Government, maybe this major environmental problem can be addressed. Those are matters for the Minister, which I hope he will be able to answer, if not in this debate, at some future time. I ask him to give them some priority and some action, which the community expects. We support all the proposed amendments, but I am surprised that there is no mention in the second reading speech of the Sea Dumping Act. That is to be regretted, and I hope that the Minister will give some thought to that in his response. I would also ask for some explanation of section 33 as amended of the Sea Installations Act.",74
112,Mr CHYNOWETH ,ENVIRONMENT LEGISLATION,"Dunkley) (9.35)It is always an honour and a privilege to follow Tasmanian speakers. I like to rub in what has happened in Tasmania recentlyand we have had a very good result today. The Arts, Territories and Environment Legislation Amendment Bill 1989 covers many areas, and I would like to mention a few. With regard to the amendment to the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act, I have watched with interest, as have many people in the nation, the d'Hondt voting system. I have never seen such a farce in my life. The counting went on for a couple of months before a decisIon could be made about who was elected. There is no doubt that that will have to change and something will have to be done. It is a very interesting system, but I do not think it here. The National Museum of Australia will be very important for Australia. The b-centenÂ­ nial year raised the awaren-s of the Australian people about their history and heritage and many people are concerned about saving and storing our traditions and heritage. About three weeks ago an organisation called Friends of the National Museum, which has been in existence for only about 12 weeks, had a rally. This gathering was attended by over 21,000 people who had driven from Melbourne, Sydney and all over Australia to ensure that their voices were heard in support of the National Museum. The Government should review its decision to delay the building of this very important national institution which will be the repository of our history, culture and heritage and an invaluable storehouse of knowledge. It will not be, as some troglodytes in the Department of Finance have described it, a place of entertainment. It will be a place where our culture is stored and people will be able to learn from what is there. It is very important that the museum should get the go ahead. I would like to take this opportunity publicly to congratulate the Government on its decision not to go ahead with mining in Antarctica. This was a major step. I know that some Ministers were all for signing the convention. But with a bit of persuasion, they came around. I am pleased that they have made this decision. I thank Opposition members for the part they played in making some Ministers change their views on this subject. I know that the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr MCGauran), argued forcefully in this Caucus that there should be mining in Antarctica, but luckily he was defeated and I am glad that that happened. With regard to the Sea Installations Act, for many years I have spoken on the floating hotel. I have raised several times the subject of the hotel and what would happen to it if it sunk or caught fire and who would pay for the shifting of it. It has not caught fire yet, but it has had a chequered history. In November 19,88 I made a speech on the hotel and raised the question of what woul<.J happen to an island near the hotel called Fantasy Island, which sank and is sitting on works top of John Brewer Reef. In Novemper 1988 I raised my concern about what was going on with Fantasy Island. I have just found out that Fantasy Island is still on the bottom; it has been there for quite a while. However, things are starting to happen. Before Fantasy Island was allowed to be put near the floating hotel, the owners had to pay a bond of $100,000. This was one of the conditions of putting it there. In that respect, the foresight of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority was excellent. However, it did not allow for the cost of getting ,Fantasy Island up off the bottom if it went down. I have heard that it would cost about $300,000. An organisation, headed by Mr Tarca, who owns Fantasy Island, started Â·work on breaking it up, getting it pulled to the top and taken by barge back to the mainland. However the organisation ,became insolvent. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority retained the bond. It got $100,000 and it will lift this island off the bottom of the ocean. I understand that this concrete is all bundled up-I do not know what it has been put into; maybe metal cages or something like thatand it is ready to be shifted. I hope that it will be shifted very soon. I have also asked about how the floating hotel went, as it appears that it will be shifted either to Vietnam or to Hong Kong; there is a possibility of that. From the reports that I have had, all the criteria set by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority have been complied with. The owners of that hotel have been very conscientious in ensuring that there has been no pollution. There were a few spills and on a few occasions things went wrong. There has been a bit of abnormal growth on the bottom of the seabed where it is shaded but that will probably dissipate fairly quickly if the floating hotel gets shifted to Vietnam. I think it is ironic that this floating hotel could go to Vietnam as one of the chairmen is the former Deputy Prime Minister and member of the National Party of Australia, Doug Anthony. I think his company has taken over just over 50 per cent of the shares. It is interesting that he is an ex-supporter of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA); he had CIA people staying in his house. The honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr MCGauran) might not remember this but back in 1975 in the Whitlam days I remember that CIA operatives actually stayed in his house, he rented it out-Mr MCGauran- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: it has been with some forbearance that we, on this side of the House, have tolerated the irrelevancy of this honourable member's contribution, straying as far as it has from the legislation. Nonetheless, given that he is now wandering into fantasy land-he truly belongs on that fantasy island he refers to-I draw your attention to the irrelevance of his remarks.",77
113,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,ENVIRONMENT LEGISLATION,Mr Andrew)Order! I have been listening to the honourable member for Dunkley. I was about to reflect on the degree to which he was straying but I would have to concede that he was still dealing with the question of the floating hotel. I ask the honourable member for Dunkley to exercise a little more discretion in his remarks.,78
114,Mr CHYNOWETH,ENVIRONMENT LEGISLATION,I was saying that there is a certain amount of irony-and I enjoy it-in the fact that someone who so vehemently stated that he was a supporter of the fighting in Vietnam-MONICA,78
115,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ENVIRONMENT LEGISLATION,Order! I conceded that the honourable member for Dunkley strayed a little. I think he would be wise to return to the point of the environmental legislation which is before the House.,78
116,Mr CHYNOWETH,ENVIRONMENT LEGISLATION,"If this floating hotel is shifted to Vietnam or wherever it goesup the Mekong River or somewhere like that I am quite certain that one of the first guests there would be the chairman of the company, Mr Anthony. Getting back to the Great Barrier Reef and sea dumping, another area that concerns me is the dumping of sewage and the pollution on the Great Barrier Reef. About four years ago I made a speech in this House in relation to Green Island. I stated then that a huge amount of sewage was going onto the reef around Green Island. It appeared to me from looking at it-I am no scientist; I am only a practical person-that the coral there was being destroyed. As I have said, I spoke about that some time ago. A scientific study, which has been going on for several years now, has been looking at the amount of pollution on the reef. I have mentioned before in this place that all the sewerage from Hamilton Island goes straight onto the reef. This is wrong. The operators have a beautiful resort there. If they do not look after it it will be wrecked and no-one will go there. Actually, it is in the operators' best interests to look at what they are doing. Thousands of people visit the Great Barrier Reef. I am quite certain that the increase in nutrients as a result of human waste is huge. This is having a tremendous effect on the coral which relies on crystal clear, unpolluted water. Another area in this Bill which concerns me relates to the mining and dumping of various minerals that, in turn, go into our environment. An advertisement in the House Magazine dated 8 March 1989 by the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd entitled 'Platinum, palladium or the pig-nosed turtle. Which comes first?', reads: In the South Alligator River Valley some two hundred and thirty kilometres south-east of Darwin, sits a modest rise known as Coronation Hill. At its base lies an exceptionally rich source as well as two of the world's scarcest metals, platinum and palladium. Mr MCGauran-A bit of uranium too.",78
117,Mr CHYNOWETH,ENVIRONMENT LEGISLATION,"The uranium has already gone. The advertisement continues: The area is already shared by one hundred and four bird species, twenty-two mammal species, fortyfour reptile species and thirteen types of frog. Eminent among these is the Pig-nose Turtle, sole survivor of a family representing around forty million years of independent evolution. A curious and scarce freshwater dweller, it is found in the South Alligator River. While this profusion of natural wealth is nothing new in Australia, it does present one of our greatest modern challenges. Reconciling the economic necessity to develop our mineral resources with the preservation of our unique, rich environmental heritage. The advertisement goes on for a whole page and there is no further mention of the pignosed turtle. There is a great photograph of it, though. The pig-nosed turtle is a strange looking creature. The advertisement goes on about how much it would cost BHP Gold to produce gold, palladium and platinum from this mine and how much it would get out of that mine. But at no stage does the company mention what it cost to make a pig-nosed turtle. You just cannot make one: no-one has yet found a way of doing it. How much is this creature worth? BHP Gold uses cyanide in its processing fairly close to this area. What would happen if the cyanide, which is in a huge open dam, flooded into the South Alligator River and wiped out the pig-nosed turtle? How much is a pig-nosed turtle worth? I do not think even BHP could afford to make one of them. There are other areas where the mining companies are abusing our environment. Recently, in November, Queensland Cement Ltd blasted a couple of caves in central Queensland. These caves were the home of rare bats and things like that. Once again, what is a rare bat worth? We just could not put a price on it. However, because that company wanted cement, it blasted these caves, the last known refuge of these types of animals. These sorts of things are happening all the time. Miners all over Australia are publishing advertisements to counter the greenie of gold offensive. People like Hugh Morgan have said: The Government's protection of a colony of extremely rare squirrel gliders and three species of orchid near Stawell has angered the Western Mining Corporation. Western Mining Corporation is gravely disappointed at the refusal . . . and cannot understand the logic on which such a decision was made . . . I would say that this is the sort of pressure that people in the environmental movement will come under in the next few years. There will be more and more pressure. We have an article in a newspaper entitled 'Greenies ""added to far Right hate-list"" '. That article states: The far right-wing League of Rights group had added conservationists to a list of hatred that included Jews, Asian migrants and Aborigines, the Minister for the Environment, Senator Richardson, said yesterday. All I can say to people in the environment movement is that they will come under a lot of attack. As other people in the world become a little aware of what is happening to our environment, there will be some changes but there will be a lot of pressure from the mining companies and there will be a lot of pressure in this House-especially on members of the Opposition who may not agree with mining in Antarctica. They are the sort of people that the mining companies will get at. It is all right for people .like me; I do not get any donations from the mining companies. I do not take any notice of the sorts of pressures they put on me. But I urge people in the Opposition who support the environment movement to stand up and make certain that the mining companies do not tend to bludgeon them into thinking the way that they are thinking. We can see what is happening in the Right in Victoria: it is gradually taking over the Liberal Party. I can assure members of the Opposition that, if they are not careful, the Right will definitely rule the whole of the Liberal Party. One of the reasons people voted for a change in the leadership recently was that they were scared of their own pre-selection and they wanted someone like theÂ·Â· honourable member for EmptyHere after them a bit. All I can say is that the Liberal Party should make certain that the Right does not take over. The honourable member for Bass ( Mr Smith) spoke about the disposal of toxic waste. The niajority of toxic waste disposal laws are State laws, not Federal laws. The honourable member need look' no further than his own State to - ee some of the problems. Recently, a television show, I think it was Sunday, gave a: graphic illustration of what is happening in' Tasmania. The Queen and the King rivers, I think it is, have been polluted for 100 years, a long time. The show showed a few shots of this brown, muddy river running down into a nice, pristine bay in which all the fishing had been destroyed. The former Tasmanian Liberal Government, not the Commonwealth Government, gave a special exemption that allowed that river to be polluted. The former Liberal State Government gave a particular mine dispensation to discharge whatever it liked into the water. I would like to see the Commonwealth in charge of pollutionÂ· laws- The environment does riot end at State boundaries. It is not as if the air stops at the Murray River and becomes cleaner as it goes over Victoria; the environment is that of the. whole world. Therefore, the Commonwealth should have control of environment and pollution laws. Perhaps we should have a referendum as to whether this power should be given to the Commonwealth. I am' quite certain that the majority of people would agree to it.. We should not allow State governments, especially those such as the' former Liberal Government of Tasmania, to allow pollution to continue. Such governments know very well that what they are doing is wrong, but they give a special exemption. The Minister for the Environment in Tasmania, Peter Hodgman, who is Michael Hodgman's brother, just blithely says, 'Well, the law has been ther,e for X number of yearS and we are not going to change it'. Therefore, I would like the Commonwealth to look again at pollution laws to see whether we can control them and in that way control exactly what happens in the oceans, what goes into our rivers, what goes into our environment and what gets hidden and dumped all over the place. I believe that in Queensland there are no environmental laws. The show to which I referred mentioned some figures. If I remember them correctly, it costs $1,600 to dump a thousand gallons of toxic waste, but a fine of only $400 is imposed on those caught dumping that waste directly into the sewer. So the incentive is there to dump such wastes straight into the sewer. Some time ago at Hastings in the Flinders electorate, the BP refinery was pulled down. A huge amount of toxic waste was pulled out from that refinery and put into drums which were supposed to be taken to the dump at Tullamarine. The trucks which were to cart the waste to Tullamarine were to return to the BP site within one hour. It takes at least two hours to get from the site to Tullamarine. Where did all those 44-gallon drums of toxic waste go? It has been rumoured that they went into a particular person's dam wall, so in the future somebody will end up with a nice little property full of toxic waste. These are the sorts of things that are going on. They must stop. We should not leave that responsibility to State governments which abuse it. The responsibility should come to the Commonwealth. This legislation increases fines, et cetera, and that is all for the good. It makes certain the majority of the people of Australia abide by the laws. As this awareness spreads throughout the community, it will mean that in the future we should not have the sorts of problems that we are experiencing now.",79
118,Mr BURR ,ENVIRONMENT LEGISLATION,"Lyons) (9.54)-1 admit that I W\lS a little slow on my feet because of the irrelevance of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Dunkley ( Mr Chynoweth). Mr Deputy Speaker, you have a very liber\ll interpretation of the meaning of 'relevance' under the Standing Orders, because most of what the previous speaker said-MONICA",80
119,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,ENVIRONMENT LEGISLATION,Hon. J. D. M. Dobie )-Order! The honourable member may care to withdraw that remark.,80
120,Mr BURR,ENVIRONMENT LEGISLATION,"I do withdraw, Mr Deputy Speaker. I rephrase it by saying that most of what the previous speaker had to say, in my interpretation, had very little relevance to the Arts, Territories and Environment Legislation Amendment Bill, which is before the House. I did not take points of order on him because I thoughtÂ· that his contribution was not worthy of taking points of order and having attention drawn to its irrelevance. The Bill covers an omnibus of matters. Frankly, I cannot understand how the Government has managed to bring forward a Bill relating to the environment and certain arts bodies and at the same time incorporate provisions relating to voting procedures in Australian Capital Territory elections. These matters have no relation to each other, yet the Government, in its strange way of thinking, has put all of them into one Bill. I do not want to occupy the time of the House for too long. As the shadow Minister for Aboriginal affairs, the honourable member for Bass ( Mr Smith) has pointed out, the Opposition supports the measures before us, so I will make only one or two brief comments ... . I want to address my comments particularly to those aspects of the Bill that relate to dumping at sea and the amendments to the Environmental Protection (Sea Dumping) Act. I find it quite ironic that the Government in this Bill is effectively using its power of legislation to pass back responsibility to the State governments to issue permits for dumping toxic materials at sea. I find this quite ironic, because the action by the Commonwealth Government to pass this responsibiJity back to the States follows hot on the heels of the action by the Commonwealth Government to overrule the, State of Tasmania concerning its interpretation and requirements for dumping at sea in relation to the Wesley Vale mill. I find it quite ironic that in one instance the Commonwealth Government is prepared to take action that prevents a $1,OOOm industrial development and overrule the sovereign State of Tasmania in reTation to discharge at sea and within a matter of weeks to completely reverse that decision and give authority to the State of Tasmania as well as other States of Australia to issue permits for the dumping of toxic materials at sea. I am not too sure how the Government rationalises that about-face in its own strategy. I do not want to dwell on the implications of the Commonwealth's decision in relation to Wesley Vale. That matter has been considered in this House and in public debate around Australia, and no doubt people around Australia have drawn their conclusions from that. I want simply to point out to the House the irony of the situation. The Government has completely reversed the position it adopted in relation to Wesley Vale and is now prepared to give all the States the authority to issue permits for the dumping of toxic materials at sea. I find it ironic that the Governmen- should be prepared to take that posit-on. Certainly in the case of the State Government in regard to Wesley Vale all the relevant legislation-both Commonwealth and State-was complied with in the preparation of environmental impact statements and in negotiations with the company. Every matter was made. public and was fully debated within Australia. Despite the fact that all relevant Commonwealth and State legislation was complied with, the Commonwealth still overruled the State and was prepared to stop that, project going ahead. If the Commonwealth was prepared to take that action in relation to the Wesley Vale project, why on earth should it now give authority to the States to issue permits for dumping at sea? Are we to believe that, if the States do adopt a position and impose standards for that particular activity, the Commonwealth will not overrule them if it sees fit to do so? There is an irony here-the Commonwealth needs to think very carefully about its position. before it starts bringing in this sort of omnibus legislation, thinking it will be able to slip it through without anybody noticing. A very serious problem exists in Australia with respect to the accumulation of toxic materials. I am sure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, are as conscious as I of the dangers posed. to the environment, more particularly the urban environment, by the accumulation of these materials. I find it very worrying that in many instances we do not even know where these toxic materials are stored. There is no inventory of those chemicals and there is no inventory of their hazardous nature. There is no inventory of what their effects might be in the event of fire or other such disasters. I know that there is a lot of concern amongst the firefighting authorities and other emergency service authorities around Australia about the fact that there is no inventory of the toxic materials that are stored in industrial warehouses in various parts of Australia. For some considerable time there has been agitation in Australia for the Commonwealth to look very seriously at the development in Australia of a high security, high temperature incinerator to dispose of many of the highly toxic chemicals that are in storage around Australia. The Commonwealth has not undertaken that serious investigation at this stage, and there has been no commitment from the Commonwealth to invest in such a high temperature incinerator. It is very worrying that highly toxic chemicals such as polychlorinated biphenyls and heavy metals are stored in waste form in 44 gallon drums in very insecure compounds in industries all around Australia. There is no secure method of disposing of those toxic materials. There is no high temperature incinerator and the only method of 'disposal' available at the moment is to dump this material at sea. In order to do that the Commonwealth now has the temerity to pass the responsibility for issuing permits back to the States. Presumably if something goes wrong, if there is a serious form of pollution at sea as a result of the dumping of that material, the Commonwealth will blame the States for having given the permit for that activity to be undertaken. I suggest very seriously to the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories ( Mr Holding), who is at the table, and to the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) that if they are serious about incorporating some safe methods of disposal of these highly toxic chemicals that are in storage in industries around Australia, they ought to give very serious consideration to installing a high temperature incinerator so that these. materials can be safely disposed of, rather than buck-passing, avoiding their responsibilities and trying to push them on to the States. I am conscious of the time and of the fact that other members want to speak. I am also conscious of the fact that the Opposition is giving approval to this Bill. BeforeÂ· I conclude, I want to make some comments about the provision that is included in this Bill to impose fines onÂ· the people who failed to vote in the recent Australian Capital Territory elections. I would have thought that any objective observer of politics in Australia could simply say to those people who failed to vote in the Australian Capital Territory elections, 'Jolly good luck to you', because it has almost been an episode out of the Keystone Cops to watch the amusing set of events that have emerged. We had a ballot paper that was over one yard in length, and I forget the number of candidates. Two months after the election nobody knew who had won a seat and who would be able to form a government. Yet this Commonwealth Government has the temerity to say that that is democracy at work. I suggest to the Minister at the table that if that is the best system of electing a government for the Australian Capital Territory or for any other area of Australia that this Commonwealth Government can come up with, it ought to look very seriously at some of the better techniques of government. Seriously, after watching the saga of events in relation to the recent Australian Capital Territory elections that did emerge, it could only be described as a joke. I seriously suggest to the Commonwealth that if it wants the people of the Australian Capital Territory to take seriously this innovation of self government, it has an onerous obligation to come up with a much better system of electing a government than has been demonstrated to date. By then proceeding to impose fines on those people who failed to participate in this charade I think is simply rubbing salt into the wound. While we do not intend to object to or vote against this particular provision, I suggest to the Minister that the Commonweillth Government and the Minister for the Australian Capital Territory have an awful lot of homework to do to come up with a much more workable system for electing a government in the Australian Capital Territory than it currently has in place.",80
121,Mr MILTON ,ENVIRONMENT LEGISLATION,"La Trobe) (1O.06)-The Arts, Territories and Environment Legislation Amendment Bill 1989 deals with a number of procedural amendments with which I have to say I have no objection. Rather, I want to take the opportunity to deal with one particular environmental problem that causes me concern; that is, the endangered species. I think that this is a very relevant time to bring up this particular question and having listened to the debate up to now I appreciate that it has been a very wide ranging debate. Whilst I would like to have said many things that the honourable member for Dunkley ( Mr Chynoweth) said about Antarctica, I think I will just confine my remarks to saying how pleased I am that the Government has decided not to ratify the Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource Activities. That is all I will say on that matter. I have just received a letter from the World Wildlife Fund, Austnilia, asking me to take up this serious environmental issue of endangered species particularly in relation. to the fauna and flora in Australia, but obviously it also applies to our territories. I note that legislation deals with our territories. I know the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) is concerned about these matters. The letter points out that the worldwide rate of extinction is thought to be something like two species per hour-a most alarming' rate to which Australia is not immune. Two thirds of the world's extinct mammal species have been lost in Australia. The World Wildlife Fund points out that this record is even worse than the loss of mammal species in' Africa. The letter indicates the following rather horrifying facts. It says that there are well in eXcess of 2,500 threatened plant species in Australia, probably nearer 3,000, and that at least 129 plant species are now extinct' nationally, or 0.8 per cent of the total flora. New South Wales has 528 plant species listed as of extinct, endangered, vulnerable, rare or unknown status, and this represents a little under 10 per cent of the State's major vascular flora. Victoria has over 500 plant species at risk of extinction. There are 102 plant species which are presum-d extinct in Western Australia-that is 1.4 per cent of the State's flora. There are 18 mammal species, three bird species, and one reptile species which have become extinct nationally. At last 400 vertebrate species are threatened nationally. Species that have become extinct worldwide in historical times represent some further 90 mammal species. Three birds and one reptile have become extinct and a further 80 birds and 120 reptile species are threatened, At least 40 amphibians and 35 fish species are threatened with extinction and, finally, inÂ· excess of 300 invertebrate species are threatened in Australia that we know about. There are probably many more, and there are those'. that may have become extinct without our knowledge. I take the opportunity to express my hope that this serious issue will be covered by the Prime Minister. ( Mr Hawke) in the environmental policy statement which he will be presenting to the Australian public next month. I agree with the World Wildlife.Fund, Australia, that we desperately need to develop a national threatened species strategy. This could be part of the 1989-90 Budget, with an allocation of $2m, as proposed by this the Endangered Speoies Advisory Committee. There is no doubt that we badly need a government funded program which will enable essential research into the causes of extinction and an indication of the actions that we need to take to prevent the continued rates of extinction. Currently, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts-of which I am Chairman-is investigating land degradation in Australia. We hope to table our report on this matter in October, but in the meantime it is quite clear to the Committee that land degradation, involving the loss of vegetation and tree cover, is causing the loss of many of our reptile, mammal and bird species in Australia. Recently, I was advised of a research program to be undertaken by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) division of Wildlife and Ecology. The program involved the killing of 44 lyrebirds, from amongst the population of 1.5 million lyrebirds which range from habitats in Victoria, through New South Wales to southern Queensland. In Sherbrooke Forest, which is part of the Dandenong Ranges, in my electorate of La Trobe, there exists a population of lyrebirds which is rapidly diminishing because of the predation of foxes and the build-up of ground litter, which makes it difficult for the birds to seek their food. Naturally enough, the people who live in the area,' and particularly the children and staff of the Kallista Primary School, were most concerned that 'lyrebirds were to be killed for research 'purposes. I made representations to CSIRO and was advised of the reasons for the research. I will not go into all the details that the CSIRO has given me, suffice it to say that the reason given for killing the birds was that it needed a spectrum of tissue protein far wider than that which could be taken from living animals, and that that was required to distinguish the principal populations. The CSIRO pointed out that: Blood from live birds alone provides too few proteins, while DNA finger-printing is inappropriate until the populations have been defined. Of course, I tried to explain this to the children but, as honourable members can imagine, they were not overly impressed. The situation became a little worse when they charged me with the task of finding out the reason for the animals being shot. I contacted the Division of Wildlife and Ecology and spoke to the Chief of the Division, and finally to Dr Peter Lynch, who is responsible for the program. In a letter that he forwarded to me, he said: The people involved in this type of work are trained (and expert marksmen). They use shot appropriate to the size and type of animal to be collected. The animal dies instantly without the loss of any tissue required from the specimen and without damage to the pelt or skin. Again, I explained that to the children but, as I say, they were not overly impressed. I was interested to read the report of the Antarctic Science Advisory Committee (ASAC) to the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. This report on research involving animals in the Antarctic referred to the use of radioactive isotopes. A number of penguins were studied in this way. The actual level of isotopes was something equivalent to an X-ray which is given to a human being. Using this process the scientists were able to study the animals and to find out a good deal about them and their metabolism. They were able to do that without causing deaths. As was pointed out in the report, 4,000 seals were destroyed by another nation which was undertaking studies, while in another case approximately 1,700 seals were destroyed. So, in reading this report, it struck me that it is not always necessary to kill animals in order to gain information. I believe that the CSIRO is now looking at other methods of finding out information about the lyrebirds. On the face of it, 44 birds does not seem to be very many amongst a population of 1.5 million but, of course, it is a problem in the Dandenong Ranges where there is now only a very small number of lyrebirds. Also, as I said, the children were very upset about it. I believe the program has ceased at the moment while the CSIRO is looking at other methods of trying to get the information that it needs. As I have said before, this had been a fairly wide-ranging debate. I have been talking about dangers of species becoming extinct. Another matter that I want to bring to the attention of the House concerns the problem with the black rhino. Last year I had the opportunity to go to Zimbabwe, visit the Zambezi Valley and observe the fight by the national parks and wildlife officers there to save the black rhino from poachers. It is estimated that although the total number of black rhinos was 100,000 in 1960, they now number less than 10,000. One pessimistic estimate of the black rhino population in the Zambezi Valley is 2,000. The problem is the poachers. In Zimbabwe there is virtually a war between the wildlife officers and the poachers. The wildlife officers go out in fatigues with guns and in fact have to kill the poachers because otherwise the rhinos will be killed. I wrote to the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories asking him whether some help could be given to the Zimbabwe Government to assist it in its fight for the black rhino. I did so because it seems to me that this is a worldwide problem. Sadly, the Minister has replied to my letter saying that it does not seem that there is any possibility of assistance through the Australian aid program and that without supplementing funding, the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service does not have the resources to support the Zimbabwean conservation effort. I was very sorry to receive this negative response. This is particularly sad in view of the fact that Zimbabwean Minister for National Resources and Tourism, Mrs Chitepo, had written to me saying how pleased she was that the Government was considering trying to provide some help. She pointed out that providing capital equipment, such as landrovers, would help the Zimbabwean Government to save the black rhino. I am hopeful that perhaps the Minister might think again and find some other way in which we might be able to help the Zimbabwean Government in this exercise. As I say, the rhino is very close to extinction. I think would be a very generous gesture on the part of our Government to help the Zimbabweans in their efforts. Another matter that I want to speak concerns the problem of the greenhouse effect. I am sure that our Territories have the same problem. Some people have tried to suggest that we should perhaps substitute nuclear power for coal-fired power stations and that perhaps this might solve the problem of the greenhouse effect. Mr MCGauran-Hear, hear I",82
122,Mr MILTON,ENVIRONMENT LEGISLATION,"I have a paper which I problem am sure the honourable member for those Gippsland would be very interested to read. Entitled Can the atom cool the greenhouse?, it was written by Greenpeace and is based on the paper written by Keepin and Kats. Keepin and Kats have produced a very our lengthy paper, with a great many statistics, in which they point out how impossible it for nuclear power to overcome the greenwere house problem. Mr MCGauran-Not all of it; 10 per cent.",85
123,Mr MILTON,ENVIRONMENT LEGISLATION,"I know that the honourmegawatt reactor. able member has e'f,pressed his interest in this matter and so' 'perhaps I should quote from the paper. Keepin and Kats said that it has been projected that the world's energy consumption will increase 390 per cent the year 2025. That seems a lot, but it only about 9 per cent each year. In their projection, they envisage that replacing coal-fired power stations would mean a fold increase in present nuclear generating capacity. This means building 7,600 large nuclear reactors in the next 37 years, or 1,000 megawatt plant every 1.61 days. That would cost $US8,390 billion in 1987 dollar terms just for the construction. Due to estimated expansion in oil and natural gas consumption-about 60 per cent to 2025from even building all those reactors would not prevent a 65 per cent increase in carbon dioxide emissions. Keepin and Kats thought they would try a second projection which did not envisage such an expansion of energy. It was devised by the United States Department of Energy and it assumes a more modest forecast for black future world energy consumption which it would grow at only 232 per cent by the year 2025, or 5.5 per cent per year. Again, doing the sums we come out with an 18-fold increase in nuclear generating capacity or building one large reactor every 2.5 days at about a cost of $US5,300 billion. Mr John Scott-How much?",85
124,Mr MILTON,ENVIRONMENT LEGISLATION,"At a cost of $US5,300 billion. Staggering, is it not? Mr O'Neil-Absolutely incredible.",85
125,Mr MILTON,ENVIRONMENT LEGISLATION,"It would be impossible. Both honourable members appreciate the enormity of the capital cost involved. The whole about all this' is that under both projections these massive nuclear programs would slow global warming by only 20 to 35 per cent by the year 2025. In absolute terms, global warming will get worse compared to today. That is because much of electricity requirements would still have to be met by oil or gas. I should point out is that in doing those figures Keepin and Kats extremely generous to nuclear power. They deliberately unde-estimated the cost of building and running nuclear plants and how long it takes to construct a typical 1,000 I know that I have ranged widely in this debate. I believe that another honourable member wants to speak after me. But I just wanted to give this information to the House by because, sadly, there are-although not is many-honourable members on this side of the House who seem to think that what is the in the Keepin and. Kats paper cannot be 29borne out. When we look at the figures we find that their paper is completely accurate. It is important to remember, when we are one having these debates and when people on the other side of the House jump up all the time and talk about the expansion of nuclear an power and the need for more uranium mines, that the demand is just not out there. Papers people such as Keepin and Kats prove the point. I thank the House for its reasonableness in letting me bring up these matters. I support the Bill before the House.",85
126,Mr MCGAURAN ,ENVIRONMENT LEGISLATION,"Gippsland) (10.23)In addressing the Arts, Territories and Environment Legislation Amendment Bill before the House I wish to concentrate my remarks on the potential for uranium mines to be developed in the Northern Territory. Let me put to rest once and for all the lie about the current oversupply of uranium which causes low spot prices. The honourable member for La Trobe ( Mr Milton) made a worthless contribution, ranging as it djd over the most irrelevant subjects in no way connected with the legislation. But the Opposition, with good grace, decided not to pull him into line with points of order on relevance. The honourable member really tested our patience in his claim that there is no demand for uranium. It is exactly what the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) claimed in Question Time last week and again today in reply to a question from me. There is oversupply at this moment but in 1992-93 foreign power utilities will seek to enter into new, long term contracts for suppliers to provide uranium throughout the 1990s. Unless we allow new uranium mines to come on stream in the next two or three years, given that is the lead time, they will not be able tender when uranium is greatly sought by overseas countries. In a nutshell there will be heavy demand for uranium in the next decade, throughout the 1990s. That demand will not be met the existing two-mine policy-because that is all it is. Only two out of the three operate at present. Unless .this Government allows new Australian mines to come on refer stream, and it will take two or three years for them to enter production-Mr O'Neil-Roxby Downs can more than meet that demand.",86
127,Mr MCGAURAN,ENVIRONMENT LEGISLATION,"That is a fallacy. It the will not be able to meet all the demand. Suppose we take it that it can meet all the demand, why canp.ot new Australian mines enter the marketplace and settle amongst themselves the supply and demand question? Mr O'Neil- Mr Deputy Speaker, I take a point of order. I do not want this House to be led astray. Roxby Downs covers an areaÂ· of 21 square kilometres.",86
128,Mr MCGAURAN,ENVIRONMENT LEGISLATION,"Oh, really! There is no point of order. Mr O'Neil-I am trying to educate the boy.",86
129,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,ENVIRONMENT LEGISLATION,"Hon: J. D. M. Dobie )-Order! I remind all speakers in this debate that the Chair has been extremely tolerant of honourable members on both sides of the House. I remind honourable members on my right that they, too, received indulgence. I ask them to hear the honourable member for Gippsland in the silence in which they were heard. I call the honourable member for Gippsland.",86
130,Mr MCGAURAN,ENVIRONMENT LEGISLATION,"The honourable member for Grey, together with the honourable member for La Trobe and the whole cortege of left wing factional ideologues, has joined with the Prime Minister in surrendering the national interest. As a result, the Canadians' standard of living has been underwritten by Australians. We have 30 per cent of the world's uranium reserves yet we supply only 10 per cent of the market. With the Canadians it is the exact opposite. They haveMONICA",86
131,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ENVIRONMENT LEGISLATION,Order! I rethat mind the honourable member that he apto pears to be very wide of the matter before the House. I ask him to relate his remarks to the Bill which is being debated.,86
132,Mr MCGAURAN,ENVIRONMENT LEGISLATION,"Mr Deputy Speaker, just to conclude the sentence so that it is not by left hanging in mid-air for Hansard-MONICA",86
133,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ENVIRONMENT LEGISLATION,No. The mines honourable member will obey the Chair.,86
134,Mr MCGAURAN,ENVIRONMENT LEGISLATION,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I you to the long title of this Bill, 'An Act to amend the law relating to the Arts, Territories and the Environment, and for related purposes'. My remarks relate principally to the economic situation of the Northern Territory. The size of investment, should Jabiluka and the Koongarra mines in the Northern Territory come on stream, has to be borne in mind because, after all, they will supply the Northern Territory with an infrastructure and create roughly 5,000 direct and permament jobs that otherwise would be lost without investment in uranium mines. It is of tremendous concern to me that the big Canadian mines in the Saskatchewan area particularly will be able to cash in on the forecast of an international increase in demand throughout the 1990s. I do not see why we should allow the Canadians to corner the billion-dollar market for uranium and subsidise Canadian living standards.",86
135,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ENVIRONMENT LEGISLATION,Order! And the Chair does not see why it should allow the honourable member to remain so wide of the Bill. The honourable member will come back to the Bill before the House. Mr Milton-There aren't any uranium mines on Norfolk Island.,87
136,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ENVIRONMENT LEGISLATION,Order! The honourable member for La Trobe will cease interjecting.,87
137,Mr MCGAURAN,ENVIRONMENT LEGISLATION,"Mr Deputy Speaker, it is a matter of deep regret to me that the honourable member for La Trobe cannot extend to me on behalf of the Opposition the same courtesies that we so extended to him during his speech on the black rhinoceroses of Zimbabwe and southern Africa. Mr Deputy Speaker, I think you will appreciate the tolerance that we showed. It is a matter of deep regret that the same sort of charity is not extended-MONICA",87
138,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ENVIRONMENT LEGISLATION,I point out that it was the Chair who showed the tolerance.,87
139,Mr MCGAURAN,ENVIRONMENT LEGISLATION,"Of course, Mr Deputy Speaker. You are certainly a tolerant person. In the little time that is left to me I point out that the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories ( Mr Holding), who has charge of this legislation, has a deep and abiding responsibility for that area under his jurisdiction. If he is unable to provide the jobs, the infrastructure and the export income that will so benefit the Northern Territory, then he stands condemned for surrendering his responsibilities. there is better way for the Northern Territory to progress than by the extension of the uranium export industry. This Government has to jettison its left wing baggage and face realities surrounding the need to provide for increased demand. Debate interrupted.

141,Mr TAYLOR ,ADJOURNMENT,"Groom) (l0.30)-Despite the late hour, it is with pleasure that I pay a short tribute toÂ· a great contemporary Australian. Recently, on a commercial flight out of Canberra after a parliamentary sitting, I sat next to the irrepressible adventurer, Dick Smith. I feel sure that he would not mind if I said we talked about many things including his role as member of the Civil Aviation Authority, his very objective and forthright opinions on a wide range of issues, and, for my part, the most impressive of his many qualities, his immense pride in all things Australian and his frustration at the unfulfilled potential of our great country. In particular on that day, he was looking forward to flying the Australian flag once again in his 'Round the World North-South' Twin Otter flight across both poles which he commenced from Sydney in November of last year. As honourable members would be aware, Dick returned to Sydney last Sunday having completed the 90,000-kilometre flight successfully under, at times, very hazardous conditions through previously uncharted air spaces across the Soviet Union, Mongolia and China. As well as providing spectacular material for his Australian Geographic periodical, Dick is hopeful that this flight will lend practical detail to research on the greenhouse effect, in particular, and on the world's environment in general. He is hopeful also that the Soviets' supportive attitudes to his adventure are indicative of a major no recognition that things are changing in our world, that their system has accepted the Gorbachev line for major domestic and international reform by the Soviet authorities the and that the cold war attitudes of the 1960s are no longer relevant. I hope that Dick Smith's perceptions are correct and that glasnost and perestroika are words with real meaning and substance. I take this opportunity to congratulate him on another dangerous job well done and to record in this place my deep gratitude, which I hope is shared by all in this Parliament, to an informed, resolute, proud and brave Australian who continues to climb previously unassailable physical and mental barriers. I look forward to reading his record of the flight, and I can only say, 'Well done, Dick Smith'.",87
142,Mr ONEIL ,ADJOURNMENT,"Gray) (10.33)-1 would imagine those with an interest in politics have their political hero, or somebody they see as the ideal politician. The person I have always greatly admired is Gavin Keneally, the member for Stuart, in the State Parliament in South Australia. The State seat of Stuart is located within my Federal electorate of Gray and is based on the major industrial communities of Port Augusta and Port Pirie. Gavin, a former clerk in the old Commonwealth Railways, now Australian National, was elected to State Parliament in 1970. Before entering Parliament, he made his mark as an outstanding sportsman and, undoubtedly, was the finest sportsman, pound for pound, who ever came out of Port Augusta. What he lacked in height he made up for in heart and always gave 100 per cent in all fields of endeavour. He represented Port Augusta at football, cricket and tennis. He was an A grade squash player and his forte was table tennis. The term, 'When the going gets tough, the tough get going' epitomises this man. This is not an obituary, for Gavin is fit and well and, as longevity is part of his family tree, I imagine he will get the standard telegram from the Queen next century when he brings up the ton. But this is a time to pay tribute to a genuine politician who has announced he' is not going to contest the next State election in South Australia. He has been an extremely competent Minister in the Bannon Labor Government, holding various portfolios during his political career and doing an excellent job in each of them. He will be sorely missed on the South Australian Labor Government front bench. For me, the outstanding quality that Gavin Keneally possesses is his ability tocommunicate with people at all levels, and his dedication to representing working class people, the under-privileged and oppressed. I firmly believe Australia is extremely unfortunate in that we do not have more politicians of the calibre, dedication, genuineness and understanding of this man. When we do have such people, it is imperative that we acknowledge them. Therefore, I am delighted to place on record my appreciation on behalf of, particularly, the Labor supporters in my area, and out gratitude to Gavin Keneally for his untiring efforts in promoting and representing our working class causes. . I wish Gavin and his charming wife, Judith a long, happy and healthy retirement and hope that we may see them on the golf course or bowling green some day where I am sure they will excel because of their natural ability. However, whatever they do in their retirement, I trust they enjoy it, for they certainly have earned it. Gavin can hold his head high knowing that he has done a wonderful job and has been well supported by his wife, Judith.",88
143,Mr HAWKER ,ADJOURNMENT,Wannon) (10.37)-One of the more irritating things in this chamber is having to listen to the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support ( Mr Robert Brown) using some very misleading statistics totry-MONICA,88
144,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! The honourable member for Wannon should not attack a Minister or a member unless he does so by substantive motion. I say that as a word of caution because he seemed to be about to say that the Minister might have been using misleading statements, and he might have been doing that himself.",88
145,Mr HAWKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I am glad you can read my mind because I was not going to say that.",88
146,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"I am sure that, if I had read the honourable member's mind, I would have had to sit him down; so I hope I have not.",88
147,Mr HAWKER,ADJOURNMENT,"I must admit that I would love to have a crystal ball, too. I was going to say that the Minister loves to trumpet the Government's supposed level of funding for roads. But, when we look at it, the level of funding for roads has declined as a percentage of the tax that is collected from fuel; it has declined in real terms since the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Fund came on stream in full in 1983-84; yet the Minister continues to claim that this Government has been a great benefactor of roads. Tonight, 1 quote very briefly from a letter that has been sent round one of my shires which includes some of the figures relating to road funding and shows how local government, in particular, has been particularly hard hit by this continuing cutback in road funding as initiated by this Government. As is pointed out, despite the high taxes attached to fuel, around 20 per cent of those taxes come back to road funding. This is' quite a big change from a few years ago when it was in the order of 50 per cent. Not surprisingly, as 1 think all honourable bers would agree if they were truly honest with themselves, the standard of our roads declining, particularly in country areas. As isÂ· also pointed out in this letter, when we look at the Victorian network of roads we find that the breakdown of roads into four gories is as follows: there are only 762 metres of national highways, freeways or developmental roads; we have 14,555 kilothat metres of ruralÂ· arterial roads; 3,849 kiloThere metres of urban arterial roads; and a staggering 138,938 kilometres in local roads, both urban and rural. Eighty-eight per cent of the roads of Victoria fall into this latter category; yet, when we look at the amount of funding that the Road Construction Authority and the Road Traffic Authority alloin cates to these categories, we findÂ· that 17.7 percent goes to national roads. That is, 17.7 per cent of the funding is allocated for 0.5 per cent of the roads in Victoria. If we look at local roads, we find that, although they comprise 88 per cent of the roads in Victoria, they get 14.3 per cent of that funding. Looking at the 1987 figures, we find that local government authorities spent more on roads than either the Commonwealth Govthe ernment or the State governments. The do Commonwealth Government continues to of claim great support for road funding. Yet, the road funding saga is a sorry story, one which the Commonwealth and the Minister have nothing to be proud of. It is a great pity that the Minister does not fight a harder in that regard when he goes to net. Since 1960 vehicle density per kilometre of Australian roads has risen from 0.95 veation. hicles per kilometre to 2.7 vehicles in 1985, a rise of 184 per cent, yet at the same time investment in roads as a proportion of gross domestic product has fallen from 2.7 per cent in 1960 to slightly more than one per cent in 1985. But probably the most telling statement of all is that, during the past 120 years, only during the two world wars has investment in road formation in Australia been lower as a percentage of gross domestic level of product than it is at present.",88
148,Mr CAMPBELL ,ADJOURNMENT,"Kalgoorlie) (10.41)-1 want to refer to a few matters tonight, but first I wish to take issue with the honourable memmember forWannon ( Mr Hawker). There are many roads in my electorate and the is honourable member for Wannon clearly misused statistics tonight. If he were to evaluate expenditure on roads in terms of the use of those roads, he would find that the money catewas much more evenly equated. He would kiloalso know, and 1 hope acknowledge,that it was this Government that raised the money goes to local government for roads. has been a definite increase in funding to local government. While there has been a decrease in road funding, that has occurred . from a historic+tlly very high base, and to talk about road funding as a percentage of gross domestic product is most misleading. One of the things that we must face up to relation to road funding is achieving a . genuine level of user pays. 1 might say that I am not a great advocate of the user pays principle: it is a much overused and abused term and idea. But certainly many operators of heavy trucks are simply not paying their share of damage to roads. Anyone who has ever driven behind one of these large trucks on, say, the Eyre Highway, would have literally seen the road breaking up underneath truck every time it ran off the road. Cars not have that effect. That is the problem heavy transport. 1 guess it is a basic law of physics that that should be so, but this matter must be addressed. 1 also believe that we must look at the anomalies that exist in respect of the taxes that railways pay, for bit which they get nothing. The honourable Cabimember for Wannon should be addressing those issues if he wants to make more than a little political capital out of the road situI rose tonight to speak about a man who I believe has given Australia many years of good service. I refer to Cedric Wyatt. Until recently he. was ,the Director of Aboriginal Affairs in Western Australia. I know Cedric well; I knew him when he was in charge of the Kalgoorlie office and when he was in charge of the Derby office. He was a man of enormous capacity, one who tackled the job at a very difficult stage and took many hard decisions. It was not until Cedric Wyatt came onto the scene that I was able to get things done that I had waited for years to get done, without avail. It was most disappointing to hear him attacked by Senator CrichtonBrowne during a Senate inquiry. I took up this matter with Senator Crichton-Browne who, I think, now concedes that he might have been a little intemperate. I believe that the record should be put straight, because Cedric Wyatt was one of those people who, before it became fashionable to be an Aboriginal, put himself through university by playing football. He served in the armed forces and of his own initiative he gained a job as a school teacher in Papua New Guinea, where he rose to the position of Secretary to the then Leader of the Papua New Guinea Parliament. He is a man who has contributed an awful lot to the progress of Aboriginal advancement in this country and it grieves me that he should be so abused in a forum where he did not have much chance to protect himself. If I can possibly do it in one and a half minutes, I want to debunk one of the great myths-the moral argument as to why we should not.mine uranium. The argument goes something like this: no matter what the benefits, there is clearly a moral reason why we should not mine uranium. It is passing strange that this argument is never raised against the Canadians, who have virtually the same requirements in respect of the use of uranium as has Australia. No-one ever suggests that the Canadians are being immoral'. It would seem to me that the advocates of the morality argument cannot have it both ways. If it is a moral argument for Australia, it is a moral argument for Canada. As it is, it seems that it is a moral argument only for Australia and that Canada gets the benefit of it.",89
149,Mr ANDREW ,ADJOURNMENT,"Wakefield) (10.46)-I rise tonight to debate the question of conservation. I suspect it would be very easy for the conservation debate, which has become so politically popular in the past 12 months, simply to. be taken over by one or other of the political parties represented in this Parliament. The reality is that the concern for the environment and for soil and soil conservation in particular is shared by honourable members on both sides of the House. It was my experience two weeks ago while visiting a farmer in my electorate of Wakefield to discover conservation techniques being put in place which I think warrant my airing in this House and ought to be. considered by a number of the training institutions in my State as an example of the way in which soil conservation should be achieved. The farmer to whom I refer is a Mr Bill Evans, who farms 450 hectares of almost idyllic country on the edge of the Barossa Valley in a small town called Keyneton. Mr Evans, whose family has farmed this country for some time, noted that increasing areas were being subjected to what he feared was encroaching salinity. He embarked on a tree planting program that has become the talk not only of Keyneton and the Barossa Valley but of all those in South Australia who have said Mr Evans's farm following this tree planting program. In. less than five years to 1989, Mr Evans has covered 100 hectares of his 450-hectare property with trees. He has chosen mostly endemic species such as local red and blue gum and som.e Western Australian varieties of eucalypt that have been chosen principally for their salt tolerance. He has made a mixture of plantings to ensure that he has eucalypts, acacias, casuarinas, melaleucas and a few under-storey plants to give a green ground cover. As everyone in, the House will appreciate, this planting program has meant that Mr Evans has had to go without some of what the farm would normally have produced in the past five years. In fact, when one quarter of one's farm is covered with native trees one is bound not only to reduce one's productive area by one quarter, but also, in the process, to lock out the sheep from that area. Mr Evans has chosen in order to minimise the salinity, not to crop the farm other tnan in a few limited areas over the past four years. However, he has discovered, when the pressure of economic reality has forced him to turn stock back in, that it has been possible to have sheep among young plantings of native trees within 18 months of the trees' being planted. He, tells me that rainfall and young growth of those trees have meant that the sheep have tended to 'attack the trees at about the 18-month stage, but he believes that sheep can be turned back after about two years without doing any damage at all. This provides an exciting opportunity for farmers who wish to conserve their soil and restore some of what has been abused unintentionally on any farm' anywhere in Australia to turn stock back into paddocks within two years of planting, restricting stock access to an area for a maximum of only two years. I should point out that Mr Evans's technique is to rip the area prior to planting as deeply as he can using a four-wheel drive tractor and a ripper. He then plants the trees in the rip mark. 'He finds that with this technique, in the soil types that predominate on the edge of the Barossa Valley in the Keyneton area, he does not have to offer any additional summer watering at all. He simply places the trees in the rip, closes the hole in behind them, and they survive. He intends to turn this into an economically viable operation by harvesting most of the varieties that he has planted. He intends that only about 10 per cent of the 120,000 trees that he has planted over a five-year period will remain there permanently; the others will be progressively harvested on a schedule designed to allow him to harvest and replant the 100 hectares that he has set aside for this sort of forestry growth. I commend him on' the work he has done and on the essential role he is playing in teaching other farmers how to both plant trees and conserve their soil.",90
150,Mr SNOWDON ,ADJOURNMENT,"Northern Territory) (lO.SI)-Tonight I rise to discuss a question of great importance to my electorate of the Northern Territory and ,to this Parliament. It is the question of consultation with Aboriginal people about matters which affect them. Last week in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, as honourable members no doubt will have seen on news reports, the Northern Territory Government introduced a Bill called the Aboriginal Areas Protection Bill 1989. The title was subsequently amended to the Northern Territory Aboriginal Sacred Sites Bill 1989, as I understand it. This Bill, 22 pages of amendments to an already existing piece of legislation, was introduced into the Legislative Assembly on Thursday afternoon and debated through the late hours of the night and the early hours of Friday morning, until about 2' o'clock, without any discussion, consultation or by-your-Ieave by the Northern Territory Government with Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory. I want t6 point out what this demonstrates. It demonstrates the hypocrisy and the contradictions of statements made by various Opposition spokesmen in relation to Aboriginal affairs, both in this place and in the Northern Territory. On a number of occasions they have lambasted this Government-particularly the Northern Territory senator, Grant Tambling-for a supposed lack of consultation about the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commissiol) (ATSIC) legislation which was passed in this House just recently and sits before the Senate. Senator Tambling said-and the Northern Territory Government has said-that the consultation process which was undertaken by the Commonwealth was inadequate. Yet it took 18 months. Senator Tambling has been called by one of' my colleagues 'the most useless piece of baggage to be sent from the Northern Territory to this Parliament'; a sentiment with which I concur. What has been said by these people is that the Minister responsible, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs ( Mr Hand), has not consulted, yet here we have an example of the way in which the Northern Territory Government undertakes its negotiations and consultations with Aboriginal people. Honourable members wiI1 have seen that there have been demonstrations in every major Territory centre. Today in my own home of Alice Springs some 600 Aboriginal people are demonstrating and have occupied the town council'lawns because of their concert) about this particular issue. What does the Northern Territory conservative senator say about this? He says it is all the idea of the land councils. Let me tell Opposition members here in this, House that perhaps they , ' could pass a passage on to Senator Tambling that this question is of importance to Aboriginal people throughout the Territory. It is not the land councils who have orchestrated a campaign to oppose this legislation; it is a question of whether or not this legislation is relevant to Aboriginal people. It has been demonstrated by their actipns since Thursday of last week that they are opposed to the legislation. Every major Aboriginal organisation of the Northern Territory in Tennant Creek, Katherine, Alice Springs and Darwin has voiced its opposition to it. Their opposition has been added to by the Uniting Church, the Catholic Church, the Anglican Church and the Human Rights Commission. That is not a problem for the Northern Territory Government because it believes that it has consulted adequately. But has it? What it has announced now, recognising the haste with which it has introduced this legislation to pass through the Legislative Assembly, is that it is going to undertake a post facto series of consultations. It hasÂ· passed the legislation. It is now going to go and explain what the legislation means to people. The Northern Territory community deserves better than that. It demonstrates the parochialism with which the Northern Territory Government treats the Northern Territory community. The Government is not prepared to deal with the non-Aboriginal community in the same way it deals with the Aboriginal community. It would not dare introduce a piece of legislation like this, which is of so much importance to Aboriginal spirituality and culture, to any other section of the community without consultation. The Bill allows, Mr Deputy Speaker, for your information, for a ministerial prerogative to destroy sacred sites. That is the ultimate. The Northern Territory Government is wondering why Aboriginal people in the Territory are concerned about it. It is wondering why Aboriginal people in the Territory are up in arms about it. Yet what do we hear from the Northern Territory senator and those protagonists on the Opposition benches who have been critical of this Government in terms of its consultation on ATSIC? Not a solitary word. Thus the hypocrisy. Thus the contradiction. It demonstrates yet again that the Opposition is fine when it comes to making heroic statements and breast beating about what it will do in government but what it does in opposition is hypocritical. What Opposition members see their confreres do in the Northern Territory is exactly what they say in this place they would not do and oppose the Commonwealth Government on.",91

152,Mr TIM FISCHER ,ADJOURNMENT,"Farrer) (10.56)Before proceeding to raise the matter of interest rates as they relate in broad terms to my portfolio of veterans' affairs, let me comment briefly on the submission made by the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Snowdon) tonight in discussing certain controversial Aboriginal issues. As I recall it, the last time the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) went to the Northern Territory to have a series of meetings with various groups of Aboriginals, the honourable member for Northern Territory dignified the occasion by conducting a brawl, as was reported in the media. Mr Snowdon- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. That is a reflection on my person and suggests I was involved in an unseemly and criminal act, a point which I reject. I suggest, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you ask the honourable member to withdraw his statements.",92
153,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! There is no point of order but the honourable member for Farrer should withdraw any imputation he may have been making on the honourable member for Northern Territory.,92
154,Mr TIM FISCHER,ADJOURNMENT,"I withdraw any imputation I was making on his .character. I made no reference to any criminal act whatsoever and I referred to published reports which were in the papers up there in the Northern Territory. Mr Simmons- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I think the honourable member for Farrer should be aware that, under the Standing Orders, if he wants to make any comments regarding a member of this House he is required to do so under a substantive motion.",92
155,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"There is no point of order but if the honourable member for Farrer wishes to make any points against an honourable member, he should do so by substantive motion. MrSnowdon- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a further point of order. Not only has the honourable member for Farrer impugned my character but he has not even been able to refer to the .. reports correctly.

157,Mr TIM FISCHER,ADJOURNMENT,"Tl1ere clearly is a lot of sensitivity in the Northern Territory about these related matters but let me turn to the question of interest rates as it relates to veterans' affairs. r am pleased to see the honourable member for Gwydir ( Mr Anderson) in the Hou-e because he has indicated' in his strong work as an honourable member how much these interest rates hikes are impacting right across the board-not just on the home buyer but on many small business operators, farmers, veterans and war widows. The casual overdraft rate has hit 23.49 per cent, a far cry from the 17 per cent which"" has been highlighted in the media,.. That is having a huge impact on .many people, not just home buyers, as I mentioned. We are almost back to the grim days of the Whitlam era, with Treasurers such as Crean, Cairns and Hayden, for which we paid such an enormous price at that time. We now face those days again under this Hawke Government, with the current Treasurer ( Mr Keating) not in the country at this time. In terms of this equation on interest rates, under the new defence service home loans scheme referred to in the response to theÂ·, Cross Report on the Australian Defence Force by the Minister at the table, the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel ( Mr Simmons), we have reached the stage now where, under the formula whereby the amount of subsidy will only be 40 per cent of the market rate, interest rates have crept, up so that under the new .scheme eligible people will pay 10.6 per cent on that $40,000 whereas it was 6.85 per cent on $25,000 under the old scheme. I appeal to eligible servicemen to study carefully the small print of this new scheme which commences in 1991. It is 'a quite complex scheme. It has some advantages in it, and I concede that freely. It moves from $25,000 to $40,000. But equally the interest rate factor payable . under the new scheme as things stand at the moment would be 10.6 per cent, a far cry from the 6.85 per cent under the old scheme.

159,Mr HOWE ,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (l) Press clippings of relevance to the Social Security portfolio and selective monitoring of radio and television news items are provided to my office eaGh week day. (2) This facility has been provided by Monitair Pty Ltd each week day since February. 1985. Prior to this a press clipping and media Â·monitoring service was not used. $83,500 (3) and (4) Monitair Pty Ltd also supplies sets of 86,000 press clippings and radio and. television monitoring 91,000 to the Ministerial and Public Relations Branch in my 93,000 Department. Copies of these are then produced within 91,450 the Department for distribution to Senior Executive 40,921 Service officers in the Department's Central Office and to State Directors. Copies are also provided by agreement to Mr David Connolly, the Shadow Minister for Social Security, and to the Standing Committee on Community Affairs. (5) No costs for a press clipping and media monitoring service were incurred in 1983 and 1984. The . costs since then have been: $4880 in 1985; $14434 in 1986; $17726 in 1987 and $25994 in 1988. (6) Monitair Pty Ltd has been the supplier continuously since February 1985. (7) At the time Monitair was first engaged by the Department in February 1985, there was no other press clippings service able to ing week-day delivery in Canberra. The only available alternative at that time was to have clippings flown down from Sydney, involving considerable expense. Accordingly, the original arrangement did not involve public tendering. This was superseded in July 1987 when the Department of Administrative Services established a PC?riod contract (PC62/07586U / I). The contract runs until June 1990. (8) The Department of Social Security. (9) and (10) Not known. The period contract was arranged by the Department of Administrative Services. (II) The service is based on information in the public domain. International Labour Organisation Conventions (Question No. 1569) Mr Hollis asked the Minister for Industrial Relations, upon notice, on 1 March 1989: Is he able to say which International Labour Organisation Conventions were applied by Britain and France to the non-metropolitan territories in the Pacific for whose international relations they were responsible, including 'any trust territories for which they were administering authorities, before those territories became independent. EmptyHere honourable member's question is as follows: There are no former French Territories in the Pacific where ,fLO Conventions were applied by France. Table ""I below lists by number the Conventions which were applied by the United Kingdom to the non-metropolitan territories in the Pacific for whose international relations they were responsible before those territories became independent.

160,Mr MCARTHUR ,TO IN TABLE I,"the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support, upon notice, on 2 March 1989: (I) What Commonwealth monies have been aIlocated as part of the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Program to the Barwon River Bridge project in Geelong. (2) To which body was this money allocated. (3) How have the funds been used. (4) Is the Minister able to furnish particulars C;f the present relationships between Lewis Constructions, the Road Construction Authority (RCA) and the unions involved in the project. (5) By how much has the cost of the 'project increased and who will be funding this increase. (6) What is the present expected date of completion of the project. (7) To what extent is the RCA accountable for ensuring that Commonwealth funds reach their intended destination. (8) Have funds provided for the project been used on any other public works. Mr Robert Brown-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I to 8) The Barwon River Bridge and approaches is an approved Urban 'Arterial Road project under the Australian Bicentennial Road Development (ABRD) Program with a commitment to the ABRD Fund of $16.2 million. The project was jointly funded with the Victorian Government. Tl:le Road Construction Authority (RCA) of Victoria has advised that all Federal funds ($16.2 million) have been fuIly expended on the project. FoIlowing negotiations between the RCA, the contractor Lewis Constructions and the unions, the project recommended on 3 May 1989. The RCA expects the project to be completed approximately one year from recommencement of the work. At this stage, there has been no agreement reached between the RCA and Lewis Constructions regarding any increase in the cost of the project due to the industrial dispute. Any increase in cost will be the subject of negotiations between the Victorian Government and the contractors, Lewis Constructions. The RCAÂ· advise that the project will be completed using State funds. Horticultural Products (Question No. 1648) Mr Rudd-ck asked the Minister representing the Minister (or Resour-s, upon notice, on 7 March 1989: (I) Does his Department, charge a fee for inspection of horticultural products exported from Australia. ' (2) Is the information in relation to fees charged kept on the basis of categories and sub-categories of products inspected. (3) In relation to all categories and sub-categories, what is the amount of fees charged in the years (a) 1986, (b) 1987 and (c) 1988. Mr Kerin-The Minister for Resources has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) Yes. (2) In relation to horticultural products, the answer is NO as all produce falling into this category is charged for on a user pays fee for service basis; this results in the charge being in direct proportion to the time spent on inspection regardless of the category Of product. (3) Fees for the inspection of horticultural products were first introduced on 1 January 1988 and therefore n9 fees were charged in the years (3) 1986 or (b) 1987. ; (c) For the year 1988 $l.l million in fees was recovered from the horticultural and associated industrieS. Horticultural Products (Question No. 1649)",96
161,Mr RUDDOCK ,TO IN TABLE I,"the Minister representing the Minister for Resources, upon notice, on 7 March 1989: (I) Were inspection fees charged for horticultural products imported to Australia decreased in the 198889 Budget; if so, to what extent. (2) Were export inspection charges for horticultural products increased ,in the same Budget; if so, to what extent. (3) What was the rationale for the different treatme!1t of what appear to be cost-recovery arrangements for similar activities. Mr Kerin-The Minister for Resources has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) No. In fact fees increased from $26 to $28 per half-hour for each officer performing the service. (2) Yes. (a) On-site attendance: from $46 fot the first half hour and $14 for each subsequent half hour to $47 and $15 respectively. (b) In-office services: from $19 per half hour to $20 per half hour. (3) While both export and import inspection charges are designed to recover 60% of their costs, the inspection regimes of each are dissimilar requiring different charging structures to ensure that the most equitable arrangements are in place. Export fees encompass a significant t'ravel component as in many instances the inspection is provided at the exporter's premises which may be some considerable distance from the inspector's headquarters. Import inspection, on the other hand, is generally undertaken at the port of discharge and involves minimal movement of staff. These travel costs are largely included in the first half hour charge for export inspection. General Aviation Aircraft (Question No. 1650) Mr Hawker asked the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support, upon notice, on 7 March 1989: (I) How many imported general aviation aircraft are waiting for a Certificate of Airworthiness in each State. (2) What is the average time from date of request to issue of certificate in each State. (3) How many airworthiness surveyors from the Civil Aviation Authority have been employed on Commonwealth of Australia inspections of imported aircraft for each of the last five years. (4) WiII the Government increase the number of airworthiness' surveyors on this work; if so, (a) by how many and (b) when.",96
162,Mrs KELLY ,TO IN TABLE I,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) As at 9 March 1989 the number of general aviation aircraft awaiting a Certificate of Airworthiness in each State was: New South Wales Queensland Victoria/Tasmania Western Australia South Australia/Northern Territory (2) The number of aircraft and the average time referred to below relate to aircraft for which applications and all the necessary supporting documentation - have been received by the Civil Aviation Authority. The average time from date of request to issue of certificate in each State is: New South Wales-5-7 days Queensland-3.1 weeks Victoria/Tasmania-2 weeks Western Australia-5 days South Australia/Northern Territory-7 days (3) Airworthiness Surveyors are generally employed on a range of duties which are varied over a period of time in accordance with industry needs and other priorities. The averages quoted below are estimates of many years spent on the Certificate of Airworthiness function, rather than the number of Surveyors dedicated full-time to the task. 1984-11.5 1985-12.3 1986-11.9 1987-12.1 1988-11.9 (4) The employment of Airworthiness Surveyors is essentially a matter for the Board and management of the Civil Aviation Authority to determine. However, Government is concerned to ensure that applications for Certificates of Airworthiness are processed in the most expeditious manner having regard to the preservation and observance of safety standards and the efficient application of finite resources. Perth Airport Land (Question No. 1666) Mr Blunt asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 4 April 1989: (I) Does the Commonwealth own land near Perth Airport, within the City of Belmont, described as the ""Newburn Land"". (2) Is it proposed to transfer this land to the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC); if so, when wiIP this take place. (3) If it is not proposed to transfer the land to the F AC, why not. (4) Have consultants been approached to provide information on alternative uses of the land; if so, (a) why has that course of action been adopted and (b) what advice has been received. (5) Would the use of the land for other purposes interfere with the construction of a parallel runway 33 at Perth Airport. 30 (6) Does the existing plan for the development of 42 Perth Airport stiII determine developmental changes nil at the Airport; if not, is it in need of revision. 3 Mr West-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Land known as the ""Newburn Land"" is held in the name of the ""Commonwealth of Australia"". (2) The land was acquired Jor future expansion of Perth Airport and will be reserved for this purpose by the Commonwealth. The timing of transfer is currently under consideration. (3) See 2. (4) Some investigation of the potential for interim usage of the land has been undertaken, prior to its development for airport uses. However, no consultants have been engaged. (5) No. (6) This question should be directed to my colleague, the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support. Department of Primary Industries and Energy: Security Checks of Staff (Question No. 1689) Mr John Scott asked the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 4 April 1989: (I) Does the Minister's Department and any authority responsible to the Minister have any requirement to conduct security checks of its staff; if so, are security checks carried out by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO). (2) If security checks are required and are not undertaken by ASIO, (a) by whom are they carried out and (b) does a review procedure equivalent to that contained in the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act apply to such checks; if not, why not. Mr Kerin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Yes. Security checks, for the purpose of assessing a person's suitability for a security clearance, are conducted on people selected to occupy Designated Security Assessment Positions (DSAPS) or Positions of Trust (POTS). Requesting ASIO to provide a security assessment forms part of the security clearance process for DSAPS-ie where access is required to national security information classified confidential and above, or to secure areas. (2) (a) and (b) For Positions of Trust, the Commonwealth Personnel Management Manual requires the Department/Agency to assess the general suitability of that occupant to occupy a position which may allow the occupant access to sensitive, nonnational security information or to valuable assets. The process involves: a check of the person's identity requesting a check of police records an assessment of the person's loyalty, trustworthiness, reliability and character. An ASIO security assessment is not required for POTS. For DSAPS, in addition to the above requirements for POTS, the Commonwealth's Protective Security Manual and Personnel Assessment Manual require that a security assessment be requested from ASIO, but only after the Departmental Secretary/Agency Head is satisfied as to a person's general suitability to occupy a DSAP. Where it is determined that, on general suitability grounds, a person is unsuitable to occupy a DSAP a decision is taken to cease further clearance action and a security assessment is not sought from ASIO. Where a Departmental Secretary / Agency Head decides not to grant a security clearance, or ceases further clearance action, based on general suitability grounds, the following avenues of appeal are available: under Division 3, Part 11/ of the Public Service Regulations the Merit Protection Review Agency for Commonwealth employees, and the Commonwealth Ombudsman for non-Commonwealth employees. Where appropriate the above procedures are fol- . lowed by Authorities under my Portfolio. Assistance to Students (Question No. 1713) Mr Wright asked the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 5 April 1989: (I) What significant changes have been made to assist Australian students at (a) secondary schools, (b) TAFE colleges, (c) colleges of advanced education or institutes of technology and (d) universities since the change of government in 1983. (2) What increases in assistance or changes have occurred since 1983 which have improved the lot of students. (3) What improvements have occurred since 1983 for adults who have desired (a) to upgrade their skills, (b) to return to an educational institution to improve their formal education or (c) to enable them to undertake advanced studies at tertiary level. Mr Dawkins-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) One of the most significant changes to have been made since 1983 to assist students at all levels of education has been in the area of direct financial assistance to students, specifically the nitionalisatibn of education allowances and unemployment benefits within a common allowances structure. The introduction in 1987 of Austudy amalgamated three former schemes into a single age-related scheme of assistance to full-time secondary and tertiary students aged 16 and over. (I a) The national strategy for schools, commenc. ing with the policy statement, Strengthening Australia's Schools in May 1988, has resulted in major collaborative action between the Commonwealth, States and Territory governments which will result in direct benefits for students. Agreement has been reached on Ten Common and Agreed National Goals for Schooling. Significant developments have occurred and will continue in such matters as curriculum development, in addressing. the problems faced by students required to move interstate, in developing an annual national report on schooling and in the professional development of teachers. As part of the rural education and training strategy, A Fair Go, the following initiatives were introduced: tax deductability will apply to donations to building funds for hostels providing residential accommodation for school-aged students from rural areas the Schools Capital Grants Program will be extended to include student hostels sponsored by non-government organisations The introduction in 1985 of an eight year general recurrent funding scheme (1985-1992) provided real increases in per capita grants for general operating expenditure each year to all government schools and to most non-government schools. Funding of sp.ecific purpose programs such as: the Participation and Equity Program (PEP) which operated from 1984 to 1987 and aimed to encourage young people to complete full secondary education. the Computer Education Program (CEP) which operated from 1983 to 19-6 and concentrated on secondary schools with the objective of introducing ,students and teachers to an understanding of computer technology. Projects of National Significance Program (PNS) The Projects of National Significance Program provides funding for 'innovative, applied research projects in areas where policy advice to the Government is being developed in relation to primary and secondary education in .Australia, and where clear national priorities have been identified. Through a limited riumber of projects the Commonwealth tests prototype educational programs, initiates investigations and extends nlltional intelligence about key i-u- and promising developments in Australian education. . T-o priority areas approved for PNS program ,funding under the Edl.\cation of Girls Element over the period 1988-90 are ""The provision of a More Supportive School Environment for Girls"", and ""Improving Girls' Understanding of their Post School Optio-s and of the Links with School Subject Choices"". Thes- priorities are linked to the objectives and implementation of t""'e NPEG and are based on national agreement with systems. Projects are being undertaken as a collaborative effort by the States. Girls in, Mathematics and Scienc- Project The Government provided $Im over a two year period aimed at increasing girls participation in mathematics and science. This project will provide classroom materials to stipport schools in their efforts towards curriculum changes necessary to increase access by girls to mathematics and science at all levels. . (I b) A substantial iricrease in Commonwealth Grants to States and Territories for TAFE has enabled a major expansion of the T AFE system, particularly in outer metropolitan and rural areas. An increase in enrolments from 786,222 in 1983 to an estimated 933,500 in 1987, in TAFE vocational and preparatory courses, has resulted in: Major changes and new directions in Commonwealth policies for technical and further education were implemented in 1988. The objectives of this restructuring were to achieve, in partnership with State and Territory Governments: further'increases in participation in vocational education and training . improvements in the relevance of T AFE provision productivity improvements and efficiency gains in the use of resources greater industry involvement in T AFE; and an enhancement of the labour market prospects of the unemployed and other disadvantaged groups U'nder the new arrangements, the Government moved from a system of earmarked grants for T AfE to the provision of general recurrent grants together with substantial infrastructure grants subject to resource agreements with the States. The resource agreements provide an integrated approach to Commonwealth and State priorities for T AFE, enable flexibiltty in the use of Commonwealth funds and emphasis performance and outcomes in the delivery of vocational education and training (1 c and d) Since its election to office in 1983, this Government has achieved a sustained growth in higher education of some 12% in real terms. In a major expansion to the higher education system, an extra 49,000 places will be provided over the 198991 triennium. By 1991, the number of higher educa, tion places will have increased by over 130,000 above 1983 levels. A number of specific measures taken by this Government to facilitate equity of access to the system and - educe the effect of ,particular impediments to accCS!' and participation, include: The Higher Education Equity Program This provides funds to institutions to undertake programs to increase the participation of disadvantaged grqups in hig-er education. Pilot projects funded under this program in .1985-88 included the provision of special entry schemes, tertiary awareness programs, and special support programs. For the 1989-91 triennium, the Program has been expanded to encompass pilot initiatives for grants for innovative pilot programs to increase participation by disadvantaged groups, mainstream initiatives to provide seeding grants to integrate broadly based equity measures into institutions' mainstream activities, and a child care program to provide additional child care places for students in outer metropolitan and regional areas. Aboriginal Participation Initiative Since 1985, the Commonwealth Government has allocated funds through the Aboriginal Participation Initiative to provide additional earmarked places to higher education institutions for Aboriginal students. The Special Assistance for Students Program A further initiative of this Government was introduced in 1985. About $16 million has been provided to institutions for low-cost loans and grants to students needing assistance to continue their studies. Residential Accommodation This Government has also assisted students in higher education institutions through an increased provision of residential accommodation. (2) It is estimated that over 330,000 students will receive AUSTUDY allowance in 1989, compared with 152,000 under its predecessor schemes in 1983. Expenditure on these students has grown from $269 million in 1983 to an estimated $840 million in 1989. Per capita grants under the eight year recurrent funding scheme (1985-1992) were more than doubled in real terms for government secondary schools and increased by up to 30% in real terms for nongovernment secondary schools. Under the specific purposes programs, $180 million was provided to PEP and CEP. English as a Second Language Program (New Arrivals Element) From the beginning of 1988 the Government doubled the per capita rate of assistance paid to education authorities to provide intensive English language instruction for recently arrived children from overseas with little or no English. The rate is currently $2142 per student and the program is estimated to cost over $40 million in 1989. Projects of National Significance Program From 1983 to date approximately $2 million per calendar year has been used to fund projects. In 1989 $1,944,000 has been allocated to the Program. For sustained growth in higher education over the 1989-91 triennium, the Government will. make more than $9.4 billion available to institutions and, by 1991, the resources provided to the sector will have increased, in real terms, by 16% over 1988 levels. Higher Education Equity Program For the period 1985-88, funding equivalent to $1.3 million in current prices, was made available annually to pilot projects which meet the needs of people from low socio-economic backgrounds, Aborigines, women in non-traditional disciplines, people from immigrant backgrounds, and the disabled. Residential Accommodation From 1983 to 1988 nearly $8 million has been provided for this purpose. This contrasts with the less than $2 million which was provided for student residences in the previous five years. For the 1989-91 triennium, $20 million has been allocated to support student residential accommodation, particularly low cost accommodation. Some $1 J.3 million of this has been provided in 1989. For the 1989-91 triennium, the Program has been allocated $3.4 million for each year. Aboriginal Participation Initiative In the 1985-87 triennium, a total of $8.6 million was provided under this program forÂ· an additional 1,000 places. In 1988, $8.5 million was provided for a total of 1,440 Aboriginal enrolments. For the 1988-91 triennium, earmarked funding wi\l also be provided to bring the total number of. places being funded under the Initiative to about 3,000 by 1991. (3) (a) The Government has developed a range of innovative approaches to provide re-training and other assistance to those who are retrenched or threatened with retrenchment in regions affected by industry structural change. Packages of assistance have been specifically designed for industries such as Textiles, Clothing and Footwear, Heavy Engineering, Steel, Coal and Timber (in the Rainforests area). In 1988-89, a further major development has been to establish the Office of Labour Market Adjustment (OLMA) which will identify local training and other needs in industries/regions affected by structural. change, working in conjunction with industry, unions and local communities. Working with an overall appropriation of over $22 million for 1988/89, innovative responses are being developed to satisfy these needs. (b) Adult students wishing to return to full-time secondary study have benefited particularly from the introduction of Austudy. Under the former Adult Secondary Education Assistance Scheme (ASEAS) such students were assisted only for formal matriculation study at senior secondary level. Austudy provides them with assistance for any form of secondary study including, for example, study at year 10 level as preparation for entry to TAFE and studyÂ· of English as a second language. . The Government has increased expenditure i- the area of adult training directed to long-term unemployed disadvantaged or especially disadvantaged groups. There has been a rationalisation of program assistance to enable more flexible and relevant responses to adults and young people by combining the Adult Training Program and the Youth Training Program into one single Jobtrain program. As part of the Government's Social Justice Strategy, Jobtrairi has become an important vehicle for targeting 'assistance to those most in need. Adult Training Program Compared with a base expenditure of $8.0 million for around 2,500 persons assisted in 1984-85, expenditure rose to $29.5 million for around 15,300 persons assisted in 1987/88. The overall funds of $86.7 million for Jobtrain in 1988/89 will allow further significant increases in numbers of adults to be assisted. Tn 1988/89 it is estimated that around 2,500 sole parents will be assisted including 500 as part of the Jobs Education and Training (JET) program. Also, the program is targeted to assist around 7,000 persons in 1988/89 who are aged between 21-54 and unemployed for 12, months or more. Of these, around 2,500 will be, assisted as part of the Government's Newstart strategies. Commonwealth grants to 'the States for T AFE have increased from $233 million in 1983 to $292 million in 1988 and an estimated $322 million in 1989. Funds are being made available ($4.2 million in 1989) under the Advanced English for migrants program to enable TAFE authorities to provide courses to assist migrants increase English languages proficiency for occupational purposes or for further training in post-secondary institutions. Particular emphasis has been given to adult literacy through the provision of ,funds under the National Policy on Languages and States Grants legislation. A total of $4.6 million is being made available in 1989 under the Adult Literacy Program and the Non-Government Adult Education Program for courses and activities to combat illiteracy and develop the community's skills in communication, literacy and numeracy. (c) The general growth in places described above has enabled a growth in the number of adults enrolled in higher education. In 1983 there were 146,000 students aged 25 years or older in the higher education system. In 1988, this number had increased to 167,000. The improvement of access to higher education for a wider cross-section of the Australian community; including adults who wish to further their formal education, is a central concern of the reforms announced in the Government's White Paper on Higher Education. The Government is encouraging institutions to make greater use of measures which facilitate access and progress of students through the system, and a number of these measures will be of particular 'relevance to adults. They include more flexible selection procedures and admission requirements, more efficient credit transfer arrangements, greater use of bridging and remedial programs, and better student support services. Many adults have benefited, and will continue to do so, through the initiatives supported under the Higher Education Equity Program. Under the current triennium, in particular, the provision of funding for additional child care places will be of particular benefit to parents on low incomes who would normally be unable to undertake higher education study because they could not afford child care.
