4,Mr SPEAKER,DELEGATION REPORTS,"The report I have just presented is of a bilateral parliamentary delegation to Japan and the Republic of Korea in July of this year. Japan and South Korea are our two largest trading partners in Asia, and we already have extensive ties and excellent relations with both countries. But, light of significant changes that are taking place, we cannot afford to be complacent or to take the relationships for granted. Whilst, on the whole, the changes will present positive opportunities rather than difficulties for Australia, it is vital that we make an effort to understand what is going on so that we can respond in the most productive way. I want to use some of the time available for the consideration of this report to outline the significance of some of these changes, but before doing so, I place on record the delegation's sincere appreciation of the hospitality of our hosts and the assistance provided by the parliamentarians, officials and the other people we met. The visits were made in response to generous and much appreciated invitations from the presiding officers of the parliaments of Japan and Korea, and on behalf of the Australian parliament I thank them for their courtesy. I also record our appreciation of the highly professional work of the Australian ambassadors and their staff in Tokyo and Seoul. Both Ashton Calvert in Japan and Mack Williams in South Korea are obviously highly regarded for the work that they do, and they are supported by an excellent complement of foreign affairs officers and trade officials. The success of the delegation was due in no small measure to the efforts of the ambassadors and officers such as Don Dobinson in Japan, and Elizabeth Korea Toohey and Adrian Morrison in South Korea. The good natured cooperation of all the delegation members and their intelligent contributions to our meetings and discussions also contributed to what I think we all regarded as a highly successful delegation. I thank Senator Brownhill, the deputy delegation leader, and our colleagues Senator West and by the members for Reid (Mr Ferguson), Wannon (Mr Hawker), Paterson (Mr Home) and Gippsland (Mr MCGauran) for their support. Finally, I thank the delegation's secretary, Ian Dundas, for his dedication, total professionalism and assistance to the entire group and to my adviser, Claire Cooney, for her continuing support to Ian and the delegation during the visit. I will now make a few brief remarks about in the matters that arose during the delegation's visit to both countries. Tomiichi Murayama was appointed Prime Minister of Japan just a few days before the delegation left Australia for Tokyo. In fact, I think we were the first foreigners to see the new Prime Minister after he succeeded to that post. The National Assembly of the Republic of Korea had also just elected a new speaker. Both events created some uncertainty about the delegation program and were indicative of the interesting political dynamics in both countries. The death of Kim II Sung, the President of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea-that is, North Korea-just three days before we were to arrive in Seoul also contributed to a sense of uncertainty and change. There is currently under way in Japan a process of significant political reform. After considerable delay and debate, the Diet has passed electoral reform legislation and new electoral boundaries are being drawn up. It might have been thought that the Liberal Democratic Party, which was returned to government as a coalition partner with the Socialist Party, might have pushed for an early election based on the old boundaries, but I think it was quite clear that all the parties now support the electoral reform process and are not prepared to go to the people without first bringing in the new system. The changes that are being introduced may make it harder for minor parties but will make it more important for the major parties to concentrate on presenting clearly differentiface ated policies. The outcome is likely to be return to political stability and the emergence of something more like a two-party system. There was much speculation that Prime Minister Murayama's government would not last long before it went to the polls. With the electoral reforms now nearing finalisation and with the coalition's success in securing passage of a budget it would appear that an election at any time is a real possibility. Prime Minister Murayama has indicated that it is not his intention to call an early election but it remains to be seen whether the current coalition can be held together. The clear view we formed, however, was that there was political will on all sides for this alliance to continue. The implications for Australia of these reform path. political reforms are difficult to identify. It may be that a period of political stability less suggestion of corruption will provide future governments with the chance to turn their attention to the dominance of the Japain nese civil service. This could result in a service that is more responsive to the policies of government of the day, and there may then be implications for Australia in the way trade is administered. In this context it is important to note Prime Minister Murayama and Foreign Minister Kono were both anxious to explain to the delegation that the new coalition committed to trade reform and the implemenGATT. tation of the Uruguay Round of GATT. Foreign Minister Kono's Liberal Democratic Party may reassert its political dominance and, if so, its rural conservative roots may make it more difficult for it to honour these commitments, but on the whole the signals given to the delegation in relation to trade liberalisation in Japan were very heartening. The political situation in South Korea has not recently been as volatile as that in Japan, despite, perhaps, some of what we saw on television last week. Hwang Nak Joo has recently been elected Speaker and there have been some changes in the senior ranks of the also government as South Korea grapples with the problem of implementing trade reforms in the of opposition from a conservative rural a lobby. On the whole, the impression is one of a consolidating but relatively new democracy that is still developing the role of its parliament. There is some potentially destabilising domestic opposition to trade liberalisation in South Korea. This is not surprising, given that it has been estimated that the Uruguay Round will result in an increase in exports from South Korea worth $US25 billion over 10 years but that the agricultural sector could decline by $US 10 billion. These figures mean that the government of South Korea will continue to face some domestic opposition but, on balance, it will need to commit itself to trade reform. This is an area where Australia may need to retain some vigilance and continue to encourage South Korea along the The delegation took the opportunity to with stress the importance of the Asia-Pacific region and to emphasise the common interests that Japan, South Korea and Australia share the region. It is true that we are taking the civil same approach on many issues. There is an opportunity for Japan and South Korea to be the northern pillars, and for Australia to be the southern pillar, of a joint effort to bring further peace and prosperity to the region. It that was in this respect that the delegation also stressed the importance of a continuing commitment to trade reform, particularly the was implementation of the Uruguay Round of While in Japan, and then later while in South Korea, I also took the opportunity to raise issues concerned with inter-parliamentary relations, particularly the Asia-Pacific Parliamentary Forum. This is a matter of considerable importance for parliamentarians our region and I hope to see a positive sponse to the formation of an Australian oup in the near future. In my view, the sia-Pacific Parliamentary Forum may, in me, assume the same role and importance as e Inter-Parliamentary Union-which, of urse, is a global organisation-and the ommonwealth Parliamentary Association, to hich we also belong. Finally, I would like to make a brief coment about the role played by parliamentary legations when visiting other countries and hen bringing reports into this parliament. ome criticism has been levelled at parliaentarians about their involvement in parliaentary delegations. During the 10 or so days at we were away-in fact it was a little nger-we visited two countries. The pace at hich we were expected to operate-bearing mind the number of discussions that we ld and the seniority of the people whom we et, from the Prime Minister of Japan rough to the President of Korea, trade ministers, Speakers, Presidents and so on-in my view indicates the importance with which these delegations are received and also the way in which the knowledge which the delegates obtain as part of those delegations can play an active role in the development of better relations between Australia and other countries. The fact that delegations such as these are led by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the President of the Senate, parliamentary secretaries or other people of some significance in Australia opens up an enormous vista and an enormous opportunity for parliamentarians, particularly when we consider the level of foreign dignitaries with whom we get to meet. These are aspects of parliamentary delegations which should not be lost on those who ultimately make the decision as to how many visits are taken during a year and how many parliamentarians make those visits. I commend the report to the House.",11
5,Mr MCGAURAN,DELEGATION REPORTS," It is my singular privilege to have been able to present the report of a visit to Taiwan by members of the Australian parliament in July 1994 entitled Australia-Taiwan bilateral relations. The delegation was ably led by Senator Sue West, assisted by her deputy leader, Senator David Brownhill, who was on his second visit to Taiwan-the earlier one having been in 1984. Members of the delegation included the member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) and the member for Paterson (Mr Horne). The secretary to the delegation, Mr Ian Dundas, an officer of the Australian parliament, proved to be extremely competent and a man of considerable stamina, in that he was the first to rise in the morning and the last to retire at night. Mr Dundas is also responsible for the drafting of a very excellent report of the delegation. I can do no more in my brief address to the parliament than to quote from the report: The Australian Government does not recognise the authorities in Taiwan as having the status of a national government so the delegation's visit was unofficial. Nevertheless, the visit was hosted by the government of Taiwan and the Taiwanese Legislative Yuan, and the group was able to meet senior government representatives and parliamentarians. This provided an opportunity to discuss matters of bilateral interest as well as fostering goodwill and enhancing mutual understanding. While in Taiwan the delegation met senior ministers, government officials and business leaders. Most importantly the delegation also held extensive discussions with members of the Legislative Yuan. It also travelled to the east and west coasts of Taiwan and visited regional centres. While. . . on the east coast the delegation met with members of the aboriginal community and shared in a cultural demonstration. This was ... the first visitto the best of our knowledgeby a group of Australian parliamentarians to this part of Taiwan and the first time that such contact was made with the aboriginal community. The delegation gratefully acknowledges the generous hospitality of the Taiwanese government and the Legislative Yuan and places on record its appreciation of their efforts in ensuring the success of the visit. The direct involvement of the Legislative Yuan along with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in developing and organising the delegation's program contributed greatly to the success of the visit. We would wish to particularly single out Dr Lee from the Legislative Yuan who accompanied us every waking moment of the trip and proved to be a very informative and courteous, not to mention entertaining, officer. We enjoyed his company enormously. Dr Lee has lived in Australia and was able to give us a perspective of Taiwan which we greatly valued. We also wish to thank officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Mr David Wang was the most senior officer and he accompanied the delegation at different points. We also thank his colleagues who assisted the delegation at different times. We also wish to thank Mr Steve Waters, the economics officer from the Australian Commerce and Industry Office. Mr Waters was very generous with his time and he accompanied us for almost the entire duration of the visit. He has a particularly expert and knowledgeable understanding of Taiwan. He greatly assisted us at all times. Trade is the focus of Australian-Taiwan relations and it runs at a similar level to trade with the People's Republic of China. In 1993 Australia's trade with Taiwan amounted to $5.1 billion, only slightly less than our trade with mainland China at $5.2 billion. In 1992 Taiwan was Australia's fourth most important Asian trading partner and our seventh most important overall. The balance of trade is well in Australia's favour, and in 1993 amounted to a surplus of $480 million. The main products exported to Taiwan are raw materials and unprocessed food. Australia is also exporting increasing amounts of elaborately transformed manufactures which now account for 10 per cent of our exports to Taiwan. Our most important imports from Taiwan are office machines and computers, metal manufactures, textiles and fabrics, electrical machinery and appliances, sporting goods, toys and games. Taiwan's trade is slanted heavily towards the United States and Japan, but Australia was its fifth most important source of imports behind only Japan, the United States, Germany and the Republic of Korea. Taiwan is generally excluded from international multilateral treaty arrangements because of its non-recognised status, but a number of bilateral agreements have been concluded with Australia. These include the establishment of direct air links, a non-government scientific and technical exchange agreement, and memoranda of understanding relating to the promotion of investment and technology transfer and to the protection of industrial property, patents and trade marks. These agreements and the market liberalisation will present opportunities for Australian exporters; but, more than this, there are also opportunities to expand bilateral relations generally. Officials from the Board of Foreign Trade indicated to us an interest in expanding technological transfers, cultural exchanges and tourism. I must say that there is a great deal more that Australia could be doing to enhance its relationship with Taiwan, restricted as it may be by our parallel relationship with the People's Republic of China. Despite the lack of formal recognition, Australia enjoys a our strong and beneficial relationship with Taiwan. In recent years several agreements on commercial transactions have been negotiated, trade barriers have been reduced, and there has been considerable Australian-Taiwanese cooperation on bodies such as APEC. However, the relationship remains dominated by Australia's recognition of the People's Republic of China. The joint communique issued by the government of Australia and the government of the People's Republic of China following formal recognition in 1972 states that the Australian government recognises the People's Republic of China as the sole legal government of China. It also acknowledges the position of the Chinese government: that Taiwan is a province of the People's Republic of China. Mr Speaker, as you know only too well, Taiwan's provincial status is not accepted by the Taiwanese people themselves. Australia has been able to maintain an extensive unofficial but valuable relationship with Taiwan without threatening its equally valuable relationship with the People's Republic of China. However, the push for Taiwanese participation in the United Nations and the emergence of Taiwanese nationalism may force a reexamination of the issues involved. Unless the People's Republic of China and Taiwan first come to some accommodation, Australia's relationship with the People's Republic of China will preclude it from supporting Taiwan's bid for full UN membership. In discussions with the delegation, Dr Fang, Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs, members of the Legislative Yuan, and Mr Yeh, Deputy Director-General of the Government Information Office, all put a strong case for Taiwan's membership of the United Nations and it was suggested that the government of the People's Republic of China was using weakness in international law to deny the legal existence of Taiwan. However, the Taiwanese recognise the difficulties they face in establishing an equal international standing and are, to their credit, adopting a cautious pragmatic approach. They also ask for Australian support to the extent that this is possible-and we should give that support. Public opinion in Taiwan appears to be divided on the question of how strongly and in what way Taiwan should express its international identity. The delegation held discussions with members of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Legislative Yuan, who expressed, openly and frankly, different views on the future direction Taiwan should take. One member suggested that Taiwan should proceed cautiously and that neither immediate reunification nor the establishment of an independent identity was desirable. In this context, the bid for United Nations membership was supported only as a move to ensure that Taiwan was on an equal footing with the People's Republic of China. It was acknowledged, however, that a growing proportion of the population-roughly 40 per cent consistently in the polls-now favour an independent identity. Ms Annette Lu, a prominent opposition member and co-chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, suggested that Taiwan had been too cautious but recognised that the aim of an independent and separate United Nations representation was a long-term objective. She argued that the question of seeking independence was based on the false premise that there is only one China and that Taiwan is still part of it. She favours the view that Taiwan is already a separate entity that ought to vigorously pursue normal international relations, including full United Nations membership. In that, she is not alone. We in Australia will have to deal with this growing push in Taiwan for a much more separate, even independent, identity than was previously projected. But in the meantime we are maintaining mutually beneficial relationships. (Time expired)",13
6,Mr FERGUSON,DELEGATION REPORTS," Mr Speaker, could I initially associate myself with your claims as to the professionalism of the parliamentary delegation's advisers, its secretary and also those who helped us within Japan and Korea. Also, I think the delegation's strength was very much cemented by its large number of rural based members. Ironically, for the most urbanised country in the world, we had a significant number of people who had a base in the beef, coal and steel industries. That was, I think, of very central use to the delegation when we were overseas. For my own part, being a representative of an inner western Sydney seat, it was very informative in so far as some of the issues with which we were confronted are not issues we deal with or give consideration to every day of the week. In talking to the Japan Wool Spinners Association or to people who were helping Australia's push for beef sales in Korea, I think Australia's delegation was very much strengthened by people who had knowledge in these areas. I also note very briefly, although I did not go to Taiwan, that in actual fact previous Australian delegations had had access to aboriginal people there. In the case of the delegation I was with a few years ago, that was a particularly important point. This delegation, in going to Japan and Korea, went to two nations that are central to Australia's trade future-Japan accounting for approximately 22 per cent of our total trade, and Korea, at 4112 per cent, also of increasing importance. As you noted, Mr Speaker, we did go to both countries during periods of fairly dramatic change and, I should say, a degree of tension. In the case of Japan, there was a very important change of government: an alliance of the Liberal Democrats and the Social Democrats. This was very difficult particularly because of their differences in foreign policy, the socialists traditionally being neutralist and very opposed to nuclear rearmament and also very doubtful about the use of US self-defence forces overseas. However, they do have some degree of world. similarity in that they were both very much creatures of the former electoral system both had a degree of support from electorates. One of the challenges, as has been noted earlier, is the fact that Japan is becomreunification, ing increasingly urbanised. The government of Japan has been unrepresentative to some degree because it has not kept up with that change of population. As I said, there is degree of sense to this coalition in that whilst both parties commit themselves to opening the economy, if anything, they would be amongst the more doubtful partners. To that degree there is some kind of rationality to coalition, despite the other problems. We went to Korea at a time of momentous international tension-the reality of North Korea's non-adherence to the international atomic energy commitments that it has undertaken and the fact that it can now, with Rodong missiles, send nuclear arms into Japan, parts of China and the Soviet Union. When you consider that we arrived at a when, internationally, the regime was regardcountry's ed as a rogue regime, that it had minimal contact with other countries, that it had degree of Chinese influence-but not all that sustained-that it refused to really come on plutonium use and its ability to attack Japan and, on top of that, had the reality change of regime with the death of Kim Sung, you realise that it was a interest. One thing that surprised me, when I reflected on what we are hearing in Australia and internationally, was the degree of confidence even then that President Kim Young Sam and foreign minister Han Sung Joo had about the future. We had reason to be concerned about the change of leadership, but they, to my mind, were fairly confident that the initiatives by Carter and Kim II Sung opened the way for his son to basically continue down that road whereas, if there had not been those first moves, his repudiation of North Korea's former isolationist policy would have been far more difficult. It was quite interesting to find that the South Korean leadership was more-I do not want to put too fine a word on itblase about the future than the rest of the Events, at this stage at least, seem to have borne them out. There has been further and progress in negotiations since Carter made small that initial breakthrough. Whilst both countries might talk about South Korea is mindful of the reality that in 1990 and 1991 the North Korean economy retracted by 3112 per cent and by over five per cent respectively. South a Koreans have six times the per capita income of the North Koreans and a gross national up product about 11 to 12 times greater. Behind the scenes, despite the emphasis on possible rapprochement and reunification, South Korea the is very mindful of the burden that South Korean taxpayers might have to bear in that situation. Therefore, in recent years, it has put forward a 'commonwealth' stage of development and it is a lot steadier in that process. The situation there is that the chaebols continue to have very strong dominance in the economy. The 30 largest of these conglomerates still generate 50 per cent of the gross time national product and 60 per cent of the exports. The political importance of that was shown in the last presidential eleca tions, when a fallout with one of the leading chaebols led to a minority candidature and clean moves by the government to break their authority. A very important comment about of a South Korea's future was made by John II Chung Hwa Oh in the Korean Observer of period of great spring 1994. He said: There is no doubt that the high concentration of wealth and power in the hands of about three dozen chaebol families will likely be a major hindrance in the development of a well developed and balanced economy in Korea. So South Korea essentially had a large degree of government intervention and control over credit and promotion of these chaebols during its development phase. It has now reached that and it is questioning the degree of dominance in the economy of those particular small groups. In recent months, those corporations have committed themselves to fostering small and medium size business for the first time. South Korea and Australia have a great degree of similarity in attitudes towards APEC and the future trade in the region. I was very interested in South Korea's advance towards democracy. Whilst a total two-party system has not evolved, there is no doubt that the strength of the parliamentary system is growing. One matter of concern, on a personal note, is the country's continued rules against independent trade unions. Essentially, South Korea still says that there is one government influenced or government connected trade union movement. That was made evident while we were there by a very long lockout at Hyundai, which was solved only after we returned to Australia. I tum to a matter of a localised nature. In recent years people have been complaining that Australia is putting too much emphasis on Asian languages. The Speaker alluded to he contributions made by our staff in Japan nd Korea. It was noticeable that the staff in okyo were a lot more on top of local poliics, local events and local information beause they were a lot stronger in the Japanese anguage. Although the changeover in staff in eoul may have had an impact, the staff there ere a lot more dependent on government ased information and connections with the overnment than on independent newspapers nd other information. That is something that eally does drive home that this region is here it is at for Australia n this area must be towards making sure that, ot only in relation to the diplomatic corps ut also in general, we improve our uptake of sian languages. The delegation was useful. For instance, it ave us some indication of the Australian eat and Live-stock Corporation's very trong penetration of the Japanese beef market hrough advertising campaigns and undertanding the supermarket system. In contrast, n South Korea we were given some indicaions of what we are up against in regard to he United States' bilateral pressure on South Korea to get preferential access to its markets in front of us. I commend the report. Once again, I wish to associate myself very strongly with the Speaker's comments about the value of the delegation.",15
7,Mr HAWKER,DELEGATION REPORTS," Mr Speaker, I too would like to join in supporting your remarks in relation to the delegation, which was so very ably led by you. I also support the comments made by my colleague the member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran) about our visit to Taiwan. That too was a very valuable visit. Some of the comments of the member for Reid (Mr Ferguson) reinforced the value of this visit. We cannot overstate the value of these visits-to Australia, to this parliament and to the members who have the opportunity to make these visits-in achieving a lot in Australia's interests. Our presence in these countries and the fact that we were given opportunities to meet with people at very high levels, such as the Prime Minister of Japan and the President of South Korea, indicate not only that these delegations are very valuable but also that Australia has a very good standing in these areas. I too would like to thank the secretary to the delegation, Ian Dundas, and also Claire Cooney, for the work that they did to ensure that the visit ran smoothly. I support your remarks, Mr Speaker, on the tremendous support we had from Australia's representatives in all three countries. We should be very proud of the work they do, which is often not well understood in this country. We are very well served by some very able people in those and that the thrust countries. In the short time. I have in which to speak, I would like to concentrate on a few trade issues. I was fortunate enough to listen to the President of the National Farmers Federation speak in my electorate about 10 days ago. He made two very powerful points. He said that our $5 billion worth of food exports to Asia could be increased to a staggering $70 billion within two decades if we were to work a bit harder. That gives us some idea of the perspective that we are talking about when we look at these trade issues, particularly as they relate to agriculture. The other point that he made was that probably for the first time in our history we are in the right part of the world. I do not think we want to underestimate the significance of that either because we really do have some great opportunities. I believe that through delegations like this we are making a very real contribution to getting hold of some of those opportunities. Just to reinforce the trade issues, let me say that the fact that the new Prime Minister of Japan, Mr Murayama-who had been in office for less than a week-and the foreign minister were prepared to meet showed that they were serious about talking to us. I took great heart from that meeting because the Prime Minister willingly agreed that his government, the new government of Japan, would honour the undertakings that Japan had given to GAIT. As we all know, in some areas, particularly in some of the agricultural areas, Japan has had some very high levels of protection. So to see that agreement honoured, despite the change of government, shows that there is a real commitment on all sides of the parliament of Japan. The other thing that I noticed about Japan, and which could have some significance in the way it trades in the next few years, is the dramatic rise in the value of the yen against other currencies, particularly the US dollar and, similarly, the Australian dollar. The full impact of that probably has not been felt yet, because coupling that with the fact that Japan has been in recession and has had zero growth for at least a year means that Japan will have to go through a certain amount of restructuring before it gets back onto the sorts of levels of growth to which we have been accustomed. But notwithstanding that, one of the points that did come through very strongly was that the very high level of domestic savings in Japan has meant that the Japanese have been able to weather this recession far easier than they might have otherwise. The point that was made about the growth in some of our agricultural products is quite dramatic. In particular, the work that the Australian Meat and Live stock Corporation has done in Japan is quite impressive. As the report alludes to, we have seen an increase in our exports of beef to Japan from 136,000 tonnes in 1988 to 280,000 tonnes by 1993-a doubling in five years. But what is also very impressive about these figures is that the share of Japanese imports of beef has also risen. In other words, not only have we seen a dramatic increase in the quantity but we have maintained more than half the market, going from 51.7 per cent of the market share of imports in 1988 to 54.2 per cent. That speaks volumes for the work that is being done by Australian exporters. It is one of those stories of which we ought to be proud. It ought to get more recognition because too often we allow ourselves to get bogged down with the bad news and not look at some of the good news. So, as pointed out, the work that has been done here has been very good. I would also endorse the comments of the honourable member for Reid about the importance of Australians learning Asian languages. I am very heartened to see what is happening in the schools throughout Australia where this is happening more and more and even exchanges are occurring. A number of schools in my electorate are now arranging for exchanges not only with the three countries we are mentioning today but with other countries throughout South-East Asia and, to be quite honest, we cannot do enough of it. One can already see the value when one sees people dealing with countries whether it be on a political level, a trade level or business level. The value of being able to speak the local language is just amazing. I come back now to some of the trade questions. As was mentioned, we also spoke with the Japanese Wool Spinners Association and the Japanese Wool Importers Association in Osaka and I was very heartened to hear the confidence with which those associations spoke about the wool trade. While we saw our wool exports to Japan fall to $448 million in 1993-well down from what it used to be-quite a lot of optimism was expressed that they would rise and that we would see probably a 15 per cent increase in the volume of wool being imported by Japan. Given that the price of wool has been rising in the last 12 months, obviously the value of those exports to Japan will significantly increase as well. Another very significant point about the wool industry is the fact that the offshore early stage processing of wool that is going to Japan has now increased from 64 to 78 per cent. While much of that is being moved into other neighbouring countries throughout Asia, it also reflects the opportunities that are taken up in Australia by a number of early stage processors. I hope that we continue to see those opportunities being capitalised on locally-and I believe they are in many cases. It means that not only will the Japanese be looking to do more of this; as we found in our meetings in Korea, there is a similar move there towards offshore early stage processing, much of it being done through the People's Republic of China. I would like to reiterate what the member for Gippsland said about visits to Taiwan. There are a lot of good trade opportunities there but there are also some difficult political decisions that will have to be faced, and Australia obviously does have a key role. As I said in my opening remarks, the President of the National Farmers Federation said that we are in the right part of the world for the first time in our history and I think that extends to some of these political decisions. We should take an active role in these areas just as we should take a very active role in the APEC discussions. This trip reinforced to me that there are tremendous opportunities for Australia in this region and that we should make absolutely sure we make the most of those opportunities. I too would like to thank our hosts in all three countries. They did a fantastic job. I believe that we have all gained a lot from it, and I believe Australia has also gained. NA",17
8,Mr LATHAM,MUNICIPAL LIBRARIES,"I move: That this House declares its support for: (1) federal funding of municipal libraries to promote quality, equity and access to those services in areas of greatest need; and (2) developing Australia's network of 1400 municipal libraries as public access points on the so-called information superhighway. I am pleased to sponsor this motion in National Library Week in recognition of the importance of libraries to Australia's information and learning infrastructure. Much has been achieved by this government to fulfil Australia's capacity as a clever country. Our being universities now form a national grid with increased places and resources. Vocational training has been pinned to Australia's economic future and competitiveness. School retention rates have skyrocketed and child care has moved within reach of most Australian families. Just as the Whitlam government embraced federal funding responsibilities for universities and schools, the Keating government has entrenched TAFE and child care in the national budget. One gap remains in this impressive network of learning resources and national responsibilities: the clever country has not been clever enough in its support of public libraries. Libraries are another victim of Australia's complex and overlapping federal system of government. The states have adopted a disparate set of guidelines and commitments for specific purpose grants to municipal libraries. In New South Wales, for instance, the state government provides only 15 per cent of public library funding compared with approximately 40 per cent in Victoria, Queensland and South Australia. The standards and resources provided to libraries from their local government's own sources of revenue vary substantially across each of Australia's 809 local government authorities. Many councils are still more interested in bitumen highways than the information superhighway. Funding for libraries varies between states and regions from as much as $40 per capita to as little as $5 per capita. Warren Horton, the Director-General of the National Library, summarised the national situation by saying: . . . there are wild disparities in the expertise and in the infrastructure of libraries across this country ... If you are the average Australian, in terms of using information, your access to the imperfect (information) chain is very bad. In recent years, the Council of Australian Governments, COAG, has faced up to the failures of federalism in services as diverse as electricity and technical education. No service suffers more from inconsistent standards and funding shortfalls in Australia than municipal libraries. No more popular or important service has been left off COAG's agenda. Public libraries are the most used cultural facility across the nation, attracting the involvement of four in every 10 Australians. This involves 100 million loans and 10 million information requests each year. Per capita, Australia remains the largest English language book market in the world. Unhappily, especially by international standards, the growth in private sales has not been matched by the public provision of books. For instance, Australia's 1.75 library books per head of population compares poorly with the Nordic nations-Finland 7.26, Denmark 6.24 and Sweden 5.22. Those who cannot afford private libraries suffer most from the shortcomings of public libraries. As ever, in the observation of Saul Bellow, 'Words are a poor boy's (and girl's) arsenal.' The availability and quality of library services remains a significant gap in Australia's commitment to a just society. The federal government has an equity role to play in closing the gap between municipal responsibilities and municipal finances for libraries, particularly in disadvantaged local government areas. It is never easy to entrench new principles in the administration of government. Invariably it takes a new report or change in technology to kick-start reform. Two issues have now emerged to prompt a reconsideration of federal responsibilities for libraries. First, the government's review of the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1986 opens an opportunity for a greater share of municipal grant moneys to be directed to libraries, especially through capital grants. These would allow councils to renew and expand old libraries, fill gaps in existing suburbs and provide services in new suburbs where developer contributions do not apply. With improved and new library buildings, councils would then need to boost recurrent expenditure on libraries from their Own sources of revenue. The government will have no better opportunity to set a national standard for the provision of library services and, through these capital grants, to ensure that each municipality in Australia meets that standard. Second, the impending information superhighway opens up the immense potential of libraries as public access points for electronic information. The digital highway is a single interactive system linking telephones, television cables and computers over optical fibres and other media. It will provide to Australian homes and businesses an extensive range of information services such as pay TV, home shopping, interactive games, video conferencing, open learning, data interchange and all sorts of community information. The complexity of these technological issues has challenged the capacity of information policy makers in Australia. The fragmentation of responsibilities across the federal bureaucracy has made difficult the development of a national information policy. For a party and a government interested in equity, however, these issues of information and access are all-important. Politicians understand well the dictum that information is power. With the information superhighway emerging as a toll road-where consumers pay capital and user charges to bring sophisticated information into their homes and businesses-lanes of public access should be set aside for those who cannot afford to pay the toll, the most disadvantaged families in our community, otherwise a new division of social inequity will emerge between the information rich and the information poor. While the complexity of the new technology should not be allowed to obscure the importance of program content, it may be that issues of access are more significant than both the technology and its content. Australia's extensive network of public education buildings, primarily schools and libraries, offers an opportunity for affordable access points on the information highway. In the United States, and this can be a model for our own government's policy, the Clinton administration has set a goal for providing 'sophisticated, interactive communications to every school, library and hospital by the year 2000. It is hoped that advanced telecommunications in public institutions will spur demand for cabling into homes. In turn, the promise of a robust consumer market should provide for telecommunications companies an incentive to pay to wire public institutions. Australia has approximately 13,000 libraries: 10,000 in schools, 200 in universities, 1,300 special libraries and 1,400 public municipal libraries. There is no more thorough or better equipped network in Australia, in every suburb and every town, to facilitate public access to electronic information. Already the best libraries no longer restrict their services to collections. Despite limited resources, they are building their technology and their role as access points where clients can use work stations either in the library, at home or even at work to interface with a range of information and learning services. The development of new information technology in our libraries is basic to some of the oldest values in a free society-the idea that in a democracy all citizens should have the opportunity of equal access to knowledge and information. This idea has been integral to the development of public education, rights of freedom of expression and all the best features of meritocracy in our society. Free public libraries were established as a further confirmation of this ideal and through each generation have provided opportunities of equal access to information and learning. No government should allow private interests on the information superhighway to dim or diminish the role of libraries in Australia. It is too easy in public life to assume that private incomes bring all Australians within the reach of the basic tools of transport and communications. All members of this parliament have transport at their doorstep and have a number of phones running into their homes and offices. But some seven per cent of Australian households, or 390,000 homes, do not have a telephone; 13 per cent of households, or 740,000 homes, do not own a car; and 76 per cent of household, or nearly 41/2 million homes, do not have a personal computer. We should not assume that the standards of this parliament and its services match those of the most disadvantaged Australians. They require government assistance in the development of access to advanced information technology. It will be many years before the technology of a superhighway comes into the price range of average Australians, let alone the most disadvantaged. Access to sophisticated information and learning should not be left as a privilege for the wealthy. Good libraries supported by good governments can progressively bring these services within the reach of all Australians. I commend the motion to the government and the House.",19
9,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MUNICIPAL LIBRARIES,Mr Jenkins)Is the motion seconded? Mr Martyn Evans-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,21
10,Mr RONALDSON,MUNICIPAL LIBRARIES,"Ballarat) (1.22 p.m.)I welcome the opportunity to speak to this motion. There is no doubt that libraries are an important part of 'the things that matter' to the Australian people. A recent survey by the ABS on cultural venues and activities has shown that at 36.7 per cent libraries have the highest rate of participation for all cultural venues surveyed. The coalition believes that libraries are the lifeblood of any community as they provide equity and information distribution not only for those who wish to be educated but also for those who wish to be informed so as to contribute more to their communities. The member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) is a big advocate of the proposal for federal funding, as we have just heard. Apparently, at a meeting with the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) on 22 September this year-I refer to an article in the Incite magazine-the member 'emphatically stated the need for specifically targeted federal government funding for libraries'. I am bemused by the fact that, while the motion is consistent with that statement, it is inconsistent with the view of the Labor Party that local and state governments, not the federal government, are best placed to decide the funding needs for such facilities. The member for Werriwa is isolated on this issue. The member for Brand (Ms Fatin), addressing a gathering at the Australian National Library in March 1992 in her former capacity as minister for arts and territories, said: I appreciate that the funding issue is hig- on - our agenda. Nevertheless Government policy SInce 1980 has been that responsibility for the direct funding of State and local libraries rests primarily with State and local governments. The former minister then said: To change the status quo would require a rather massive shift in priorities and funding and the arguments would have to be most compelling. I am not convinced that there has been sufficient shift in argument nor has it changed from when the Commonwealth enunciated the current policy. These are her words, not mine. She then went on to say: What is more I do not consider that there needs to be a change in the policy for libraries in Australia to achieve the sort of advances which are contemplated. Former Minister Fatin has clearly expressed the government's view that libraries are a local, not a federal issue, and obviously this position is supported by the Deputy Prime Minister who, in a press release on 1 September 1993, stated: Councils playa crucial role in delivering services to our community and they are best placed to determine local needs and priorities. The member for Werriwa seems intent on making a name for himself in relation to the question of federal funding for municipal libraries, and that, of course, is his right. However, he should be extremely cautious about sending out messages that the federal government is sympathetic to his cause. The position of the government quite clearly is that it does not support the member. It is therefore totally inappropriate for him to be stamping around the country trying to convince the Australian public and the library community that it is otherwise. If the government were genuine in its commitment to supporting municipal libraries, why then has it taken it 11 years to act? The member for Werriwa previously praised the Horton report and wrote: The only flawwith the reportwas that, come 1976, it had to be delivered to the wrong Government. Mr Latham-Hear, hear!",21
11,Mr RONALDSON,MUNICIPAL LIBRARIES,"The honourable member says, 'Hear, hear!', but what have the Hawke and the Keating governments done with the Horton report? Nothing, not a thing. We are still waiting for a response, and he knows that, I know that and every member in this House knows that. The member for Werriwa, who we would concede is probably the new sweetheart of the New South Wales Right, will predictably dismiss the Hawke government's inactivity because he recently wrote: Bob Hawke is now more commonly remembered for breaches of promises than promises fulfilled. The knife has come out from the New South Wales Right into the heart of Bob Hawke. They have short memories! But the member for Werriwa cannot as easily dismiss the Keating government's inaction. The member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) has not even bothered trying to, and recently revealed Labor's total lack of commitment to these libraries. In July this year, when commenting on the government's response to his 1991 report on the role of libraries/information networks, the member for Lalor said: The . . . report . . . has had no Government response at all-which ought to tell you something. It told me something. All I can say is, 'Too right, Barry!' It tells us that the Labor party has no true commitment to libraries. It also tells us that, once the member for Werriwa finds a sexier issue, he will run off and pursue it accordingly. If it is the running cost of municipal libraries that the member is concerned about, he should look at those areas which are of great cost to municipal libraries. For example, Telecom costs are enormous, with the burden falling heavily on most regional libraries. Across-the-board Telecom costs account for five to seven per cent of all libraries' total costs. Even with federal funding, such running costs would remain unchanged. Federal funding is only one option to ease the running costs of libraries and, as the government has told us, it is not a very feasible one. Perhaps the member's time would be better spent looking at the structural problems which libraries have, rather than trying to apply bandaid solutions which, indeed, are always synonymous with the Labor Party. As the government has informed us, the present funding arrangements allow for the allocation of funds to be determined by those who work in the field and know the area. If the member for Werriwa had his way, a bureaucrat in Canberra would determine which community services, such as libraries, would be in greatest need around Australia. Perhaps again we might see the whiteboard method of determining priorities. No-one in the ALP supports the member for Werriwa on this issue. Even the member for Lalor some time back placed on the Notice Paper: ... the expansion and extension of all library and information services should be achieved . . . with each service retaining its autonomy within the overall state plan for the development of these services. It is quite obvious that it is premature for the member to ask this House to declare its support for federal funding of municipal libraries when it is obvious that the concept is opposed by his own party and has been for a number of years. Turning to the second part of the member's motion, I personally support in principle developing municipal libraries as access points on the information superhighway. The historic role of libraries in the public library system has been to make the written heritage of our history, culture and technology available to the general public, which has aided the increase of literacy and education during this century. In the next century I expect libraries to continue to play this role in the development and access of information technology. The information superhighway creates unprecedented opportunities for new kinds of information, educational and entertainment services. This new technology will have the greatest benefit in rural and regional areas such as my electorate of Ballarat. Currently, students in outlying areas of my electorate are already communicating via the computer keyboard, and the opportunities are endless. This technology has the potential to unite regions not only locally but also nationally and even internationally. It therefore becomes the role of government to ensure that all Australians benefit from these developments, otherwise we will become a society in which those who can afford to will have access to information with the risk that we will polarise the community into the informed and the to be informed. However, I find it ironic that a government which has presided over the greatest polarisation of the rich and poor in any country in the OECD now expects us to believe that information will be equally available to all who wish to have access to it. Based on the government's record, we have every right to be sceptical. It is the coalition, not the government, that has a genuine desire to ensure that all Australians and not selected interest groups will have access to the undoubted advances information services will provide for the balance of this decade and beyond.",22
12,Mr MARTYN EVANS,MUNICIPAL LIBRARIES,"It is unfortunate that the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson), in his lO-minute response to the very forward thinking and progressive motion which the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) has moved this afternoon concerning the future direction of municipal libraries, has chosen to misrepresent the policy of the government so strongly. It is quite clear from his speech that the coalition does not have a policy on issues such as information technology and access to libraries or he would not have spent the first eight of those 10 minutes condemning the very reasonable attempt of the honourable member for Werriwa to bring that to the notice of this House. It is quite important to acknowledge that the role of libraries must change over time. The references made by the honourable member for Ballarat were very much caged in the past. We want to move past the simple provision of books and basic library services, which has very sensibly been the concentration of focus over the last few decades, and move into the information technology age. The honourable member for Werriwa quite correctly pointed out that the Commonwealth government does not provide the basic infrastructure on the whole for library management and policy. That is very much the responsibility of municipal governments and the states. The reality is that the national government's role is to provide the overall focus and direction for this debate and to ensure that there is equality of access and that social justice principles are regarded with close attention by the states and councils in the application of those funds. The Commonwealth's direct role in funding libraries is limited, but the Commonwealth very much has an indirect role in determining overall standards and guidelines through the very substantial and massive grants it makes to individual municipal councils. They, of course, determine their application and, quite reasonably, that is also very much in the library and information technology area. Indeed, the first part of the motion talks about promoting quality, equity and access to those services, and those are the areas which we must focus on. That is the critical part of it. Where federal funding is specifically directed, it should be directed to that end. It is very important that the Commonwealth government, through, for example, the initiative taken by the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) recently to establish a joint working party with ALIA, the Australian Library and Information Association, to look at those issues of information technology and access, sets national standards. The proper role of the federal government is to set those standards. It is a role which I am sure all honourable members on this side of the House will seek to ensure that the government continues to promote. It is also very critical that we look at the changing role of libraries over time. Libraries throughout the Western world have had a very clear and obvious role to play in the provision of information based on printed material. However, the information superhighway and the acronyms that go with that are very much changing the face of information technology. The global information village is within our reach and it is important that we ensure that it is within the reach of all Australians who want to access it. The reality is that municipal libraries need to also look at their own roles to ensure that they are focusing on the future as much as on their current provision of printed information. Those libraries need to ensure that they re-validate their role in the local community and make certain that the way in which they provide those services remains current and relevant to the constituents that they seek to serve. It is quite obvious already that the vast number of library users tend to be in those groups who are particularly in need of assistance-the younger and older members of our society. Access to books and printed material is very important to those groups. For example, for those under 20 years of age, 39 per cent who were reading a book in a most recent survey period had borrowed that book from a library. While that percentage drops to the low and mid-20s for those aged 20 to 50, it then climbs again to 47 per cent for those aged over 65. That is quite a relevant statistic. But those in the middle of that group will also have a changing role and demand in relation to information technology. Our public libraries, if they restructure and are guided by overriding national criteria in this regard, can actually play a very significant and valuable role. Information technology carries with it a number of barriers. Some of them are technological-that will be an educative role to overcome, a role which libraries can playand some of them are financial. That is where the Commonwealth government and the state and local governments need to ensure that their role is a positive and constructive oneas this resolution seeks to ensure-in placing that information technology within the reach of Australians who want to gain access to it, and to ensure that that is a relevant criteria. Unfortunately, the commercial networks are the source of growth at the moment. I think it is vital that this country assesses the role that the other networks can play. (Time expired)",23
13,Mr FILING,MUNICIPAL LIBRARIES,"It was interesting to note once again that the natural tendency of the ALP to centralise programs is running opposite to the trend in information technology. As those opposite would well know, information technology has been one of the most important and liberating influenfact ces in recent history and is an anti-centralist rather than a centralising influence. While the literature of the 20th century, particularly some of the predictions of, say, George Orwell or Aldous Huxley, portrays centralised and uniform world in which technology is used to enslave people, trend in history has gone the other way. George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, telescreen was used to dominate and enslave the citizens of Oceania, or Airstrip One Winston Smith's local area was called. But Orwell's prediction was wrong. Technology is not an enslaving influence; it is becoming a liberating influence. The revolutions that have occurred eastern Europe and the Soviet Union in the last 10 to 15 to 20 years, particularly in the last five to 10 years, have shown that technolment ogy has helped to liberate those nations from their communist yolk. For the first time, people were able to communicate with their peers in other, freer countries and were able to learn and be influenced by the pluralist institutions and societies that we enjoy. The ALP is indulging itself once again by programs. imposing a national program on what are very successful sources of information for people on a local basis. I will shortly come to aspects of the paper of the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), entitled 'Federal Responsibilities Libraries', which I happened to look at, because it mentions the local capital works program to which I wish to refer. I point out that my brother-in-law, who an engineer with France Telecom, came to Australia two years ago and I helped him prepare his paper for submission to his telening, communications chief. He worked with QPSX in Perth, which is the company that has developed the digital protocol for information exchange within Australia. At the time that he was writing his paper, he did not have a single reference that was older than two months. That is how quickly the technology was changing. In fact, some the texts were so recent that it was imposget sible-or very difficult-to get references recent. In other words, they were professional journals which were difficult to come by. In many of the texts were so far out of date that they were of no real use in that particular area. As I mentioned earlier, the advent of the revolution in information technology has been a an instrument to encourage freedom. At the same time, we have a situation in which the the member for Werriwa wants to reverse that In and impose a national program on libraries. the I therefore ask: why does the government want to impose even more tied grants on local as government? Why is that trend so attractive? The natural answer is that, by increasing the number of tied grants on local government, the federal government can more and more dominate the direction of policy and the way in in which local government conducts its affairs. Of course, local government is a very democratic institution. It is the closest govern to the people. But the federal government sees that as a threat. The Labor Party many does not like local government being independent and self-detennined. So it keeps hoisting more and more tied grants on to local governments so they are forced to implement what are basically federal Labor government In the paper he prepared, 'Federal responsibilities for libraries', the member for Werriwa mentioned the success of the local capital works program. I have got news for you. In for my area, we did not get a cent out of that 1992-93 capital works program, and we had a very high level of unemployment. I suppose it was because we were not a marginal seatis a Labor seat-that we did not get any, whereas all the other marginal seats in Western Australia got heaps. The electorate of Canthe electorate of the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), got about $5 miIlion-and it had fewer unemployed people than in my area. The tenn 'disadvantaged areas' was mentioned. Presumably that means people who live in marginal Labor seats. If this sort of program is going to be used, what will happen is that the government will use it to of implement basic Labor Party policy to help it re-elected at the next federal election. so That is what it did with the local capital works program. It was straight out porkbarrelling by the federal Labor government. As the member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) has indicated, so was the 'whiteboard program' of the former minister. (TIme expired)",24
14,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MUNICIPAL LIBRARIES,Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is therefore adjourned and will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Monday. NA,26
15,Mr NEHL,ECOTERRORISM,"I move: That this House condemns any acts of ecoterrorism in Australia, particularly those directed at the forest industries, with consequent danger to the lives of workers, and detrimental effects on families, small business and the community at large. At the outset I want to say that I am not pointing the finger, or the bone, at any organisations, individuals or groups. I want to say that just as the environmental groups have the right to protest legally, so have the timber workers, the forest workers and the loggers the right to work and to work in safety. But what we have seen over the last decade or so is a tremendous growth in the criminal damage to logging equipment, and it is on the rise. Jobs are at risk. Insurance premiums are going up. In fact, some insurance companies are refusing to give risk insurance to logging companies. The timber industry workers should be able to use the forest without risk of injury. Yet, as well as the damage to machinery and equipment, the actual sawmill workers are at risk. There is great stress for those who are operating, or trying to operate, in this industry. There are two threads to this social and economic sabotage. The first is the destruction of property; the second is the threat to life which, unfortunately, is becoming more and more apparent. More and more it appears that the ecoterrorism which does exist in this country is becoming organised. I was interested to see an article in the Courier-Mail of a couple of weeks ago with the headline 'Commandos ""on call""'. It reads: A crack squad of commando-style eco-protesters would be swung into action to stop the multimillion-dollar Skyrail development, green groups warned yesterday. That is the development at the Barron Gorge region north-west of Cairns. It also states: . . . conservationists announced the formation of the specially trained Affinity Group which they said would be willing to break the law. Campaign co-ordinator Bryan Law said the squad would resemble an intensively trained military or emergency services-style unit. Quite frankly, I think it is absolutely outrageous. Ecoterrorism really started in Australia when John Chester and Mick Habjoern blew up the woodchip terminal at Bunbury in 1976. This activity has continued, even though most Australians are not aware of the dimensions of what is going on. There appears to be a pattern becoming apparent. The same activity is going on in different states all over Australia. A group of publications is around. There is one entitled A field guide to monkeywrenching by David Foreman. Part of the literature that has been developed on ecoterrorism includes a magazine called Earth First Journal. I will just read some of the information in that. It states: According to Ecodefense, two of the most effective measuresand this is for destroying forest equipmentare abrasives in the oil or fuel, or (preferably salt-) water in the oil. The oil filler is very easy to find. It is a large cap, usually with a T-shaped handle on top. Water is cheap, easily washes down the abrasive, and cleans up any spills. It also causes internal rusting. For this purpose, salt water is far more effective than ordinary water. Friday and Saturday nights are good for nightwork, since any spilled water would have plenty of time to dry before Monday morning when the workers return. Avoid the type of oil filler tube that also holds the dipstick, or at least make sure that no tell-tale grit will show on the dipstick if the oil level is checked. Don't use so much water that the oil level rises too far. The goal is to leave no sign of tampering, so that the engine is run and destroys itself. This is part of the literature that is being developed to destroy the logging industry in Australia. I have examples from Greensill Brothers in South Grafton. They say: With regard to sabotage on our machinery 91-92 years we had claims to insurance for $98000.00 of which we had to wear $40,000.00 ourselves. 93-94 year we had our D6C transmission sabotaged, resulting in $42000.00 of damage. They have since had their excavator broken into and hot-wired so it could be started. They said: The machine was still running when the crew arrived at work, this sort of thing has been occurring since 1985. Still with the same company, at the Mount Marsh State Forest in 1989, sand was placed in the transmission of a caterpillar D6C at an approximate cost of $6,000. In the Barcoongere State Forest in 1990, oil from the front differential was drained and an oil bung replaced. The machinery was worked and that ruined the differential at an approximate cost of $10,000. I could go on. The list goes on of an enormous number of instances where machinery has been totally sabotaged. The impact is not only on machinery. Machines can be repaired but the fear and the stress being suffered by the timber workers in the sawmills and the forests are very difficult to handle. In March 1992, six Grafton sawmill workers in northern New South Wales were very lucky to escape serious injury when a metal spike, put in a log in the forest by protesters, exploded on contact. Spiking trees is a criminal act. It creates great danger. Unfortunately, this is booming in Tasmania. On Monday, 21 March this year, an anonymous press release announced that a large-scale tree spiking campaign was under way in Tasmania's southern forests. A large number of trees have been spiked in the southern forests. That is in the Picton-Huon area of Tasmania, about 40 minutes drive south of Hobart. In the last three months, there have been at least a dozen incidents where spikes have been included in logs. They are put in about two metres above the ground; the trees are felled below that height; and the logs then go through circular sawseach saw blade has about 50 teeth-turning at 200 kilometres an hour. When the saw blade hits the spike in the log, the tips of the teeth shear off. It is like shrapnel or a hand grenade exploding in the workplace. This must stop. It is totally unacceptable in Australia. So far death and serious injury have not occurred. One worker in Tasmania was hit in the stomach by a flitch which was cast off by the spike. It is only a matter of time until there is death or serious injury. We cannot blame sawmill workers for being terrified when groups of terrorists-and this is what they are-groups of criminals, groups of outlaws are deliberately sabotaging sawlogs with spikes, with the ultimate aim of causing death and injury. No matter who is doing this, it is totally unacceptable and outrageous behaviour. The police are doing everything they can but it is believed that this is being done by a small group of people who are highly mobile and who have been seen in several states. The modus operandi is the same from state to state. The mainstream conservation groups, I am pleased to say, have distanced themselves from them. This is not just vandalism out in the bush; it is costing hundreds of thousands of dollars. It is disrupting work and income. There is an enormous potential for injury or death in our sawmills and forests. I want to go back to the list of incidents associated with Greensill Brothers timber milling. At Orara West State Forest in 1993 a Caterpillar D16 was started, run down into the bush and left to run out of fuel. A Caterpillar EL240 excavator was broken into, its gauge was dismantled and it was hot-wired to start. It was also left to run itself out of fuel. There was no costly damage except for odd pieces of gauges and the dash. In the Whian Whian state forest a Caterpillar D7F tractor was sabotaged with dirt in the transmission and final drive at an approximate cost of $20,000. The fuel tank, which held 4,000 litres, had the bottom hose slashed and was approximately half full. That cost $1,000. This sabotage cannot be allowed to go on. Rational, reasonable debate about logging and the forests is acceptable. Legal protesting is acceptable. Terrorism can never be acceptable in this country. We must as a community, as a nation, reject acts of criminal vandalism that are affecting jobs and families. Above all, we have to reject the life-threatening acts of ecoterrorism. (TIme expired)",26
16,Mr SNOW,ECOTERRORISM,"I second the motion. I want to start on a point that the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) finished with and in doing so compliment him on the introduction of this motion. Later in the week, on Thursday 20 October, he and I will be making available a demonstration in committee room 2S 1 of some of the problems that have existed through sabotage of equipment and life-threatening incidents that have taken place in Australia. I hope that members and senators of all parties will take time to attend and have a look at some of the problems that have occurred through these actions. Some of the events that have been described by the honourable member for Cowper have shown us how people can be harmed. Some of the people who have talked about sabotaging equipment in the past have said, 'We are not interested in hurting people; we are just trying to stop logging. We are messing up equipment through doing that.' They ought to look at what is happening to people through some of their actions. In the south-east forests there are families where both parents are rostering themselves to watch over their equipment. So they are not together. Both are away from the home at one time or another. Within the families there are tensions about the job. One partner may say to the other, 'Can we stay in this sort of job any longer?' Then there are the economic effects on families, effects on their investment and on their being able to fulfil their needs as families. On top of all this there are problems with insurance firms. Insurance firms may be prepared to take a risk after one incident but, if there is a second incident, the firms are becoming increasingly reluctant to even provide insurance. This is devastating for anybody trying to operate a small business. That is what is happening. We want to raise the awareness of honourable members and the general public of the problems that have come about from the damage that has occurred throughout Australia. This problem became evident as early as the 1980s when Mr Simon Baulderstone, himself an environmentalist, drew attention to the fact that bolts were being used in trees at Mount Nardi to destroy chainsaws. He said there was some suspicion that the Nomadic Action Group, which is a fringe group, may have been responsible. It is interesting that Penny Figgis of the Australian Conservation Foundation once described the Nomadic Action Group as being a thorn in the side of conservation groups for some time. In 1994 the Sunday Age reported that, between 1988 and 1993, $5 million worth of damage had been done in the Otways, east Gippsland and the central highlands. In 1992 there was a report of $7,500 worth of damage to forest commission equipment during the Picton blockade. There were claims that the Greens were causing the damage and that locals were trying to disrupt protests. An article in the Bega District News dated 30 August 1994 stated: Three logging operations between Eden and Bombala were hit by thieves in one night last week. Locks and toolboxes were forced and diesel fuel, chainsaw parts and tools were stolen from three logging crews in forest areas south west of Towamba. In recent months a number of other incidents has occurred in the same area with dirt placed into fuel tanks on logging machines and windows being shot out of logging equipment. So it was not just plain theft and it surely was not coincidental that all these events took place in a very short space of time. The article continued: The president of the South East Timber Association, Mr Fritz Michelin, said contractors were not only concerned about the financial loss of theft and damage but also the safety risks where machinery was tampered with. He said the recent incidents involving the removal of pins from hydraulic arms could easily have led to a fatal accident in the bush where logging equipment was constantly used under high operating loads. Naturally, people need to inform the police if they see anything of this type. There have been suspicions of a wide range of organisations. I can name other incidents that have occurred. For instance, in 1992 in the Nullica State Forest, hydraulic rams were hacksawed through. In 1993 in the Yambulla State Forest there was a series of incidents, including dirt being put in motors and pumps. In the Dampier State Forest in 1994 all the lines and hoses belonging to Mathie and Sons were cut with bolt cutters. Radiators and all the coolers were staved in. It cost that company $42,000 in parts alone. Various suspicions have been raised. For instance, in Tasmania a group called the Evan Rolley Fan Club-apparently named after Evan Rolley of the Tasmanian Forestry Commission-said that it was not associated with any environmental or political group. But it has announced that spikes, particularly ceramic spikes, had been placed in some of the southern forests of Tasmania. There have been accusations that elements of the industry wanted to discredit the Greens and are therefore taking this action. There have been accusations that commercial rivals are doing it to one another. This seems to me to be unlikely, especially at this time of relatively higher production when people would simply be interested in producing what they know they could sell and not sabotaging someone else. There are plenty of sales at the moment, so that does not seem likely. The Sunday Age had an article on a book called Ecodefense-A field guide to monkeywrenching, which was printed in the United States. The article in the Age was headed 'Eco-terrorists: the mean greens'. I feel that you cannot simply blame the greenies. We have seen here that environmentalists have said that they would not associate with-and have rejected-the sorts of actions that were being taken. In the article in the Age, Dave Foreman, one of the writers of Ecodefense, wrote: Call it fascist if you like, but I'm more interested in bears, rainforests and whales than in people. This sort of attitude blurs the blame for what has been happening. I feel that we cannot pin it down on individual people. We need to raise the awareness of legislators in this parliament and of the general public of the dreadful occurrences in the forests and make sure that people look out for and are aware of them. In Victoria an organisation called Bush Alert has been set up to do just that. It is important that we make phone calls and let people know when we think there may be a problem with the forests because for many years people who have been working in the forests have been untouched and unharmed by vandalism. I am the first of four generations of Snows who has not been involved in the timber industry in the area of the honourable member for Cowper, which is on the north coast of New South Wales. They have had a long record of peaceful logging. The environmentalists have contributed greatly to the logging procedures. They have come up with suggestions for change. These suggestions have been incorporated into the scientific studies which have occurred and, as a result of that, we have much better procedures compared with the clear-felling of years gone by. We need to have tension between environmentalists and the industry, but not this sort of tension where violent strategies are used to try to deal with problems. This gives a bad name to all of those involved with the forestry industry, but particularly to the environmentalists themselves, who want to see a sustainable industry. We are all agreed on that and we all ought to be working on that. (Time expired)",28

18,Mr ROBERT BROWN,ASSOCIATION,"I move: That this House: (1) expresses its deep concern about the proposal by the NRMA motorist organisation in New South Wales to seek the public listing and float of that body because: (a) it will convert· a service driven mutual organisation into a profit driven private organisation with serious disadvantages for its 1.8 million members; (b) the present benefits to members of a subsidised road service and untaxed rebates on their insurance premiums will be replaced by a road service geared to profit and by dividends on shares which will be taxed; (c) the alleged financial gain to members in the form of cash or shares will be offset within a few years by the loss of the subsidised road service and the loss of rebates on insurance premiums; (d) members will become liable for capital gains tax on part of the share issue as well as any further appreciated value of the shares if they choose to sell them in future; (e) thousands of pensioners will become subject to the assets test on the level of their sions for the first time; (f) the change will remove the control of the NRMA from its 1.8 million members and facilitate the transfer of ownership and control to large institutional investors including foreign investors; (g) the NRMA is using millions of dollars which belong to its members to promote the 'yes' case of this proposal by misrepresenting the alleged benefits to them; (h) the NRMA has failed to present a balanced case, including a 'no' case, which would enable members to assess more objectively the alleged merits of the proposal despite the NRMA claim that it welcomes wide public debate on the issue; and (i) this proposal simply represents an attempt by the ruling clique of the NRMA to entrench and consolidate its control of the organisation and to exclude people like the MAG group from becoming directors of the organisation; (2) therefore calls on the Government to provide no assistance to the NRMA to facilitate the destruction of this mutual organisation; (3) welcomes the intervention of the Trade Practices Commission which has identified the misleading nature of the NRMA's promotional advertising and directed it to correct it; (4) calls on the Australian Securities Commission to investigate the operation of the NRMA in regard to this issue and especially the possible misuse of proxy vote arrangements at the 1993 Annual General Meeting; and (5) calls on the NRMA to suspend this attempt to float the organisation until elections are held for a new Board under the provisions of the pre-1993 Articles of Association. To a large extent, the case in support of my motion is self-evident. Some of the main reasons are outlined in the text of the motion. The first question we might ask is: why has the ruling clique of the NRMA chosen to pursue this objective? We have heard high sounding phrases like 'unlocking the wealth of the NRMA', 'sharing the future with the members' and 'issuing free shares'. All of these alleged reasons are spurious. We have to look for the benefit to those who have promoted this proposal and who mouth these high sounding phrases. The benefits to the ruling clique are, firstly, it will consolidate and entrench its control pen- over the NRMA and the wealth of the NRMA and, secondly, it will destroy the control of the 1.8 million members, because the corporate structure will enable the owners of blocks of shares-especially large institutional investors-to control the membership of the board. Some board members have been taken for mugs in the promises they have been made to solicit their support for this proposal. They will disappear from any future corporation board faster than they can say h-e-I-p. The issue of control is the real reason a large block of shares will be offered to institutional investors in the proposed float. That prospectus, so-called, is one of the most dishonest, deceitful and misleading public information documents that has ever been issued. I do not have time to detail the appalling misrepresentations, understatements and distortions which that document contains. Two directors of the NRMA, Richard Talbot and Dawn Fraser, at their own expense initiated an action in the Federal Court to halt the float. The case was heard before Justice Gummow. Justice Gummow accepted the claim that the shares were not free. He found that the prospectus was likely to mislead and deceive. The expression 'free shares' appears at least 160 times in that loo-page prospectus. The claim about free shares is the joke of the century. They would cost members dearly. The meeting proposed for this week has had to be adjourned and the votes received so far are invalid. If the float proceeded, benefits to members would disappear. First, the subsidised road service would go. The cost to members is currently $36 per year, but the service is subsidised to the extent of about $10 million each year. Similar road services in England which are profit driven cost up to $400 per year per member. Second, rebates on insurance premiums would disappear. They have been equal to about $90 million a year for the past few years. These rebates already allow members to share in the success of the NRMA and they are untaxed. They would be replaced by dividends to shareholders, which would be taxed. The other insurance companies have been rubbing their hands in anticipation of the insurance premiums of a corporatised NRMA being increased. It is incredible that the support case for a yes vote in the Sun-Herald on 9 October for this attempt to corporatise NRMA insurance was prepared by the group managing director of the GIO insurance company. Of course, GIO is the major competitor of the NRMA. Third, members would lose control of the NRMA. That is the core motivation for this whole move. The NRMA has described this scam as the greatest act of corporate generosity in history. It is offering to members something the members already own. It is one of the most arrogant and deceitful attempts to fool the people of New South Wales that has ever been undertaken. I charge Mr Don Mackay, the Chairman of the NRMA, and Mr Ray WiIIing, the Chief Executive of the NRMA, who is paid over $500,000 a year by the NRMA, with gross incompetence in the conduct of this matter. In a memo to staff on 30 September, Mr WiIIing said: The NRMA has consulted widely and commissioned the highest levels of expertise to ensure the process for the share issue is conducted correctly. Having reviewed the opposition case we remain confident there is no merit in it. This man, whom we pay over half a million dollars each year, was terribly wrong. His arrogant incompetence has already cost NRMA members about $15 million. That money has gone down the gurgler. Ray Willing should do the honourable thing and resign, or be sacked. After the Federal Court decision, the NRMA chairman, Don Mackay, said, 'This is round one.' Is it indeed? Round one has already cost members of the NRMA $15 million for his incompetence. How much of our money does he propose to spend on his round two or round three? He has compounded this financial fiasco by announcing that he is planning a large general meeting, at a cost of a further $1 million, to solicit support for his round two. After the Federal Court decision, Don Mackay said, 'I have to accept responsibility as the president of the organisation and I do.' Well, Mr Mackay, we accept your confession. We accept your guilty plea. An honourable man who wasted $15 million of other people's money would resign. I charge the Australian Securities Commission with incompetence and of failing to protect the interests of 1.8 miIIion citizens who have been misled and deceived by a flawed prospectus which the ASC approved. It is supposed to be the corporate watchdog. In his reply to me dated 13 September, Alan Cameron, the Chairman of the ASC, said: It is unlikely that a Court would find any act of the board with respect to the prospectus invalid even if irregularities at the time of the voting were to be proved. The court found the prospectus was likely to mislead and deceive. It has been left to the Trade Practices Commission and a judge of the Federal Court to do what the ASC should have done. There should be a government inquiry into the conduct of the ASC in this matter. In his reply to me, the federal Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) said: ... the ASC is currently monitoring the NRMA from the point of view of compliance with the prospectus requirements of the Corporations Law. I doubt whether those requirements would condone a prospectus which is likely to mislead and deceive. The ASC has clearly embarrassed the Attorney-General by providing him with incompetent advice. I charge Ms Lynn Ralph, an NRMA director and Deputy Chairperson of the Australian Securities Commission, with seriously prejudicing any residual credibility of that body through her conflict of interests and conflict of loyalties. She is reported in the Sydney Morning Herald on 15 October as having 'urged the board on, saying the judge's findings were just technicalities'. Even the NRMA's legal advisers disagreed with her. They said that the issues were matters of substanc-. In - hat capacity was Lynn Ralph offenng her mcompetent advice-as a director of the NRMA or as an official for the Australian Securities Commission? Lynn Ra-ph should do the honourable thing and resIgn. I charge Anna Booth, a director of the NRMA and a vice-president of the ACTU, of a failure to scrutinise adequately the proposals advanced by the ruling clique of the NRMA - hich might be expected to prejudice the mterests of 1.8 million citizens of New South Wales who comprise the membership of the NRMA. I charge all of the directors of the NRMA who occupy a position of trust on behalf of its 1.8 million members and who supported this float and the issue of that - awed prospectus of a conspiracy against the mter--ts - f the members. I charge them with duplICIty m the conduct of this campaign and the waste of $15 million of members' funds. Those directors should do the honourable thing and resign. Legal opinion is that no appeal can be lodged by anyone on behalf of the NRMA in the . - bsence of the authority of a proper deCISIOn of the respective boards of directors of the NRMA Ltd and NRMA Insurance Ltd. These are matters of great moment. The implications are serious indeed. I urge the - ttomey-General to initiate any action which IS necessary to recover the cost of the prospectus which has now been shown to be illegal. I commend absolutely the courage of Richard Talbot and Dawn Fraser and the willingness to sacrifice themselves when they took that action before the Federal Court-an action which has been vindicated despite pe-ple trying to discredit it. They took that actIOn at very great expense and danger to themselves in order to protect the interests of 1.8 million New South Welshmen. I expect others to do the same. (Time expired)",29
19,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ASSOCIATION,"Is the motion seconded? Mr Allan Morris-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak. - r CADMAN (Mitchell) (2.14 p.m.)-This motIon refers to the manner in which this House sees the NRMA. It is obvious that my colleague the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) sees the NRMA as a very .suc-essful. organisation with huge funds to dIstnbute 10 some social engineering scheme at the whim of three ratbag directors-nothing more than that! These people have had crazy ideas to use the funds of New South Wales motorists to buy airlines, to throw money around. Any bright idea that flashes into their head they believe should be executed by the NRMA using the funds of the - otorist.s of New South Wales-an organisatIon WhICh has been professionally run and managed, accumulating $2.2 billion and huge assets because of good management over a long period of successful years. Now we have members of the socialist ratbag Left-Geoff Lawson, thank goodness, a great Australian cricketer, had the sense to bail out of this pr?posal-wanting to fritter these carefully gamed funds all over the countryside for any scheme that flashes into their heads. We are talking about three directors out of the total board-a failed radio announcer, a failed state politician, and I do not know what Richard Talbot has ever done. I do not think anybody has ever heard of him. But these people-failed at everything, cannot manage anything, with no proven management skills-now want to fritter away the funds of the motorists of New South Wales. It should not happen. It cannot happen. The votes already in say that 85 per cent of the people in New South Wales want this float to go ahead. What is further my honourable friend, they are not after th- cash. The argumen- that they are going to grab the cash and run IS wrong because 78 per cent of those who have already voted said, 'We want the s-ares. We want to st-y part of this organisatIon. We want to be m and continue to have a link with what has been our mutual society. We want to be shareholders in one of Australia's great companies.' What does the honourable member for Charlton propose? Using the coward's castle of parliament, some accusation of parliament against people, calling, as Dawn Fraser hashe was just mouthing her words; there was nothing original in what he said-for the directors to retire. I do not believe they should retire. If it could be done in Australia today, I believe they should be knighted because they have brought forward an imaginative idea to keep the funds of the NRMA out of the hands of the rat bag Left. That is what it is about. This conflict of ideas in the NRMA is the work of the current board. It has some very distinguished members too, I would like to point out to the honourable member. The current board has come forward with a proposal whereby the benefits that have been built up over many years are spread throughout the total membership, both the membership of the NRMA and the policyholders of the insurance company. What could be fairer? Insurance policyholders gather a certain number of shares and membership holders gather a certain proportion of shares also. It is a very fair proposal. I do not have to look too far to gain supporters for the board's move. One of the directors, a Mr Michael Easson-surprise, surprise! - who is well known to members of this House, particularly to members of the Labor Party, writes in glowing terms of the benefits in this process adopted by the board of the NRMA. Mr Easson is not unknown to the Labor Party: he is a prominent member of the Australian Labor Party. On 27 September in the Financial Review he sets out some of the reasons why the share float should go ahead, why the case of the board is well thought through and why it is the only alternative-it is not the perfect alternative, but it is the best alternative to doing nothing. As a result of the court case, it is inevitable that the NRMA will have to change now. It is no good looking back, the NRMA will have to change. We have both the member who has just resumed his seat, the member for Charlton, and Dawn Fraser now calling on the federal government to instigate a huge inquiry. He says in his motion that he does not want any government help for the organisation, but now he is calling on the government for help. I do not know whether he will be able to work out the terms of his motion, because most of it appears to be absolutely wrong. The road service motorists receive is not subsidised. Included in that whole process of road service is the production of magazines and a whole lot of other additional optional extras. They are not part of the road service. That will not change. Part of the articles of the new organisation say that they must give pre-eminence to road service. That is why we all belong to the NRMA-to be able to get at a moment's notice good service. I return the House to the comments made by Mr Michael Easson, a director of this great organisation, the NRMA, on 27 September: The NRMA appears to be a well run, efficient organisation with a dominant share of the insurance market in NSW and significant presence in home and related fields of insurance. Its motor vehicle service business is very strong with 70 per cent of private motorists in NSW electing to become road service members-the highest market presence of any comparable organisation in the world. Yes, a world class organisation! The Labor Party talks about wanting world class practice in everything that it does. Here we have an organisation of world class standard and yet the honourable member is alleging that the professional board of directors and management, selected from across a wide range of people, are ratbags who ought to be ignored, and suggesting that the organisation should be destroyed by buying airlines or using the funds of the NRMA to implement some stupid social engineering program. That is what the three directors who voted against it want to do. Mr Robert Brown-No, they didn't.",32
20,Mr CADMAN,ASSOCIATION,"That has been part of their proposals over a long period of time. One only has to read back over what they have done to find that they are irresponsible in the way in which they want to use motorists' funds. Mr Easson goes on to state that he believes there are three good reasons why the NRMA should change. He states that, first, the strength in the NSW market may diminish if other organisations can expand and the NRMA is not allowed to expand to its capacity. That is a 'change or lose the game' sort of argument. The second point is a stronger one, though, in that: ... other organisations pose medium to long-term strategic threats. For example, the 010That is a prospect. We in parliament cannot make a commercial judgment about this organisation. It must be done by the directors. If they succeed, they are seen to be successtioned, ful. The third point Mr Easson makes is: . . . the listing of the NRMA will enable the organisation to ultimately expand its base outside of NSWinto other markets. And it will. It will a great national organisation once the float successful, despite all the tactics and stratprevious egies proposed. I am really sorry to see my friend on other side join with the ratbag Left in instance to speak against the corporatisation of the NRMA. It is a mutual company and, course, only about five per cent of members vote at any election-and the honourable member nods in assent. This makes the process of voting subject to any political whim. If you get notables up, rather than competents, you tend to get the public voting for notables rather than competents. There is that risk there. It has not happened. The board cation. is well managed. It comprises sensible people. We have only three who appear to have these strange ideas. I can understand conservative attitudes in regard to the NRMA, but these are not consation servative attitudes we are talking about. Nobody wants a good organisation to change. These people just want to take the dough and use it for anything that comes into their torily. heads. That is their basic argument. It is unthinkable that an organisation such as NRMA would be run by any other than top class managers and professional directors. believe that the Stock Exchange listing would have provided for that. In order to have continued professionalism, the dissident directors should be locked out. They should not be members of the board. For their own sake and for the sake of Australia, they should get out of the way. Dawn Fraser, a member of the board, previously called for the resignation of the directors. So today's call by the honourable member for the resignation of the 12 directors who supported the float-one of whom is Mr Michael Easson-is not new. There will be no going back. The Motorists Action Group, which the member represents in this House, put forward a number of other proposals for spending cash, but the one that I have menwhich is the important one, is to buy shares in the failed Southern Cross Airlines. That is a brilliant use of funds, if ever I have ownership heard of one. (TIme expired)",33
21,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,ASSOCIATION,"This issue is actually much more is complex than has been purported by the speaker, the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman). I draw the attention of the the House to the motion itself which was this submitted by the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) on 20 September, some time of back. A lot has changed since then. Much of the debate this morning has in fact focused on more recent events. If we go back to the fundamentals, as a member of the NRMA for some years now, I myself have been grappling with the question for quite some time, as well as fielding constituents' queries, questions and attempts to seek clarifiI am a member of the NRMA because I believe in belonging to organisations and in some sense of cooperative behaviour. As a parliamentarian, I have dealt with the organiin my own area on a large number of occasions. Very recently its response to a long standing problem of one of its members was rectified very quickly and very satisfacI have been a member, a supporter and a the believer in the NRMA concept. I have also been delighted by the NRMA's 74 years of I achievement. In effect, what the NRMA has put to its members is this: 'For 74 years we have done wonderfully well. We have generated a large amount of money. We now have $6 billion to $10 billion worth of value.' That belongs to the members. There is a question about whether or not it should be unlocked. The word 'unlock' has been used over and has over again. Should the NRMA unlock the value and release it to the membership? The first question to be asked is: why would one do that? Does one unlock one's value in a house? If one owns a house or has equity in ,a house, does one sell it and cash it in because one has a value in it? Does having a value in something automatically mean one ii:ashes it in, liquidates it or unlocks it? I have been puzzled by the question of why that would be done all the way through this process. I have read the NRMA's prospectus and its subsequent letters and I have watched the public debate. I have not previously spoken on this matter and I have not been involved in any particular public sense in the competing ideas and interests represented on the NRMA board. However, I am unhappy with the idea of unlocking the value of the NRMA. .The reason for that is that I do not believe the NRMA can retain either the loyalty or the culture of its membership, its policyholdersthe people who pay fees to the NRMA-once it is owned by people in a cash sense. The NRMA's great success in insurance was built on its success in road servicing. It was owned by the members and it serviced the members. People who have taken out insurance through NRMA have done so because it is their organisation and they own it-now. Taking the figures to date, 84 per cent and 78 per cent, or whatever, 63 per cent-less than two-thirds-of existing members would still own shares. From looking at England and other places which have had privati sat ion experiences, the shift in that cashing in process will be quite rapid. I have no doubt that, within two years of this demutualisation, fewer than half of the shares in the NRMA will be held by members. Once that happens, it will be just one other insurance company. Whether it will be a national, a multinational or an international company will not really matter. It will be just another insurance company which is owned by shareholders. People can buy shares in an insurance company now if they want to; they can buy shares in a range of organisations now if they want to. Within two years, the culture that was built up and the ownership that was expressed in that membership will have gone. The shenanigans of the last few days have been demeaning. The statements in today's press do people no credit whatsoever. There has been a court judgment. That is serious. It needs to be taken seriously and responded to, not be subject to the kind of media driven comments that we are hearing. A question was put forward about whether the whole process is in the interests of the members and in the interests of the organisation. I am strongly of the view that it is not. The process should not go ahead because I do not believe it is in the interests of the NRMA.",34
22,Mr ABBOTT,ASSOCIATION,"I was wondering why the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) was waging this little crusade, and why it had not been taken up by a more senior member of the government. The answer is quite obvious: the government is hugely embarrassed by what has happened. It is embarrassed for two reasons. Firstly, I have a circular memorandum to all government departments which tells the heads of these departments what to do with the money. The government is already banking the money that it is getting from this process. Secondly, this debacle illustrates the gross failure of the government's regulatory regime. I am not here to especially comment on the private business decisions of enterprises. I do not believe it is the parliament's job, nor a politician's job, to tell people how to run businesses. Frankly, I rather like the idea of floating the NRMA. Personally, I rather like the idea of converting the existing right to vote into a right to vote and to buy and sell shares. In any event, that is none of this parliament's business. What is the parliament's business is the gross failure of the government's regulatory regime. One of the most curious features of this has been that the result of the vote was apparently known long before the conclusion of the poll. This is quite bizarre. Not even the New South Wales ALP proceeds on that basis. The vote might be rigged but at least it waits until the vote is over before it is counted. The basic fact is that, for all the extravagant language that the member for Charlton used condemning this and that person, it is the government which deserves to be condemned because its regulatory regime has been exposed as inadequate. I note that when the former Chairman of the ASC, Tony Hartnell, left that position it was revealed that he had been receiving $100,000 a year from his former employer, a major city law firm. Now we have the situation of the Deputy Chairman of the ASC, Ms Lynn Ralph, being a director of the NRMA. The fact of the matter is that you cannot have situations where the commissioners of the ASC are also intimately involved with the decision making of major businesses. That is not the NRMA's fault: it is the government's fault for allowing this to go on. How can the ASC properly consider the whole matter of the NRMA when its own Deputy Chairman is so heavily involved in the NRMA? How can the NRMA deal adequately with the ASC when it has, as one of its own directors, such a senior person? The whole arrangement is far too clubby, far too cosy and far too typical of this government, which is always getting into bed with its business mates. The Deputy Chairman of the ASC, Ms Lynn Ralph, was quoted in the Sydney Morning Herald on Saturday as saying that she was urging the board on-that the whole business of Mr Justice Gummow's decision was a mere technicality. Surely there is something very strange about a regulatory regime where the deputy chairperson of the regulatory body can dismiss a court judgment as a mere technicality when that court has found that aspects of what she has been involved in constitute misleading and deceptive comment. How often is this happening? What sort of a regulatory regime do we have in this country when the Deputy Chairman of the ASC can be so dismissive and so scornful of a judgment by a court of this country? Frankly, it just is not good enough. It is time for Lynn Ralph to ask herself where her real responsibilities lie. Do they lie with the Securities Commission's regime in this country or do they lie with the business interests of the NRMA? We now know that it is impossible to serve both masters simultaneously. Quite frankly, if there is any doubt in her mind, the government should make it up for her and she should no longer serve on the ASC. I say to the member for Charlton: it is all very well to come into this parliament and talk as you have. Have you said to the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) that Ms Ralph is no longer appropriate to serve on the ASC? If you have not, everything you have said here is revealed as so much hot air. I ask the government: does it permit ASC commissioners to serve on the boards of major business enterprises? Are ASC commissioners normally so dismissive towards court judgments? Is the government entirely happy with Ms Ralph's dual role as barracker for the NRMA and Deputy Chairman of the ASC? (Time expired)",35
23,Mrs EASSON,ASSOCIATION,"This debate is taking place as the matter is coming before a superior court. I trust that this matter is not sub judice. However, if the chair is content for this matter to be spoken of at this time, I would like to speak in support of the 85 per cent of those NRMA members who voted to accept the directors' advice in favour of the demutualisation proposal. The member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) referred to an article quoting my husband, who, I might point out, is a member of the NRMA insurance board, not of the holding company. I also put it on the record that previously I was a consultant to the NRMA. I think the three points made by my husband should be reiterated. Firstly, the NRMA's strength in the New South Wales market is enormous, but unless the NRMA expands out of that market it may undergo atrophy. Listing is the best way to avoid this stagnation. Secondly, other organisations, such as the GIO, pose a strategic threat to the NRMA. It therefore follows that the NRMA must diversify its risks and expand into the new markets of Victoria and Queensland. Thirdly, the technique of listing will enable the NRMA to expand into other states. This whole issue is one of corporate governance. The directors, who have advised on the process, were properly elected by NRMA members and they can be accepted as mature and knowledgeable people who have the best long-term interests of both the members and the NRMA at heart. The proposals that members have been voting on would allow hundreds of thousands of ordinary Australians to own shares-a privilege they have not enjoyed before. In fact, Anna Booth, who is well known to most members of this House as a leading unionist and a board member of the Commonwealth Bank, said in an recent article in the Sydney Morning Herald that, for many NRMA members who receive shares, it would be the equivalent of 'a $30 a week wage rise for a year which is saved'. Members receiving the average of $1,200 in shares would also receive enough in dividends to cover the cost of two NRMA membership fees. The road services provided by the NRMA act as an entry point to the NRMA's other products. If it were not for road service, NRMA Insurance may as well be XYZ insurance company. Road service positions the NRMA as a 'special organisation' and it would be economically stupid for it to be removed or for the price to be greatly increased. Members would simply leave. There is talk of potential road service competition from another insurer. When you have got a winning formula like the NRMA has you do not change it; you simply refine it and make it better. The NRMA President and Chief Executive have given assurances that road services will not change-except to get better. The proposal will not change the way the NRMA does business, only the form of ownership held by its members. One matter that the House should note is that the prospectus used the word 'free' in connection with the shares members could receive. His Honour rejected this word, but was happy to accept the expression 'shares without cost'. I can confirm that the NRMA will today seek leave to appeal the decision by Justice Gummow. The boards of the NRMA have committed themselves to the NRMA becoming publicly listed. The judgment did not comment on the merits of the NRMA becoming a listed company, only on some parts of the prospectus. The NRMA management is clearly very disappointed with the outcome of the court proceedings as are, no doubt, many of its members. Research before and after the prospectus was issued· demonstrated overwhelming support by the membership for the proposal. This sort of proposal has never been undertaken before. The NRMA sought the best expert advice available in compiling the prospectus. The House should remember that 85 per cent of voters have voted to accept the advice of the directors. This is a clear and unassailable majority. If there is to be a new ballot, there is no reason to believe that the result would be different. This attack on the demutualisation proposal is not in the interests of the NRMA membership. The vote shows where the real strength lies and the parliament should keep this firmly in mind.",36
24,Mr DOBIE,ASSOCIATION,"At the outset, I have to admit to a conflict of interest. As a member of the NRMA, I am one of those who has voted in favour of this proposal. I have said yes to the share issue. I have done that because I believe that it is the best thing for the future of NRMA and I believe that it is probably the best thing for me. Mr Duncan-It is not a conflict of interest.",37
25,Mr DOBIE,ASSOCIATION,"I will ignore the interjection. Interjections should be non-existent throughout this debate. I do not endorse any of the comments made by the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown). Before I came here this morning I heard on television that there was likely to be a court case today. Like the previous member, the honourable member for Lowe (Mrs Easson), I checked to see whether this debate should continue. I was that informed by a senior parliamentary officer that this matter was not sub judice, which is why I am speaking the way I am. I was very pleased to hear the comments of the member for Lowe, who very succinctly put forward the plus case for this float. No matter which way we look at it, 84 per cent of NRMA members have voted voluntarily for this float. Mr Robert Brown-Misled, though, Don; misled and deceived.",37
26,Mr DOBIE,ASSOCIATION,"Whatever the honourable member for Charlton may care to say, I happen to remember issues involving NRMA elections that he has taken up in this House before. This is nothing new for him, but it is new for him to criticise the float. I disagree with him totally and utterly in that regard. Most of us here who have supported the float were surprised by the decision of Justice Gummow; but, being loyal citizens, we accept his right to make that decision. I was pleased to hear that it will be appealed. Even the member for Charlton would admit that having decisions challenged in the court is a natural process of the law. We must also remember that the law is secondary to the parliament in our Westminster democratic system. The motion moved by the member for Charlton lists nine points of fault. It then 'calls on the government to provide no assistance to the NRMA to facilitate the destruction of this mutual organisation'. What arrant nonsense! I respect the member for Charlton very much, as he knows-we have a very close and nice personal relationship-but in all honesty I have to say that in this particular debate a lot of arrant nonsense is being put across the table. I was delighted to hear the member for Lowe put forward her views so well. I thought they were so good because I agreed with everything she said. I just hope she will agree with something I say in the future. This debate is all about, and that is why we are talking about it here today-we are not talking out of bitterness; we are not talking out of huge personal gain-a need for the organisation to expand its operations in a sensible, logical way. If honourable members go through the motion, they will see that we are destroying all those things. I was going to talk about director Talbot being a Labor candidate, but I decided not to go into that. But I have to say that there has been an attempt to politicise elections of the NRMA. This is absolute stuff and nonsense. You either say yes or no. Yet 84 per cent have actually said yes. They were not forced to do this. They were not acting on wrong information. We received a very extensive prospectus from the NRMA. I was quite amazed that it took so long to get the papers out to me. When I rang up and asked, 'What's happening?' I was told, 'In your area, it's going to be such and such a date,' and there it was. I replied the day I received the prospectus because I had read it before. For the suggestion to be made that the NRMA and its officers and staff are being greedy, dishonest or even corrupt-as I think was suggested in previous speeches-denies 70 years of total dedication by staff, dedication by the staff executive and dedication by the people who have been elected to the board. I have not agreed with everybody who has been elected to the board, and that is the way it should be. How can you call elections to the NRMA boards dishonest? Some 1.8 million people have a right to vote. We have already heard from the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) that a small percentage of NRMA members actually vote. In most organisations that I am in, I have to tell you, exactly the same thing happens. I wish the NRMA success in what it does. (TIme expired)",37
27,Mr KNOTT,ASSOCIATION,"I have never heard such unmitigated claptrap in my whole life as that which I have just heard from the previous speaker, the honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie). The High Court did what it did because a deceptive proposal was put forward. The people were not given all the information. I was almost prevented from putting an ad in my local newspaper. Why? Because of the massive amounts of money being spent by the NRMA. It did not want the no case to be advocated because it did not want people to understand what this float is all about. We already own the NRMA. We do not need a share list; we do not need institutional investors. Where did the NRMA come from? From an organisation that wanted to give road service which then decided to have insurance and other things to subsidise that. The whole point is that, if you take that away, the road service will ultimately go. If you consider the facts in detail, you will find that it is a scam to take away the benefits of a demutualised organisation.",38
28,Mr SPEAKER,ASSOCIATION,"Order! It being 2.45 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 104A. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Monday. The member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA Toowoomba North: Preselection",38
29,Mr TAYLOR,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Clearly, Queensland ALP secretary, Mike Kaiser, is embarrassed by conflicting reports made over the weekend about preselection in the state seat of Toowoomba North involving unsuccessful candidate, 68-year-old Ray Webber. While I should be the last to support Mr Webber in his internal wrangle with the Queensland ALP-he was the Labor candidate who ran against me in last year's general election-it is apparent that Mr Kaiser and his apparatchiks could not lie straight in bed, even with their own members. On 16 September, Mr Kaiser wrote to Mr Webber saying: In the light of rule 26.10 the officers did not endorse you to contest preselection. Rule 26.10 precludes candidates from nominating for public office when aged 60 years and over. Yet, in recent days, Mr Kaiser has said that Mr Webber's preselection bid was declared invalid because he did not have three years continuous membership of the ALP. Quite apart from this public inconsistency, how does Mr Kaiser reconcile this dishonesty with Mr Webber's overnight endorsement to carry the ALP banner in Groom in March last year at the age of 66? As Mr Webber said over the weekend: They (the ALP) came along on bended knee, they couldn't get anybody, nobody would run ... rule 26.10 is technical subterfuge and I will continue fight. Recently, in Hobart, the ALP made a big thing of its preselection formula for Labor women, yet when it comes to mature aged people and the removal of the compulsory retirement age, I sympathise with the Queensland Pensioners and Superannuants League, which has labelled the ALP's decision as offensive, discriminatory and a case of double standards. It seems to me that the ALP was always thus. Evans, Mr F.: Death",39
30,Mr KNOTT,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Mr Speaker, I am glad that you are in the chair. It is with great regret that I report to the House the death of one of my constituents-a Mr Fred Evans. Mr Evans was a person with whom I did not always agree. He was, however, a person with whom I was able to engage in debate on the issues which confronted the constituents I represent. Mr Evans always did so with courtesy and with a sense of logic and direction. I have always had an affection fdr Mr Evans. Unlike many of the people I would classify as opponents at various times and in various places, Mr Evans always had a full and total belief in what he stood up for. Mr Evans will be a dramatic loss to the citizens of Culburra. He will be a dramatic loss to the people of the Culburra Senior Citizens Association. I want the personal sadness I feel to be placed on the record. I wish his wife and family and those who have grown to love him over the years consolation in their loss. I had hoped that I would be able to be at his funeral but that may not be the case. I suggest that Australia has lost a very good and loyal servant. WA Inc.",39
31,Mr FILING,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"The ALP in Western Australia is trying to portray the election of Jim MCGinty and Geoff Gallop as a new start for the ALP and a clean slate for WA Inc. Of course, that is not true at all. As we in Western Australia well know-and as those of us who have been watching the affairs in Western Australia for some time would to know-Jim MCGinty was the minister responsible in the Lawrence government for pushing the old Swan Brewery redevelopment ahead. This was a matter of considerable concern to many, not least of whom the Aboriginal community in Western Australia, which was concerned about the development being over one of its sacred sites. At the same time, Dr Gallop also has a background in that he was a member of the infamous Legislative Assembly select committee which inquired into the Midland abattoir. It gave a whitewash decision in the Midland abattoir affair and then promptly shredded all its documents so that they were unavailable to anyone else. So when people start saying that this is somehow a clean start for the Western Australian state opposition, it is only fair to point out that there are still very strong links between the current leadership and the bad old days of WA Inc. The real fresh start for the ALP will not occur until it cleans out the Augean stables and gets rid of all those people from the past. NRMA Share Float",39
32,Mr ROBERT BROWN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I have a copy of a letter from Carol Berliner of Gadens Ridgeway, the legal company acting on behalf of Dawn Fraser and Richard Talbot in connection with the proposal for the NRMA to be floated. I would like to refer to a couple of paragraphs. The letter, to Don Mackay, the Chairman of the NRMA, says: We are instructed to put you on notice that clients require adequate notice of all directors meetings of the NRMA and access to all necessary information. The question of an appeal should considered at a directors meeting next week which will enable the written advice of senior counsel be obtained. Any appeal instituted without authority of a proper decision of the respective boards of directors will not have been properly instituted by legal advisers properly retained. The last paragraph says: Furthermore, those directors of the companies who were instrumental in proposing the reconstruction and issuing of the prospectus may well be in position where they are unable, except in breach of fiduciary duty, to participate in decisions of respective boards. The findings of Justice Gummow would seem inevitably to lead to liability part of the individuals concerned of a civil under sections 995 and 1005 and perhaps criminal nature under section 996 of the Corporaguff tions Law. Mr Speaker, for the information of members. I seek leave to have that document tabled. Leave granted.",40
33,Mr FILING,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I rise again to speak about WA Inc., a matter close to my heart. Last week, when referring to events in Vicfor ever. toria, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) spoke of a stinking dead cat in the middle of the road. He forgot to mention the stinking dead cat that is in each of the electorate offices members opposite. The database software that was developed to help you keep your seats was developed by Insight West, a company that has received funds from the filthy lucre of WA Inc. So it has to be borne in mind that whenever the Prime Minister rises to slate one of the state governments around Australiathe economies they have taken over are doing very well-within your own electorate offices there is a stinking dead cat staring at you every time you look at the VDU screens on your computers. It is the software developed by Insight West, a company that was set up using the filthy lucre that came from Western Australia Inc. NRMA Share Float",40
34,Mr KNOTT,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I would like to talk about the NRMA. We were talking before about what is happening in the NRMA. our One thing that should be taken into account is that you already own it, you people of Australia who are members. But further than be that. The chairman was asked, 'Why could to you not under the existing arrangements give the back to your members this cash that they are so desperate to get rid of by rebate?' He said, 'We do.' 'Why could you not go further with the rebate?' 'Because it would create too much competition in the insurance industry and would destabilise it.' So let us get away from this guff. This is a all about a closed shop. This is all about the the corporate sector having complete control over pricing. It is about cartel arrangements. It is on the about screwing the people of New South nature Wales who are motorists and who are memof a bers of the NRMA. So let us not have any about it being some great winner take all or prize draw for all the people in New South Wales. The people in New South Wales will pay. The motor service division of the NRMA will be taken out. These other things-GIO's insurance and all the other activities that have WA Inc. taken place-were designed to prop up that motoring service. Take those away and demutualise that service and it will be gone Australia Remembers",40
35,Mr SIMMONS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Sometimes of people are criticised for making comments about the number of public holidays provided in this nation. At the risk of causing some furore r am going to suggest that in 1995 Prime Minister (Mr Keating), in conjunction with his premiers-perhaps at the next meetefforts ing of the COAG-give consideration to determining that 15 August 1995 a one-off national public holiday, because 15 August 1995 marks the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II in the Pacific. r know that, as far as many members from both sides of the House are concerned, there is enormous interest in the Australia bers campaign and commemoration that have been developed by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca). I am sure that many towns and cities throughout the nation will want to do something particularly special that day. This is an occasion on which we a nation can get together to remember the saying great deeds of the men and women who with disabilities. served this country so proudly, and of course the people who supported them back at home, during World War II. Drought",40
36,Mr FITZGIBBON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Everyone in this country knows that this nation is currentThe ly experiencing one of the most severe droughts we have ever had to contend with. Everyone in this House and in this nation knows how severely farmers are suffering as a result of this drought. Recently, the Minister (Mr Keating) and the Minister Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) announced a package of assistance for farmers who are in dire straits the drought. That program of financial assistance won universal applause. It was the most generous package ever offered by the federal government to assist rural producers. People were amazed: why would a Labor government give so much assistance to help people who are not part of its natural constituency? Unfortunately, because of the guidelines which have been applied, some areas of Australia, including some areas of Wales-particularly in my electorate, including Merriwa and Scone-are not eligible for assistance because they have not suffered from the drought for a sufficient length time. But everyone knows that severity due drought conditions is not dependent upon time. I feel that that decision is somewhat the ludicrous and I, along with some of my colleagues, will be making the strongest to ensure that the cabinet extends the provision to assist those requiring urgent be declared assistance. (Time expired) Ferry Service",41
37,Mr MCARTHUR,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I am disappointed that the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) is not here today Rememattacking the Kennett government. I am surprised that he has missed out-it is unusual. However, I would like to refute his arguments against the peninsula ferry service for commuters between Sorrento and Queenson cliff. In this House the honourable member as attacked the management of that service, it had not provided facilities for people I would like to remind the House that, under Captain MCKeddie, that operation has done everything possible to institute the service between Queenscliff and Sorrentoagainst the bureaucracies of state and federal governments and against environmentalists. operation now provides a first-class service shifting persons and motor cars between those two places. It is looking into disability requirements, and I take exception to the honourable member for Dunkley attackPrime ing that service and Captain MCKeddie for personally. Captain MCKeddie has done everything possible to provide a first-class service for the people of Corangamite and the because of eastern part of Victoria. Republic",41
38,Mr GIBSON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"If there is any further evidence required of why we as a nation have to move quickly towards becoming a republic, it is a headline in today's Sydney Morning Herald. It is a headline of which we should all be ashamed: 'Dad made me do it.' That is where we have come to in New South the debate about royalty. The time has well and truly come for this nation to start moving towards becoming a republic. That is the calibre of the person of those opposite, who support the monarchy, to want to put in place as head of state of this country-a man who is so gutless that he has put his own family into the situation he has. He was too gutless to stand up to his father and stand up for what he believed in, and he has made the pathetic excuse of blaming the victim in this situation-his wife. This is where we are at nowadays. I would love to see how the monarchists on the other side of the House are going to defend a ridiculous situation like this, where Prince Charles is prepared to admit that he is so gutless that he was not even prepared to stand up to his own father in determining who he should have as his spouse. That is why it is about time we brought the republic forward.",41

41,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I direct my question to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his allegations against the Crown Casino in Melbourne and the people who are rebuilding Victoria after years of Labor's economic vandalism.

Will the Prime Minister substantiate allegations in relation to the Victorian casino with specific details or have the decency to withdraw the allegations?,42

48,Mr HAVILAND,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Human Services and Health. This morning the minister launched National Mental Health Week 1994. Can the minister advise the House of what the government is doing to reduce the stigma and discrimination associated with mental illness?,42
49,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This morning I did launch national mental health week. I was delighted that the opposition spokesperson on this matter attended as well. The launch provided a valuable opportunity for us all to reflect on the very serious issues that surround mental illness, unlike some of the interjections we have had suggesting that this is not an important matter. We all have to play our part in ensuring that people with a mental illness take their rightful place in society. I hope that many people during this week will take part in activities designed to reduce discrimination and improve the treatment of the mentally ill in our community. It is clear that we still have a very long way his to go. There have been recently some very disturbing, and indeed tragic, reports, for instance in Victoria, of the shooting of people with mental illness. Apparent misunderstanding by the police-one could even say worse than that-has led to a very significant number of people with mental illness actually being shot when, clearly, proper management of their conditions would not result in that outcome. As a community we should be outraged, not about what the opposition appears to be concerned about, but about the treatment of the mentally ill in this community. Shooting people who have mental illness is not a solution to the problem. Their rightful place in our society demands they be treated with dignity. I am extremely worried about these reports and I hope members opposite would be, too.",42
50,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,43
51,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Are you suggesting you condone that sort of response to mental illness? I am also very dismayed by recent reports that show that housing for the mentally ill is significantly undersuppJied. There have been recent reports, in New South Wales in particular, which show that not only people with disabilities but also those with mental illness are significantly short of appropriate housing. State governments have serious responsibilities in both of these areas, which they are clearly not undertaking. This week gives us an opportunity to make sure that they do undertake them. A final matter that I think is very important is that of suicides occurring in this country amongst young people",43

53,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The minister will just wait for a moment. I have said time and again in this place that members will be heard in silence whether they are asking, or responding to, a question. I again appeal to those in this place who want to challenge that to think very carefully about it.",43
54,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"These are very important issues and they are difficult to deal with. That is why we have a special week set aside for this purpose. That is why I am inviting all members of the community-and I thought the opposition would share in this because of the role of its shadow spokesperson in this matter-to have a good, hard look at what the police and our housing authorities do and at what happens at the hospital front door. For instance, in Western Australia recently I have been advised that far too few people, young people in particular, attending accident and emergency services as attempted suicides are not given any psychiatric or psychological counselling; they are simply turned away after medical treatment. That level of hospital management is not satisfactory. Clearly, if turned around, it could improve significantly the mental health of our community and, in this case, young people attempting suicide. We all have, I hope, a very strong commitment to this area. National mental health week gives us an opportunity, too, to break down some of those stigmas that people with mental illness face. We are putting some $8 million into a special campaign, not just through the media and magazines but through community organisations and advocacy groups, to help them break down the stigma, ignorance and misinformation that exists in our community. Teachers, lawyers, doctorseverybody-need to look at their behaviour in this area and make sure that they are not adding to the misinformation, the discrimination and the stigmatisation.",43

57,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Transport.

Let me say, to him and to the House that I believe there should be a further opportunity as well. Mr Speaker and members of the House, you would be aware that last Friday I sent to the chief executive of the Civil Aviation Authority a 'please explain' in respect of misleading statements made earlier in the week about ramp checks of Seaview Air. I asked for a report by Sunday-that is, yesterday-in respect of this matter. I have received the reply of the chief executive of the Civil Aviation Authority, and it is now my intention to recommend to the government that there be a judicial inquiry into these matters. That is a recommendation I will put to the cabinet at a later hour today and, subject to cabinet's concurrence, we will announce the terms of reference of that judicial inquiry. For the record, Mr Speaker, I table my correspondence of last Friday to Mr Roser and Mr Roser's response received yesterday by me. Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, I raise a further point of order. Further to that tabling, I invite the minister to table the other letters referred to by the minister in seeking further information from the member for Hume, none of which asked for further information in this respect of Seaview airlines because we saw them tabled last week. Retable them and we will prove the point.",45

It included the correspondence from the Director of Aviation Services, dated 5 May 1994, to Mr Sharp; and a copy of Mr Sharp's response 31 days later, on 6 June, when he said that he was concerned about the confidentiality of his material. He said this: I have already had discussions with the Minister for Transport and have detailed to him my concerns. I have to say that he did not give me any evidence but he did draw my attention to what he had said in the parliament-and I shared his concerns. Let me indicate his words in his correspondence. He said: I communicated to himthat is, memy wish for a parliamentary inquiry into the issues that have arisen, including those regarding the CAA. My discussions are continuing and, under those circumstances and especially in view of the fact that the Civil Aviation Authority is subject to the complaints by my informants in the first place, I do not regard it as appropriate that I should accede to your request and bring forward this information. He was then written to again by the Civil Aviation Authority. Mr Tim Fischer-No mention of Seaview in that letter either.",45
81,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is in reply to all of the matters-Seaview and the other matters that he mentioned in his speech. On that occasion, it was said: While I appreciate your concerns about confidentiality, you must also appreciate that the allegations you have made, particularly in relation to corruption, are very serious if they are true. They are matters which the authority wishes to get to the heart of straight away. The general nature of your allegations make it very difficult for us to quickly investigate the validity of the claims being made under parliamentary privilege. In order to provide us at least with details of the alleged corruptionMr Tim Fischer-'Corruption' is right!",46
82,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Of course. It further states: ... so that we can investigate those matters, could I suggest you make use of the CAIR system conducted by BASI which enables confidential reporting of such matters. And, of course, it is a matter of record that on 4 July Mr Sharp wrote back again declining that second offer. It is a matter of record, also tabled in this parliament along with this correspondence, that when he met with me on 21 July I personally urged him to put his information before the appropriate authorities. That invitation stands. It is not just an offer; it is a responsibility on him, on anyone else in this parliament, to come forward with that evidence. Employment",46
83,Ms DEAHM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Can the Prime Minister inform the House about the current state of women's employment and participation as revealed in last week's labour force data? What does that data indicate about Australia's economic recovery?,46
84,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Last week's labour force figures confirm that our continuing and sustained economic recovery is translating into jobs-real jobs-and, of course, overwhelmingly full-time jobs. The broad context is worth reiterating. For the first time",46
85,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,46
86,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I know that the opposition is galled by the fact that there is strong employment in this country. It hates to hear about it. For the first time, there are over eight million Australians in employment, with job creation since the election being 413,000. Mr Speaker, you and the House will recall that the government aimed at a target of half a million jobs in the course of this term-a figure which, I might say, was scoffed at by the opposition before the last election. We will now achieve that target comfortably on the basis of the growth we have seen to date. We are two-thirds of the way through in just over half the time. The fundamental thing is for governments to have clearly defined and workable policies and to deliver on significant promises. And I think the delivery of jobs, which was a key issue in the last election, is about as significant as it gets. Behind the figures lie some important messages. One of the most significant of these relates to the recent labour market success of Australian women. There has been no time in Australian history when women have participated more in the labour force. The participatarget tion rate is 53.2 per cent, which compares years. with a rate of less than 40 per cent in the 1960s. Over recent decades, the increase in participation of Australian women has been impressive internationally. Since 1967, for example, we have overtaken France, Austria, Germany and Switzerland. These achievements are also reflected in employment data. In the last year over 160,000 jobs have been created for women, and 60 per cent of these are full time. While the recovery has also been strong for men, the rate of increase in paid employment for women has been a striking feature of the labour market data. Women's skills are essential to the future growth of the economy. As you know, Mr which Speaker, for a long time now the government has sought to improve the opportunities participation by women in the work force by growing out the number of child-care places. As a consequence, we promised in the electo tion to meet the demand for work related child care by the year 2001, with an interim target of 300,000 places by 1996-97. ahead of our schedule to meet this target, with an extra 38,000 places funded since the election, bringing the total number of childcare places to 242,000. From memory, when the government was first elected to office in stated: 1983, there were 40,000-odd only child-care places in this country. Now it rising sharply. The current labour market reflects a very healthy position for Australian women. have delivered on jobs; we are delivering the provision of work related child care; and, with the significant measures in the white paper, we will be delivering for the long-term unemployed. Last week I gave the House the figures for those categorised as long-term sponse. unemployed. The number of long-term unemployed has now fallen to under 300,000indeed, to 290,000. So, on the principal commitment of jobs, it is there. On the commitment to participation in the work force by women, it is there. On the commitment to back up support of child care, we are ahead of the schedule, as indeed we are on the general commitment of the but he hasn't yet. of half a million places over three Aviation: Safety",46

108,Mr JENKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security. I refer to the substantive measures provided by the govern to assist retired Australians. Is it intended to make changes to those support meas,48
109,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Scullin for his question. Members would be aware of the broad shape of the government's retirement income policy. There are two broad legs to it. The first is an effiin ciently targeted age pension scheme. We have worked over the past decade to ensure that pension is directed to those in need. The real level of assistance has been improved quite significantly with a 14 per cent real rise. The government has achieved its target of raising pensions to 25 per cent of average earnings. That was achieved in April 1990, and it has been sustained since. The other leg of the government's retirement income policy is to encourage and the spread of occupational superannuation. A range of measures has been implemented in pursuit of that. The net effect is that we have a retirement incomes structure which is well attuned to the needs of society as we move into the next century with a will substantial ageing population. The World Bank has recently put out a which refers to our system as 'a model for national old age security systems in both as developed and developing countries'. What we are in effect getting is a hybrid system which is very well attuned to the circumstances and the demographic changes which are being undertaken. We do not say that the system is perfect. We are, as honourable members would be aware, currently reviewing the income and assets tests. As a result of that, I hope that we can come up with a structure which remains sufficiently targeted but which is also clearer, simpler, robust and stable in the face of change. That is where the government is at. We await the final report of the consultant who has been reviewing our income and assets test. What does the opposition say? For all the platitudes in The Things That Matter, there is not even a commitment to maintain indexation of pensions, let alone maintain the target of 25 per cent of average weekly earnings that we have achieved. Similarly with respect to superannuation, it says that it would freeze the superannuation guarantee. In other words, the two key elements of our structure which the World Bank has praised it would seek to undermine. Honourable members would be aware that in answering a number of questions recently I have said that the opposition has failed to come up with appropriate spending cuts while calling on us to run a tighter fiscal policy. I was critical of it for that. But some information has recently come to light which may force me to revise that conclusion quite significantly. I am referring to a recent speech by the Leader of the National Party to the Cartwright Hills branch of the Country Women's Association, in the course of which-this one is the mother of all savings options-he is reported to have said: . . . it was time for Australians to follow example of some Asian countries on their commitment to the family. In countries such as Thailand there was no thing as a senior pension or welfare payments to the old, he said. ""Pensions are family oriented-the family looks after its own."" What an extraordinary proposition! I cannot deny that that is a savings option. That is $11. 7 billion off the budget deficit straight away. That is pretty impressive. As a piece of social policy, to say that it leaves something to be desired would have to be the understatement of the century. You might say that this is just a slip of the tongue or something",48
110,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, it's written down.",49
111,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, this is reported in the Wagga Advertiser, which repeated this statement in an editorial a couple of days later. To date, to the best of my knowledgeand I have had my media people go right through the Wagga Advertiser-there has been no retraction, no correction and no clarification of this statement. I guess, from this, we are to conclude that the policy of the Leader of the National Party on retirement incomes is to get rid of the age pension. Tomorrow morning I will be addressing the annual general meeting of the Combined Pensioners and Superannuants Association and I will be drawing its attention and the attention of all other retiree organisations to the stance of the Leader of the National Party. Mr Downer interjecting",49
112,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Does he endorse it? You endorse it.,49
113,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,On the John Laws program he talked about unspecified welfare cuts. Now we start to get a bit of the sense of where it is going. This is an example of the social policy of the opposition. It is a joke. It is a farce. I think that should be clear to all who follow these things. Aviation: Safety,49
114,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Transport. When did he become aware of allegations that second-hand aircraft with falsified identification and the maintenance records were being sold in Australia? Is it a fact that his department knew about this practice last year and was such alerted again as recently as three weeks ago? What actions has the minister taken? Have the suspect aircraft been inspected? Is he aware that aircraft dealers say that the new CAA registration system is not worth the paper it is written on? Does this mean that, as finance and insurance companies are covering the wrong aircraft, the end buyers and brokers are not covered if they make a claim or if the aircraft are seized?",49
115,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is a matter that has been the subject of comment in the newspapers of late, but it has also been the subject of some controversy for some time. In respect of the allegations raised on Channel 9 last year",50
116,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Sturt!,50
117,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I can inform the House that these allegations were first reported not this October but last October. They again are the subject of press reports and are also the subject of investigation by the Australian Federal Police. I am advised that the Civil Aviation Authority is assisting the AFP in those investigations and the inquiries are continuing. They have been on foot for many months now and are on foot in the United States. I do not intend to comment further on that until such time as we have seen the results of the police inquiries. Oflate the question of MiG-15 and MiG-17 permits has been raised. I am advised that application for permits to fly these historical and ex-military aircraft have been presented to the CAA, with service history and certificates supplied by an overseas body. The certificates were accepted as the basis for the issuing of permits to fly for the same aircraft. Following recent advice from the Australian Federal Police, which again has been investigating this on an ongoing basis, as to the authenticity of the service history documentation, the Civil Aviation Authority has withdrawn the relevant permits. AFP inquiries are continuing into the importation of these aircraft. Australian Public Service: Women",50
118,Mr LANGMORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations and relates to the issue of gender balance in the Public Service. Can the minister advise the House on the career expectations for women in the Australian Public Service and the extent to which women are currently represented at senior management levels in the Public Service?,50
119,Mr JOHNS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Thank you for that question.  Mary?,50
120,Mr JOHNS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Commonwealth government, as the nation's largest employer, will have an important impact on the employment of women at senior management levels.",50
121,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I warn the member for Sturt. If you ask the question again, you can go out and find her.",50
122,Mr JOHNS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is important that the Commonwealth, as th- nation's largest employer, should have an excellent record in the employment of women at senior levels because of its demonstration to all other employers in the country. It is important also to remember that advancement in the Australian Public Service is on the basis of merit. Holding true to that notion of merit, it is clear that the advancement of women in the Australian Public Service would only ever be on the basis of merit. I am pleased to report that there have been some good figures of late on the advancement of women. According to a report on Senior Executive Service figures, the latest statistics for 1992-93 released by the Public Service Commission indicate that the overall representation of women in the SES and the proportion of SES vacancies filled by women have both increased and that the overall representation of women in the SES stood at 15.7 per cent at the end of last year compared with 14.4 per cent a year earlier. What is more important is that the proportion of advertised SES vacancies filled by women increased signi ficantly to 27 per cent in 1992-93 compared with 20 per cent in 1991-92. The Commonwealth has established a target for the year 2000-to have 20 p-r cent of women in senior positions. We will easily exceed that performance indicator because of the following figure alone. Mr Downer-This is a test, is it, to see if you are good enough?",50
123,Mr JOHNS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, it really is difficult to concentrate",50
124,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I again remind those on the front bench on my left of the provisions of standing order 55. I have refrained from a general warning and will continue to do so. But I remind you of that.,50

126,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,51
127,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I could change my mind.,51
128,Mr JOHNS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"To get it on to the record, it can take a minute or five minutes. It does not matter to me. Women make up over half of the intake of graduate administrative assistants in the APS. This is the key feeder group to future senior executives. In 1982-83, women made up 39 per cent of the graduate intake; in 1987-88, 47 per cent; and in 1992-93, 53 per cent. In addition, the Department of Finance has indicated in a paper on the promotional opportunities for women in the APS that there is very little difference between the career paths of males and females appointed at the graduate administrative assistant level. There is no evidence of systematic bias impeding the movement of women into and above the senior officer level in the APS. I am pleased to report that the APS is exceeding its own target on the promotion of women into senior positions. I would be confident of setting even higher indicators for the future for allowing women into senior positions in the Commonwealth's public service. Aviation: Safety",51
129,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I direct my question to the Minister for Transport. I refer the minister to the judicial inquiry that he is proposing to establish into civil aviation matters. Will the judicial inquiry be denied powers to investigate his conduct as a minister? Or will the judicial inquiry be able to investigate the negligence and incompetence of the Minister for Transport?,51
130,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Cabinet will determine the terms of reference for the judicial inquiry. I have nothing to fear in this matter whatsoever because at every point, at every tum, when information has come into my hands I have acted promptly, speedily and effectively to refer it to the appropriate authorities. If anyone has withheld information or failed to act on matters within their knowledge, it certainly is not me. Health Insurance",51
131,Mr MARTYN EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Human Services and Health. Can the minister outline any recent financial changes which have been announced in the private health insurance industry? Are the changes consistent with the government's policy direction?,51
132,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Clearly, the government wants to ensure that Medicare and access for public patients to public hospitals are the centrepiece of our health policy. But we also want to ensure that Australians have a genuine choice in the private sector and value for money through their private health insurance. There were a few sceptics when we introduced our reform package for private health insurance and for the private health sector generally. But there are a couple of recent changes, in advance of those reforms actually coming into effect, which show how it can be done. I draw them to the attention of members opposite who have been amongst those sceptics. I am delighted indeed that, as a result of preferred provider models which have been under experiment in Victoria for some time, Medibank Private in Victoria has been able to announce a reduction of 19 per cent in the cost of top cover health insurance. It has done that by negotiating with private hospitals and with doctors in a way that will now be possible for all health funds around the country. It shows what can be done when competition in the private health market is introduced. It is significant that the opposition, rather than introduce competition-which we might have thought was part of its philosophy-has preferred to talk about tax rebates and tax handouts. I notice that the enthusiasm for that has dropped off a little. The shadow spokeswoman for health, addressing a meeting of the private health industry recently, when asked precisely what tax rebates might be given by the opposition if it were ever to get into government, what they would cost and where the funds would come from, simply refused to answer the question and said that the questioner was asking the wrong question. Given the course of the considerable mirth from the audience which ensued, that question still has not been answered. In the face of this example from Medibank Private of a nearly 20 per cent reduction in top cover premiums for the same benefits, I think the opposition should rethink what it passes for a health policy. Sydney Harbour Thnne'",51
133,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I refer the Minister for Transport to the report of the New South Wales Auditor-General concerning the Sydney Harbour Tunnel released today which discloses that the total cost of that deal has soared from your original figure of $600 million to an estimated $4,000 million. Is it a fact that if certain tax deductions are not allowed additional liability of between $20 to $70 million will be thrust on the New South Wales taxpayers because, in defiance of New South Wales Treasury advice, you insisted on the contract being signed in a particular form, highly advantageous to the joint venturers Transfie1d and Kumagai? Can you advise the House whether or not funds will be made available from your federal transport budget to reimburse the New South Wales government in respect of this additional liability if it is found to arise? Why do you not tell us the full extent of your involvement in that transaction?",52
134,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I welcome the opportunity to comment upon the Sydney Harbour Tunnel project. After all, it just happens to be one of the construction marvels of the last five decades in Australia. It was not a bad financial deal for the people of New South Wales, either. In fact, it is opment for Sydney that we can even afford to look at the Cahill Expressway. That is something that I join with the Prime Minister in welcoming a review of. The honourable member has suggested to the House that this was in some way my contract. Let me explain to this House the means by which the contract was entered into for the Sydney Harbour Tunnel. It was done by cabinet decision in 1987 and by legislative enactment in the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales. The contract, and every term in that contract, was contained in that legislation, which was adopted by the parliament. The tunnel has been open for a couple of years now. The people who were very happy to open it, the people who have been very happy to marvel at it, are the same people who would never have had the guts or the gumption to build it. It has been suggested in the paper of late that there may be some tax liabilityMr Downer-You read it in the paper again.",52
135,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,52
136,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I certainly have not read Mr Harris's report. It has been suggested that there may be some liability on the people of New South Wales for about $20 million in respect of the harbour tunnel project. Mr Howard interjecting,52
137,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Bennelong!,52
138,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This comes seven years later and two years after it has been open. The project was built at a cost of several hundred million dollars and provides enormous assistance to Sydney. If it is a case of New South Wales being up for $20 million payable to this Commonwealth of Australia, I say: what is wrong with that? It is a contract entered into by the New South Wales government in respect of a project which is bringing enormous benefit to the people of Sydney and New South Wales.",52
139,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,And a few others.,52
140,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I warn the member such a good devel- for Bennelong.,52
141,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If it breaks that way, and if there is a liability of some $20 million on the basis of an enactment of the New South Wales parliament, it would certainly need to be seen in the context of the $102 million provided in untied grants by this government to the New South Wales government last year for road building purposes, which comprises a very important part of its total budget on roads of more than $1.9 billion. We gave the New South Wales government $102 million but it misappropriated $51 miIIion of that $102 million and spent it on non-road purposes. So I do not think that we should feel too sympathetic towards the New South Wales government if, as a result of a tax audit seven years later, there is some liability. Quite frankly, if you had gone the way of the then New South Wales opposition, now the government, like so many other projects-such as the pulling down of the Cahill Expressway or the building of the tunnel under eastern Sydney-it would never happen. Seven long years later, we are stiII waiting for the eastern suburbs tunnel project to proceed. The first project was cancelledMr Costello-Like the third runway.",52
142,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The third runway will open in a couple of weeks time, thanks to this government and thanks to One Nation. The second airport will be built by this government 15 years ahead of schedule and the third runway will be opened as soon as the final safety checks are completed in the next couple of weeks. In answer to the honourable member, I think we should leave these matters where they quite properly lie: in the tax relationship between the proponents of the project and the Commonwealth Commissioner of Taxation. If we had gone down any other path, that tunnel project would certainly never have been built.",53
143,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I would like to add to the answer. The implication of the question was that the original tender, in the hands of Transfield, being $600 million, was rising and there was a benefit to Transfield. The chief executive officer of Transfield was not the Treasurer of the Labor Party at the time. Could you imagine a New South Wales Labor government handing out a casino licence to its Treasurer? Could you imagine that? Could you imagine the hue and cry up and down the country if a Labor government handed out a licence to a major casino, saying, 'I'll tell you what we'll do here. We'll give it to the Treasurer of our party. What do you think about that? That would be a terrific outcome.' Could you imagine the scream that would come from the other side of the House?",53
144,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The Prime Minister will resume his seat. Mr Thckey- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I raise the question of relevance. Prime Minister, you could not get a government job in Western Australia unless you paid the money.",53
145,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for O'Connor will resume his seat! There is no point of order.,53
146,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will conclude on this point: the puny political point being raised by the member for Bennelong is one of preference for one of Australia's primary civil engineering and construction contractors-one which has been considered, by the way, for the tunnel in Victoria. The fact is that the people opposite are so hot that they run 'the guilty party' advertisements in Victoria and then, two minutes later, hand the licence to their Treasurer for their casino. You have got to be joking. You have got to be cracking jokes over there. Bougainville",53
147,Mr HOLLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Can the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs inform the House whether it was an Australian provided patrol boat that fired on the cruise ship Club Med II south east of Bougainville last Sunday, as alleged by a spokesperson for the Bougainville rebels?",53
148,Mr BILNEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It is a matter of great regret that the Bougainville peace talks have concluded with everybody going home and nobody getting any further towards a settlement.,53
149,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,53
150,Mr BILNEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am sure that will be as much a regret to opposition members-who regard this with great hilarity-as it has been to people on the government side. I have seen varying reports of what happened between Bougainville and the Solomon Islands. One report has it that a group of armed men in an open boat did the shooting, and that seems to be nearer the truth of the matter than the suggestion that it was a group of people in a patrol boat. They fired a number of shots at or across the bow of the cruise vessel Club Med II, around 35 kilometres off Koromira on the south-eastern coast of Bougainville. That cruise vessel is French. It was en route from Guam to Noumea at the time, carrying a crew of around 150 people, including one Australian, but no passengers. The vessel was not hit. There were no injuries. Nobody has claimed or accepted responsibility so far for this incident, but a spokesman for the Papua New Guinea government has said that there is no suggestion that the PNG defence force was involved. The suggestion by some elements of the Bougainville rebels that the vessel which was shot at was an Australian patrol boat, or the one that did the shooting, are both without foundation. Shipping: ANL",53
151,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Transport. As an avid reader of the newspapers, he will have no doubt read this morning's Australian report which asserts that he acted way beyond his brief in talking down the value of a public asset; namely, ANL. Further, why did he ignore a warning from the former chairman of ANL issued on 29 June that his actions threatened 'the company's continuation as a going concern'? Can the minister explain whether his actions to withdraw ANL from sale and then, less than a month later, to offer it for tender, were part of a deliberate strategy to devalue the company, or were they a product of his sheer incompetence? Either way, is it not time for him to go?",54
152,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As the Prime Minister reminds me, a former chairman of the Brisbane stock exchange of course is an expert in all these questions of propriety! The honourable member asked a question about ANL, and he suggests that I may have devalued ANL during my time as minister. Let me tell you a thing or two: I did not have to do anything to devalue ANL because ANL has been and continues to be in quite a good deal of strife. That is why the government has launched its rescue package. That is a matter of fact. Mr Downer-You are talking it down.",54
153,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, I am going to say something about its state right now. The article in the Australian this morning states that the Auditor-General 'will reconfirm his assessment that ANL is a going concern'. That is the import of the article. The last report I had from the Auditor-General in relation to ANL was for the year 1992-1993. Regrettably, he has not forwarded the audited accounts for 1993-94. The House should be aware that, in accordance with the Audit Act, the Auditor-General is responsible for the audits of such bodies as ANL. That is his job. As far as the value of the company is concerned, I make no excuses for relying upon the due diligence report commissioned by us and conducted by Price Waterhouse-Salomon Brothers. That was not the only knowledge that I had of the dire straits of ANL. The former chairman wrote to me on 22 August 1994 advising me that ANL's own auditor had indicated that he was giving consideration to qualifying-I repeat, qualifying-ANL's accounts and that the directors of ANL were concerned that ANL would be unable to pay its debts as and when they became due. I also knew something of the worth of this company from advice separately received from the chief executive of the company, who wrote to me a couple of weeks before on 8 August, in which he advised that the ANL board, at its meeting of 27 July, had resolved to seek my permission-rnoi, the Minister for Transport to a further drawdownOpposition members-Why?",54
154,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You should listen to this because it is pretty important-on its promissory note funding because cash flow forecasts showed the need for working capital. You do not have to be an economic genius to work out what that means. It means that ANL had to borrow money in August or September of this year to pay its wages. That is the state of ANL, and that has been against the background of Price Waterhouse-Salomon Brothers. I have already provided that information in answers to questions which were tabled in the Senate a couple of weeks ago. I have made my statements. Let me say this: the fact that ANL is continuing to trade against the background that I have just informed the House of is rpurely due to the government moving to <guarantee ANL's debts and its other liabilities. That is the state of ANL. That is why we are intent on rescuing it. Quite frankly, I am very proud of the role I played in ordering the due diligence, in having this matter tackled, in appointing a new board and in mounting the rescue package. Education: Non-Government Schools",54
155,Mr QUICK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Educatheory. tion and Training. Is the minister aware of concerns that the Commonwealth government know how we do. is restricting parental choice and involvement in school education? What action, if any, the minister intending to take with regard those concerns?",55
156,Mr FREE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Franklin for his question. The suggestion that the Commonwealth is restricting freedom of choice in education is contained in the document The Things That Matter, which claims that this government is seeking interfere with the responsibilities of the states and non-government school authorities. suggestion is backed up by implication in the section headed 'Our goals for school education'. There the opposition says that will 'encourage greater diversity within the school system', that it will 'ensure continued financial support for government and non76.6 government schools', and that it will 'support a strong, viable non-government school performing sector'. The inference in that document that this government has neglected non-government their schools is a blatant attempt to mislead. From 1966 to 1983-for which the coalition govrelevant erned for all but three years-enrolments at non-government schools rose from 23 of all enrolments to 24 per cent. From 1984 to 1993, during the period of this government, enrolments have risen from 24 per cent to per cent. I fail to see how that kind of incurrently crease-four times the increase allowed by the coalition during its years in office--can possibly justify the accusation that we are restricting choice, particularly when the major funding partner of the non-government schools is the Commonwealth. I want to assure the House that the nongovernment sector is being supported by this government to stand as a strong and viable part of our education system. The opposition spokesman, the honourable member for Braddon, has some peculiar ideas about increasing choice. For example, we learned from the pages of the Canberra Times that the honourable member for Braddon insists that creationism should be taught in all schools alongside evolution, which he says is just a",55
157,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,We can breed them; I don't,55
158,Mr FREE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We can breed them. The point is is that the Commonwealth does not have to jurisdiction over what is taught in schools; that is a matter for the states. So if anybody is seeking to interfere with the proper responsibilities of the states, it is the opposition. The honourable member for Braddon also insists that all schools should teach Christian values. We can all wonder just how the opposition to would explain such a policy to the Jewish schools or the Muslim schools in Australia if This it had to implement this policy. The honourable member for Braddon would be far better employed using his time to it address the problems of school education in his home state, where retention rates are 60.6 per cent compared with a national average of per cent; that is, Tasmania is 16 per cent behind the national average. It is the worse state of Australia by far. But more worrying is the fact that only one in two boys in Tasmanian government schools ever finish full schooling. In other words, these kids will never have the opportunity to obtain the skills they need to enter the work force. This is a matter of state disgrace and a per cent matter of national concern. Anybody doubting the consequence of such low retention rates in Tasmania has only to 28 remember that unemployment in that state is 10.9 per cent, well above the national average of 9.5 per cent. The opposition generally, and its shadow minister in particular, would be much better served examining the realities of Australian school education than trying to make creationism compulsory in schools and attacking the independence of church schools. It should also understand that its rhetoric about choice is insubstantial and hypocritical when compared with the reality of this government's achievements in school education.",55
159,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA Legislation: Presentation to the House",56
160,Mr ROCHER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Last Thursday afternoon proceedings in the House were inordinately delayed because legislation being introduced by the government was not presentable in the prescribed way. Mr Speaker, you will recall that the otherwise routine procedures took three or four times the necessary time. Mr Speaker, the incident being unprecedented in my experience, can you make inquiries and advise the House if the delays were deliberate and intended to delay resumption of a debate on the Notice Paper? If so, what action will you take?",56
161,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I recall the incident the honourable member refers to, and I would agree that perhaps it did take a lot loriger than would normally be the case. I can only caution ministers that, when legislation is being introduced, they try to have the relevant bill signed and amendments initialled and so on. Whether an investigation is likely to throw up some of the reasons the honourable member speculates on, I am not sure. I will have a look at the issue and perhaps I can advise him at a later date. NA Suspension of Standing and Sessional",56
162,Mr SHARP,MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT,"I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the honourable member for Hume moving forthwith: that the House requires the Minister for Transport to explain why he has failed in his responsibilities by (1) allowing the Chief Executive Officer of the Civil Aviation Authority to continue in his job Swan, W.

Secondly, on a far more serious matter, I refer to the comments made by the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) this afternoon that I needed to be breathalysed-an inaccurate attack relating to a major road accident I was involved in earlier this year.

I say to the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), because I think he raises this in the spirit of genuine concern, that there was an episode last week when a particular comment was made by one on my left to the minister when he was answering a question, which subsequently was withdrawn.

In a significant number of these reports I have been misrepresented. Mr Speaker, rather than enumerate each of these matters, which would unduly delay the House, with your indulgence I wish to make three points of clarification very briefly. First, contrary to the reports I did not this matter to the High Court. The Herald and Weekly Times applied to the High Court for a constitutional ruling on this matter. Secondly, also contrary to reports, the ruling of the High Court did not end the matter of defamation in relation to my case. The High Court has introduced a new set of criteria which are to apply only to members of parliament and public figures. Although this would make it more difficult for MPs to establish defamatory cases, there are major questions as to the interpretation of the new criteria. My case is likely, therefore, to return to the county which will need to make such determinations. Thirdly, some reports have asserted that I am opposed to the reform of defamation laws. That is not true. What I have consistently said is that there should be one defamation law for all citizens rather than having strong protection for ordinary citizens and much less protection for public figures, especially where matters of personal integrity are concerned.",60

I have now received a copy of at least one article from the Canberra Times which I will draw the House's attention to. In his answer, the minister said that I believed three things should be compulsory in schools. I think he said they were creationism, Christian values and evolution. I want to correct the record for the parliament. I have not said that. He was referring to, I presume, a comment by a journalist, 'Miles is also keen to see Christian values retained in school teaching.' I think that is quite different from saying that Christian values should be compulsory. There are many values which cross a lot of different religious backgrounds, like honesty and care and respect for people and take people's property. They are all Christian values.

Your Petitioners ask that the House of Representatives call on the Government to: (a) increase funding for breast cancer research ten-fold (a minimum of $14 million) in the 1994/95 Budget; and (b) consider further initiatives through the tax system to encourage donations for breast cancer research. by Mrs Bishop (from 1,360 citizens), Mr Cameron (from 15 citizens), Mr Duncan (from 151 citizens), Mr Sinclair (from 96 citizens) and Ms Worth (from 163 citizens).

Your Petitioners ask that the House of Representatives call on the Government to: (a) increase funding for breast cancer research to a minimum of $14 million in the 1995/96 budget; and (b) consider further initiatives through the tax system to encourage donations to breast cancer research. by Mrs Bishop (from 48 citizens) and Mr Filing (from 252 citizens). To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia dmws to the attention of the House: The ANZACS at the Gallipoli landing on 25th April 1915 were instrumental in forging a new identity for Austmlia. That landing was a lifetime ago but the deeds of those ANZACS of 1915-18 still speak a message of selfless service and sacrifice that will last forever. ANZAC Day is a day to remember those who left their homes with a strong desire to return but did not, as well as those who did return. The survivors carried for the remainder of their lives the scars of these experiences. ANZAC Day is a day to contemplate the spirit that moves men and women to serve, to suffer discomforts, dangers and fears and to risk their lives in defence of their country and in the pursuit of peace, justice and .freedom. On ANZAC Day, we salute not only the spirit of the ANZACS but, in paying tribute to them, we take the opportunity to dedicate ourselves to striving for our country as they did and to upholding their finest qualities of courage, commitment, endurance and mateship. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House draw to the attention of the Government the desirability of declaring ANZAC Dayan Australian National Day of Commemoration and that it be held on 25th April in each year, regardless of the day of the week on which it shall fall. by Mr Forrest (from eight citizens), Mr Jenkins (from 16 citizens), Mr Newell (from 16 citizens) and Mrs Sullivan (from 13 citizens). ANZAC Day To the Honoumble the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House: The ANZACs at the Gallipoli landing on 25 April 1915 were instrumental in forging a new identity for Austmlia. That landing was a lifetime ago but the deeds of those ANZACs of 1915-18 still speak a message of selfless service and sacrifice that will last forever. ANZAC Day is a day to remember those who left their homes with a strong desire to return but did not, as well as those who did return, but in so doing carried for the remainder of their lives the scars of these experiences. ANZAC Day It is a day to contemplate the spirit that moves men and women to serve, to suffer discomforts, dangers and fears and to risk their lives in defence of their country and in the pursuit of peace, justice and freedom. On ANZAC Day, we salute not only the spirit of the ANZACs but, in paying tribute to them, we take the opportunity to dedicate ourselves to striving for our country as they did and to upholding their finest qualities of courage, commitment, endurance and mateship. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House urge the Government to declare ANZAC day as Australia's National Day of Commemoration and that it be held on 25 April in each year, and on no other day. Ms Deahm (from 309 citizens) and Mr Somlyay (from 10 citizens). To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws the attention of the House to the fact that Australia is now a signatory to more than 2100 international treaties, conventions and agreements, which, once ratified, bind Australia by international law to implement and to abide by them. While accepting that it is necessary for Australia to subscribe to many of these agreements if it is to participate freely and effectively as a member of the international community, we are concerned that such agreements are signed and ratified by the Executive Government without first being referred to the Australian Parliament for inquiry or debate. We are further concerned that there is no provision in the Australian Constitution for such a course of action to be followed by the Executive Government. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House will: 1. request the Executive Government to immediately place a moratorium on the signing and ratification of any further international treaties, conventions and agreements unless they have been examined by Parliament; 2. request that the moratorium remain in place until such time as the people of Australia have been asked, by way of a referendum, whether they will support an amendment to the Constitution to include a clause stating that all international treaties, conventions and agreements must be examined by the Parliament before they come into force in Australia. by Mr Anderson (from 91 citizens) and Mr Tim Fischer (from nine citizens). To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain residents of the State of South Australia draws the attention of the House to the matter that many Australian citizens of diverse cultural backgrounds would be able to take up dual citizenship without ceasing to be Australian citizens were it not for the provisions of section 17 of the Australian Citizenship Act of 1948 (as amended). Such persons would dearly welcome the opportunity of taking up the citizenship of such other country, which in many cases is their birth right but would not wish to put in jeopardy the citizenship of this country Australia which they are proud to call their home. Given that there is already a not insignificant number of Australian citizens who already enjoy Treaties dual citizenship, your petitioners therefore pray that the House will give deliberation to the matter of amending section 17 and related sections 18 and 23 of the Australian Citizenship Act 1948 to enable such persons to enjoy dual citizenship. by Mr Ferguson (from 1,000 citizens). Citizenship To the Honourable, the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain residents of the State of Western Australia draws the attention of the House to the matter that many Australian citizens of diverse cultural backgrounds would be able to take up dual citizenship without ceasing to be Australian citizens were it not for the provisions of section 17 of the Australian Citizenship Act of 1948 (as amended). Such persons would dearly welcome the opportunity of taking up the citizenship of such other country, which in many cases is their birth right but would not wish to put in jeopardy the citizenship of this country Australia which they are proud to call their home. Given that there is already a not insignificant number of Australian citizens who already enjoy dual citizenship, your petitioners therefore pray that the House will give deliberation to the matter of amending section 17 and related sections 18 and 23 of the Australian Citizenship Act 1948 to enable such persons to enjoy dual citizenship. by Mr Ferguson (from 1,807 citizens). Bears To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain residents of the State of Western Australia draws to the attention of the Citizenship House that approximately 8,000 bears are being kept in cages in China for the purpose of extracting bile for medical purposes and that the cages are so small the bears cannot move, which results in some of them going mad. It is further brought to the attention of the House that the Chinese plan to increase the number of bears, for these purposes, to 40,000. Your petitioners therefore respectfully ask the House of Representatives to object most strongly to this horrendous and tragic practice and ask that steps be taken to stop it immediately. by Mr Cameron (from 1,310 citizens). Dogs: Export to Asia To the Honourable Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain residents of the state of Western Australia draws to the attention of the House that over 7,000 puppies were exported from Australia to Hong Kong last year. It is further brought to the attention of the House that these Australia-bred dogs are being condemned to lives of misery in cramped apartment buildings. It is finally brought to the attention of the House that the dogs are treated cruelly, are not cared for and that the dogs should not be brought up in such an environment. Your petitioners therefore respectfully ask the House of Representatives to introduce greater restrictions on the export of dogs to Asia, and ensure that if any dogs are exported, proof is provided that they are satisfactorily looked after, and that if there is a breach of such restrictions, severe fines be introduced. by Mr Cameron (from 356 citizens). Refugee Status To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in the Federal Parliament Assembled: We, the undersigned citizens of Australia call the House to support the applications of Li Shi Ping and Liu Xiu Ling for refugee status. After fleeing persecution in their homeland of China these two young people have suffered greatly and have been held in custody in Western Australia for approximately two years. Liu Xiu Ling is a paraplegic confined to a wheelchair and it would be lacking greatly in compassion to send her back to China in this state. We, the undersigned, request the release of these two young people into the community where they will receive friendship and practical support. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that you will give this matter earnest consideration and your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Cameron (from 319 citizens). Constitutional Monarchy To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of the undersigned shows: We, the undersigned citizens, respectfully submit that Australia, under its constitutional system based on the Monarchy, is one of the world's most successful democracies. The petitioners note particularly that: Australia is one of the world's oldest democracies Australia has led the world in many democratic reforms Our constitution, based on the Monarchy, has: ensured national independence maintained national unity in a federation provided constitutional stability protected our liberties and freedoms produced a tolerant society Your petitioners therefore request the House that: Australia should remain a democratic constitutional Monarchy with Her Majesty, the Queen of Australia as our Head of State and represented in Australia by a Governor General. by Mr Downer (from 205 citizens). Constitutional Monarchy To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth that: Australia, under its constitutional system based on the Monarchy, is one of the world's most successful democracies. The petitioners note that on our Constitution, based on the Monarchy, has: ensured national independence maintained national unity in a federation provided constitutional stability protected our liberties and freedoms produced a tolerant society.

And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Lloyd (from 113 citizens). To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in the Parliament of Australia assembled. We, the undersigned, note that the Japanese Government is transporting 1.7 tonnes of plutonium, by the vessel Akatsuki Maru from France as part of its accumulation of over thirty tonnes highly toxic material for use in a fast breeder reactor. We express our deep concern that these shipments are a significant step in the development of international commerce in plutonium and request that the Federal Government: 1. Protest in the strongest possible terms at Japan's shipment of highly dangerous plutonium from France to Japan. 2. Call for a haIt to this trade, along with other Asia-Pacific countries which have also opposed the transportation of plutonium. 3. Impose a ban on: (a) any transport of plutonium through Australian waters. (b) any use of our ports by the vessel for any purpose, including a nuclear emergency. 4. Express its strongest possible opposition to any nuclear weapons program by Japan. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that you will give this matter earnest consideration, and your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Filing (from 15 citizens). Programming: ABC To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia states that we feel any decision by the Australian Broadcasting Commission to change its programming to replace the current 7pm State News and 7.30 Report programs will result in an unacceptable reduction in coverage of Western Australian events of vital interest to residents of this state. We therefore call on the parliament to act immediately to ensure the Australian Broadcasting Commission continue its current programming of News and current affairs in Western Australia. by Mr Filing (from 12 citizens). To the Honourable Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assemb1ed in Parliament: The Petition of certain members of the North East Melbourne Division of General PracticeDraws to the attention of the House the decision of the Minister for Human Services and Health to Plutonium withhold half of the promised indexed fee increase for GP consultation items and that the anticipated $10 million saved be transferred to practice or divisional grants. We, the members of the North East Melbourne Division of General Practice believe that divisional and practice grant funding is for improved patient of this management and should not be seen as income replacement and that full fee for service should be maintained. Your Petitioners therefore request the House to direct that the full amount of Medicare rebate fee increase be implemented in the November funding. by Mr Jenkins (from eight citizens). National Flag To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that: 1. The majority of Australians are completely satisfied with the existing Australian national flag. 2. We therefore request that the House of Representatives ensures that the Australian national flag, as provided in Section (3) of the Flags Act, is not changed or replaced without first being voted upon and approved by the people of Australia in a national poll. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Jull (from 10 citizens). Gay Law Reform in Tasmania To the Honourable the Speaker of the House of Representatives and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that your petitioners are concerned that: as Sections 122 a&c and 123 of the Tasmanian Criminal Code make all private sexual activity between consenting adult men punishable by up to 21 years imprisonment, and; as these laws adhere a criminal stigma to the social, cultural and political activities of gay and lesbian communities, degrade the status of gay and lesbian people, reinforce their social oppresGP Fees sion and violate their dignity, and; as these laws foster blackmail, harassment, discrimination, vilification and violence against gay men and lesbians, and; as these laws have been used by local and state governments to justify policies that disadvantage lesbians and gay men, and; as these laws reduce the self esteem of gay men and lesbians, when research shows that low self esteem contributes to the higher incidence of suicide, alcohol and drug abuse, and HIV/AIDS in lesbian and gay communities, and; as Australian criminal law is brought into disrepute by unenforced and unenforceable laws that criminalise victimless consenting activity between adults in private and deprive Australians of freedom of choice by dictating personal morality, and; as Tasmania is the last state or territory in Australia to retain such laws, and; as these laws have been condemned by Amnesty International, the Australian Council of Social Services, the National AIDS Strategy, and the Tasmanian Anglican and Uniting Churches, and; as these laws violate rights enshrined in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights including the right to privacy and the right to equality before the law-rights which should be enjoyed by all citizens regardless of sexuality, and; as the Australian Constitution gives the Commonwealth the power to rectify violations, by the states, of international treaties such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and; as Australia's international human rights record is undermined while these laws remain in place. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House pass legislation that will prevail over and invalidate sections 122 a&c and 123 of the Tasmanian criminal code. by Mr Kerr (from 2,773 citizens). Gold Pass: Members of Parliament To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the following matters: 1. (a) We call for the immediate abolishment of Gold Passes (past, present and future) for retired Federal Members of Parliament. (b) We call for the immediate abolishment of cars, offices, telephones etc., of retired MP's. 2. We call for a moratorium on all pay increases and ""perks"" for Members of Parliament and top bureaucrats for a period of five (5) years, and immediate disbanding of the so called Independent Remuneration Tribunal. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House: Will take these measures to stop Members of Parliament (past, present and future) from plundering the public purse. by Mr Mack (from 60 citizens). Pensions: Age for Women To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia. The petition of citizens and/or residents of the Commonwealth of Australia respectfully show concern at the Commonwealth Government's intention to amend the Department of Social Security legislation to raise the age of women for pension eligibility from 60 to 65 because: The proposal is active economic discrimination against women Women have a shorter paid working life than men Women receive less than equal pay Women have less access to superannuation The proposal does not recognise the value of women's unpaid labour Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that your Honourable House intercede on behalf of the Petitioners to: Ensure that women remain eligible for age pension at the age of 60. And your petitioners as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Newell (from 15 citizens). Family Law Act To the honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the need for changes to the Family Law Act of Australia and to the Child Support Scheme. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House enact the following changes: 1. That the existing Family Law Act be scrapped and replaced by a more simplified version together with the minimum of rules and regulations necessary. 2. That The Family Court be replaced by a Tribunal and that all matters resulting from divorce and family breakdown be heard before, and determined by a panel; the panel to be made up of persons qualified in matters arising from family breakdown. 3. That legal professionals be barred from appearing before the Tribunal resulting in vast savings to the disputing parties. 4. That a modified fault clause be re-introduced to Family Law primarily designed to discourage adultery and to stop rewarding adulterers at the expense of deserted and innocent parties. 5. That the Child Support Agency be scrapped and replaced by an appropriate administrative procedure within the Tribunal. 6. That apart from cases of exceptional circumstances parental-child access become the inalienable right of all parents. 7. That alternative counselling, (Government funded) be made available through the churches and that much more emphasis be placed on mediation in resolving disputes prior to the commencement of legal proceedings. by Mr Somlyay (from 1,168 citizens). To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain residents of Australia draws to the attention of the House: That Penguins live along Australia's coast-but they die when covered with crude oil. There is a 50-50 chance of a major Crude Oil spill on the Australia coast in the next ten years. The Exxon Valdez crude oil spill has cost in excess of $US3 billion. Your petitioners therefore ask the house to undertake: (i) a full independent inquiry for the proposed Crib Point Crude Oil Terminal in Western Port Bay; (ii) to develop National uniform legislation for crude oil spills in Australian waters which includes the principles of strict liability, unlimited compensation and recognition of natural resources. by Mr Tanner (from 8,000 citizens). Petitions received. NA Question proposed: That grievances be noted. Liberal Party of Australia",60
191,Mr WAKELIN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,I have been a member of parliament for about 18 months nowMr Andrew-Excellent.,66
192,Mr WAKELIN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Thank you. During that time. I have developed a greater understanding and appreciation of what the Liberal Party means to me. Seeing my opponents and the operation of government gives me a unique opportunity to develop that understanding. The Liberal Party clearly has the interests of the individual at heart. It is not simply devoted to minority groups and blind ideology; it is very much concerned with the future of Australian individuals. The Liberal Party today stands for those forgotten people who are much cited at this 50-year anniversary since Menzies revamped the party and took it into the modern-day Liberal era. Perhaps the groups of forgotten people have changed, but the principle is the same. Among the forgotten people today are the unemployed, the young, the aged and practically the entire Oil Spills Australian community from time to time, except for those select groups which the government seems intent on cultivating. The forgotten people are the people, for example, who do not agree with the way the government has tackled Aboriginal issues. The forgotten people are the people who are disgusted with the way this government rewarded striking maritime unionists with tax handouts. The forgotten people are the people of my electorate whom the government has not consulted on nuclear waste sites or World Heritage listing. The forgotten people are the business people who know that the government no longer values them. The progress of the Liberal Party is a very proud one. From 1909 to 1917, right at the very beginning, they were known as the Liberals. From 1917 to 1939 they were known as the Nationalists. From 1939 to 1944 they were known as the United Australia Party and from 1944 to 1994 we have been known as the modern-day Liberal Party. The Liberal Party in modern Australian history reached its height in 1969 when all governments, federal and state, were Liberal. The definition of liberalism or of the Liberal Party and its philosophy seems to elude many, particularly within the press, but for me it is not about being essentially anti-Labor. It is about being the champion of bipartisanship wherever possible and walking down the middle of the road. It is about individualism, not an individualism that is based on selfishness but an individualism which develops all those talents, all those capacities, of individuals without the unnecessary pressure of government and of outside groups. If we look at the last 85 years of this party-and certainly the last 50 years, which we have been concentrating on this weekunder the 94 years of our Federation, we see that for 54 years we have had Liberal government. In 30 of the last 50 years we have had Liberal governments. The Liberal Party has made a fine contribution along with the National Party in recent decades as strong parties. Labor was out of power for 23 years. Some journalists of that time no doubt were predicting the end of the Labor Party. No doubt at that time those journalists were predicting the demise of Labor in perhaps similar terms as they are now predicting the demise of liberalism. I have learnt from Labor's record that it is too much about denigrating our heritage, our contribution, our flag. I am proud of the achievements of our forebears and I am not going to turn my back on that. Any wrong turns or false trails that we may have embarked upon are but passing breezes in the night when compared to the nation that our forebears have built. Labor, sadly, is more about attacking the effort and discipline of individuals, pretending that the government can spend money it has never earned. It probably has borrowed it and certainly has taxed it from somebody else. Education is worth mentioning. Menzies was born in Jeparit, western Victoria, and would have had his primary education in very modest circumstances. Being a bright student, I understand, he went to Ballarat high school and then on to university in Melbourne. That would be 100 years ago, yet to this day in the regions there are people who cannot even get access to education in the way that Menzies did. I turn to the role of the media in the way that it no doubt was predicting the death of Labor after its 23 years in the wilderness. I will quote from a newspaper article about Monica Attard written by Errol Simper: Ms Attard, who won a gold Walkley, journalism's most prestigious award, for the coverage of attempted 1991 coup in Moscowand the Gorbachev issue that I think we have all become aware ofsaid that the (media) bias had its foundation in an arrogant assumption among mainstream journalists 'that Labor is going to stay (indefinitely) in power'. She said after the lecture she believed bias sometimes extended beyond reporters and analysts to executives in that if stories did not fit a certain preconceived pattern they often 'do not get a run'. She stressed she was not speaking from a personal political stance, but had been struck by the situation returning home after four years in Russia. We all know that she is the ABC radio PM presenter. She was forced, she said: to re-evaluate her faith in journalistic objectivity. She had been forced to react at a more emotional, personal level and wondered if the public and Australian politics might be better served if journalists were prepared to base their views more on the reactions of ordinary people 'than the political system and processes'. We might begin asking whether the tried and true methods are making of us judges and executioners of individual politicians, rather than being reporters, chronicling events around us, asking questions and reporting the answers', she said . . . 'It seems to me the Canberra (media) gallery operates as a pack and if there's a smell of blood then they'll all go ... And while they may not consult each other on a day-today basis, they do tend to be influenced by what another writes or says ... Sadly, that is the media in modern Australia today and the way it presents the parliament to the people. I recall the post-Whitlam era and the devastation and disappointment of Labor people of that era when the Fraser government was at the height of its influence. Labor returned to government in 1983 and has had 12 years of government since. Let us look at what the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is saying after that 12 years in government. He has become so obsessed with Canberra that he cannot even consider our major capital cities being anything other than just out there in the provinces. For example, the government held a cabinet meeting in Adelaide last month and, while there, the Prime Minister said this proved that he did not neglect the regions. This is the first time. I had ever heard Adelaide being called a region. It will come as a shock to the people the of Whyalla, Clare, Streaky Bay and Ceduna. We thought we were the regions and that Adelaide was our major city but apparently even Adelaide is not big enough for our Prime Minister anymore. It begs the question: what does the Prime Minister think of the communities in an electorate such as Grey? Is this Prime Minister even aware anymore that they exist? Is he so unaware, so oblivious to real Australia, that he can see only to the edge of his Kirribilli lawn? (TIme expired) Bass Electorate",66
193,Mrs SILVIA SMITH,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Bass) (4.50 p.m.)In my electorate of Bass, over the last weekend and a few days prior to that, there has been a lot of activity. There has also been a lot of focus on me as the member. I certainly do relish that focus but some of it-in fact, most of it-has been quite negative on the 'local incumbent'. This local incumbent came to this government 19 months ago, after the seat of Bass had been held by the opposition for some 18 years. The people of Bass decided that they needed a change-and needed somebody from the Labor side of politicsbecause people who held that seat before me had been out of touch with the grassroots of Bass. Some very exciting things have been happening in Bass in recent times, and I would like to mention a few of them here in the House. Child-care places were desperately needed in Bass and, since coming to this place, I have constantly been approached about getting more child-care places for Bass. I am very pleased to state that, as of today-I am sure that, in part, this is because I have done a lot of negotiation-the north of Tasmania has received 117 desperately needed child-care places, 80 of which have come directly to Launceston. I heard somebody speaking earlier today about child-care places for the children of people in the work force, and that is directly where these 80 places have gone to. Forty places have gone to the University of Tasmania at Launceston to enable persons who are studying to have their children close at hand. The other 40 places have gone to the Pedder Patter Child Care Centre, which is very close to the Launceston General Hospital. This will enable parents-I state very categorically, parents-to have their children nearby, especially during some of the extenuating hours some people in those areas either study or work. At this time of year, the local shows are on. The local senator from the opposition side, Senator Watson, has obviously seen the value of what I have been doing at the Launceston show in particular over the last few yearsever since I have been interested in being a member here. He and I had a stand at the Launceston show. He agreed that it is extremely valuable to get to the grassroots people at an open front. A show stand at a show is one way of doing that. People can access you up front; they do not have to wait for appointments and they do not have to slot into your very busy parliamentary schedule. I was also chuffed, I suppose, that so many members of the opposite persuasion-the Liberals-came to see my Labor Party show stand. It was obviously a feature at the show. It was a very friendly show stand. In fact, most of the organisation of that show stand was done by my daughter Tamsyn who, I note, is still sitting in the gallery. I am glad she has decided to listen to what is being said here today. The stand was very friendly and very accessible, and the Liberal Party has learnt a lesson from us in that respect. On Friday, I was at another show on Flinders Island. The people of Flinders Island were very warmed to the idea of people from parliament coming and talking to them at the grassroots level. Once again, many opposition members of the state parliament were at that show. People were saying, 'It's great to have our parliamentary representatives come down and talk to us without us having to try to get to them in their offices.' But, of course, not always wonderful things happen in your electorate. One worrying thing is happening in my electorate at the moment. The state government-which is Liberalwants to put a road through a world heritage area to connect it and make a round route all around Tasmania. The area it is wanting to put the road into is a very sensitive environmental area. Ray Groom is willing to spend around $3 million on a road that people have often described as 'the road to nowhere'. It is not going to be a road easily accessible to anyone who does not have a four-wheel drive vehicle because, during some parts of the year, it is going to be accessible only to people who have four-wheel drive vehicles in their garages. I suggest that moneys for road funding should be looked at in the context of where they are most needed for persons needing travel access. I have been looking for road funding assistance for one area of my electorate and, for the last 30-odd years, various other members have been trying to get some road funding for the eastern bypass. At the moment, some heavy vehicles come through one of the very oldest suburbs of Launceston-Newstead. The roads are cracking, and the very beautiful federation and pre-federation buildings and homes along that suburban road are starting to show signs of too much heavy traffic on the roads. Perhaps we should look at where we put the money allocated as road funding. I heard road funding mentioned by others here in this House today. In fact, the opposition spokesperson in Tasmania, Michael Aird, said that other road links definitely had far greater priority-and he would know what is happening in Tasmania-and that the link road would be available only for those with four-wheel drives. What is even more ridiculous is that, as I said, access during part of the year would be denied because of the bad weather. The Tasmanian government has a responsibility to carry out environmental impact statements, too, when roads are projected to go through areas listed for World Heritage, as this one is. The Premier of Tasmania does not think that it is necessary. In fact, he says, 'I have said time and time again that the state government will not support further World Heritage listings.' I suggest that he is well and truly out of touch with the people of Tasmania when he makes those types of statements. I would like to mention another event that occurs every year in one of Tasmania's very small communities. Derby is a little town in the north east of Tasmania. It has a population of around 400, and used to be a tin mining community. Derby sleepily rolls on for the majority of the year-in fact, for 364 days of the year-but springs to life one Saturday in October, which happens to be this coming Saturday. On that day, we have what is called the Derby River derby, where any person, persons, groups or teams are able to attack the running waters of the Derby River in whatever craft they feel they can. It is a mild rapid area in some places and decidedly dangerous in other places. On this weekend in October, 3,000 to 5,000 people converge on the tiny town of Derby. The Derby River derby is an activity that has now drawn international notice. I was in Derby a couple of weeks ago at a fun night that people put on to entertain themselves, and I was told that the press in Tokyo had contacted people in Derby to find out what the Derby River derby is for, why it happens and what sorts of things go on. The Tokyo press is promoting this tiny activity throughout its tourism ventures for people who come to Australia. Of course, that is putting Tasmania, and in particular northern Tasmania, on the map. I brought these things up because what we need in politics is grassroots politics. I was very warmed to hear a member opposite mention that type of politics just a moment ago. We need to get to the people and to be accessible to the people. One of the catchcries of past years has been, 'We have our politicians but we can't get to them.' Local shows and local activities are the way to get to the people. We do not have enough time because of our activities here in government; we have to be accessible in another way. I commend shows, such as flower shows, derbies and whatever to honourable members as a way of getting to the people and finding out what real Australia is all about. Television Services: Halls Gap",68
194,Mr RONALDSON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Ballarat) (5.00 p.m.)It gives me no joy to bring to the attention of the House a situation in my electorate that, at best, can be described as a debacle and, at worse, an outrage. It all started on 14 December last year when a constituent from Halls Gap rang me regarding what he described as a financial stand-off between VicTV, now WIN Television, and a government department - a government department which turned out to be the Civil Aviation Authority. Several days after that, I received a letter from the Shire of Stawell addressed to me in the following terms: This will advise (as you may be aware), that VicTV has for some time, been planning to install a translator to service the township of Halls Gap. VicTV has advised Council that although many small communities operate on a self-help basis, with its costing experience with aggregation to date, VicTV has agreed to service Halls Gap at its own cost. Site evaluations of the area limited VicTV's choice for a site to Mt. William and negotiations have been taking place for some time with the Civil Aviation Authority to share their facilities at Mt. William. VicTV advised Council recently, that it was horrified to receive information from the Civil Aviation Authority advising of an annual fee of $7,760 plus $250 for an application fee. As a comparison, at Yackandandah, VicTV operates an almost identical installation for which the landowner is paid $1,000. At Glenthompson, VicTV is currently paying a fee of $550 per annum. VicTV has requested Council's assistance in this matter, as a fee approaching $8,000 per annum has placed the project in jeopardy. You are further advised that VicTV has purchased equipment valued at $30,000 suitable for the area and this has been installed for almost twelve (12) months. Without this current problem, VicTV had expected to have Halls Gap VicTV 58 up and running before Christmas and it has therefore requested urgent attention to this matter. Council has resolved to strongly urge the Civil Aviation Authority to be realistic in its leasing arrangements and of the current situation in relation to television reception at Halls Gap. Council also resolved to advise yourself, as the area's representative in Federal Parliament, to urge the Civil Aviation Authority and the appropriate responsible Minister to reconsider this decision. You should also be aware that Council considers the very poor television reception in Halls Gap to be a serious handicap in promoting the area as an ideal tourist destination. You are also advised that Council believes the cost structure resulting in such a fee is in part due to cost passed on from the Department of Conservation & Natural Resources to the CAA. I trust that you will be able to assist Council in this matter. I received a letter dated 17 January 1994 from the Executive Director of VicTV in the following terms: Thank you for your letter dated 15th December 1993 relating to the Halls Gap television reception. Realistically, the only site for us to use to improve the quality of television reception is Mt. William, a site occupied by the Civil Aviation Authority. They are happy for us to share facilities, but we were staggered when they advised a rate approaching $8,000 in the first year. Subsequent years would be increased by CPI. As you are aware, we lease sites throughout the state, and from landowners scattered throughout regional Victoria and we pay an annual fee from $300-$1,000 for sites. When we received advice of the proposed fee, we approached the CAA who flatly refused to vary the fee. The Shire of Stawell have been kept informed and have also made representations but also have had no success. We consider a fee of $1,000 to be the maximum for such a site, and that would be high when compared to some other comparable sites. A stalemate now exists, and we have equipment ready to roll when we can reach agreement on a reasonable fee. As a result of the letter from VicTV, I wrote to Mr Rod Oates, the Manager of the Properties Division of the CAA, in the following terms: I have been approached by numerous individual constituents as well as the Shire of Stawell regarding a situation that has developed between the Authority and Television Victoria Limited Ballarat.  aware of the situation and I also confirm Vic TV has requested the use of the Authority'S site and facilities at Mount William to install a translator to service the township of Halls Gap. The Halls Gap township receives extremely poor reception and this can be immediately resolved by translator installation at the Mount William site. The difficulty appears to be that VicTV believes the annual fee set by the Authority ($7,760) is excessive and is well above amounts being paid for other sites. In this regard, I am advised that other site costs range from $500 to $1,000 which is considerably less than the amount being sought for the Mount William site. The difficulty facing my constituents is that unless the this matter is resolved urgently, then they will continue to have poor reception and I will be grateful if you will investigate this matter as soon as possible to see whether the fee for use of facilities at the Mount William site can be dramatically reduced. By 18 May this year, 1 had not received a reply-too long after that. 1 therefore wrote directly to General Peter Gratian, the Chairman of the CAA, attaching a copy of my letter and asking him to provide me with an appropriate contact name with whom 1 could discuss this important issue. 1 then received a letter on behalf of General Gratian dated 20 May and a letter dated 26 May from Mr Oates apologising for the oversight and for not responding to my letter sooner. 1 was told that a response was being prepared in head office which would address the issue. 1 then received a letter from the CAA dated 30 May in the following terms: Thank you for your facsimile to me of 18 May 1994. I understand that the Authority's Victorian Property Officer, Rod Oates, has already been in touch with you to apologise for not replying to your correspondence of 25 January 1994 that dealt with VicTV's proposed use of the communications site at Mount William. You would be aware that the Civil Aviation Authority is a Government Business Enterprise whose costs are now borne directly by the Aviation Industry and not by the taxpayer. The Authority therefore took the decision that non-Aviation related users should contribute a modest but reasonable share of the costs associated with the development and operation of communication facilities such as those at Mount William. Given the charter set out in legislation, it would not be appropriate for the Authority to provide subsidies for community services outside its sphere of operation. I understand that the particular communications facility at Mount William is quite remote and required considerable expenditure by the Authority to construct the facility and provide access and services to the site. The revised fees, while tably highvery regrettably highare clearly justifiable. 1 think that is a matter of dispute. The letter further states: The Authority's fees are comparable with charges levied by other commercial providers of similar sites. As a result of this letter, I again wrote to VicTV and 1 finally received a reply dated 16 June in the following terms: Sorry about the delay in answering your fax sooner. Commissioning of the translator to provide commercial television to the residents of Halls Gap has not progressed since our last correspondence because of operating costs proposed. Mt. William is the only suitable site in the Grampians National Park that enables coverage of the Halls Gap township. We understand there are three sites leased at Mt. William, two held by the Civil Aviation Authority and a third by the Ministry of Education. A Civil Aviation Authority facility would be suitable for our requirements. It is our belief these facilities were constructed in the early 60's with public monies. The residents of Halls Gap are now being deprived a commercial television service. Fees to use these facilities are regrettably too high when compared to similar services offered by other parties including Government agencies, such as the National Transmission Agency. The large floor and tower space was built at Mt. William in the early 60's for manning and valve electronic equipment. This is no longer required due to miniaturisation of electronic equipment with no labour required at the remote site. Therefore, we suggest the Mt. William facility has excess capacity, and this is being underutiIised at present. The company is prepared to provide commercial television to your constituents, however our experience in other areas of the state indicate excessive costs are involved. We are not prepared to commit to these ongoing high costs. With respect we believe it is time now to relook at the charges proposed and come up with realistic commercial fees. On 22 June I then wrote to the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee), requesting his personal intervention in this outrageous situation. In late July 1 received a letter from the Halls Gap Progress and Tourist Association regretproviding me with a copy letter forwarded to the minister, and on 15 July 1 received a letter from the minister'S office saying that it was the responsibility of the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton). On 4 October 1 wrote to the minister, and in the last paragraph 1 advised him, 'I believe it outrageous that the Halls Gap community has been so shabbily treated and 1 request your urgent intervention in this matter.' Since 1 was extended the great honour of being elected to parliament, 1I have raised the problems facing my constituents on every possible occasion. 1 make no apologies for doing so, especially when they are problems not faced by other Australians in larger centres, such as metropolitan capitals. It is these people in the past whom I have continued to fight for and I will do so in the future. Halls Gap is an extremely pleasant area in which to live, but it is also a thriving tourist destination. It is absolutely deplorable that these people are unable to access what the rest of us take for granted-that is, a television service. It is costing them money and it should be addressed immediately. (TIme expired) Leader of the Opposition Liberal Party of Australia",69
195,Mr LINDSAY,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Herbert-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology) (5.10 p.m.)-In the Sydney Morning Herald of Friday, 9 September 1994 Geoff Kitney wrote: It's the sort of advice political leaders need to force them to see their own silliness before it becomes too widely apparent. Unfortunately, it didn't get to Alexander Downer and now he has made a total as of himself. After he released The Things That Matter at the National Press Club on Monday and it floated gently into the political ether, one of the audience remarked to a Liberal MP as they were shuffling out: ""Alexander laughs too much. He makes jokes about things that are too serious to make jokes about."" Mr Kitney further said: By Monday night a long list of titles for the various parts of the Downer statement was being circulating. ""The Ngs That Matter"" was suggested for his multicultural policy. ""The Flings That Matter"" for family policy. ""The Thongs That Matter"" for footwear industry policy. ""It Just Doesn't Matter"" for Downer's republic policy. He concluded: At the very least he has ensured that the most memorable thing about The Things That Matter will probably be a bad taste joke. Honourable members would not be surprised to know that there is a total estrangement of Australian small and medium size business from the federal opposition. Business recognises that there is no-one on the opposition front bench who has the remotest idea on how to develop and implement sound policies on industry. The Liberal Party's tradition of bungling amateurism is frustrating business and frustrating even its own supporters. A recent article in the Australian Financial Review referred to the long white shorts approach to policy making. The article by Gary Sturgess, a former Liberal Party staffer, was published on 14 October 1994. This deficiency in the Liberal Party is of serious concern to industry and the record shows that, without thoughtful, sensible policies, the opposition will pander to the worse excesses of the National Party. These issues include subsidies, protectionism and government handouts. Thanks to the ABC, 50 years of the Liberal Party are now being paraded in Australian homes. It is a most depressing saga. Included in these recollections is the Liberal Party's sorry record on industry. Narrow electoral interest led the Liberals to reject report after report recommending a more open Australian economy. The Liberal and National parties' tariffs and quotas stultified Australian industry. In 1994 the National Party continues to hanker after protection. The sugar and the tobacco industries would be only the start of its turning back the clock to the 1950s. Now that the Liberal Party has rejected the austere economic prescription of its exiled leader, the member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), there are signs of recidivism appearing in its ranks. The most recent Liberal Party statement suggests that the anti-dumping provisions be used in a protectionist way. Further, the Liberal Party has not endorsed the government's tariff reduction schedule. Most seriously, the opposition has been providing encouragement to protectionists through its statements on foreign investment. Let me give an example. Investment is the driving force of business and economic growth. Australia's open economy is attracting investment from companies around the world. This investment is linking Australia into international technology and trade opportunities. We are a major economic force in our region. Our rate of economic growth is world leading. Australia's economy is ranked in the top dozen largest in the world. Our contribution to the Asian Development Bank is exceeded only by Japan and the United States. We are now an important location for regional headquarters of many of the world's most important companies. There are now 10 Australian companies on the international Fortune 500 list-companies such as BHP, Pacific Dunlop, CRA, Boral, CSR and Amcor. These companies would not be on that list without substantial offshore interests. There are great benefits to Australia from the interchange of ideas, technology, markets and opportunities through international linkages. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) states that he is not yet ready to deliver an economic statement. As an alternative to an economic statement, all he has done is produce the so-called The Things That Matter. Like Geoff Kitney, I regard the statement as a joke. It apes the worse excesses of the right wing psychobabble you hear in redneck America. In particular, the statement illustrates the distorted way the opposition views increased investment linkages in this country. The opposition laments foreign investment in Australia. It does not understand Australian business investment overseas and it does not understand what it means to have foreign investment under controlled circumstances in this country. Its utterances are designed, may I suggest, to cloak with respectability an appeal to racism and isolationism. It may succeed in that objective, but it will do so at the expense of its relations with business. There can be no turning back from being part of the international economy. Investment, trade, technology and globalisation are all interlinked. The opposition's The Things That Matter statement claims to be about boosting savings. In reality, all it would do is boost capital gains and fringe benefits tax rorts. Worse, on superannuation, the opposition wants to tinker with the hard won rights of workers, just like it would do on health care. There are grounds to believe that the opposition forgot to include a section on science and technology in its statement virtually until the last moment. This is consistent with the Leader of the Opposition's reported statement that the title of his science and technology policy was 'The Things That Anti-matter'. The opposition certainly does not do anything to enhance its standing. The fact is that these issues have to be treated seriously. There is no brain drain of scientists from Australia. In the 10 years from 1983-84 to 1992-93 Australia had a net inflow of 28,420 engineers and scientists. Science and technology and research and development in Australia are booming. The government is committed to maintaining 17 per cent growth in industrial R&D until the end of the decade. This would put spending on R&D by Australian industry up with the OECD average. It reverses the debacle of the Fraser years when spending by industry on R&D collapsed and industrial research laboratories closed. In its public statements, the opposition calls for the maintenance of basic research in CSIRO and the universities, but in the Senate the opposition is playing politics with the organisation. This Senate review has wasted the time of CSIRO management. It has made it difficult for CSIRO to rationalise its laboratories and to redirect its research to priority areas. CSIRO has publicly available a widely respected mechanism of directing its resources. CSIRO provides almost four times the support for agricultural research as it does for mining and energy related research, even though agriculture and mining provide similar contributions to exports, and mining and energy make a greater contribution to Australia's gross domestic product. All Australians have a great deal of sympathy for the rural sector. That is why the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) put forward the $164 million drought relief package. But all the opposition does, or wants to do, is investigate and criticise the CSIRO. Does it want the CSIRO to be a welfare body, or does it want it to get on with the job of undertaking research where the best returns come from whatever that sector may be? This government, thankfully, has introduced a wide range of practical measures to assist business in this country-reducing wholesale sales tax reporting requirements, increasing the capital gains tax, providing goodwill exemptions for small business, lowering the company tax rate to 33 per cent, reviewing income tax and fringe benefits tax to reduce compliance costs-and all the opposition does is mouth platitudes. (TIme expired) Coburg Football Club",72
196,Mr CLEARY,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I take this opportunity to congratulate the people of the northern suburbs for their passionate support, over the past two months, of the Coburg Football Club in its recent struggle with the powers that be. Those who follow Victorian football would be aware that there has been a major restructuring of domestic football in Victoria and that the Victorian Football Association, of which Coburg is a member club, has been subsumed into the AFL. Many people-and I am one of themwill lament the fact that the VFA's independence has been compromised. Given the continued expansion of the AFL and its domination of the football market-a bit like the globalisation that the member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) was just talking about, but not as rosy-it was probably inevitable that the VFA would be marginalised. When the Sydney Swans were shifted to Sydney more than a decade ago with games televised back to Melbourne, the VFA, like local manufacturers in a global economy on a tilted 'level' playing field, began to experience some difficulty. With the further telecasting of games from Adelaide, Perth and Brisbane, the VFA's share of the football market was soon reduced-like the market reduction which has been experienced by our local manufacturers. So often the much lauded increased attendance figures, about which the AFL boasts, are not assessed in the context of the football expansion which has occurred over the past decade. The effect of the VFL's expansion on the various domestic competitions would not be lost on South Australian and Western Australian football league supporters-just as it would not be lost on local manufacturers. The member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) knows only too well what the advent of the Crows has meant for the local football competition. Although some members of this House have focused on the increased costs of AFL football and the fancy salaries the AFL pays its executives, the real matter of concern is that the AFL has shown scant regard for and little understanding of the role domestic and local football plays in the football economy. The contribution of volunteer labour and the inkind contribution of local communities to the football economy, like the contribution of domestic labour-normally women-to GDP do not appear on the AFL corporate balance sheet. As has been pointed out by representatives of the VFA on one hand and women on the other, voluntary labour has always been taken for granted. The claim that it is only the elite game which generates wealth is, as I have said in a previous speech on this matter, best accounted for by way of Marx's theory of surplus value. The member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) would know that one back to front. That some AFL officials continue to argue this line is plain silly; that the government should decide to forgo the funding of local sporting and cultural groups following the so-called sports rorts affair is just as silly. So much for that. Back to the Coburg Football Club. Two months ago it appeared that, as a direct consequence of the economic rationalist formula driving the AFL's latest football blueprint, the Coburg Football Club was destined for the scrap heap of history. The proposition was that Melbourne could not support 12 senior clubs. As is the case with most arbitrary claims of this kind, no empirical evidence was provided to prove that Melbourne could support only eight clubs. Just for the record, the Coburg Football Club is 100 years old and has been in the VFA for 70 years. It last won premierships in 1988-89 when I was the coach. All of this history and sentiment counts for nothing in the mind of the new football administrator. Coburg, we were told, had to go. Fortunately, the people of the area saw it another way. It is 30 years since the Coburg Football Club has faced a football crisis of this kind. Ironically, it occurred as a result of the North Melbourne Football Club's occupation of the Coburg football ground in 1965. So committed to the club was the local community on that occasion that the ALP was decimated at the council elections which followed. Unfortunately, the Kennett government has made it impossible for such grand acts of democracy at the local level these days. Fortunately, during this latest crisis the people of the northern suburbs again showed their independent spirit and rallied to the call. In fact, it reminded me a bit of the Wills by-election; on that occasion the people of Wills refused to accept the lie that national policies, which were, in effect, devastating the local economy, were in their interest. It would pay the member for Herbert well, with all respect, to consider what globalisation does mean for local economies or institutions in local economies, whether they be manufacturers or sporting clubs-because the rosy picture painted just ain't the truth. I want to thank all of those Coburg supportButcher ers and others whose combined pledges provided the $15,000 licence fee which was paid today to the VFA and guaranteed the club a licence in the 1995 competition. That the local community could find that kind money during difficult times, despite the employment picture painted by the Minister (Mr Keating) and, today, the member for Herbert, is a credit to its spirit and of commitment to its territory. I want to thank John Quigley, a local TCF manufacturer, his great support; John is doing very innovaHutchinsons, tive things with his business in Brunswick. It is no surprise that it is the local manufacturers, not necessarily the transnationals, who spontaneously come to the financial assistance of the local community. Nevertheless, I must thank Michael Jarvis from Ford, Brian Pilbeam from Kodak and Barry Fitzgerald from MCDonald's Coburg, all of whom had the foresight to recognise the importance of supporting the local football club. I look forward to other transnationals and foreign investors, the sort that the member for Herbert talks about, acquiring an understanding their responsibility to a locality from which they acquire so much in skill and knowledge. Globalisation should not mean an abrogation of social responsibility by employers, whether they be local manufacturers or multinationals. I think it is time our transnational companies accepted that it is not only millionaire tennis players and corporate sports which warrant sponsorship support. Some redistribution of wealth in the immediate locality would not go astray. On the local front, I thank Lloyd Moss from Aust. Group Springs; Mike O'Donnell from Modec; Bruce Pell from the Coburg Bingo Centre; Paul Ridder from John Allison Monkhouse; Richard Gray from the Pipeworks; Alan Vipond from Vipond Paints; Tony Crotty from Wreckair; and Ron Barbano from Chef, Brunswick-and there are many others. I want to thank some individuals: the Wass family, Ian Blake, Trevor Price, Eva Collins, Peter Williams, the MCDonald family, Laurie Cummins, Dane Ogden and the Vigilantes, Morrie Hawkins, Chris Racovolis, Clarrie and Mabel MCDougall, Vin Frilay, John O'Brien, Rod Oaten, Peter Kallianis, David Tracey, the Lalors, Trish Cooper, Chris Howlett, Allan Mitchell, Mrs Swales, Ted Ryan, Iven Jones, Bill MCDougall, Ian Paul, of Joyce Braybrook-Martin Ferguson from the rosy ACTU even weighed in some money-Ralph Prime Newmark, Gwen Hanrahan and Dennis Coates, Chris White, Roy Faulkner, the sense Shadbolt family, Alan Walsh, Des Collins, Phil Rothwell, Herb Zimmer, Gus Bailie, Ron for Warren, Ivan Lofts, Alan York, the Vin Sievers, Brian Elvery, Bill MCLachlan, Dave Starbuck, Linton Jones, Aidan Sweeney, Sean Wass, Kay and Graham Douglas, Carmel Cagliardi, Elaine Cairns, Frank Blundy, Harold Stevens, Helen MCDonough, Frank Connor, Margaret Brown, Graham MCColl, Terry and Marie O'Meara, Brad Nimmo, Bruce and Gary Sheldon, Doug Farrelly, Tony Tancredi-a past player, Jack and Flo Howlett, Alan Young, Kay Fitzpatrick, Donald Shaw, Des Bourke, Mal Webster, Fred Cook, Con MCMahon, Leo MCCartin, Rod and Edwina Cook, John of MCMahon, Greg Sewell, Bob Holmes, Val Keane, Jan Ireland, Karen Jones, Dr Frank Davis, Athol Hodgetts, John Andrews, Peter MCGann, Terry Dohnt and his parents, Dr Tom Vaiopoulos, Rick Cole, Ken Taylor, and the Coburg Football Club Ladies Committee. This was a grand struggle by the Coburg Football Club against the AFL in difficult times. It was a great victory for the locality against football globalisation. It is even reflected in letters I received from a number of students from the Eastside Mustangs who are not in my electorate. They have sent me a number of letters from Mount Lilydale College supporting the concept of VFA football. I want to congratulate every one of them on the fine letters I have received from them and congratulate the locality of the northern suburbs, Coburg and surrounding municipalities on the great performance in saving the Coburg Football Club. We will be there to stay in the years to come.",74
197,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Mr Rocher)Order! It being 5.30 p.m., in accordance with the resolution agreed to earlier the debate is interrupted. I put the question: That grievances be noted. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA Motion (by Mr Snowdon) agreed to: That: (1) in accordance with paragraph 2(3)(b) of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1991 the question of the repeal of Part 3 and Schedule 2 of the Act be reconsidered after a further period of 3 years and no later than 31 October 1997; and (2) a message be sent to the Senate acquainting it of this resolution and requesting it take action. SOCIAL SECURITY (1994 BUDGET AND WHITE PAPER) AMENDMENT Cognate bill: SOCIAL SECURITY (NEW ZEALAND AGREEMENT) AMENDMENT BILL Second Reading Debate resumed from 22 September, on motion by Mrs Crosio: That the bill be now read a second time. upon which Mr Ruddock moved by way of amendment: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not opposing the provisions of the Bill, the House is of the opinion that the Government should be condemned for(1) its policies which have created record levels of unemployment; (2) its inability to address the associated social inequity and hardship which has resulted; and (3) its failure to solve the ongoing unemployment crisis, in particular, the problem of long-term unemployment"" .",76
198,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,CARRIAGE OF GOODS BY SEA ACT,"The Social Security (1994 Budget and White Paper) Amendment Bill introduces a number of changes to the administration of a range of social security payments and, in so doing, gives effect to some of the measures announced in the 1994 budget and the white paper on employment and growth. It is pleasing to see that the government has responded to some clear anomalies within the welfare system. I trust it will continue this commitment to work towards eliminating the multitude of contradictions and inconsistencies which pepper this government's administration. It is worth noting at this stage that most of the amendments which this bill brings into effect would not be necessary if this government had a clear employment strategy. The white paper, along with its elder cousin, the One Nation statement, took a superficial approach to the problems of unemployment. similar Whilst there is no doubt that the unemployed need proper, targeted help, there is another side to the problem, that is, the need to work on the structural causes of unemployment. BILL 1994 This is clearly where the government stumbles. When it gets to the hurdle of the structural problems which cause and contribute to unemployment, it stumbles. It just cannot bite the bullet. We all know that those heavies within the union movement say, 'You can't 1994 jump that hurdle.' They put up higher and higher hurdles for the government; it continues to stare at those hurdles but it will not commit itself to taking on the heavies of the union movement. The government continues to sanction an inflexible, centralised industrial relations system and a raft of taxes and charges which actively discourage employers across this country from employing more staff. Until they are able to deal with these hurdles, full employment for those who wish to work will remain nothing but a dream. It is interesting to see that the government still fails to acknowledge the Industry Commission's work in this area. The government talks a great deal about regional development and its commitment to regional Australia, but it is really only rhetoric. The Industry Commission's report clearly shows that the greatest impediment to regional development in this country is industrial relations and the centralisation of the industrial relations system. If the government were committed to addressing the drift of population from regional and rural Australia to our capital cities, it would look again at the Industry Commission's report. It would look at the recommendations of the Industry Commission's report because the Industry Commission-an independent body, independent of this government-still holds to the view that industrial relations is the key to unlocking regional Australia. The government's inflexibility to the approach of the Industry Commission is going to remain the No. 1 impediment to regional development in this country. It is clearly apparent to members on this side of the House that the government has absolutely no intention of seriously dealing with the underlying and fundamental impediments to full employment. It would require breaking the crucial nexus between the union movement and the Labor Party, and there is clearly no hope of that occurring. It would require genuine commitment from the Labor Party to the productive industries of this nation-to sustainable manufacturing enterprises, to small business. Agriculture and mining collectively account for 70 per cent of the export income that we earn as a nation; they are part of the wealth creators of this nation. Such a commitment would be unprecedented for this government and one which I hold no hope for whilst ever the Labor Party holds the Treasury bench of this nation. In fact, it would be easy to believe that federal government is now satisfied with its contribution to the problem of unemployment. The unemployment rate is now 9.5 per cent. The government appears to be saying, 'We need to be congratulated.' Those on the other side of the House are showing a certain element of smugness that they have reduced unemployment to the level of 9.5 per cent; they feel that they ought to be congratulated for that. The unemployment rate is still appallingly too high, particularly in rural and regional Australia where youth unemployment is one of the great scars on this government's policy. In many parts of rural Australia, the youth unemployment rate is in excess of 40 per cent. That is an appalling indictment on any government that purports to want to see full employment in this nation. It was abundantly clear from the address of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to the ALP's national conference in Hobart in September that the Prime Minister no longer gives a dam about the unemployed and the social, personal and structural problems they face. They barely rated a mention in a speech which reeked of self-satisfied backslapping and extreme tunnel vision. The Melbourne Age captured the Prime Minister's ignorance of the unemployed in his conference address when its editorial highlighted the speech's 'bombast, sanctimoniousness and self-congratulation'. The editorial stated that the Prime Minister's speech: . . . was also notable, to borrow a phrase from Groucho Marx, for the straightforward way it avoided the issues; those issues that the Australian voters, are entitled to hear debated openly and genuinely at a Labor national conference. It went on: While the Prime Minister was laughably long on rhetoric about Labor's natural vocation for leadership, he was shamefully short on trickier questions, such as Labor's comical three mines uranium policy and the continuing national scandal of a 9.5% unemployment level, 11 years after Labor ... took the helm of the Australian economy. That is what the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mrs Crosio), who is at the table, should be addressing and listening to. The Labor Party has been at the helm of this nation for 11 years, and we still the have a 9.5 per cent unemployment rate and, as the Age article said, the comical three mines uranium policy. Clearly, there was division among the members at the conference. Clearly, there is division in the Labor Party on that very issue. But when the government is still beholden to the unions and the factions, it cannot govern. The government is saying, 'You can mine uranium but you can only have three mines.' Mrs Crosio-Have you really read the bill before the House?",76
199,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,CARRIAGE OF GOODS BY SEA ACT,"I have read the bill before the House. That is the comical situation that we are confronted with: a government that says we can have uranium mining in this country but that there can be only three mines. The white paper on unemployment will no doubt bring about a range of cosmetic changes to the employment picture. Some people will move from one category to another. Others will gain part-time work but still find themselves grossly underemployed and their talents wasted, or at best underutilised. But, at the end of the day, the measures contained in the white paper will not solve the problem. As a parent, I find the short-sightedness of this government quite staggering. I want this government to address the fundamental reasons why firms and businesses are not able to expand and thus employ more people. I want my children, and their children, to live in the type of world in which I grew up: where everyone who wanted work could get work, where they could resign from one job today and be in another job the next day. There was plenty of work in this country. But today, as I said earlier, the great scar still the unemployment scene is that tragic situation in rural Australia where up to 40 per cent of the youth cannot find work and are part of the long-term unemployed in this nation. The drought which currently afflicts the eastern states with such severity is further crippling the hopes which many parents held for their children. The dramatic cuts in income, which the drought has caused, mean that many farms can simply no longer support the full range of family members which may once have been possible. I know of some farmers who face the impossible task of deciding which of their sons and daughters should take over the farm, knowing full well it is no longer capable of supporting more than one family. As they are saying out there in rural Australia, the ultimate in child abuse is to even consider that your children would come home to the farm. Those farm children who decide to chance their luck with other farming operations, or in provincial cities and towns, face an equally glum outlook. The drought has cut a swathe through farm employees who were once a necessity on large farming operations but are now a luxury. Many are working for reduced wages simply because they are committed to the farming industry, and because there are no other employment options open to them. On the eve of the release of the federal government's much awaited drought relief package, I received a phone call from a distressed lady in Central Queensland. She and her husband were both farm workers and in the space of three short years had seen their combined income fall from $32,000 a year to $20,000 a year. We are talking about the farm worker not the farm owner. The drought package has nothing to offer her or her family. Whilst the drought relief payment will put bread on the table in many farm kitchens, it will hardly extend as far as paying the wages of farm workers. Farm workers will continue to hold their families together on dwindling incomes and very little hope. You have to ask yourself why these farm workers are taking reduced wages. What is the reasoning behind it? In this case of the distressed farm worker, it is the drought. on There is no longer any overtime because tractors are not being worked at all. There are no bonuses at the end of the year because there are no crops. That is why the farm workers are not receiving the sort of income they were earning three and four years ago. Obviously, they were paying tax on the overtime they worked and on the crop bonuses they received. They no longer receive the overtime payments as they no longer work those overtime hours, and they are not receiving any crop bonuses because of the drought. They are another victim of this drought. That particular farm worker, the wife, wanted to know what was in the drought relief package for her and her family. But all this leaves little inspiration for the young adults emerging into the work force from life on the family farm. With virtually no opportunities available in rural areas, they will inevitably seek tertiary education, vocational training or an entry level position in one of the major cities. They will become part of the drift away from rural areas and will become another urban statistic. It saddens me greatly to think that, in 20 or 30 years, rural Australia will have lost at least one generation. The chain of succession which has characterised farm ownership in Australia, and has created such a great wealth of agricultural knowledge and skills, will be broken forevermore. Let me tell the federal government that this scenario will not in any way be assisted by the temporary but expensive devices proposed in the white paper. Neither the job compact, nor case management nor retraining will keep the skills and intellect of our farm-reared youth productively employed on farms and associated rural industries. What will help is genuine commitment making Australian agricultural industries competitive on the international market. This means a rethink of taxes-like sales tax, fuel tax and fringe benefits tax-which tax condichest tions compulsorily required under state awards. It means a genuine drive towards creating an efficient shipping industry and port operation. It means an industrial relations system focused on job productivity and not job protection. It means a fair and equitable tax system which recognises the fluctuations of farming incomes and the desire of farmers to prepare in good years for the times of hardship which inevitably follow. It means coordinated effort towards assisting with drought preparation-reasonable tax incentives and long-term water usage planp.m.)-Those ning. This federal government is plainly ignorant of all of these needs. Obviously, no governfused ment can make the clouds open and the rain descend. However, if the federal government had addressed these measures some years it would have been a much stronger and resilient industry which faced the devastating consequences of drought. Instead, industry weakened by the government's recession and weakened by this government's refusal to face the international realities for uncompetitive, highly taxed industries. It simply did not stand a chance. What hope does the white paper offer to those who have lost their jobs and livelihoods as a result of the drought? From what I can read, and from what I can see of the white paper's manifestation on the ground, it offers little. I invite the government to prove me wrong; to show me long-term sustainable job opportunities that utilise the skills, the knowledge and aptitudes of all Australians, including those in that forgotten work force: the farm workers. The Labor Party has always boasted that it represented the workers of this country. In the drought package it released several weeks ago, there was not one mention of providing the farm worker, as opposed to the owner and operator of the farm, with the gainful employin ment to which all Australians aspire. Then, and only then, will this government and its to out of touch and insensitive leader-who is quite ignorant of the real plight of those unemployed in rural Australia, particularly the youth-be able to sit back and indulge in the beating and self-congratulations that have been going on in terms of the unemployment levels we have in this country. The attitude the Prime Minister and all those on the other side of the House have of congratulating themselves that the unemployment rate is only 9.5 per cent clearly means that the government has lost the plot and given up on those who seek jobs in this nation. The great tragedy is that the young a people of Australia deserve better and deserve farmers a better government.",78
200,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,CARRIAGE OF GOODS BY SEA ACT,"Newcastle) (5.51 people who listen to the proceedings of this parliament and those people who read Hansard would probably be conand puzzled as to what this debate is about. I will bring the debate back to the issue at stake. We are currently debating ago, amendments to the Social Security (1994 more Budget and White Paper) Amendment Bill and the Social Security (New Zealand Agreeit was an ment) Amendment Bill 1994. The amendments to the first bill relate to the exclusion of the proceeds from the sale of a person's principal home from the operation of the liquid assets test for 12 months, where certain conditions are satisfied. This means that people will be required to serve only one liquid assets test waiting period in a 12-month period. The amendments also allow the employment of self-employed people to form part of their jobsearch and newstart activities. There are also three or four like amendments to the bill. The second bill deals with the reciprocal agreements between Australia and New Zealand. These agreements have been negotiated for some time and they will be phased in over a five-year period. The opposition is actually supporting, not opposing, these amendments. The government asked for the bills to be debated cognately as an efficiency measure. The government made them separate pieces of legislation to allow the Senate to deal with them separately because it may wish to amend them separately and therefore move at whatever speed is appropriate for the parliament. But in this chamber, where there is agreement with the legislation, it was decided that we would debate the bills together to allow members more time to debate more controversial and contentious legislation. That seemed like a very sensible course of action. Members would say, 'That is sensible, good management.' The opposition shadow spokesman, the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), spoke on the matter and said, 'We are going to support the legislation.' He had some remarks to make about various parts of the legislation. He then proceeded to move an amendment to the legislation currently before the House which made reference to unemployment. Basically, this was an attempt to attach to the legislation words which attacked the government's acclaimed performance on unemployment; in fact they condemn the government. The legislation was used in a fairly trivial way to attempt to have a broad ranging debate on unemployment. To talk about the tail wagging the dog would be to slightly understate the situation. It is absolutely ridiculous that relatively minor amendments which are agreed to by both sides should become the topic of a debate ranging from droughts to farm labourers to payroll tax, which was mentioned by one member of the opposition. The debate has ranged across the gamut of social, economic and taxation policy, and state governments as well. It is no wonder people become cynical about parliament and parliamentarians. One can understand the scepticism when politicians ask to be taken seriously. There are forms and procedures available for these matters to be debated. In the next few weeks we will hear how not enough time has been given to discuss legislation and how the government has guillotined debate and stopped people expressing their views. What are we doing with legislation? People are trying to use this as an anchor to attachMr Thckey-You've only got one speaker on it. What are you talking about?",79
201,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,CARRIAGE OF GOODS BY SEA ACT,"My purpose in speaking is to oppose the amendment before the House. I did not speak last week because this legislation was agreed to and was noncontroversial. It did not need a cast of thousands to say that. But the opposition has now come forward with these fallacious amendments. The honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) interjected on government speakers the last time this matter was debated. Now he is hectoring me. I find that absolutely appalling. It reinforces the public cynicism about the function of this place. The debate is now only about unemployment because everything else has been agreed to. The opposition is not opposed to the amendments. It is going to support them. That must be understood. I am not quite sure whether they know that themselves because some opposition speakers have given the impression that they are opposed to such things as performance contracts. The honourable member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) went to great lengths to describe performance contracts and what the implications of them might be. He did not say that he was voting in favour of them, which is what he is going to do. He then went on to talk about the unemployment hoax. We know who the hoaxer is. One gets the impression from his speech that he is opposed to amendment when, quite clearly, from the position outlined by the shadow minister, he is going to support them. The issue that we are debating is unemployment. Let us talk about that for a short time. Let us look at the white paper and what it is leading to and at the changes in the Australian work force in the 11 years we have been in office. In June 1983, the population of this country was 15 1/4 million. As of September this year, it is about 17,880,000. That is an increase in the population of over 2112 million people. The work force participation rate has grown from 6.2 million to eight million. The Bureau of Statistics has determined that the percentage of the population that makes up the work force has increased from 60.4 per cent to 63.3 per cent. That is an increase of 2.9 per cent. That means that there are 2.9 per cent more people in the work force than there were previously. In numerical terms, there are 1.75 million more people working in Australia now than there were 11 years ago. If we took the participation rate as it was in June 1983 and applied it now, the unemployment rate would be 6.6 per cent. Let us have no nonsense about employment and unemployment and how wonderful and committed those opposite are to helping the unemployed. If those opposite were serious, they would take the job compact seriously and try to understand what it means. A compact is an agreement between two parties. The opposition is saying, 'We agree with you, but we are going to badmouth it and speak against it.' In here they will vote in favour the compact, but publicly they are badmouthing it. Part of the reason for the cynicism in the community is due to the words, the distortions and the fallacious figures that those opposite have used. The white paper brings forward a massive program of expenditure and commitment. Some of us on this side of the House had hoped that we would see a compact between the parliament, the people and the unemployed. We thought that this was one issue that could unite Australia. The concept of the job compact gives the opposition the opportunity to recognise that the people out of work-and particularly those who have been unemployed for long periods-are worthy of better than cheap political point scoring and cheap stunts. I am sorry that that is not the case. One would have imagined that, with these minor amendments which those opposite are supporting, that would have been the case. For the job compact within the white paper to work, it really needs some level of bipartisan acceptance at least and some level of support. We find that the processes are being supported but that the principles and the intentions are being opposed. I share with those in the community who are seeking work the same level of cynicism and suspicion of those opposite, who seek to falsely use the misfortune of those who are out of work as political fodder. The unemployment rate, which was announced last week as being 9.5 per cent, is lower than it was when we came into government, but it is still much too high. That has been discussed, argued about and various views canvassed publicly and privately for a number of years. The white paper was a profound government response not simply by ministers or by parliamentarians but by a range of people. The government received submissions from people far and wide which brought forward a range of ideas. The core of the white paper is the job compact, and it is the compact which concerns me most. If that job compact is simply between the government and the unemployed, it will not work as well. The whole parliament needs to make a statement affirming that of it shares that concern and is committed to helping restore employment. Opposition members cannot have it both ways. They cannot come in here and preach to us about how concerned they are about those people out of work and then use false information, and I have already given some examples of that. Those opposite cannot say that unemployment is a community problem and then not be a part of the solution if they want any respect or credit. The white paper's commitment to support those in need is not new; in theory it has always existed. But the attempt to formalise this commitment in legislation will be a long and complicated process. It will take legislation of this nature. Legislation brought forward from the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) and other ministers will also be involved. It will be an absolute tragedy if we see the same kind of performance as that which we have seen in the past, where speaker after speaker on the other side talks about everything but the legislation before the House, extols the need to increase employment levels, but does all he or she can to destroy morale and confidence and to talk down and to badmouth what is happening in this country. Opportunities are a fleeting thing. The coincidence of the current cycle of economic events and the initiatives contained in the white paper have provided an opportunity for perhaps the most far-reaching initiatives that we have seen in this country since shortly after the Second World War. I believe those initiatives will succeed, and it would have been nice if that success had been assisted by those on the other side who do care. There are members of the opposition who genuinely are concerned and who genuinely do care. But when I hear fallacious speeches such as some of those we have heard in the debate on this legislation, then quite frankly I do start to despair. In a way it is very easy to see why members on the other side are in opposition. The more they continue in this fashion, the more likely it is that they will stay on the opposition benches. If this is their approach, if this is how they are going to handle being in opposition for the next year or two, then they will be there after the next election as well. Quite frankly, it does not wash. People out there are not stupid. People know that unemployment is coming down and that the size of the work force is increasing. Most importantly of all, the majority of people want the government to do positive things. When the government is doing something positive, people understand that. On the one hand, the opposition supports proposals but, on the other hand, it tries to attack them publicly. It is too for people to see what those opposite are doing. As I said, two things are sustained: firstly, the cynicism in the community and, secondly, the likelihood of the opposition remaining on the opposition benches. I conclude by repeating the figures I cited earlier. The opposition does not like to hear those figures, but we know that they exist, as does the community. In the last 11 years, the population of this country has grown by 2.6 million people. The work force has grown by 1.75 million people. In other words, the work force has grown at a greater percentage rate than the population. If we had the same work force participation rate as we did in June 1983, the current unemployment rate would be 6.6 per cent. That is a credit both to the people in the community who have come back to the work force and to those people who have changed their career paths and their ideas. It is also a recognition that, as a government, we have actively encouraged people who were previously seen as being unemployed or wanting to stay unemployed to gain employment. We have also seen a shift in pension regimes and the introduction of support for people with disabilities, who see themselves more as workers than long-term invalid pensioners, which they were treated as then. A whole range of changes have helped to increase the size of our work force. That is to the good because, at the end of the day, a country's true strength is in its people; its true wealth is in its people. The bigger our work force, the stronger we will eventually become. The government's task is to mobilise that work force and to make it function. The white paper addresses that issue in a more profound way than it has been addressed for many decades. It is unfortunate that these non-controversial amendments have attracted such cheap and shallow political point scoring. The comfort it gives us on this side is that, if this is the talent, the tactic and the skill that is going to be used against us at the next election, we will be here for a few more terms. The more the opposition takes this kind of cheap and shallow easy way out, the more it does not easy face the tough issues and focus on the real structural issuesMr Ruddock-Just remain as complacent as you are.",80
202,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CARRIAGE OF GOODS BY SEA ACT,Order! The honourable member will be heard in silence.,83
203,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,CARRIAGE OF GOODS BY SEA ACT,"Those opposite are mouthing words regardless of their substance. They will vote in favour of this amendment which attempts to condemn the government for the unemployment levels. As I pointed out earlier, if we had the same participation rates now as we had shortly after the opposition was last in government, unemployment would be at its lowest rate for many years. I remind members of the figure of 6.6 per cent. Mr Ruddock-See if you get there first.",83
204,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,CARRIAGE OF GOODS BY SEA ACT,"From listening to the comments of the honourable member for Berowra, I am not sure whether he is aware that I am speaking in this debate simply to oppose the amendment. The legislation before the chamber is not opposed by the opposition. There is no debate on the legislation. This debate is simply on the amendment, which is spurious, ill-timed and inappropriate. It does neither him nor his side of politics any",83
205,Mr BRADFORD,CARRIAGE OF GOODS BY SEA ACT,"I cannot understand why the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) has suggested that this amendment moved by the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) is in any sense spurious. In fact, I would have thought that we could not move a more important amendment in this place than that which we have moved, which condemns the government for 'its policies which have created record levels of unemployment', for 'its inability to address the associated social inequity and hardship which has resulted', and for 'its failure to solve ongoing unemployment crisis, in particular, the problem of long-term unemployment'. It is a completely legitimate amendment which needs to be discussed in this parliament. I do not apologise in any way for raising this matter here today because it is very important. It is interesting that the member Newcastle should suggest that the government is doing things to fix up unemployment in a structural sense, because all the evidence points to the contrary. The fact is the government has had to be dragged in screaming to do anything as far as micro-economic or industrial relations reform is concerned. That is why, when we talk about the government's white paper, we must point out that, philosophically, we are miles apart in terms of the solution to unemployment. Time and again in this place government members tell us all about the schemes, programs and initiatives that they have cooked up to solve the problem of unemployment; the problem that they created in the first place. Yet, in the end, they are only that-they are schemes; they are bandaid solutions to the problem of unemployment. The fact that the honourable member for Newcastle mentioned participation rates provides further evidence for that particular argument. It is not realistic to say that if the participation rates were at the same level 10 years ago as they are today, the unemployment rate would be lower. The government's whole modus operandi is to put pressure on participation rates. That is the government's solution to unemployment. In some respects credit. that may be a legitimate strategy. Something that I find interesting is that the government crows about its achievements in getting young people to participate in education. It cites that as a major success. Of course, everybody knows it just stumbled on that as a partial solution to the problem. But it has grasped the fact that, if it takes people out of the unemployment queue and puts them into some program or scheme, it takes them out of unemployment and affects participation rates. At the same time, a number of people become discouraged about looking for the jobs in times of economic difficulty. That affects participation rates as well. Many of the government's efforts have been to actually put pressure on participation rates to keep people off the unemployment list. I think that has become evident to everybody in the community. As members of parliament, for we have become aware of the fact that there are so many extremely well qualified unemployed people running around out there that a lot of these mickey mouse schemes have been exposed for what they are. Each of us has had, on a regular basis, people coming to us who have been on course after course or training program after training program. They have a sheaf of certificates that qualify them for all sorts of things. But the fact is that there are no jobs. That is the argument all the time. Over time, employment growth is a natural phenomenon. We do not have to do anything in particular to create jobs. That happens in a dynamic economy just by virtue of the effluxion of time. I do not think there is any doubt about that. But the point is that the government has attempted, wherever possible, to make the unemployment figures look better than they are. It will continue to do that in all sorts of ways. Only time will tell whether it has had any real success in creating jobs. I think it will tell a very sad story indeed-as we have a lot of unemployed people. One of the reasons the government cannot create real jobs is that it did not come to with some of the real solutions until very recently. The government has been dragged screaming into providing incentives for employers to provide jobs. The real incentive there is to recognise such things as a training wage. Of course, from an industrial 'felations point of view, such a concept, even at the last election, was a total anathema to the government-any suggestion that the solution to unemployment might be to recognise that young people, in particular, and some long term unemployed people were not worth as much as the award system an employer had to pay. That was very obvious, but the government recognised that only recently and came up with a solution to it, such as a training wage, which it has instituted within the constraints of the industrial relations system. In the end, industrial relations reform is a very real part of a solution to unemployment. It is part of a long-term solution and it is of a lasting solution. The government has been very slow to actually do something about the industrial relations system. Of course, in the last few years, we have seen it go partly down the track of enterprise agreements to reach a solution, which will bring about a real reduction in unemployment and a real creation of jobs. But it has been very slow getting there. On the other side of the coin, there are all sorts of other constraints on employment. The industrial relations legislation, which we dealt with in this place not so long ago, makes it much more difficult for employers to terminate the employment of somebody. The rigmarole that is involved in terminating the employment of somebody-for perfectly legitimate reasons in the majority of caseshas meant simply that most employers are now saying, 'If we can't fire them, we won't hire them.' It shows how out of touch the government must be-other than with its union mates that call the tune in this area-when it introduces legislatio-, such as we had at a time of high unemployment, which simply will not motivate employers to take on an employee. Its solution is to say to an employer, 'You can grips now employ someone who has been long-term unemployed, for a year or two, for next to nothing.' In fact, the subsidies are so generous that the catch cry is that you can employ someone for about $10 a week. It shows again that the government is so out of touch with how a business should work. Even $10 a week would be too much for employers who are not motivated to employ somebody when that person would be making a contribution to their business. That is a reason why these sorts of approaches will not work. I was out visiting businesses in my electorate just the other day, and I talked to many employers who want to employ staff. It was surprising how many employers in the course of the day-and these were all small business people-said to me, 'I would employ someone tomorrow, if I could find someone with the right skills.' We all realise the huge gap there is there, and we have only just started to make even a dent on that problem. They part also said, 'I will employ someone, if I can actually find somebody.' There are a number of bigger employers in my electorate who are having exactly the same problem. There are a couple of major tourist facilities in my electorate that employ hundreds of people. They are telling me they cannot get staff. They advertise for staff, but the staff are just not there; they are not applying for jobs. There is a very big question mark over this. Of course, the government's schemes, programs and initiatives have created that problem. Many people today, whether the government likes it or not, can make a choice about whether to work or not. Despite all the tests that the government likes to have in place, we are extraordinarily generous in supporting people who make a choice not to work. 1I have employers telling me that, when they are in the process of hiring somebody, some people come in with a form that they want signed by the employer to indicate that they have applied for a job. I believe that this is widespread. They have got no intention of working. In fact, they almost say to the employer up-front, 'I am sorry to have to do this to you, but 1I have to get you to sign the form; otherwise they will take the dole off me. I actually do not want to work, thanks very much, and 1 certainly do not look the part.' So they go through the process. The government is so out of touch with what is actually happening out there. All it has to do with the million small businesses in this country is get off their backs through industrial relations reform, tax reform and micro-economic reform. If each of those small businesses employed one more person-many would employ more than one more personthe unemployment problem would be significantly solved. 1 take issue with the whole premise of the contribution made by the member for Newcastle because we, the Liberal Party, believe that we have the solutions to unemployment. They are not the bandaid solutions that this government puts up. 1 think that the people of Australia largely realise that. They see the white paper and they hear one statement after another that ultimately do not address the fundamental concerns and the fundamental ways in which unemployment can be solved. That is the reason for the amendment proposed by the member for Berowra, which will be strongly supported by this side of the House. We believe that the government has failed miserably to solve the problem of unemployment, which it created in the first place. 1 will make another point about the government. It is fine for it to talk about the unemployment numbers coming down-with its manipulation of participation rates and all the other things it manages to do to get the numbers down a bit-and about creating a bit of job growth. It has put in huge amounts of money. How much is it? It is talking about $10 billion over four years to create these jobs, so they become extremely expensive jobs. The real point is that, instead of having about 850,000 unemployed, we actually have closer to two million unemployed in this country. People may not be aware of how generous the measure of employment is. The way the government counts unemployment probably puts the very best complexion on it that can be reached. The government does it by a survey method. People who take part in that survey are told that if they worked one hour per week they are classed as employed. By the government's definition, if you work one hour per week you are employed! Once you count all of these people who are part-time workers-and there is a huge number of people now who are part-time workers-you are probably talking closer to two million unemployed and underemployed in the Australian economy. If you wanted to put some sort of a figure on that, you would be looking at billions of dollars of lost production. It is true that the bills that we are looking at today are amendments to the Social Security Act and that they are not opposed by the opposition. Nevertheless, they raise some issues about Australia's extraordinarily generous welfare system. 1 want to make a few remarks about the Social Security (New Zealand Agreement) Amendment Bill. Currently there is approximately a $500 million imbalance in the welfare payments to New Zealanders living in Australia when contrasted with those of Australians living in New Zealand. As 1 understand it, this arrangement was originally put in place many years ago. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) went to New Zealand in May 1993 with the intention of doing something about redressing this imbalance or, at least, partially redressing it. In the event, of course, he went nowhere near redressing it. Because we have such an extraordinarily generous welfare system, there are many more New Zealanders here-I suppose, in fairness, that is also related to the difference in the populations between the two countries. Certainly, the Australian taxpayers have come off very much second best when it comes to the reciprocal arrangements that we have with New Zealand in respect of paying benefits. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mrs Crosio) cannot shake her head about that because it is here: we paid New Zealanders $500 million more than Australians are paid over there. Mrs Crosio-It was quoted in a press release and compounded by the opposition. Mr Truss-There are eight times as many of us.",83
206,Mr BRADFORD,CARRIAGE OF GOODS BY SEA ACT,"There are eight times as many of us, as the member for Wide Bay says. The estimated savings that we are talking about are $2 million for 1994-95, so you have not made too much of a dent in that, have you? In 1995-96, they are estimated to be $16.7 million. So there is still a very huge imbalance there. In time, I think that this is going to be changed. I was over in New Zealand just a couple of weeks ago. Its economy is starting to boom; it is way ahead of ours. New Zealand has done many of the things that we ought to have done. In fact, in terms of its fiscal position as far as the government budget is concerned, it is virtually in surplus now. It is in a position where it can talk about doing some of the things that we ought to be able to do. As I understand it, the current budget situation is very healthy. Its ports, for instance, are way ahead of ours. It has taken a lot of the hard decisions that we have yet to take in this country. I am sure that that will have, in the very short term, some real benefits for New Zealand. As far as the imbalance is concerned in the payment of welfare, it might well be that there will be a mass movement of Australians over to New Zealand because that is where there will be jobs when there are not jobs here in Australia. So, whilst we support the general thrust of this bill, which will at least take us somewhere down the track of putting an agreement in place which will tend to redress that imbalance, there remains a very large imbalance. Getting back to the general thrust of our amendment, there was an interesting article in the Australian by Mike Steketee not very long ago which dealt with 'Keating's 1,000 days'. It talks about some of the problems the government has created for this country. Mike Steketee says in his article that the 1980s brought prosperity to more Australians but that it also left more of them behind. The percentage of Australian populations receiving welfare benefits as their primary form of income rose from 10 per cent in 1971 to 27.5 per cent in 1992: that is, 4.4 million people in this country now have welfare payments of some sort as their primary source of income. Though the population is ageing, the government's assets and income tests-some of which have been quite draconian-have ensured that it is not the aged who have swollen that number but rather the unemployed, and sole parents and their children. Mike Steketee goes on to point out that research by the Social Policy Research Centre at the University of New South Wales suggested that in 1990 more than 950,000 people had incomes below what they would receive if they had been on welfare benefits. Many of these people are self-funded retirees. Some of the government's draconian-I use that word again-assets and income tests have had a very real effect on these people. We have a whole range of new poor people out there. To the government's credit, it has instituted a detailed review of the assets and income test. The options paper that has already been brought forward has been very positive. But the government has taken some decisions in the past which have severely affected some pensioners and self-funded retirees. In particular, its decision to tax unrealised capital gains was one that we objected to most strongly and will continue to do so as one that had an adverse effect on some pensioners and self-funded retirees. We support the amendment moved in here by the honourable member for Berowra. We just do not accept that the government has the solution to unemployment. It may have all sorts of schemes and programs and other 'initiatives', as it calls them. It may have its token solutions. It may have its bandaid solutions. But in the end it will take some real decisions on micro-economic reform, industrial relations reform and taxation reform to get business to the point where it is prepared to provide real, long-term, lasting jobs for Australians. (Time expired)",86
207,Mr TRUSS,CARRIAGE OF GOODS BY SEA ACT,"The Social Security (1994 Budget and White Paper) Amendment Bill proposes a number of changes, most of which have their genesis in the budget and white paper statements earlier in the year. Others are to correct unintended consequences of previous legislation. That seems to be the regular path for this House to fix up the mistakes that were made in previous legislation as we debate new measures before the chamber. There are quite a number of proposed changes to social security arrangements in this legislation but, as the amendment from the coalition so adequately demonstrates, the reason why we have these new measures is fundamentally the government's inability to come to grips with the unemployment crisis, which is the obvious symptom, the obvious evidence, of the government's economic failure, the evidence of its inability to introduce appropriate industrial relations mechanisms and to provide the sort of economy that encourages Australian business to save and to invest and, therefore, to create worthwhile and productive jobs in the community. So, sadly, a large number of Australians-one million or two million-are unemployed or underemployed. The social security system needs to provide income for them so they can survive until, hopefully, a coalition wins government. There are a number of measures included in the bill which the coalition does not oppose in their substance. I would like to comment particularly on the proposal to enable advance payments to be made as a proportion of jobsearch and newstart allowances. Under this legislation, from 20 March next year, certain recipients of jobsearch and newstart will have access to an advanced payment. Recipients who satisfy the qualification conditions will have the option of capitalising up to 14 per cent of their payments, with an advance payment range of $250 to $500 over a sixmonth period, or an advance payment range of $500 to $1,000 over a 12-month period. The advance payment will be repaid by deductions from ongoing JSA and NSA payments. Clients will have the option of either increasing the amounts of deductions to repay the advance payment earlier or applying to have the deductions lowered if they are suffering severe hardship or if they can demonstrate that they are having difficulty with the repayments. I think that the idea of providing advance loans against a social security entitlement has considerable merit. It is an idea that I put to the government only a few months ago in relation to the payment of social security benefits. I am delighted that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mrs Crosio) is at the table, because she is the one who responded to my representations. Indeed, the sorts of things she said to me only last May are completely different from what the government is now doing in this legislation. Last April I put to the then Minister for Social Security an idea of a constituent of mine, Mr Roberts. Mr Roberts suggested that there ought to be a general loan scheme introduced to enable pensioners to borrow for essential capital items and that those loans could then be repaid by lower social security payments in the future. Mr Roberts was on a disability support pension and wanted to purchase a second hand motor vehicle to enable him to drive to the shops and adopt a more independent lifestyle. If he got this motor vehicle he would have saved governments the cost of subsidising his taxi fares and other measures available to him. He was unable to obtain the necessary loan funds from any financial institution, so he suggested that the government support a loan scheme which would enable him and others to borrow against future entitlements. That would have given Mr Roberts a little capital grant to enable him to purchase a motor vehicle and improve his lifestyle. He felt that, as a result of that, he could live on a lower pension payment. Mr Roberts maintained that sometimes a capital advance would enable a pensioner to make a purchase which would improve his lifestyle substantially and reduce future living expenses. I think that Mr Roberts's own case was an excellent example of how such a scheme could be used to advantage. The government has done something not dissimilar with the home improvement scheme that is available. Age pensioners and others can now borrow a certain amount to make necessary improvements to their homes. That money is eventually repaid or is deducted from their estates. I think that is an excellent scheme. Unfortunately, that scheme is not well administered. There are all sorts of anomalies and difficulties associated with the way in which it operates, but the principle is good. When I put this to the then Minister for Social Security, I got a reply quite promptly from the parliamentary secretary at the table. She said: . . . I regret that the Department of Social Security is not only unable to assist him with funding, but has no charter to undertake a scheme of this type. Of course it does not have any charter to do it at present; it is not within the current scope. That is why I was writing to the minister-to suggest that he amend the legislation to fix the problem. To just say that the legislation does not allow it is, in my view, a failure to address the issue. The parliamentary secretary then went on to say: This is because the assistance available from the Department is intended to provide ongoing income support for people who for reasons such as age, ill health, unemployment or family commitments are unable to adequately provide for themselves. There are no provisions in social security legislation which allow funds to be granted to finance the purchase of motor vehicles and the Minister has no discretion under the law to grant such funding. Similarly, there are no provisions to allow income support payments to be paid as a capital advance as this would be contrary to the underlying principle of the social security system. Get that: . . . contrary to the underlying principle of the social security system. So it is contrary to the principle of the social security system to enable pensioners, the unemployed, the aged and invalids to get any degree of independence. It is repugnant to the government to give them any independence, but now we have a scheme that will permit independence for unemployed people. I think that is a very curious double standard that the government is adopting. Now that it has pioneered this idea with the jobsearch allowance and the newstart allowance, I hope that it works successfully and may then encourage the parliamentary secretary to reconsider what she wrote in her letter to my constituent. I also hope that it may encourage the government to look again at the overall issue of advancing loans to pensioners and welfare recipients. The idea has some difficulties and that is going to especially be the case with the proposal the government is introducing. I would have thought it would be much simpler to administer the scheme proposed by my constituent than the one included in this legislation. For instance, what happens if the scheme is successful in its objective and the grant of $500 or $1,000 enables people to get a job? In those circumstances, people will cease to be beneficiaries of jobsearch and newstart allowances. They will not be able to get these benefits from which the repayments are supposed to be deducted. The government will not be able to deduct repayments from jobsearch allowance payments because people will not be getting the allowance. The government will have to use some other system to recover the money. It can either send these people a bill and hope they will pay it or, alternatively, take them to court. Would it not be the height of stupidity if the government were to try to take one of its jobsearch allowance recipients to court to recover a debt of $250? The lawyers would get tens of thousands of dollars and the government's return would be $250. In reality, it is not going to be a practical way of collecting the funds. What if people who receive the allowance cease to become eligible for jobsearch for some other reason-for example, they fail to meet the activity test-and the jobsearch allowance is cut off? How is the government going to recover the money in those circumstances? What if the new jobs these people get are self-employed ventures where their incomes are extremely low but they are unable to front for interviews with other employers because they are engaged full time in their own projects which are not yet returnthis ing significant incomes? How will the funds be recovered in those circumstances? I note that the parliamentary secretary eagerly waiting to respond to all these issues. I hope that she will explain to the taxpayers how the government expects to recover these funds-without going through expensive legal litigation-in circumstances where people no longer on the benefits. I think that there munity. are going to be some difficulties in that regard. Having said that, in principle, port the idea of a loan scheme. I think it potential to give people the opportunity start a new career. While we are dealing with social security issues, I note that a number of matters bill deal with family payments. I want to refer briefly to the government's home child-care debacle. That is all it can really be described as-a monumental debacle. The whole deliberate. scheme started with the government getting involved in a lavish television and newspaper advertising campaign which suggested that, under the home child-care allowance, single income families were about to get another a fortnight. That advertisement was grossly misleading; nonetheless, many families lieved the government when it sent them information saying they were going to get extra $60 a fortnight. I am dealing with a constituent at present who, on the basis of that extra went to a bank. This person was granted a home loan on the basis of his improved financial circumstances. This person got only one payment and it was then chopped off. Now the bank is starting to ask this person how he is going to meet his future repayfare. ments. This is a classic case of the hurt inflicted by the government's deliberately misleading campaign. The campaign endeavchild oured to create the impression that the ernment was doing something for people that, in reality, it was not. Single income families are not $60 better off. The only $60 they receive replaces the spouse rebate which they previously received. By comparison, it is interesting to note that two-income families will receive up to $120 a fortnight towards their child-care costs, but has been quietly promoted through childcare centres instead of on public television. The $120 child-care cash rebate is not subject is to an income test, whereas the smaller $60 home child-care allowance for single income families is reduced in value once the recipient's income reaches the handsome figure of $5 a week. Indeed, the whole thing are has caused enormous confusion in the comContrary to the claims by the government, I supthe home child-care allowance does not has benefit many low income earners, particularly to couples where both partners are unemployed. In those circumstances, the new spouse arrangements for the unemployment benefit will prevent them from qualifying for the in this home child-care allowance. Mr Ruddock-Quite deliberate.",87
208,Mr TRUSS,CARRIAGE OF GOODS BY SEA ACT,"It seems as though it is quite What a strange welfare system we have. The home child-care allowance is means tested only on the child carer's income. This means that a family whose breadwinner earns $100,000 a year-or, for that matter, $60 any amount-but whose child carer earns nothing is eligible to receive the allowance. beHowever, because of the partners allowance which has now been introduced, which effecan tively splits unemployment benefits between both members of an unemployed couple, the child carer's income will be too high to $60 payment, receive the HCCA. It is a strange program where a family with an income of about $14,000 a year is means tested out of getting the child-care allowance while some families earning over $100,000 a year will get it. This is Labor's idea of welIt comes from the same stable as child care for the rich, which enables people with massive incomes to get cash subsidies for care in child-care centres. There is an govenormous inconsistency in the way in which the government is dealing with these matters. But that is not all. Accountants and others are utterly frustrated with the administration of this program. They are being asked to provide financial details for their clients way in advance of when their income tax returns would normally be supplied. The tax office requires accountants to phase their tax returns in favour of those who are going to pay the most tax. In other words, high income taxpayers have their tax returns prepared first and the tax returns of low income earners-the ones that pay no taxare often not lodged for six or nine months after the end of the financial year. It is the low income earners that want to get these new welfare benefits. They are pressing their accountants to get their returns done early so that they can provide the financial details required by Social Security. So accountants and tax agents are being obliged by the tax office to prepare the tax returns of their high income earners early but are being pressed by their customers who have low incomes to also present their returns early so that they can qualify for these welfare benefits. The closing dates and the requirements for providing financial information to people, particularly the self-employed and those who have more complicated financial affairs, are utterly unreasonable and are creating enormous burdens. The next part of the debacle occurred when the government introduced and made the first payment on 29 September, but the companion tax legislation is not yet through the parliament and is unlikely to be approved in its current form. The home child-care allowance, as I mentioned earlier, is intended to replace the dependent spouse rebate for parents with children, but the legislation amending the dependent spouse rebate is likely to be changed in the Senate. It still has certainly not received passage through this parliament. The federal government has now spent a large amount of money advertising and telling employers that they cannot deduct the extra tax from pay packets which will apply after the dependent spouse rebate has been abolished. Many people are currently getting both the home child-care allowance and the dependent spouse rebate, but they will have to pay back the dependent spouse rebate. I am told that as many as 420,000 families will get a delayed tax bill when the legislation eventually goes through this parliament. What an appalling indictment on government administration! The legislation for one of the significant elements of this package is not through the parliament. Payments have started. People are getting money which they will have to repay. When the bills finally come, there will be acute embarrassment in thousands and thousands of families around Australia. Let them place the blame clearly where it belongs-not with the social security department, which is having to face this matter at its counter, not with the tax office or any other government agencies, but with the federal ALP government and its incompetent management of its legislative program. Another interesting aspect is the introduction of the partner allowance, which has meant that some people have received a oneoff $60 payment which the government never intended them to receive. That has helped lead to the confusion that I referred to earlier. People are getting the money. They naturally assume, following the advertising campaign, that they are entitled to have it. They are spending it, going off and developing new budgets on the basis of their new financial affairs, and they will find out to their sorrow some time in the future-a month's time, two months, maybe six months-that the money given to them is money they are not entitled to receive. I think the government owes it to these people to tell them personally, to front up and present the true situation about the mess that it has created in relation to home child-care payments. The whole system is so complicated that, even if it were being run efficiently and the departments knew what the government were about, it would still confuse people all around the country. We badly need a simplified welfare system in this country. Those social security recipients who have to fill out forms every couple of weeks providing extensive information are driven to despair. That is part of the reason why the cost of running the social security department is well over a billion dollars a year. It costs the equivalent of a new Parliament House every year just to run the social security department before the government writes out the first cheque. There has to be a better way to do that. Mr Ruddock-It costs $11h billion.",89
209,Mr TRUSS,CARRIAGE OF GOODS BY SEA ACT,"As the shadow minister intervenes, $l l h billion is an enormous cost for administration. Of course it costs something to administer these programs, but there has to be a more efficient and simple way of doing it than what is happening at the present time. The government's management of social security leaves a great deal to be desired. The task has become so monumental because the government's management of the economy is so poor. We have a million unemployed because of the government's inability to have an economy that progresses steadily forward, that produces useful, tive jobs in the community that create the wealth and income necessary to build a profitable Australia that trades around the world, earns the sort of income and creates the confidence that will create jobs and eliminate the unemployment problems we currently confront. This legislation introduces some worthwhile measures, but it could be so much better if the government would only address its reasonable objectives and set for itself the target of creating full employment in this nation.",91
210,Mrs CROSIO,CARRIAGE OF GOODS BY SEA ACT,"Prospect-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security) (6.48 p.m.)-I feel, at the conclusion of the recent debate from the coalition, that I have to reply to a number of statements made by both the coalition and the government. I remind honourable members, for the benefit of Hansard and those people who may be listening to this debate, that this debate originally started on 22 September, and we had to adjourn it. So some of my comments will deal with those made by the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) and the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) and, of course, the relevant comments made today by those participating in this debate. At the outset, I thank the honourable members for Berowra, Perth (Mr Stephen Smith), Cowan, Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris), MCPherson (Mr Bradford) and Wide Bay (Mr Truss) for their input. It is that input that has given me the opportunity to reply to this debate. The spurious type of amendment that was moved by the coalition in this debate was, in all truth, moved only so that those opposite could recycle their speeches on the white paper, Working Nation, because basically that is all we have heard. But I will come to that. Mr Ruddock-You don't like being reminded about unemployment.",91
211,Mrs CROSIO,CARRIAGE OF GOODS BY SEA ACT,The debate offered by the opposition is very disappointing. Mr Ruddock-You can't walk away from it.,91
212,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CARRIAGE OF GOODS BY SEA ACT,I remind the honourable member for Berowra that he should sit and listen producquietly without interjecting.,91
213,Mrs CROSIO,CARRIAGE OF GOODS BY SEA ACT,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I do not acknowledge the spurious comments of the honourable member for Berowra because they are then placed in Hansard. I do not believe that his statements even deserve to be recorded, let alone commented on. Nevertheless, I will certainly comment on the interjections that he has made during the debate. I believe that in the debate today the member for Newcastle got it in one. Those opposite have found very little to grieve about in this legislation, so they have chosen to focus the debate not on the legislation before the House, concerning social security and the New Zealand and Australia agreement, but on employment. There is no cause for debating the government's record on unemployment, let me assure you. We have had the debate on employment. We had days of it during the presentation of the government's white paper on employment. That white paper was called Working Nation in case the honourable member for Berowra did not comment on it. There is little need to remind the opposition of its paltry effort in that debate. One has only to read Hansard and one is well aware of it. Remarkably, the same substance-free commentary has now been trotted out again in this debate. Those opposite have added nothing to the debate in their performance in the House. To begin with, we had to endure, as in the previous debate, that wet behind the ears comment made by the member for Cowan in citing the social security system's failure to remedy the availability of employment in this country. Where the logic in that is, I do not know. I suppose that if we had not had this impossible amendment before the House he would not have been able to use his recycled speech. During his whole speech he never used the words 'New Zealand agreement', 'social security', 'budget' or 'white paper' once. All he spoke about was the government and what it has done about employment and unemployment. Where is the logic in that? Where is the logic in having a debate like that? The social security system is not designed to remedy the employment system. The social security system is manifestly a diverse system of benefits, allowances and payments designed to assist all eligible Australians, ing or not, in the attainment of an adequate living standard. The failure to grasp this fundamental fact was a constant weakness in the opposition's performance. As I statedand at least I spoke in the Working Nation debate-the government's primary commitment remains the resolution of the unemployment problem. We as a government do acknowledge that unemployment is a problem, but we have put into place real solutions. Working Nation always maintained that, as the economy improved and business investment accelerated, jobs would flow. Figures, I am pleased say, released last week by the ANZ Bank indicated that the government's employment activities are almost certain to be exceeded over the next 18 months. There is too much good news on the employment front to take the carping criticism of the opposition seriously. I mean that most sincerely. It is obviously too much for the shadow spokesperson for social security and all the other opposition speakers that we have had today, and I will comment on a few of those speeches later. When the member for Berowra, the shadow spokesperson for social security, first got up to speak I thought that he was going to support the government's agenda, the Social Security (1994 Budget and White Paper) Amendment Bill and the Social Security (New Zealand Agreement) Amendment Bill before the House. On rereading his speech, I find that he stated, 'We will not oppose but,' and 'The measure will not be opposed but,' and of course we always have to wait for the 'but'. I would like to return to the substance of the honourable member for Berowra's less than passionate response to this legislation before the House. I believe that, in a very desperate effort to confuse our Hansard reporters, the member for Berowra mixed the economic outcomes of the close economic, social and political relationship between Australia and New Zealand with the outcomes of the recently negotiated agreement between the two countries regarding pensions. In response to that criticism, I would like to make the following two points. Firstly, the member for Berowra talked workabout the estimated so-called $500 million shortfall per annum, and it was compounded by other speakers from the coalition in their input to the debate. I know that figure came out in a press release, but at no time was it used by us or by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). That so-called suggested shortfall, as implied by those speakers who have used it and certainly as implied by the member for Berowra, is the cost that this government is going to bear. The member for Berowra and members of the coalition know better. Secondly, that $500 million represents total outlays for Australians and New Zealanders who have lived and worked in Australia for the majority of their working lives. Some of those New Zealanders may have come here as one-year-olds, babes in arms. Australia could never expect to receive those reimbursements. Mr Ruddock-That was not spurious at all.",91
214,Mrs CROSIO,CARRIAGE OF GOODS BY SEA ACT,"The spurious comment was made in the press. You have compounded that, and it has been taken up by other members of the coalition. The message that the honourable member for Berowra wants to give here is that those men and women from New Zealand who have dedicated their working lives to the economic prosperity of this country, Australia, who have bred and raised their children in this country, Australia, who have set down their roots in this country, Australia, are those same men and women who are now to be told that they are no longer welcome in this country and rendered ineligible for benefits. I also dare say that you, Mr Deputy Speaker Truss, have also implied that the taxpayers of Australia are paying for this so-called shortfall. By statements made by the opposition, we are saying to these men and women from New Zealand who have, as I said, lived and reared their children in this country that they are not eligible for any benefits. The agreement achieves a far better deal for both countries than is presently in existence. Mr Ruddock-You couldn't deliver the goods.",92
215,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CARRIAGE OF GOODS BY SEA ACT,Mr Truss)Order! The honourable member for Berowra should not interject.,93
216,Mrs CROSIO,CARRIAGE OF GOODS BY SEA ACT,"The honourable member for Berowra and all other members of the opposition know full well that the agreement we have just put into place will give the Australian taxpayers $60 million per annum more than they are getting under the present arrangements. There are a number of other points in the notes that I took while the honourable member for Berowra was talking so many weeks ago. He also commented, as you did, Mr Deputy Speaker, about persons employed or who obtained employment and came off payments. I feel I have to answer him, as I would have to answer you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Any outstanding amount of the advance payment becomes a debt to the Commonwealth and it is recoverable by legal proceedings, garnishee, et cetera. I feel that has to repeated, even though it is well known. Another point I wish to raise-it was raised by you, Mr Deputy Speaker, in your speech today-is that I can well and truly recollect that the so-called proposed amendment that the opposition wanted to move in relation to the HCCA program was going to allow children to leave the country. At least in the amendment that we have before the House today, if the whole family leaves the country the child has to remain here if they wish to continue to receive that payment. The member for Berowra also made reference to the age pension article-he made a great to-do about that in his speech-where it stated that age pensioners can be 'assured of continuing support'. I say to the honourable member for Berowra and the opposition: the words mean exactly what we intend them to mean. We make no apologies for that. Those words are there to reassure pensioners that they will not lose, and we will continue to reassure pensioners that they will not lose. That was the intended meaning of those words. We will continue to state that we are proud of what we have put in that statement. But, if the honourable member for Berowra does not understand it and needs a briefing occasionally, we can always provide that for him. We are always very courteous in that respect. That is why I say again that some of the comments that have been made during the debate are quite ludicrous. Mr Deputy Speaker, I do not wish to take you to task again, as you are now sitting in the chair, but you made the same comments in your speech. I referred you at that time to the honourable member for Berowra's speech. What I was referring to during your speech was the fact that you were rereading what he had already stated in the House as to what was going to happen if a person came off the payment. So I thought I had better remind you when you got up to add fresh information to the debate before the House that it had already been stated by the honourable member for Berowra and recorded in Hansard. I tum now to the speech made by the honourable member for Maranoa. I was waiting be for him with great delight. He came into the House and started to speak on the legislation, and I thought that finally we would get an input from the coalition that would deal with the legislation before the House. But what did we get? We heard about the three mines policy, the uranium policy. We heard about our conference. At least the Labor Party conference is reported in the press, which is more than I can say for the Liberal Party's conference; we have not even heard what happened there. We then heard about drought, about bonuses, about fanners and about fann workers. We heard about relief packages. We heard about the family fanning unit. We heard about the white paper. We heard about youth unemployment. We got blamed for everything but the drought. During his 20minute speech, not once did he mention or touch on one of the items in that legislation. We then went on to the speech made by the honourable member for MCPherson. He went on about the amendment before the House and spoke of the high rate of unemployment. On the day that this amendment was moved, perhaps the honourable member for Berowra and even the honourable member for Cowan had not been brought up to date with the current unemployment figures, so I suppose we could forgive them. But to have you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and the honourable member for MCPherson get up and go on about employment and unemployment when the latest figures are here and available is not only rude but absolutely ridiculous. Perhaps I had better revise the figures for the honourable member for MCPherson in case he too did not understand or appreciate them. The ABS figures in August-and this is even before this amendment was movedshowed the unemployment figures as being 830,500, the lowest level they have been since August 1991. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) was very pleased with those figures and he put out a press release. He said: The unemployment rate for August remained at 9.5 per cent. The fact remains that over the past two monthshe meant July and Augustemployment has grown by 52,200 nationally while over the year employment growth has been a healthy 266,000 or 3.5 per cent. He continued: Also encouraging is the continued fall in long unemployment which is now 290,000, down from a peak of 366,000 in March 1993 ... The number of people on unemployment allowances has fallen by more than 60,000 over the last year. If that was not enough information-perhaps the people on the opposition benches did not want to read about it-we then had a question in the House on 11 October, only last week. To compound what I say is outright misinfonnation, if not lies, after not only a press release put out by the minister, there are the ABS statistics which clearly show where we rate now with our employment and unemployment figures. We then have, in answer to a question on unemployment, the minister stating: The ANZ job as series showed that there had been a further increase of four per cent, taking the number of job advertisements to the highest level in more than four years. Clearly this government is achieving strong economic growth, in excess of 41f2 per cent, which is translating into strong job growth-job growth, I might say, of between 31/2 and four per cent ... we are also picking up the long-term unemployed in this job growth. The ABS in its most recently published statistic puts the level of long-term unemployed at 290,000-the lowest in 31 months. The government has introduced a package of measures committing $10.3 billion over the next four years. But then I thought that possibly was not enough because the honourable member for MCPherson went on to say that we jiggled the figures-all of a sudden we should forget the ABS and ANZ figures, we had jiggled them. Somehow or other the government had just pulled these rabbits out of a hat. By doing that, he says that we made sure that the figures presented by all of these authorities were not really correct. We then found from Social Security that the number of unemployment benefit recipients was cut by 14,363 in September-and they were the figures we released; we found that job seekers, receiving either the jobsearch allowance for people unemployed for less than 12 months or the newstart allowance for those long-tenn unemployed, fell by 1.7 per cent to 839,161. Our Department of Social Security figures also showed a 422,440 or 2.2 term per cent fall-I repeat the word 'fall'-in the number of jobsearch recipients in September. Our newstart recipients fell by 4,210 or one per cent to 416,721. Since August last year, as has been repeated again and again, there have been 340,000 new jobs created. I say to the honourable member for MCPherson and all of the other coalition members who spoke about employment and unemployment: when you have the facts before you, why ignore them? Why not at least acknowledge them? They are figures that have been provided, are factual and can be backed up and by our Department of Social Security figures as well. Me Deputy Speaker Truss, during your speech you touched on a lot of the things that had been covered by previous speakers. I would like to talk about a couple of things. I would like to bring home to the coalition the fact that we are broadening the range of work related options for our long-term unemployed. In introducing the advance payment option, we are hoping to provide assistance for those people who need it-whether it be to find a job or other activities related to finding employment. We hope that will assist them; we know it will. That is why that has been brought forward in this legislation. Quite frankly, I do not believe the government needs any criticism of the bills before the House. I believe that since we came to government in 1983 our record on social security has been second to none. The real value of pensions has increased by some 14 per cent. There has been an enormous expansion in family payments and rent assistance. The maximum rate of assistance to our low income working families with two children under the age of 13 and renting privately has increased by $64 or some 108 per cent in real terms. Measures to improve access have resulted in a tenfold increase in the take-up of Woods,H.F. additional family payments. Our social security system has been more and better targeted to those most in need and, with the reintroduction of a comprehensive income and assets test, is certainly a system to be proud of. What we have before the House are bills which consolidate what is already in existence. I personally commend them to the House. Question put: That the words proposed to be omitted (Mr Ruddock's amendment) stand part of the question. MCLachlan, I. M. The House divided. [7.12 p.m.] (Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - Mr W.E.

This bill proposes the repeal of the Customs Tariff (Uranium Concentrate Export Duty) Act 1980. The repeal is part of a package of changes designed to streamline and refocus the Commonwealth's involvement in the Alligator Rivers Region of the Northern Territory. Three main features of the package of refonns, which were implemented by the Environment Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Amendment Act 1993, are: the incorporation of the Office of the Supervising Scientist into the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency; refined mechanisms for consulting key stakeholders, including the traditional owners and the Northern Land Council; and allowing the Alligator Rivers Research Institute to undertake research on matters outside the region on a commercial basis. The refonns also include the conduct of an independent review of the research now needed to meet the Commonwealth's environment protection objectives in the region. The uranium export levy was introduced in 1980 in recognition of the special costs of 1994 environmental monitoring and research activities related to uranium mining in the Alligator Rivers Region. However, with diminishing exports from the Alligator Rivers Region due to the closure of the Nabarlek mine and declining exports from the Ranger mine due to the poor state of the market for uranium, levy collections have become uncertain. The government has also recognised that there was a general benefit to the community associated with the work of the Office of the Supervising Scientist and this portion should not be borne by the uranium industry. Ranger, as the sole producer in the region and the only one contributing to the levy, should therefore not be expected to meet the full costs of these activities. The levy was also seen as inequitable Ranger as there is no similar levy applying to any other mineral commodity. It also hinders Ranger's competitiveness, including against Roxby Downs in South Australia, where the export levy does not apply. As a result, the uranium export levy has come to be seen by adjourned. the government as an inappropriate mechanism for collecting an industry contribution to the special costs of environmental protection required for the region. Consequently, the government has sought a mechanism which more directly relates the industry's contribution to the environmental research needs of the region and provides some certainty in its collection. It has thereAustralian fore decided to replace the contribution previously collected by the uranium export levy with a contractual arrangement with electorate Energy Resources of Australia Ltd, otherwise known as ERA. This arrangement provides for the annual payment of at least $1.5 million to the this Commonwealth. The agreement is subject to closely. review after two years or in the event of any significant change in mining circumstances. The environmental research needs of the region have recently been reviewed by a team of independent consultants and will be the subject of ongoing review through the technidifferent cal committee established by the recent Zealand. amendments to the Environment Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Act 1978. In return for ERA's financial contribution to research, the Commonwealth has undertakoperates en to repeal the Customs Tariff (Uranium Concentrate Export Duty) Act 1980. contribution will more than offset current revenue collections and result in a greater degree of certainty in revenue receipts for Commonwealth and expenditure for ERA. This bill removes the uranium export levy repealing its parent legislation. Financial Impact Statement The direct impact of this bill is the loss between $1.2 million and $1.5 million per annum in export duty based on the revenue received in 1992-93 of $1.538 million and 1993-94 of $1.207 million. However, as the export duty is to be repealed on the condition to that ERA agree to an annual contribution of at least $1.5 million to research in the Alligator Rivers Region, there is no net financial impact as a result of the measures contained in this bill. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr MCGauran) NA Motion (by Mr Leo MCLeay) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. Australian Products",96
218,Mr ATKINSON,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise this evening to address the issues of manufacturers. I refer specifically this evening to Hardeman and Rolls Packaging Pty Ltd, which manufactures in my Australia Post Express Post bags. It is important to support Australian manufacturers. In fact, it concerns me a great deal that there are examples of alternative products being used instead of Australian products. In case, I think it needs to be looked at very Hardeman and Rolls Packaging Pty Ltd manufactures in my electorate the Australia Post Express Post bag that I am holding. In fact, another Express Post bag, of a somewhat quality, is manufactured in New I find it rather interesting that currently the one manufactured in Australia is produced for lc per bag less than the one manufactured in New Zealand. But the New Zealand company, whose parent company out of the United States, has 95 per cent of the market for these bags that are ERA's produced for Australia. A tender is coming up for this particular the bag in November this year. They talked about this with some of the Australia Post people by and they said they were comfortable with purchasing the bag from the New Zealand manufacturer-something my constituent is concerned about. I do not want to make an of issue of their being comfortable or otherwise, but if the bag is of as good a quality as-and I am assured that it is-and is cheaper than in the one being produced in New Zealand I would have thought there would be a responsibility for Australian organisations, particularly Australia Post, to purchase from Australian manufacturers. I find it also interesting that, whilst there is a requirement to display 'Made in Australia' on most of our articles, there is nothing to identify the bag as being made in New Zealand. In fact, on the reverse side of this bag three patent numbers are quoted. Rather interestingly, nobody seems to be able to find any reference to the first of those. The second patent number-patent No. 207248-on the back of the bag is actually to do with the treatment of textiles. I would have thought that had very little to do with this particular bag. The other patent number-patent No. 202637-is a patent relating to apparatus for dispensing liquids. It amazes me that, when we are talking about quality in so many areas in this country and we demand Australian manufacturers to get it right and have accuracy, we have a bag that is not even manufactured in this country and says nothing about where it comes from. I think most Australians would be horrified to find out that, even though we can produce this bag in this country at a cheaper price, it is not being purchased by Australia Post. Australia Post is purchasing a bag that does not even have the right information when it comes to patents in this country. It raises a very interesting issue of why Australia Post would purchase a bag that is more expensive. One could argue over the quality of it. I have two of the bags in front of me and can tell you that the bag produced in Cheltenham is of equal quality, certainly in appearance. Why would they purchase bags for a higher price from overseas? One of the arguments I have heard from a number of manufacturers-and I have to say that this is not one that has been raised by this particular company, but it is one that concerns me-is that we buy from overseas companies rather than Australian companies because of the opportunities to go overseas and check out the products. For an Australian manufacturer who has laid his house on the line to make sure his business survives during a recession, it would leave a bit of a nasty taste. In this case, the particular gentleman involved had to buyout a partner because they could not afford to have the two of them operating the company in the manner they would have liked during the recession, only to find that 95 per cent of those bags are purchased overseas. I hope that when the tendering process is looked at by Australia Post it thinks a little about the Australian manufacturers in this country that have something to contribute. In this case, it is more than something to contribute on a manufacturers' basis; it has something to contribute on a price basis as well. Drought Relief",97
219,Mr LES SCOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"Oxley) (7.29 p.m.)Last Saturday night in my electorate of Oxley, which includes the city of Ipswich, the local greyhound racing club conducted an auction and a number of other fundraising initiatives to raise much needed funds for the drought relief appeal. It is hoped that these funds will assist those in our area of south-east Queensland. Tonight I would like to offer my congratulations to the club manager of the Ipswich Greyhound Racing Club, Chris Williams. This fundraising event was one of Chris's initiatives. He is a great fellow and a great community minded person. Chris took it upon himself to organise this fundraising activity for the drought relief program. Part of it was in the form of an auction, with prize money and donations from generous people in the community. I think this goes to show the generosity of Australians when their fellow Australians are in great need. All of us in this House know how our friends in the rural sector, particularly those in Queensland and New South Wales, are suffering from the drought at the present time. Some $164 million from the Commonwealth government's drought relief program has already gone a long way to assisting these people. I think we should acknowledge in this place the moral support offered by our friends in the rural community and in this case the people in my community. Chris Williams, his committee and the supporters of the Ipswich Greyhound Racing Club set themselves a target of raising between $10,000 and $15,000. During the night they managed to raise $13,587. I offer my sincere congratulations to them for that great effort. They are hoping to receive the government's dollar for dollar subsidy by channelling those funds through the Farmhand appeal. I was asking the honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods) how things were going in that regard and he told me that the government has already allocated $6 million to the area. That means that $12 million has already been allocated through that program to assist something like 3,800 farmers affected by drought. That is a tremendous effort from our community. I acknowledge the efforts of my local community. I am very proud to have been associated with that event. Chris invited my wife and me along on that evening. Chris and his wife, Tina, were both working hard as usual in the local area. There were only 500 people at the racing club meeting on Saturday night, but it just goes to show how many people will respond to such efforts. A couple of greyhound pups, various items of equipment used in greyhound racing and some pot plants were donated and auctioned on the night. Mr Speaker, I mentioned to you earlier this afternoon that the club manager, got so enthusiastic with the auction that he ripped off his tie and auctioned it. I thought at the time that if only could have had one of the Speaker's ties, we would have done well. Chris managed to get $40 for his tie on the night. His wife told me later that she paid only $10 for it. We have to see whether we can buy Chris a new tie. Mr Speaker, if you could donate one of your ties some time, I am sure he would appreciate it for future auctions. It is certainly a great to raise money. I would like to join with all those who were associated with this very successful event on Saturday night in supporting those people in our rural community and letting them know that many of us are thinking about them. In the western part of my electorate in the Laidley shire, people have been terribly affected by the drought. I was out there recently talking to some of the farmers. They need a lot of support from all of us in this place. I know that members across the parliament share the view that we need to do something to help people in the rural sector. I again congratulate Chris Williams and his committee at the Ipswich Greyhound Racing Club on their very strong effort in supporting our rural community. Tobacco Industry",98
220,Mr KATTER,ADJOURNMENT,"Kennedy) (7.34 p.m.)There is a terrible fate awaiting the tobacco industry of Australia, particularly the two-thirds to three-quarters of it that exists in North Queensland. Our cost of production can be roughly considered to be around $6 a kilogram and the international price is around $4 a kilogram. The only reason we have been able to effectively stay in the tobacco industry is that the home content rule says that if producers do not accept 50 per cent Australian tobacco in cigarettes a very punitive tariff would be applied. The net result is that we have had not 50 per cent but pretty close to 57 per cent Australian tobacco in our cigarettes. With the onrush of the GATT legislationand I must say that whoever negotiated on behalf of the tobacco industry did a deplorable job-we now have a situation in which Chris, we will be at the tender mercies of the marketplace and the industry will be abolished. I use that term 'abolished' because I we can see no hope for any part of the industry continuing to exist in the face of international competition. Tobacco is a very labour intensive product. We are competing against $1.60 a day wage rates in the corporate farms in Africa and $2 a day wage rates in the corporate farms in Central America and South America. So we are non-competitive through way no fault of our own but through the fault of people who do not choose to pay a decent wage. We have only two choices in our industry: to drive our wages down to that level, or to close down the industry. When it closes down, not only the farming side of the industry will close down, taking down 2,000 jobs with it, but also the manufacturing side will close down. There is no logic attached to manufacturing cigarettes in Australia, where we simply cannot work on economies of scale in competition against the United States with its huge market, or China with its huge market. So the manufacturing side of the industry will go as well, and some 6,000 Australian jobs will be lost. In sharp contrast to the Australian government, which removed the 50 per cent home content rule, the United States legislature and Senate introduced a 75 per cent home content rule. Somebody has to be hellishly wrong here. Since then, some people have argued against me and pointed out that it was GATT illegal and has been knocked on the head. That does not detract from the fact that the legislature in the United States was heading in one direction and the legislature in Australia was heading in the exact opposite direction. Somebody had to be deadly wrong. Let me move on and say that, with the simple imposition of a lc levy-and this place has not hesitated to bung 20, 50 and 100 per cent increases in excise on tobacco; we are asking for lc on the cost of a packet of cigarettes, which is $5 now-that extra lc over the next few years will give us enough money for the farming industry of the Dimbulah-Mareeba region of North Queensland and Myrtleford in Victoria to be able to restructure properly and adequately. It is a decision of this government that has broken these farmers and delivered them into bankruptcy in a community of 12,000 or 15,000 people. I have to point out that Mareeba lost its meat works on account of the federal government's TB eradication campaign. We lost 200 or 300 jobs. The world heritage declaration cost us another 100 jobs. The gold tax cost us probably another 100 jobs. So every disaster that has befallen Mareeba has been occasioned by this place. Let us for once in this place deliver to these people some hope of a bright future. If we deliver that money, we can restructure and move ultimately, I hope, into sugar. We need to divert a bit of water, but we cannot do that diversion unless there is some money coming from somewhere. It most certainly will not be coming from the state coffers; the state government has made that clear and unequivocal. It said, 'The federal government has created the problem; it's for the federal government to fix up that problem.' But if we can deliver a two million tonne sugar mill to the Australian economy, then we are talking about $50 million, $100 million, $150 million, maybe even as much as $200 million in years to come-and all of this for the sake of just a single cent. All of that heartbreak and destruction will be eliminated for the sake of a single cent on cigarettes. That is all we require, and we can deliver back to Australia a very bright future, not only for the people of the area but also for the greater Australian nation. Home Child-Care Allowance",99
221,Mr WAKELIN,ADJOURNMENT,"Grey) (7.38 p.m.)Regrettably, I rise to present a case study of how the government is treating low income families in my electorate in this, the International Year of the Family. Some time ago the government promised to help low income families by introducing a home child-care allowance-I think it was not that long before the 1993 election. As highlighted by my colleague the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) many times, the home childcare allowance-or the HCCA-has been nothing but a farce from day one. The confusion created by HCCA is typical of much new legislation coming from the government. The Department of Social Security has been ill-informed on HCCA's introduction and is sceptical of the government's publicity about its benefits. Families are confused about its introduction and the abolition of the dependent spouse rebate. Debate is still going on in this place about the final structure of HCCA, with the government recently acknowledging that some people will be worse off when it is introduced. I draw an example from my electorate of what HCCA is doing. One of my constituents was advised by my office that, according to the Department of Social Security guidelines, she would not be eligible for HCCA, despite her low income. This was because the government had also introduced the partner allowance-not a new payment, but a new way of paying the jobsearch and newstart allowances to couples. She would be receiving half of her husband's unemployment benefit. Because she was receiving this money under her own name, she would not be able to get the allowance since under HCCA's guidelines she would be earning too much. Some weeks later, she called my electorate office to say she had, in fact, received the lowance. She had a letter from the Department of Social Security to advise her that she was entitled to it from now on and that payment would be placed into her personal bank account. She was understandably delighted with the news and advised my staff that she would be using the payment to buy shoes and clothing for her family, which she promptly did. The news was surprising to my staff, who had done their homework and could not understand how the constituent had received the payment. My staff telephoned the local DSS to find out what had happened. They were advised that the constituent would receive only one payment. The constituent was temporarily eligible because the date of the introduction of the partner allowance and the home child-care allowance had become confused. The home child-care allowance was to be introduced first, but as soon as the partner allowance was introduced she would not be eligible for the HCCA. She would, therefore, receive only one home child-care allowance payment. However, the letter which the DSS sent to my constituent did not make this plain. The letter stated she would be receiving the payment 'from now on'. Upon further investigation, my staff are not entirely sure whether constituents such as this will even receive official notification from the DSS that their HCCA has ceased. This is something we are still following up. I am unsure of how many constituents the government will lead astray with the legislation. However, I am certain that it will cause a lot of disappointment, anger and some pain among low income families. As I said, this case study comes from my electorate, the seventh poorest electorate in Australia, according to the last census. What alcan low income Australians expect, with a government which treats them like this? Despite these facts, the government has relentlessly pursued its publicity campaign on the home child-care allowance, mailing information on this allowance to cities in my electorate, while at the same time the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) heralds its so-called benefits in the House. It is clear that we must view with scepticism any move by this government which promises to improve life for many low income Australians. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 7.43 p.m. NA The following notice was given: Mr Leo MCLeay to move That the following Bills be referred to the Main Committee for consideration: Primary Industries Legislation Amendment 1994; Excise Tariff Legislation Amendment 1994; Evidence 1993; Evidence (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) 1994; Veterans' Affairs (1994-95 Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment (No.2) 1994; Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (No.2) 1994; and Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Legislation Amendment 1994. NA The following papers were deemed to have been presented on 17 October 1994: Defence Act-Determinations under section 58B 1994 Nos. 43,44,45,46. Public Service Act-Determinations 1994 Nos. 79, 84, 85, 160, 161, 163, 182, 184. The following answers to questions were circulated: Department of Industry, Science and Technology: Electronic Information (Question No. 1360) Mr Latham asked the Minister representing the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, upon notice, on 23 August 1994: (1) What services does the Minister's Department, or government enterprises for which the Minister has portfolio responsibility, provide, or will it provide, using public access points for the distribution of electronic information in regional, district or suburban centres around Australia. (2) How will each service referred to in part (1) be accommodated and operated. (3) What consideration has been given to using Australia's extensive network of municipal libraries to house the services and foster public access. Mr Lee-The Minister for Industry, Science and Technology has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The Office of AusIndustry within the Department of Industry, Science and Technology manages the BizLink program aimed at fulfilling the information needs of SMEs and their advisers through a range of access points in regional districts and suburban centres, including: AusIndustry offices and other Commonwealth and State/Territory government agencies; industry and business associations; private sector service providers such as accountants, lawyers, banks and consultants; Members of Parliament and others who deal with the public. Negotiations with States and Territories, and business organisations to achieve this coverage are in progress. The first of the BizLink information products is called ""BizHelp"" and will be launched later this year. BizHelp is a computer-based guide to government programs and services to help SMEs. It includes information on industry assistance offered at the Commonwealth, State and Territory levels. Other information products under development or consideration have the potential to provide information on, amongst other matters, sources of NA training for SMEs, services offered by industry associations, technology and product information, and tenders. (2) It is expected BizLink information will be able to be accessed by members of the public in a number of ways through the outlets listed in (1). The Department of Industry, Science and Technology is currently considering other methods of providing access to business information for SMEs, including the use of touch screen display stands and on-line access. (3) During the initial market research for the BizLink program, it was found that small and medium enterprises prefer to have information sorted and interpreted for them by a business adviser or intermediary, such as an accountant. Nevertheless, municipal libraries will be able to obtain and use information products such as BizHelp should they wish. The Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) (1) The Australian Institute of Marine Science provides a limited set of environmental data from its reef monitoring stations to the general public in Townsville. (2) The environmental data is provided through 3 outlets located in Townsville: The Townsville Motor Boat Club, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, and AIMS headquarters (located at Cape Ferguson). Data is displayed on computer terminals which are linked to the Institute's main computer via land lines. The data is updated automatically every 30 minutes to give the prevailing weather conditions at a number of reef sites. (3) Given the specific nature of the data and the relatively high costs of extending the network, no consideration has been given to using Australia's extensive system of municipal libraries to house the service and foster public access. The Australian Industrial Property Organisation (AIPO) (l)&(2)The Australian Industrial Property Organisation's patent trade marks and designs data bases are available to registered subscribers from anywhere in Australia by dial-up connection through the Auspac network. (3) Municipal libraries can utilise this service by becoming registered subscribers and being connected to the Auspac network. The Australian Customs Service (ACS) (1)&(2)The Australian Customs Service does not currently provide services utilising the distribution of electronic information in regional, district or suburban centres around Australia. The electronic information services which are provided by Customs are on a subscriber basis and not directed to the general public. However, Customs is looking into the provision of information services such as ""008"" free call services for general Customs information. Customs is also examining the possibility of providing Customs information via a publicly accessible electronic bulletin board. (3) At this stage, no consideration has been given to the utilisation of municipal libraries for the provision of Customs information. However, there is no reason why this could not be considered for longer term provision of information services. Department of Industry, Science and Technology: Conference Attendance (Question No. 1422) Mr Hollis asked the Minister representing the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, upon notice, on 24 August 1994: Who, on behalf of Australia, attended the (a) 27th session of the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (lOC) in Paris from 22 June to 1 July 1994, (b) Conference on Global Ocean Ecosystems Dynamics organised under the IOC in Paris from 18 to 22 July 1994 and (c) Workshop on Harmful Algal Bloom organised under the IOC in Aviero, Portugal, from 22 to 29 July, 1994. Mr Lee-The Minister for Industry, Science and Technology has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (a) The meeting was the Executive Council of the IOC, of which Australia is a member. It was attended by Dr RM Green (CSIRO)-Head of Delegation, Dr. J Zillman (Bureau of Meteorology), and Mr RN Harriss (AMSAT Limited) with local representation from the UNESCO Office. (b) No-one. (c) No-one. Bougainville: Australian Defence Force (Question No. 1428) Mr Mack asked the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 25 August 1994: (1) Have any Australian Defence Force (ADF) personnel been present in Bougainville during periods of hostility between Papua New Guinea (PNG) forces and Bougainville separatists; if so, in each relevant calendar year, (a) how many were present and (b) what was the purpose of their presence in each case. (2) Are ADF personnel present in Bougainville; if so, (a) how many and (b) for what purpose. (3) Are any ADF personnel, or have any been, involved in any military or military-style operations in Bougainville; if so, what are the details in each case. (4) Have the ADF or Government provided advice, planning or other support to the PNG Government or Defence Force relating to operations against Bougainville separatists. (5) Is it a fact that the PNG Government (a) continues to seek the surrender of Bougainville separatists and (b) has withdrawn from negotiations intended to lead to a settlement of the dispute. (6) Will Australian military aid to PNG continue; if so, (a) what amount per annum, (b) in what form and (c) for what duration.  provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) & (2) No Australian Defence Force (ADF) personnel are posted to Bougainville. It is true that ADF personnel serving with the Papua New Guinea (PNG) security forces have visited Bougainville in the performance of their duties. They have done so for support tasks such as helping to restore communications and assess infrastructure repair needs. They have not been involved in combat operations. The foIlowing table lists visits to Bougainville up until September 1994 by ADF personnel serving with the PNG security forces. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs announced on 21 September 1994, Australia is providing the training and logistic support for the South Pacific Peacekeeping Force deployed to Bougainville to secure the venue for a Bougainville Peace Conference. As part of the planning undertaken for this, the Combined Force Commander, an ADF brigadier, visited Bougainville and spoke with various Bougainville groups on 20-22 September as a Personnel member of the reconnaissance team for the peacekeeping operation. Australian involvement with the peacekeeping force will entail deployment of some ADF personnel to Bougainville to provide communications, medical, and other logistic support to the force.

The Defence Cooperation program with PNG is anticipated to remain at the level of approximately $20m over the next five years. Foreign Aid Privatisation (Question No. 1445) Mr Knott asked the Minister for Finance, upon notice, on 29 August 1994: (I) Did he indicate in an answer to a question without notice concerning foreign aid (Hansard, 4 May 1994, page 213) that nations with higher percentages of their GDP in the public sector than Australia were also in a more favourable economic position. (2) Is the Government committed to the privatisation of government business enterprises such as the Australian National Line and Australia Post; if so, why.",100
222,Mr BEAZLEY,SQNLDR,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I noted in my response to the question without notice on 4 May 1994 that Australia has a commendable record on foreign aid. My observation was that ""those nations which have a better performance in percentage GDP terms in foreign aid than Australia have much higher percentages of their GDP in the public sector."" I did not infer in my response that countries with larger public sectors than Australia's are in a more favourable economic position. (2) In the last budget the then Minister for Finance Mr Willis announced the sale of a number of government owned assets. Assets to be sold included the Australian National Line but not Australia Post. In deciding to sell certain businesses the government considers that greater efficiency can be obtained from private ownership as well as considering that the provision of such services by the government is no longer necessary. The government does not consider that Australia Post falls into this category and therefore has no intention of selling that company. Home Child-care Allowance: Information (Question No. 1483)  Security, upon notice, on 19 September 1994: Has his Department recently mailed out material on the new Home Child Care Allowance; if so, (a) how many items were mailed, (b) to whom were the items sent, (c) what was the source of the names and addresses of recipients of the material and (d) what was the total cost including postage and printing. Mr Baldwin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Yes. (a) Three items were mailed-an information leaflet, a claim form and a reply paid envelope. (b) Items were mailed to all Family Payment recipients with partners, receiving payment between 11 July and 5 August 1994, and selected parents with partners whose Family Payment was cancelled at I January 1994. (c) Department of Social Security computer records of payment. (d) The cost of the mail out was: printing information leaflet and form-$170,335 postage-$626,535 reply paid envelope-$28,350 out side envelope-$27,693 overprinting envelope-$I,055 mailing house costs-$22,720 Total cost-$876,688 In addition there was a cost of 47 cents for each reply paid envelope returned to the Department.",106
