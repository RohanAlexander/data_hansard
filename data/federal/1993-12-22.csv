5,Mr RUDDOCK,NOES,"I am glad that the government has accepted the amendments in relation to the Social Security (Budget and Other Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill. The first matter relates to the mature age allowance. In my view the amendments are quite sensible because they the ensure that people who receive a mature age allowance and undertake part-time work will be able, if they lose that work, to go back on the mature age allowance rather than having to receive other forms of benefit that are available to the unemployed. In relation to the compensation recovery arrangements, the opposition has agreed to the majority of the provisions that the government has sought to enact. But we have moved to delete from the bill those compensation measures which deal with the question of excluding from benefits those who receive a compensation payment to replace lost income or future income earning capacity. We wanted to do so because the particular measure, as it is intended toÂ· operate, will characterise all compensation payments as 50 per cent economic loss related. The impact of such a provision would be that a beneficiary might suffer a significant preclusion period as a result of the compensation being characterised as 50 per cent for economic loss. That could mean,' for instance, that an invalid or age pensioner who was involved in a motor vehicle accident and received a small compensation paymentfor pain and suffering or out of pocket medical expenses would have part of that payment ch-racterised as 50 per cent economic loss related. There would be a preclusion perio""d for that person being able then to obtail1 social security benefit. While there are discretionary provisions in the existing law which allow the government to make a decision to grant a person an ex gratia payment, the fact is that the way in which those provisions have been construedthis has been confirmed by the courts-has meant that a person would not be able to get the discretion exercised that is available unless there were new guidelines. The government tells us that the guidelines are very complex and difficult to draft. I do not believe it is beyond the wit of parliamentary counsel to come up with appropriate guidelines for advising officers on the exercise of a discretion. If the government is given time, it will come up with an appropriate set of guidelines for implementation of the discretion. So, Jor that reason, we have deleted all of the provisions at this time; but, if the government brings back fresh provisions along with appropriate guidelines for administering discretion, obviously we will be prepared to look at this measure again. In relation to the movement of 16-year-olds from Austudy to family payments, the opposition took the view that this measure would have quite a significant impact, particularly on families, because"" the measure was designed to save the government money, which it can do only by reducing the support available. It does this by applying different assets and income tests. Our view is that the measure would disadvantage families, particularly rural families. We opposed it and we are pleased that the other parties, the Australian Democrats in particular, joined us in opposing that particular measure. The final matter relates to data matching. The government ""sought removal of the sunset clause that brought data matching to an end. We would have been prepared to look at these provisions more realistically if the government had been able to produce evidence that data matching was achieving the outcomes originally foreshadowed. The government expected savings of the order of $300 million from data matching. In the end, in net terms, a mere $3 million saving has been demonstrated in the most recent reports of the Auditor-General who has examined this matter. At this time it is appropriate to deal with the data matching by ensuring that the sunset Clause presently in place-which would have seen the provisions expire on 22 January 1994-remains in place but with the substitution of a new sunset date of 22 January 1996. This is an appropriate response which gives the government flexibility in future years to move in relation to this matter. But it ensures continuing reports on the adequacy of the data matching regime and it leaves open the option of having the sunset clause operate if it is demonstrated that the data matching has not realised the objectives set for it.",34

10,Mr BEAZLEY,NOES,As long as you keep it to a couple of minutes; you know the schedule.,35
11,Mr ANDREWS,NOES,"We have already wasted one minute."" I briefly wanted to address clauses 88 and 89 of the Social Security (Budget and Other Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill because what the"" government originally intended to do would have had a detrimental effect on some 136,000 students and their families in Australia, and particularly those in regional and rural Australia. It would have halved the assets test that applied to these payments, from some $730,000 to $360,000; reduced the maximum income from some $30,000 to $24,000; and reduced the maximum payment from $129 a fortnight to $121 a fortnight. This was in light of the government's own policy statement that it would 'make continuing improvements to the Austudy schemes of student support'. This was not an improvement. It was clearly detrimental to the interests of a whole range of families, particularly in regional and rural Australia. In a week in which the government brings out a report on trying to maximise and improve opportunities for regional Australia, this provision stood in marked contrast. So we on this side are glad the government has finally seen the light on these measures. Question resolved in the affirmative. Resolution reported; report adopted. NA BILL. (No.2) Consideration of Senate Message Bill returned from the Senate with amendments. Ordered that the amendments be taken into consideration in Committee of the Whole House forthwith. Senate s amendments No. 1Clause 3, page 2, paragraph (b), proposed point 1068-B3, line 8, after //items//, //3,4,"". No. 2After clause 6, page 3, insert the following clause: Schedule lA //6A. Schedule IA of the Principal Act is amended by adding at the end the following clause: Transitional saving for existing student parents '69. The amendments to this Act made by section 5 of the Social Security Amendment Act (No.2) 1993 do not apply to a person who, prior to 1 January 1994, was eligible to receive payments in respect of the Post-Graduate Awards Scheme, until the person loses such eligibility by operation of this Act other than as it is amended by section 5.'.//. Motion (by Mr Sciacca) proposed: That the amendments be agreed to.",35
12,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENT,"Berowra) (9.36 a.m.)The amendments to the Social Security Amendment Bill (No.2) attempt to bring student parents' income for testing purposes for family payments into line with the tests that apply to all others. Unfortunately, the government did not take into account that some people had planned on receiving incomes which included postgraduate awards which, if this test had applied, would have excluded a number of peeple from receiving family payments even though they had included that very carefully in their budgeting. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that this provision has no retrospective application. We think it is a sensible measure and support it. The ombudsman tabled a report this week which suggested to the government a number of matters that needed urgent remedying. I simply draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca) to the fact that, while the department has been busily drafting amendments designed to save revenue where there is a small cost to the revenue of ensuring fairness and equity, those sorts of amendments do not seem to have been on our agenda to date. So I wouldÂ· encourage the parliamentary secretary and the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) to ensure that those sorts of matters are addressed when we have further social insert security legislation before the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Resolution reported; report adopted. NA Motion (by Mr Beazley) agreed to: That the House, at its rising, adjourn until Tuesday, 1 February 1994, at 2 p.m., unless the Speaker fixes an alternative day or hour of meeting.

House adjourned at 9.39 a.m. until 1 February 1994 at 2 p.m. in accordance with the resolution agreed to this day.

My involvement as Minister for Consumer Affairs is limited to providing funding for the National Coordinator of the National Prices Netand work Inc. The National Prices Network Inc is an incorporated association which acts as the coordinator of the national Price Watch network. Responsibility for funding the National Coordinator of the National Prices Network Inc was transferred from the Treasurer's portfolio in August 1993 and the Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs has provided $39,000 in the 1993-94 Budget to employ the National Co-ordinator of the National Prices Network Inc, Ms Kathleen Shaw. The resources and activities of Price Watch are the responsibility of the Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services and I am unable to provide any further information in response to the honourable member's question. Industry Commission: Cost of Relocation (Question No. 193) Mr Campbell asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 17 August 1993: (1) What is the estimated cost of relocating the Industry Commission from Canberra to Melbourne.

(3) The article in the Melbourne Age of 6 March 1993, referred to by the honourable member, reflects views I expressed at that time. (4) One professional officer and one support staff hllve been employed for more than 25 years by the Industry Commission. (5) Resignation*-18 Leave Without Pay to take employment with other organisations (including Part IV Mobility)22** Total Number-40 Number of paid staff at 6 May 1992-235# Proportion-17% Note: * it is not possible to determine whether the resignations were specifically for the purpose of taking up other employment. dustry Commission needed to change and that there were persons who had served with the Commission for 25 years and were not capable of dealing with anything else.

(6) What proportion of officers employed by the Commission will resign or take leave without pay to Melbourne if the relocation proceeds. (7) Will the microeconomic reform process in Australia be detrimentally affected by the loss of key Industry Commission personnel. (8) Will he postpone or cancel the relocation and allocate the sum saved towards Australians in genuine individual need.. ' Mr Dawkins-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) 1992-93 1993-94 1994-95 1995-96 Actual Estimate Estimate Estimate Total 2,532 10,601 9,527 573 23,233 590 4,000 1,800 6,390 2,532 10,011 5,527 (1,227) 16,843 234.8 240 234 226 (Aver) 234 $10,800 $41,700 $23,600 nla $72,000 ** of the 22 staff, 3 have since returned to the Commission, 2 have permanently transferred out of the Commission'and 1 officer has resigned. # obtained from the Department of Finance Staffing Monitor, being the latest official data prior to the announcement of the relocation on 13 May 1992. (6) There is no information available to provide an answer to this question. (7) There will be inevitable dislocation and disruption associated with the relocation of the Industry Commission. However, I am confident that the relocation will assist the Commission in fulfil. ling its enhanced role of investigating opportunities for growth and employment in specified industries, via its Industry Development Inquiries. The adoption of an Industry Development approach, together with the move of the Commission to Melbourne, heralds a new phase in the Commission's continuing valuable contribution to the microeconomic reform process in Australia. (8) In April of this year, it was announced that the Commission would retain a presence in Canberra of some 70 officers. This will reduce the fiscal cost and dislocation associated with the move to Melbourne.

(a)-(g) See above (h) No Department of Employment, Education and Training: Training Courses (Question No. 249) Mr Aldred asked the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 17 August 1993: Did the DepartmenCs Staff Bulletin, reference 10/93, of 24 May 1993 contain descriptions of several courses; if so, (a) did Moreland write the description of the courses to be provided by Moreland; if mit, who did, (b) were the combination of cooperative and accelerated learning techniques used by a Ms Purdon described as unusual; if so, in what way Were they unusual and (c) was a Ms Fischer described as having a reputation for high quality outcomes; if so, (i) how 1993: was this determined, (ii) with whom were checks made and (iii) when were they made.",49
26,Mr BEAZLEY,MORELAND,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Staff Bulletins of the Department's Victorian Office regularly carry notifications of training courses and seminars which may be of interest to Fischer staff. Staff can approach supervisors to nominate for these or other courses/seminars of which they rimy be' aware and which. are relevant to their development or upgrading of knowledge and workrelated skills. Bulletin No. 10/93 of 24 May 1993 carried descriptions of several training courses, including a number endorsed or sponsored by the Victorian Regional Directors' Staff Development and EEO Steering Committee, a grouping of Commonwealth agencies in Victoria.

(3) No-See answers to Questions 177 and 396 Bornhorst, Ms P. (Question No. 350) MrBradford asked the Minister for Communications, upon notice, on 2 September (1) Has his attention been drawn to reports that Pamela Bornhorst, a presenter on ABC TV's. 7.30 Report in Brisbane, is to be sacked. . (2) Is he able to say whether she is being sacked because of (a) her alleged failure to maintain political contacts, (b) an aggressive interviewing style and (c) an alleged generation of adverse publicity for the program. (3) Is he able to say whether she is being replaced because she is (a) 40 years old, (b) a woman and (c) out of favour with the Government. (4) Has his attention been drawn to the refusal by the Premier of Queensland, Mr Goss, to appear on the program; if so, is he able to say whether this has any bearing on her sacking. (5) Is he able to say whether the ABC will sack other ABC TV presenters, such as Paul Lyneham and Quentin Dempster, for aggressiveness. Mr Beddall-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Under its Act the ABC is responsible for determining the terms and conditions of employment and is required to endeavour to achieve high standards as an employer in relation to terms and conditions of employment; occupational health; industrial safety; industrial democracy; non-discriminatory practices and other matters. The ABC has provided the following information: (1) Ms Bornhorst was not sacked. She was removed from air after negotiations had broken down between Ms Bornhorst and ABC concerning her on-air presentation and other matters. There was no suggestion that Ms Bornhorst was to be dismissed from the ABC and the ABC continued negotiating with Ms Bornhorst to see if she could be redeployed in another position .. Ms Bornhorst was employed as a journalist with ABC TV News and Curre.nt A/fairs in Brisbane. (2) As Ms Bornhorst has now instigated legal proceedings for both breach of contract and defamation, it would be inappropriate to provide further comment in relation to this matter. (3) The decision to remove Ms Bornhorst from air was not connected in any way .')Vith her public statements that she is (a) 40 years old, (b) a woman and (c) out of favour with the Government. (4) At no time has ABC Branch or Federal Management including TV News and Current Affairs ever been approached or influenced by any member or official of the Goss Government. It is not uncommon for political leaders to deny or limit access to particular television programs or reporters. (5) It is not a question of whether Mr Lyneham's, Mr Dempster's presentations or that of any other ABC presenter is aggressive on air or not. Like Ms Bornhorst, all presenters are subject to regular review and are assessed on their individual merits. Jury Service (Question No. 365) Mr Melham asked the Minister for Justice, upon notice, on 2 September 1993: In which States and Territories are adults disqualified from jury service in'criminal and civil trials, whether or not the Commonwealth of Australia is party to thesuit, on account of (a) sex, (b) age, (c) property, (d) language Qr (e) racial origin.",49
28,Mr KERR,MORELAND,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: There is no legislation disqualifying an adult from jury service on the grounds of sex, age, property or racial origin in the States and Territories. Adults who are not able to read and write the English language are disqualified from jury service in New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, Western Australia, South Australia, Tasmania, Australian Capital Territory and Northern Territory.

32,Mr BEAZLEY,AIDAB,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: My answers to Questions 177, 396 and 397 describe inquiries conducted by the Department in response to various matters raised by the honourable member. These matters do not relate to 10 May speeches made by the honourable member in the House of Representatives other than those made on 17 December 1992 and 10 May 1993. Roads: Expenditure (Question No. 410) Mr Cobb asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Communications, upon notice,on 29 September 1993: (1) What sums did the Government spend or will it spend on road funding in (a) 1992-93, (b) 199394 and (c) 1994-95. (2) Will road funding be reduced; if so, what will be the consequences. Mr Beddall-The Minister for Transport and Communications has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question: (l)(a) Commonwealth road funding (including B1ackspots) in 1992-93 was $1.694 billion. (b) Commonwealth road funding in 1993-94 will be $1.013 billion. (c) The forward estimates show Commonwealth road funding in 1994-95 to be $807 million.

The amounts involved are $175 million in 1993-94 and $350 million in 1994-95. (2) No, direct Federal road funding will not be reduced in the three years from 1 January 1994. Australian Tourist Commission: Number of Employees (Question No. 423) Mr Jull asked the Minister for Tourism, upon notice, on 5 October 1993: When may I expect answers to questions Nos. 9 to 13 which first appeared on the Notice Paper on 5 May 1993. Mr Lee-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The answers to these questions appeared in the Hansard on 16 November 1993. Commonwealth Purchases: Australian Made Goods (Question No. 450)",52
33,Mr CONNOLLY,AIDAB,"the Minister representing the Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services, upon notice, on 7 October 1993: Does Purchasing Australia maintain statistics on Commonwealth purchases of Australian-made versus imported goods; if so, What (a) quantity and (b) percentage of total purchases was purchased in each year since 1983 on (i) Australian-made goods, (ii) goods with varying degrees of Australian content, and of (iii) imported goods.",53
34,Mr WILLIS,AIDAB,"The Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: At the present time the only service-wide data accessible is drawn from the contracts arranged data that is published in the Commonwealth Purchasing and Disposals Gazette. This does not provide information about the origin of supplies. No statistics have ever been maintained by the Commonwealth Government on the Australian content of all the goods it purchases. The Department of the Arts and Administrative Services is examining this and other issues relating to purchasing statistics, with assistance from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. It should be appreciated that to collect, record and analyse detailed information on Australian content for all purchases would involve additional costs since no consistent and reliable measures are presently in use. For certain categories of goods, however, estimates of the origin of supplies are available. For example, Audit Report No 7 of 1992/93 found that over 80 per cent of expenditure on goods and services purchased under common use contracts (other than information technology) is on goods made in Australia. The greater part of this is accounted for by fuel, paper, tyres and furniture. Similarly, over 80 per cent of DASFLEET's expenditure on vehicles of $175 million per annum is domestic. In addition, the Commonwealth is a very large and increasing purchaser of services, most of which are supplied primarily in or from Australia. Examples of estimated annual expenditure on services include: Removals-$75m Travel-$100m Telecommunication services-$325m Rent + POEs for budget agencies-$ IOOOm IT outsourcing-$240m Consultancies-$372m Defence outsourcing-$313m Issues relating to purchasing information and data are b-ing examined by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology in its inquiry into government purchasing as well as by the task force established within the Department of the Arts and Administrative Services by Senator MCMullan to develop options for improving purchasing policy and procedures. Department of the Treasury: Contracts (Question No. 474)",53
35,Mr MCARTHUR,AIDAB,"the Treasurer, upon notice, on 20 October 1993: What contracts of an individual value of $100,000 or more have been entered into by (a) the Minister's Department or (b) agencies for which the Minister has portfolio responsibility with (i) Abigroup Ltd, (ii) Baulderstone Hornibrook Pty Ltd, (iii) Barclay Mowlen Constructions Pty Ltd, (iv) Civil & Civic Pty Ltd, (v) Concrete Constructions Group Pty Ltd, (vi) Fletcher Construction Group Ltd, (vii) Grocon Ltd, (viii) Macmahon Holdings Ltd, (ix) Theiss Contractors Pty Ltd, (x) Transfield Group and (xi) Watkins Pacific Ltd between (A) 1 January and 30 June 1993 and (B) 1 July 1993 and 30 September 1993 and for what works was each contract awarded. Mr Dawkins-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The only such contracts entered into by the Department of the Treasury, or Treasury portfolio agencies, are the following: NA Civil & Civic Pty Ltd was appointed construction manager for refurbishment of the Bank's Perth branch building in March 1993. The project is expected to be completed around June 1995. Lewis Construction Co Pty Ltd, which is part of the Concrete Constructions Group of Companies, was appointed construction manager for refurbishmentÂ·of the Bank's Melbourne branch building in October 1989. The project is expected to be completed in December 1993. NA The Australian Taxation Office did not enter into contracts with the listed builders during the period in question. However, the Australian Property Group, a part of the Department of Arts and Administrative Services (DAAS), entered into a pre-commitment lease with Grocon Ltd for the Penrith building on the ATO's behalf. DAAS will include details of this contract in their response. Attorney-General's Department: Contracts (Question No. 487)",54
36,Mr MCARTHUR,AUSTRALIAN TAXATION OFFICE,"the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 20 October 1993: What contracts of an individual $100,000 or more have been entered into Minister's Department or (b) agencies for Minister has portfolio responsibility Abigroup Ltd; (ii) Baulderstone Hornibrook Pty Ltd; (iii) Barclay Mowlen Constructions Ltd; (iv) Civil & Civic Pty Ltd; (v) Concrete Constructions Group Pty Ltd; (vi) Fletcher Construction Group Ltd; (vii) Grocon Ltd; (viii) Macmahon Holdings Ltd; (ix) Theiss Contractors Pty Ltd; (x) Transfield Group and (xi) Watkins Pacific Ltd between (A) 1 January and 30 June 1993 and (B) 1 July 1993 and 30 September 1993 and for what works was each contract awarded.",54
37,Mr LAVARCH,AUSTRALIAN TAXATION OFFICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) No contracts of an individual value of $100,000 or more have been entered into by the Attorney-General's Department with any of the companies listed for the periods indicated. (b) The Family Court negotiated a contract in August 1993 with Baulderstone Hornibrook Pty Ltd to the value of $392,000 for the fitout of the Geelong Court. Gun Laws (Question No. 490) Mr MACKel1ar asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 20 October 1993: Has the Australian Institute of Criminology established the necessary components of uniform national gun laws; if so, (a) what are the components, (b) what are the main features of the existing gun laws of each State and Territory and (c) how does each feature of the gun laws in each State and Territory compare with the Institute's objectives.",54
38,Mr LAVARCH,AUSTRALIAN TAXATION OFFICE,"The answer to all elements of the honourable member's question is as follows: While the Australian Institute of Criminology (AIC) was significantly involved in the preparation of the report Violence: Directions for Australia, it is the Australasian Police Ministers' Council (APMC) , as the relevant Ministerial body, which establishes the components of firearms policy nationally. The APMC has agreed on a national firearms regime which includes: Automatic Firearms A nation-wide prohibition on the importation and possession of fully automatic firearms, other than for official purposes. Handguns A nation-wide restriction on the importation and possession of handguns. Military Style Semi-Automatics value of The enactment of legislation in all jurisdictions, by (a) the to supplement the provisions of the Customs which the (Prohibited Imports) Regulations, to prohibit the with (i) sale of any firearm that is fitted with a folding or detachable stock, or that is a sel(-loading centre-fire rifle or carbine of a kind that is designed or adapted for military purposes or substantially duplicates those firearms; and that exceptions to the prohibition on imports for government or government authorised purposes be made on the basis of a Minister's certificate and that exceptions to prohibition on the sale be made on the basis of a Commissioner's certificate. Self-Loading Centre-Fire Rifles and Self-Loading Shotguns That the existing provisions of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations be adopted in all jurisdictions to prohibit the sale of all selfloading centre-fire rifles and self-loading shotguns which have a detachable magazine capable of holding more than 5 rounds; that exceptions to the import prohibition for government or government authorised purposes be made on the basis of a Minister's certificate; and that exceptions to the prohibition on sale be made on the basis of a Commissioner's permit, issued against strict criteria. Licensing That firearms licences: (a) be issued only to residents of proven identity; (b) be issued on the basis of appropriate qualification and training and a character check with the assistance of all jurisdictions; (c) be endorsed with a description of the category of firearm(s) for which the holder is licensed; (d) be issued for periods of no more than 6 years; (e) preferably bear a photograph of the holder; (t) be issued on the basis of a genuine reason for requiring a firearm, including a particularly stringent test of need for the possession of handguns and centre-fire self-loading rifles and self-loading shotguns. Also, the provision of evidence sufficient to substantiate the claim of belonging to a certain group (e.g. sporting shooter, bona fide collector), and that prospective licensees be required to demonstrate that a firearms of the applied for is, in all the circumstances, reasonably required for the purpose stated; (g) be issued after a 28 day cooling off period. Registration of all Firearms To require that all firearms be registered in the licence holder's jurisdiction of residence, and that registries record the licence holder's name and address, and the serial number and type of firearms held; and to establish a national linkage of firearms registries or firearms sales records with capacity to interrogate relevant databases. Ammunition Sales, Magazines and Security Rec quirements To limit sales of ammunition and its components to collectors and licence holders, for the category of firearms endorsed on the licence; to ban, other than in the case of government or government authorised users, the possession and use of detachable magazines of more than 5 rounds capacity for centre-fire self-loading rifles and self-loading shotguns; and to require the separate secure storage of firearms and ammunition and that minimum Australian standards be established. Recording of Sales The imposition, Australia-wide, of an obligation on business and private sellers and purchasers of firearms to ensure that purchasers are appropriately licensed. Categories of Firearms The adoption of an Australia-wide, minimum standard categorisation of firearms. Police Reference System A recent extension to the Police Reference System, to record adverse firearms histories and current domestic violence orders. Where a person obtains an adverse firearms history or a domestic violence order in a particular jurisdiction, that jurisdiction is to advise every other jurisdiction of that record. Each jurisdiction may then match that record against its record of firearms licence holders to enable a review of the continuation of any licence. Sale of Defence Surplus Weapons At its meeting in May, 1993, the APMC requested the Department of Defence to review the appropriateness of disposal of semi and fully automatic weapons to the civilian population generally, as well as the adequacy of present deactivation procedures to render weapons irreversibly incapable of firing before a deactivation certificate is issued. Most recently, the Commonwealth has placed a total ban on the sale of surplus weapons from the Department of Defence to members of the public. Given the honourable members' reference to the AIC in his question, the following additional information may be of interest: 1. The Australian Institute of Criminology takes its direction with regard to the necessary components of uniform national gun laws from the recommendations of the National Committee on Violence (NCV), which the Director of the Institute chaired, in its report on Violence: Directions for Australia (A copy of the relevant recommendations, with the updated responses received earlier this year from all States and Territories on progress with implementation of these recommendations, is attached). 2. The main features of the legislation of each State and Territory, given in the responses above, is summarised in the attached table, which was prepared as part of a study on firearms management in 1992. 3. All States and Territories have taken action implement at least some of the NCV recommendations in the last few years and some degree of uniformity has been achieved; for example, with regard to the seizure of weapons in a Qomestic violence situation and to the use of lethal force by police. On the other hand, there are still some major omissions, notably concerning the central issue of registration of firearms, which has not been accepted by New South Wales, Queensland and Tasmania. 4. The Institute is currently completing a detailed examination of the implementation of the NCV to recommendations relating to firearms. I have asked the Institute to make a copy available to Mr MACKellar, as soon as it is finalised.

Vo w NA NA NA 1991 and 1993 Cumulative Progress Reports from States and Territories The following information has been supplied by Commonwealth, State and Territory officers. Other than basic editorial requirements, the content has not been changed. The information is current as of 1 June 1993. Recommendation 54. All governments should take appropriate action to minimise death and injury arising from the accidental or intentional use of firearms by: Recommendation 54.1 The enactment of uniform legislation throughout Australia to regulate the acquisition and possession of firearms. Commonwealth The power to regulate the acquisition and possession of firearms lies with the States and Territories. At the Premiers meeting on 22 December 1987 all jurisdictions, with the exception of Tasmania, requested the Australian Police Ministers Council (APMC) to give further consideration to a number of issues related to gun control. A special meeting of the APMC was held in March 1988. Although the meeting passed a number of resolutions aimed at controlling the ownership and use of firearms, progress towards achieving uniformity of approach between jurisdictions has proved difficult. It has proved impossible 10 achieve the broad agreement which the Commonwealth regards as essential to the effectiveness of legislation in all jurisdictions. However, the Commonwealth is committed to continuing to work through the APMC to encourage the further development of a national approach. New South Wales On 23 October 1991 the Australian Police Ministers Council adopted a set of resolutions to be used by each jurisdiction as a basis to reform guns laws across Australia. On 22 November 1991 a Meeting of Premiers and Chief Ministers decided to implement the positive steps taken by the Police Ministers at their October meeting and indicated their full support for the principles agreed to by Police Ministers, as a guide to the reform of the gun laws. The NSW Government acted quickly on this matter. It drew on the resolutions of the APMC, and on the recommendations of the NSW Joint Parliamentary Committee Upon Gun Law Reform, to formulate new gun laws for NSW. These new laws came into effect on 1 May 1992, within the target date of 1 July 1992 proposed by the Police Ministers. A special booklet, entitled 'New Firearms and Domestic Violence Legislation', was issued by the NSW Police Service on 27 April 1992 to inform police and the general public of the new legislation. In addition, the Police Service conducted special training courses for its officers. Victoria These recommendations relate to the proposed development of uniform gun control legislation, enforcement and strategies throughout Australia. The stated aims are not inconsistent with those of the Victorian Firearms Act. The introduction of uniform gun control legislation should be the subject of a future agreement between State and Territory Ministers. It is probable that the existing Victorian Firearms Act 1958 will comply with most section of such an agreement. Queensland The Queensland Government has introduced the Weapons Act 1990. This legislation allows for the licensing of all firearm users. The Act fully implements current Queensland Government policy. 1993: No change recorded Western Australia A committee has been formed to establish uniform legislation in regards to firearm possession and guidelines. South Australia The Police Department concurs with this recommendation. Tasmania Tasmania is a full member of the Australian Police Ministers' Council (APMC) and is therefore substantially bound by Council's decisions. Tasmania has always had strict control in relation to firearms and pistols. The Guns Act 1991 broadens these controls to all types of firearms. This Act requires persons using/possessing firearms to be licensed (photographic licence) to do so. Tasmania departed from Commonwealth recommendations in electing to register the owner of a firearm(s) rather than each firearm itself. Northern Territory the Previous attempts at uniformity have failed. Northern Territory Police, after extensive consultations with the Territory Sporting Shooters' Council prepared a Firearms Bill which represents the most acceptable compromise in meeting the needs of the whole Northern Territory community in regard to gun control. The Act will commence on 1 January 1993. Recommendation 54.2 The introduction, through the Australian Police Ministers Council, of uniform guidelines for all Australian police forces in the enforcement of firearms legislation. Commonwealth This is a matter for the States and Territories and could only be implemented in conjunction with recommendation 54.1. ' New South Wales See comment on recommendation 54.1 Victoria These guidelines will follow from the agreement referred to in the response to recommendation 54.1. It is probable that procedures currently employed by the Victoria Police Force will be consistent with such uniform guidelines. Queensland The Australian Police Ministers Council is to discuss this issue. 1993: no change recorded Western Australia In Western Australia all firearms are licensed by individuals who use them. It is the firearm that is licensed not the shooter. Persons who commit violent crimes or show a history of violence, either have their licences revoked or are placed on computer 'Not to issue without reference to Firearms Branch'. South Australia The Police Department concurs with this recommendation. Tasmania The Tasmania Guns Act recognises firearms legislation applicable in all mainland States. Northern Territory It is difficult to perceive that uniform guidelines could be considered until such time as the various forces had time to implement the various recommendations relating to firearms in the National Committee on Violence report, including uniform firearm legislation. The new NT Firearms Act Â·has incorporated many of the NCV recommendations. Recommendation 54.3 Development of a national gun control strategy aimed at(a) reducing the number of firearms in Australian society; (b) preventing access to those weapons by individuals who are not fit and proper persons, such as those who have been convicted of violent crime or who have demonstrated a propensity for violence. Commonwealth Refer to response to Recommendation 54.1. New South Wales The NSW Joint Parliamentary Committee Upon Gun Law Reform recognised that a reduction in the level of gun ownership in the community must be a long-term goal. The Committee went on to say that its recommendations were aimed at achieving cultural changes in the community towards the possession and use of firearms. NSW's new gun laws, which became effective from 1 May 1992, require: genuine reason to - ossess a gun; successful completion of a Firearms Safety Awareness Course; proof-of-identity check; check of criminal history; check of previous licence history. Failure to meet any of these requirements results in an application fora firearms licence being refused. The maximum penalty for supplying false information is $5000 or two years imprisonment. Victoria This recommendation relates to the development of a uniform gun control strategy aimed at reducing the number of firearms in the community and preventing access by unsuitable persons to such weapons. The Firearms Act 1958 is not inconsistent with those objectives. Refer also to response to Recommendation 54.1. Queensland The APMC has already resolved for such a strategy. The Weapons Act is aimed at reducing the numbers of firearms in Queensland. The Weapons Act specifically prohibits the licens ing of people who have been convicted of violem crime or have shown a propensity for violence. 1993: no change recorded South Australia The Police Department concurs with this recommendation. Tasmania The policy of Tasmania Police is to restrict the number of firearms in the community. Guide-lines exist that establish strict requirements whereby the Commissioner of Police has to be satisfied that potential owners are fit and proper persons to hold a firearms licence. Our new domestic violence legislation also makes provision for police to seize firearms in potentially threatening domestic situations. Northern Territory The present NT Firearms Act provides that a person convicted of a firearms offence, is: (a) not eligible to be licensed; (b) may have his/her licence revoked by Commissioner; and (c) may be disqualified by court. However, the new Firearms Act does not expressly deal with persons 'convicted of violent crime or who have demonstrated a propensity for violence', although the Commissioner of Police does have to be satisfied that a person is 'fit and proper' to have a firearms licence. This interacts to some extent with Domestic Violence Legislation, in so far as it refers to 'demonstrated propensity': a person the subject of a domestic violence restraining order could be viewed as a person having demonstrated a propensity for violence. Australian Capital Territory The ACT Government supports these recommendations. The ACT Legislative Assembly has recently enacted the Weapons Act 1991 which seeks to give effect to the recommendations of the National Committee on Violence to the greatest extent possible. The Government notes, however, that efforts in this direction through the Australian Police Ministers' Council have highlighted the difficulty in achieving progress towards uniformity of approach between jurisdictions. The ACT Government maintains its support for these recommendations. The ACT Government notes that a minimum position has been agreed to on these issues by the States and Territories. The ACT Weapons Act 1991 seeks to give effect to the recommendations of the National Committee on Violence to the greatest possible extent. The Committee recommends the following specific strategies: Recommendation 55. The Federal Government should undertake the following action: Recommendation 55.1 Military weapons: sales of surplus military weapons should be prohibited to prevent their use in Australia. The importation of military-style weapons for use other than by law enforcement officers or defence force personnel should be prohibited. The Federal Government should provide a general statement to specify what firearms are importable. Commonwealth The Commonwealth supports limitations on the public availability of firearms in order to minimise death or injury from their misuse. It has announced strict controls oil the disposal of surplus military weapons and a ban on sales of semi-automatic firearms to members of the public from the Small Arms Factory, Lithgow; although the Factory will continue to supply parts to bona-fide customers consistent with current State and Territory gun legislation. . The Department of Defence is responsible for the disposal of working weapon systems, military platforms and warlike stores. In almost all cases the Department of Administrative Services, through the Commonwealth Government Sales Agency, Aussales, manages the sale of surplus military weapons of historical value or with civilian equivalents. Neither Department supports a complete ban on the sale of surplus military weapons. Current Commonwealth policy makes provision for the sale of military weapons of historical significance or with commercial equivalents, in accordance with State gun laws and after being rendered inoperable if automatic or semi-automatic in operation. The Commonwealth is able to control the import of firearms under the Customs (prohibited Imports) Regulations. This power is used in a manner complementary to the controls established in each jurisdiction. All automatic arms are prohibited imports under the Customs Act. A positive generic statement is being prepared by the Australian Federal Police (AFP), in consultation with national shooting and firearms associations, and the States, limiting the types of firearms to be allowed to be imported into Australia. The question was discussed at the November 1990 APMC meeting in Alice Springs. New South Wales The Commonwealth Government banned the importation of military-style semi-automatic firearms in December 1990. Victoria This is a Commonwealth responsibil-ty. Queensland The Australian Police Ministers Council has agreed upon a generic statement to ban the import of military pattern firearms. The Customs (Import Restrictions) Regulations have been amended to prohibit the import of these types of firearms. Currently the sale or possession of firearms of this nature is not restricted in Queensland. 1993: no change recorded Western Australia In viA legislation is in existence to cover the types of firearms which are prohibited. / Tasmania Fully automatic firearms require a permit. They may only be used as a collectors item. The Minister may declare other firearms to be prohibited under Section 4 of the Guns Act 1991. This gives the Government control on the types of firearms available to the community. This Government has indicated the importance of military style weapons being prohibited. Northern Territory Does not involve Northern Territory legislation. However, the Northern Territory Government whole heartedly supported the generic statement put forward by the Federal Government on the importation of firearms. Australian Capital Territory The ACT Government supports the recommendation noting that under the Commonwealth's generic statement on firearms importation(a) the importation of military style centre fire self loaders is not allowed; (b) non-military style centre fire self loaders may be imported but are restricted to a magazine with a maximum of five rounds; and (c) there is no restriction on the importation of rim fire self loaders for hunting and recreational shooting. Recommendation 55.2 Mail order firearms: if the Federal Government has the constitutional power, the sale of mail order firearms should be prohibited. If it does not have such powers, and jn the absence of uniform State and Territory licensing laws, the mail order sales of firearms should be restricted by using, for example, legislation relating to dangerous goods. Commonwealth Mail order firearms entering Australia are subject to the Customs (Prohi,bited Imports) Regulations. Within Australia, however, there is no general. prohibition on sending firearms through the mail. Compliance with relevant controls is a matter for the sender and recipient in light of the laws of the jurisdiction in which they reside. Any proposed amendments to the Australian Postal Corporation Act to restrict the carriage of firearms through the mail would require 'end user certificates' to be issued by State Australia Post would dispatch firearms. In order to successfully implement this legislation the full cooperation of all jurisdictions would be required. In April 1989 the Commonwealth wrote to the States to seek their views on such a scheme, and although some jurisdictions were in favour of it, others opposed it on both Constitutional and practical grounds. New South Wales Commonwealth matter. Victoria This is a Commonwealth responsibility. Queensland . This is a Federal Government responsibility, however the Australian Police Ministers Council will be examining this issue. 1993: no change recorded Western Australia Firearms Branch support this recommendation that mail orders be prohibited without prior approval. South Australia Weapons purchased by. mail from other States come within the provisions of the Guns Act 1991. Weapons purchased from overseas would be subject to Customs in the first instance. Northern Territory The Northern Territory Implementation Group has been given the task of implementing the NCV recommendations, if appropriate, in the Territory. The Group will take this recornmendation up with the Minister responsible for Consumer Affairs and or Dangerous Goods. Australian Capital Territory The ACT Government supports the recommendation insofar as it calls upon the Federal Government to prohibit mail order sales of weapons noting that it is not possible for ACT legislation to address this matter. The ACT Weapons Act 1991 does, nevertheless, impqse an obligation on an ACT person selling a weapon to a person interstate to have reasonable belief that the possession of the weapon by the purchaser in the other State or Territory is not proscribed by the law of that other jurisdiction. A penalty of $2 000 or imprisonment for twelve months, or both, is provided (section 78). The Act will, of course, apply to an ACT person who purchases a weapon from interstate by mail order. The person needs to be licensed and is only able to acquire a weapon of a kind which is appropriate for the purpose for which he or she is licensed. To this extent, for law abiding persons, controls are adequate. authorities before Recommendation 55.3 Rifle Clubs established under the Defence Act should be brought under the ambit of State licensing and registration requirements. Commonwealth The Department of Defence considers that the legislation governing rifle clubs is an anachronistic and unnecessary use of defence powers. In 1988 the Minister for Defence approved repeal of the relevant legislation (the Australian RifleÂ· Club Regulations) but the repeal was disallowed by the Senate. Since then the Department of Defence has been in negotiation with the two peak councils of rifle clubs towards achieving a common view on the jurisdiction that should govern rifle shooting as a sport. To date agreement has not been reached and negotiations are continuing. The Department believes that there is no sound basis for legislation governing firearms in rifle clubs to be separate from legislation governing all other firearms. Adoption of uniform firearms legislation would remove the principal argument for keeping rifle clubs under a Commonwealth umbrella, namely that variations in State law (and nonportability of registration) cause difficulties in transportation of weapons for competition purposes. NewÂ· South Wales While it is logical for Rifle Clubs under the Defence Act to come under State administration, the Commonwealth should consult fully with the States to ensure a smooth transition. Victoria This is a Commonwealth responsibility. Queensland The Weapons Act allows for this. The Police Service is designing systems to implement this change over. This matter is to be discussed at the Australian Police Ministers Council. 1993: no change recorded Western Australia In WA restrictions are placed on individuals licensing their firearms to use on rifle ranges. Tasmania Rifle clubs established under the Defence Act are exempt from the Guns Act. The weapons may only be carried between the residence and the Military Range. If they are used for any other purpose the owner must be licensed under the Act. Northern Territory In 1988 Police proposed these changes but they are not reflected in the proposed Firearms Bill. This was because the Northern Territory shooting lobby opposed such changes when negotiations in the Bill were conducted. The shooting lobby argued that the rifle clubs were well run and self-regulating and caused no problems to police. Further, the majo-ity of rifle club members voluntarily registered their firearms and obtained appropriate classes - of firearms licences. Australian Capital Territory The ACT Government supports the recommendation noting that this is a matter for the Federal Government to address in its legislation and that it is currently under consideration by Australian Police Ministers Council. Recommendation 56. The Federal Government should use its corporations power under the Constitution, as well as its powers to regulate trade and commerce, and imports, in furtherance of a national gun control strategy. Commonwealth The Attorney-General's Department reports that a gun policy based on the Commonwealth's corporation power could only regulate the activities of the corporations with respect to guns. Although such a policy might deal with a large portion of manufacturers and distributors, it would not apply to individuals, and would therefore create anomalies and could be easily circumvented. New South Wales Commonwealth matter. Victoria This is a Commonwealth responsibility. Queensland Federal Government responsibility 1993: no change recorded Western Australia The working party committee is discussing the formation of a national gun control system by a computerised firearm registry. Northern Territory Does not involve Territory legislation. Australian Capital Territory The ACT Government supports the recommendation noting that this is a matter for the Federal Government. Recommendation 57. State and Territory Governments should undertake the following action: Recommendation 57.1 Prohibition of all automatic long arms and certain types of ammunition. New South Wales NSW gun laws have prohibited automatic long arms since 1973. There is no restriction on types of ammunition available, but various types of ammunition have been banned by the Commonwealth from import. In addition, a purchaser of ammunition is only able to purchase ammunition of the calibre which is suitable to the firearm covered by his licence. Victoria Automatic .long arms (machine guns) and certain types of ammunition are prohibited in Victoria under section 32(1) and 32(6) of the Firearlns Act 1958. Queensland All automatic long anus are prohibited. Certain types of ammunition are prohibited or restricted. 1993: no change recorded Western Australia In WA legislation is in existence prohibiting these types of firearms. South Australia The Police Department agrees with the prohibition of all fully automatic fireanus. However, upon the recommendation of the Select Committee, the yet to be proclaimed Firearms Act Amendment Act 1988 will allow any dealer to possess and deal in fully automatic fireanns and allow a person holding an appropriate firearms licence to possess such firearms. The Government will need to legislate to restrict the possession of fully automatic firearms. The prohibition of certain types of ammunition is currently addressed under the Explosives Act but will inÂ· the near future be included in the amendments to the Dangerous Substances legislation. Tasmania The Guns Act 1991 prohibits fully-automatic longarms and restricts their possession to those persons who are genuine collectors. The Act contains no provisions pr.ohibiting certain types ammunition. Northern Territory This Recommendation needs further clarification. The word 'automatic' is sometimes ambiguous. If it means 'fully automatic' then the present Northern Territory Firearms Act covers this. If it means 'semi-automatic' then the new Firearms Act does not go as far as recommended. Semi automatic rilles are highly restricted, but not prohibited. However, the recommendation goes beyond rilles and includes shot guns. Semi automatic shot guns are not often seen in criminal activities. Any move to restrict them would be very strongly opposed by interest groups. The new Firearms Act removes numerous loopholes in the restriction of 'D' class firearms, for example, semi-automatic rilles. Also note that ammunition is restricted under the Dangerous Goods Act. The Recommendation does not make it clear what types of ammunition are to be prohibited. Australian Capital Territory The ACT Government supports the recommendation. The Weapons Act 1991 has the effect of prohibiting all.automatic weapons not merely long arms. The Act also limits the possession and use of grip weapons with the effect that such weapons will only be acceptable for use by current owners for competition shooting purposes and will be phased out over time. The Act also prohibits the sale of any ammunition which is suitable only for such weapons. Recommendation 57.2 Restriction of semi-automatic long arms to IlllliÂ· vi duals with a specific need. New South Wales Under the new NSW gun laws introduced on 1 May 1992, there is a progressive ban on the p.ossession of military style self-loading centre-fire niles so that, by 30 June 1997, possession of these weapons will be totally banned, unless a permit is obtained or unless the owner is a primary producer and the magazine has been modified so as to hold no more than five rounds. There is also a progressive ban on the possession of self-loading centre-fire rilles and self-loading shotguns with a magazine capacity of more than five rounds so that, by 30 June 1994, possession of these weapons will be totally banned, unless a permit is obtained. An applicant for a firearm licence must show that he has a genuine need for the type of firearms covered by the licence applied for. A <?ommi-sio.ne-'s Prohibited Firearn- Permit may be Issued In limited cases for profeSSIOnal hunting or target shooting using a semi-automatic rille with of a magazine capacity of more than five rounds. Victoria Centre fire semi-automatic weapons continue to be prohibited in Victoria, except on the authority of the Register of Firearms issued on a case by case basis. Such permission is only given to individuals who demonstrate a specific need for the use of such weapons [section 32 and 50(3) of the Firearms Act 1958]. Rim fire semi-automatic rilles continue to be permitted. Queensland Semi-automatic long arms in Queensland are covered in Schedule 3 of the Weapons Act and as such are not restricted. The Australian Police Ministers Council will discuss this matter. 1993: no change recorded South Australia Included in the Firearms Act Amendment Act 1988 and proposed amendments to the regulations. This will occur through the inclusion of purpose of use on the licence and the approval to purchase each firearm. Tasmania pistol 1991: The Tasmanian Government has announced that it will be imposing restrictions on the possession of military or military style semi-automatic centre-fire firearms. To this end it will be moving an amendment to the Bill in the Legislative Council to enable the Minister by order to prohibit certain types of semi-automatic firearms. This amendment will provide that no person can possess a prohibited gun unless they have authorisation. The amendments will provide that in future only active members of military rifle clubs and collectors will be able to possess these prohibited guns. It should be pointed out that it is intended only to prohibit military or military style semiautomatic centre-fire firearms. It is not intended to impose any restrictions on sporting semi-automatics unless they are fitted with a detachable magazine which is capable of taking more than five rounds. 1993: Fully automatic firearms require a permit. They may only be used as a collectors item. The Minister may declare other firearms to be prohibited under Section 4 of the Guns Act 1991. This gives the Government control on the types of firearms available to the community. Northern Territory This is the thrust of the present Firearms Act and policy. The new Firearms Act considerably tightens up this area. Australian Capital Territory The ACT Government supports the recommendation and has implemented it. The granting of a licence in the ACT is conditional upon the applicant meeting certain criteria, one of which is that the applicant requires the weapon for an approved purpose. The sale of military style self-loading (or semiautomatic) rifles are banned. There are no specific restrictions on non-military style self-loading firearms. However, a licensee needs to be able to show that such Ii weapon is appropriate for the approved purpose for which his or her licence was granted. Recommendation 57.3 Restriction of sales of ammunition by licensed gun shops only, to licensed individuals only, for personapproved al use of a specific firearm. New South Wales NSW gun laws restrict the sale of ammunition to licensed firearms dealers (except in a limited number of isolated rural areas where some general stores are permitted to sell ammunition). A purchaser of ammunition must be the holder of a current firearms licence. Victoria The purchase and sale of ammunition in Victoria continues to be prohibited except by persons licensed to sell ammunition to persons who hold a shooter's licence or permit [section 27C of the Firearms Act 1958]. Queensland . Sale of ammunition is governed by the Explosives Act, and is administered by the Minister for Resource Industries. 1993: no change recorded Western Australia Individuals can only purchase ammunition for firearms they have a licence for, from licensed dealers. South Australia Controls regarding the acquisition of ammunition have been included in the Firearms Act Amendment Act 1988. Tasmania The Guns Act 1991 does not restrict the sale of ammunition to those persons who are licensed gun shops. However, the Act does provide that ammunition can only be sold to persons holding a gun licence. . Northern Territory Ammunition is regulated by the Dangerous Goods Act. Sellers and purchasers both require licences. Further restrictions, for example, restricting use of ammunition to a particular firearm and shooter would be a great inconvenience and would, in any case, be largely unenforceable. Australian Capital Territory The ACT Government supports the restriction of sales of ammunition as outlined below. The Weapons Act provides for the sale of ammunition by a licensed dealer only to a person who holds a dangerous weapons licence and for use only in a weapon of a kind registered or endorsed on that licence, to a person who is a collector of ammunition or to an interstate person whom the . dealer reasonably believes is not prevented from having such ammunition by the law of hisfher home State or Territory However, the Act also enables the member of an club, authorised in writing by the club, to sell ammunition. Such sales can only be made on the club's premises; made to' club members or persons participating in competition shooting at the premises (such as interstate competitors); and of ammunition capable of being discharged from a weapon registered or endorsed on the member's licence or from a dangerous weapon being used by a non-member competing on the premises. Recommendation 57.4 Registration: All firearms should be registered in a computerised national firearms registry. New South Wales Registration of all firearms would result in the keeping of extensive records which would be of little or no assistance to police officers in the perfonnance of their duties. Registration would also result in a high level of non-compliance. NSW gun laws require the registration of all pistols. Victoria In Victoria, all firearms are required to be registered under section 22AA of the Firearms Act 1958. The firearms data base in Victoria is computerised. Victoria continues to maintain the computerised database of all fireanns. Queensland This matter is to be discussed at the Australian Police Ministers Conference on 23 October. This initiative is not opposed if it is cost neutral. 1993: no change recorded Western Australia The WA firearms branch supports this recommendation. Discussions are currently being undertaken to ,implement such a registry, but it has not gone ahead yet for resource reasons. South Australia South Australia has a computerised firearms registry which could be accessed on a national basis. No consideration has been given to the financial implications involved as it is not known what fonnat will be used for a national registry. Tasmania The Act provides registration for pistols. There is no registration of longarms. Only the user is licensed. Northern Territory Northern Territory Police have their own computerised registry and would support any moves for a national firearms registry similar to the present national computer fingerprint registry. This is probably a matter for discussion at a meeting of the Australian Police Ministers' Council. Australian Capital Territory The ACT Government supports the recommendation but notes that its implementation requires the agreement of other States and the Northern Territory. The ACT has a Register of Weapons which contains specified information on licensees and their weapons. The Weapons Act requires the establishment of a Register of Weapons containing a specified range of information on licensees and their weapons. Recommendation 57.5 Licensing: ownership or possession of a fireann to be restricted to those possessing a valid licence. The prerequisites for obtaining a shooter's licence should be those in existing legislation, together with the following: (a) must be over the age of eighteen years; (b) limited to fit and proper persons with good reason; (c) a twenty-eight day cooling-off period between application and grant of the licence, during which time appropriate checks can be made; (d) training, competence and safety. consciousness must be demonstrated to the licensing authority; (e) hand gun licences should be restricted to authorised security personnel and members of pistol clubs, with weapons stored on premises. New South Wales (a) NSW gun laws require that an applicant for a firearms licence must be 18 years of age or older. However, it is possible for a person aged between 10 years and 17 years of age to obtain a Minor's pennit which allows the holder of the pennit to use a fireann under the supervision of a licensed person. (b) NSW gun laws require that an applicant show 'genuine reason'. (c) NSW gun laws require a cooling-off period of 28. days for the issue of a fireanns licence. During this period checks are made on the criminal history of the applicant and the previous licensing history of the applicant. If the applicant has an adverse history (eg if he has been subject to an Apprehended Violence Order in the ten years prior to the application for a fitearms licence), the application is refused. (d) NSW gun laws require that an applicant successfully complete the NSW Fireanns Safety Awareness Course. This course does not, however, require an applicant physically to demonstrate his competence in using a firearm. Unfortunately, the resources needed to allow for a physical test are too great. (e) NSW gun laws specify the following types of pistol licences: business pistol licences; Government pistol licences; club pistol licences; target pistol licences; scientific pistol licences; blank fire pistol licences; and pistol collector licences. The category of personal pistol licence was deleted when the new gun laws came into effect on I May 1992. Although there is no requirement for pistols used by pistol club members to be stored on the premises, owners of pistols must store them securely in a locked metal cabinet or, if there are more than five pistols, in a safe. Holders of business pistol licences must store their pistols at the adc\ress to which the licence relates (usually the place of business). Storage of pistols is checked once each year. See also comment on recommendation 57.6. Victoria All the listed proposed prerequisites for obtaining a shooter's licence apply in Victoria [sections 22AA(2) and (2A)]. InÂ· the case of hand guns, weapons in some circumstances may be stored at the licensee's home, under prescribed security conditions [section 22(2b) and (3A)]. The restrictions in Recommendations 57.5 paras (a) to (e) are contained in section 22AA of the VictoriThe an Firearms Act 1958. Pistols may in some circumstances be stored at the licensee's home, under prescribed security conditions [section 22AA(2b) and 22AA(3A)]. Queensland Queensland has implemented all of the measures outlined in this recommendation. The Department of Employment, Vocational Education, Training and Industrial Relations (DEVETlR) has begun negotiations with relevant organisations to develop a training program to support proposed gun laws. The program will have elements covering:Use of firearms; Security personnel's use of firearms; Firearm owner responsibilities; Firearm dealer responsibilities. 1993: no change recorded Western Australia (a) In WA existing legislation requires that a person must be 16 years or over to obtain a firearms licence and 18 years or over for a concealable weapon (b) Legislation is in existence covering this recommendation (c) The committee is discussing this recommendation (d) Pistol clubs provide training and individuals must meet the criteria to satisfy the firearms branch before a licence is issued (e) Concealable weapons are restricted to members of Pistol clubs. Individuals who require concealable weapons for personal use are only granted on exceptional good reasons and restrictions placed on them. South Australia The age, whether someone is a fit and proper person with good reason, and a cooling-off period have been included in the Firearms Act Amendment Act 1988. The cooling-off period of one month is from the issue of the licence to the granting of a permit to purchase a firearm. The training prerequisite is included in the proposed Regulation, The Police Department is of the opinion the restriction of hand gun licences should include other persons who have good justification, such as veterinary surgeons and genuine collectors, as well as security personnel and members of pistol clubs. The Police Department does not support the storage of hand guns on pistol club premises, which are usually remote and unattended. Tasmania Guns Act provides that those persons wishing to own or possess a firearm must possess a gun licence. The prerequisites for obtaining a gun licence are as follows: 1. Must be over eighteen years of age. 2. Limited to fit and proper persons. An application does not have to have a good reason to possess a firearm. 3. A twenty-one day cooling off period between application and grant of licence to enable appropriate checks to be made. 4. Safety training and testing for those persons who wish to possess or own a firearm for the first time. Existing gun owners do not have to attend these safety training courses. 5. The possession of hand guns is to be restricted to security personnel, members of pistol clubs and those persons who can satisfy the Commissioner of Police that they need such a pistol for protection of life or property. These pistols do not have to be stored at pistol club premises. Northern Territory Included in the new Firearms Act is the requirement to be over the age of eighteen. The 'fit and proper' requirement is included in the present Firearms Act and the new Firearms Act. However, 'sufficient reason' is required for licences in respect of firearms classes 'C' (pistols) and 'D' (firearms not normally permitted in the Northern Territory. Should this be extended to classes 'A' (rifles, shot-guns and air rifles, not including semiautomatic) and 'B' (all other rifles and shot-guns that are semi-automatic, and centre fire rifles), as the National Committee on Violence recommends, then a decision has to be made as to what constitutes 'sufficient reason'. Further, what scrutiny will such reasons be subjected to? Finally, where will the personnel come from to make all of the necessary inquiries? The new Firearms Act, provides a cooling off period of fourteen days. The new Firearms Ac;:t deals with this but may not go as far as the National Committee on Violence (NCV) recommends. The NCV wants 'demonstration' of training etc., whereas the Bill requires the Commissioner to be 'satisfied' that training etc. is adequate. Recommendation (e) appears to fail to take into account the nature of many businesses in the Territory. Subject to being fit and proper etc., the following occupations are routinely issued pistol licences in the Northern Territory: Police; professional fishermen; cattle station staff; cattle truck drivers; aircraft pilots; crocodile farm staff; and tour and safari guides, as well as the two classes person recommended by the NCV. The Recommendation that pistols be 'stored on the premises' is also of dubious merit. The intention appears to be that pistols be kept at the place where they may be lawfully used, so as to reduce the possibility that they will be used in a domestic violence situation. Balanced against that is the fact that such 'premises' will be unattended for most nights and some days, leaving the pistols at risk of theft. Given that licensees are subject to considerable scrutiny, it may be preferable to allow pistols to be kept in owners' homes. Australian Capital Territory The ACf Government supports the recommendation with the qualifications outlined below. (a) must be over the age of eighteen years; The Weapons Act acknowledges that a person under 18 may be licensed for a dangerous weapon if he or she is a member of an approved club and competes in shooting competitions. However, such a person must also meet the other criteria which apply to licensees generally, for example, be fit and proper, have completed a course in safe handling of weapons etc. In effect, a minor can only ever possess and use a weapon registered or endorsed on his or her licence while on a club shooting range and under the immediate supervision of an authorised instructor or while taking part in a shooting competition conducted by his or her club. On all other occasions the weapon must be in the possession of the club's armourer or other licensed adult person on whose licence the weapon is registered or endorsed. Special provision is made for the conveyance of an underage licensee and his or her weapon to or from the club. However, it should be noted that the Act specifies no minimum age for possession and use of a weapon. It is considered that the powers of the Registrar are adequate to enable him or her to refuse a licence to a young person having regard to such factors as age, level of maturity, physical capacity to handle and fire a weapon etc. Such refusals (or indeed, any grant) are appealable to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Under the requirements of the Weapons Act 1991, the Registrar of Weapons has determined 'Guide-lines for the Security of Premises and for the Storage of Weapons' for which the penalty for non-compliance without reasonable excuse is a fine of $2000. (b) limited to fit and proper persons with good reason; The Act specifies that one of the matters of which the Registrar has to be satisfied before granting a dangerous weapons licence is that the applicant is of a fit and proper person to hold suchÂ· a licence. Another matter is that the applicant requires a dangerous weapon for an approved reason. The Act specifies a number of circumstances to which the Registrar must have regard in determining whether the applicant is a fit and proper person. These include whether the applicant has within the previous eight years been subject to a recognisance to keep the peace or be of good behaviour, is the subject of an interim protection order under the Domestic Violence Act 1986 or within the previous eight years has been the subject of a protection order under that Act, or is the subject of an interim restraining order under the Magistrates Court Act 1930 or within the previous eight years has been the subject of a restraining order under that Act. These circumstances are not exhaustive of the matters which the Registrar can consider in deciding whether a person is fit and proper. He or she can consider any other relevant matter. For example, the Registrar may consider the physical fitness of the applicant, whether the applicant suffers form any mental or emotional instability or if the applicant is adversely affected by drugs or alcohol. (c) a twenty-eight day cooling-off period between application and grant of the licence, during which time appropriate checks can be made; The granting of a licence entitles the licensee to a weapon of a kind which is appropriate for his or her stated reason for requiring the licence: in other words; a licence does not entitle a person to acquire any firearm, only a firearm of a type approved by the Registrar as necessary for the approved purpose for which the licence was granted. The Act creates an offence if a person acquires a first weapon within 28 days after the grant of the licence and where a person sells or gives a weapon to a licensee within 28 days of him or her obtaining the licence. There is not considered to be any impediment in the Act to adequate checks being made on applicants. (d) training, competence and safety consciouSness must be demonstrated to the licensing authority; The Act requires the Registrar to be satisfied that an applicant has satisfactorily completed an approved course or otherwise have adequate training and experience in the safe handling of weapons before granting a licence. Further, provisions relating to registering a weapon and endorsing a weapon each require the applicant to have good knowledge of safety practices relating to the type of weapon to which the application relates. (e) hand gun licences should be restricted to authorised security personnel and members of pistol clubs, with weapons stored on premises. The Act authorises a licensee only to acquire a weapon of a kind approved by the Registrar as necessary for the approved purpose for which the licence was granted. Thus a hand gun can only ever be acquired by a licensee who specified security or competition pistol shooting purposes in his or her application for a licence. The Act does not require hand guns to be stored on the premises. The reasons for this are that it wouldinvolve unjustifiable expense and resources in administering the requirement especially for clubs which are amateur in nature and are not profit making; be met with widespread opposition by sporting pistol shooters; and make club premises in particular the target for gun theft. Recommendation 57.6 Security: mandatory measures to be introduced for the safe-keeping of all weapons in the inoperable condition in secure storage, both by individuals and businesses, with appropriate penalties for non-compliance. New South Wales NSW gun laws require that all firearms which are not actually in use or about to be used be properly secured by ensuring that: the bolt or firing mechanism is stored separately from the balance of the firearm except where it is unable to be separated; and ammunition is stored separately; OR, the firearm and ammunition is kept in secure storage of a standard approved by the Commissioner of Police (ie. in a locked metal container). If is found that these requirements have not been met, police seize the firearms concerned and suspend the firearms licence or permit. If the offence of unsafe storage is proved, the firearms concerned are destroyed. Victoria In Victoria all firearms are required to be stored prescribed secure conditions [section 22AA(2)(e) Firearms Act 1958]. A shooter's licence may only be issued in Victoria if the Registrar of Firearms is satisfied that the applicant will ensure that firearms and ammunition are securely stored separately in locked cupboards, containers or similar repositories [section 22AA]. The intent of the recommendation, that is that weapons be stored in an inoperable condition is met by section 22AA(10) which requires that weapons and ammunition be stored in separate locked containers. Queensland The Weapons Act stipulates minimum security requirements and imposes penalties for non-compliance. 1993: no change recorded Western Australia This recommendation is being addressed. South Australia Stricter security requirements are included in the proposed Regulations Tasmania The Guns Act requires mandatory measures for safekeeping of all weapons in secure storage, both by individuals and businesses with appropriate penalties for non-compliance. The major penalty is the revocation of a licence. Northern Territory The new Firearms Act requires security of premises. There is no requirement in the Bill to keep firearms in an inoperable condition. If this were to be added, would merely being unloaded amount to 'inoperable'? In any case, this could only be enforced on very rare occasions. Australian Capital Territory The ACT Government supports the recommenda"" tion. The Weapons Act creates an offence, punishable by a fine of $2000 or twelve months imprisonment, or both, where a person keeps a weapon otherwise than in an unloaded condition and in a locked container or under such other conditions as are necessary to. prevent another person having access without permission. Recommendation 57.7 Seizure: in the event of a licensed owner giving it reason to believe that he/she is no longer a fit and proper person, for example by using the weapon in a threatening way, there should be provision for mandatory seizure of all firearms in hisfher possession. New South Wales . NSW gun laws provide that any police officer may in suspend a firearms licence for 28 days if the officer considers that there may be grounds for revoking the licence. During the period of suspension, fireanns 'in the possession of the licence seized. From 1 May 1992, NSW gun lawspr-vide that'a police officer must suspend a firearms licence held by a person who has c,?m"":litted or is all--ed to have committed domestIC vIOlence. In addItIOn, a police officer must seize all firearms at the sce-e of domestic violence or threatened domestic violence. Any person subject to an Apprehended Violence Order is not able to obtain a firearms licence for ten years following the date of the Order. Victoria The Registrar may cancel the licence of any person who has been proven to be unsuitable to possess a fireann (section 22AA(9) Firearms Act 1958). Section 38 and 39 allow any member of the police force to obtain a warrant to search premises or may search a person or vehicle for a then unlicensed fireann. The Crimes (Family Violence) Act 1987 requires that a member of the police f-rce who is satisfied that there are grounds for the Issue of an Intervention Order and is aware of the presence of firearms to search and seize any firearms belong0; ing to in the possession of perpetrators of family violence of which the member is aware. Queensland The Weapons Act allows for the revocation of licences and the seizure of weapons if they are misused. 1993: no change recorded Western Australia Firearms are seized from persons who are no longer a fit and proper person or are using the weapon in a threatening way and are held till enquiries are completed. South Australia This is included in the current Act. However, there is a need to amend the Act to permit the Registrar to suspect a licence pending court or ca.ncellation proceedings, otherwise the unfit person can legally go out and buy or borrow other firearms. A - ubm-Â­ sion was recently forwarded to you seeking thIS authority. Tasmania The Guns Act enables the Commissioner of Police at any time to cancel a gun licence where the Commissioner is of the view that the holder of the licence is no longer a fit and proper person. In these circumstances the former licence holder must hand in hisjher firearms and the Police have the power to seize those fireanns if this is not done. Northern Territory The new Firearms Act provides for this recommendation holder are Australian Capital Territory The ACT Government supports the recommendation. The Act provides entry, search and seizure p-wers which are considered to be adequate to enable the seizure of weapons in circumstances of the kind envisaged by the Committee. The provisions reflect current criminal law policy and are, at the same time, mindful of the rights and liberties of individuals. In addition to the Weapons Act, recent amendments to the Domestic Violence Act 1986 and the Magistrates Court Act 1930 enable the Court to order the seizure of the weapons of a person against whom a domestic violence protection order or interim protection order or restraining order or interim restraining order is made. Further, the amendments to the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) which are included in the Weapons (Consequential Amendments) Act 1991. make it clear .that a police officer who enters premIses under sections 349A, 349B or 349C of that Act may seize a firearm where there are reasonable grounds for believing it is necessary to prevent an offence or the repetition of an offence or of a breach of the peace or to protect life or property. Recommendation 57.8 Restrictions on private sales: all sales of fireanns, including second hand sales, be made t-ough licensed gun dealers, and any change of regIstered owner should be notified through the proposed registration mechanisms referred to in (57.4) above. New South Wales NSW gun laws require that both the seller and the purchaser of a firearm must be licensed to possess firearms and that both the seller and the purchaser must ch-ck that the other party is in fact the holder of a current licence. NSW gun laws also require that firearms dealers keep a record of sales made and that dealers regularly submit details of all sales to the NSW Police Service. Victoria All sales of firearms in Victoria must be made through licensed gun dealers, except when witnessed by the Firearms Registrar or another authorised member of the Police Force (section 28D Firearms Act 1958).' All changes or registration must be notified to the Registrar of Firearms (section 28D) and are recorded on the firearms registration database. Queensland' It is not proposed to restrict private sales oth-r than to require that weapons can only be supplied or sold to licensed or authorised people. 1993: no change recorded Western Australia Firearms are sold both privately and by licensed general dealers and records adjusted accordingly through registration. South Australia The purchase and sale of. all fireanns through licensed firearm dealers has merit. However, due to the distance of many areas in this.State from a licensed dealer, this recommendation would not be practical. Tasmania The Guns Act provides for firearms sales, but only between two licensed persons. One cannot sel1 or lend a firearm to another person who is not licensed under the Act. Northern Territory Change of ownership is dealt with under the present Firearms Act and in the new Firearms Act. There is no proposal to prohibit private sales. To require allÂ· sales to be through dealers would put dealers in a remarkably privileged position. The report does not explain what purpose would be served by such a requirement. Australian Capital Territory The ACT Government supports the recommendation with the qualifications outlined below. The Weapons Act does not prohibit, private sales although controls are placed on such sales (and other means of transferring ownership such as giving by way of gift, lending etc). The Act creates an offence punishable by a fine of $5 000. or imprisonment for two years, or both, where a person sells or gives a weapon to another person who is not licensed or sells etc a weapon of a kind for which the purchaser is not licensed. A licensee is required to notify the Registrar within 7 days of the disposal of a weapon. A licensed dealer is required to enter the details of sales in Dealer's Book and to provide quarterly returns to the Registrar regarding sales. Recommendation 57.9 Amnesties: a pennanent amnesty for the surrender of unauthorised firearms should be implemented, with conditions similar to those provided in the temporary amnesties which have been introduced from time to time in variousjurisdictions. Commonwealth The Australian Federal Police (AFP) cOlnment that following the report of the National Committee on Violence, it has been recommended to the Australian Capital Territory Government that the Weapons Bill should provide a pennanent amnesty. New South Wales While limited-time amnesties are usual ways to encourage gun owners to hand in firearms which are no longer wanted, a permanent amneSty could provide a defence for a person who is found to have prohibited weapons. NSW has co-operated in nation-wide amnesties. . FoIlowing the introduction of NSW's new guillaws on 1 May 1992, the NSW Government has introduced a compensation scheme in respect of fire-arms whose possession has been ,made illegal under the new laws. NSW looks to the Commonwealth to assist in meeting the cost of the compensation paid. Victoria Victoria has had fireanns amnesties from time to time. There is not a pennanent amnesty in force in Victoria. Queensland The Weapons Act allows for a pennanent amnesty. 1993: no change recorded South Australia This is the current police and practice of the Police DepartmenUn this State. Tasmania The Guns Act contains a provision for a pennanent amnesty for the surrender of unauthorised firearms. Northern Territory This proposal has merit but is not provided for in the new NT Firearms Act because there are considerable legal and evidentiary problems with such a proposal. Australian Capital Territory The ACT Government supports. the principle of temporary amnesties rather than pennanent amnesties and has imposed a temporary amnesty in the ACT for the surrender of unauthorised fireanns which extends until 31 December 1992. The Act empowers the Minister to specify an amnesty period, without any limit, during which no the proceedings will lie against a person in relation to the possession of a surrendered weapon. To provide a permanent amnesty, as recommended, would make the offence provisions in respect of possession purposeless. Mandatory Sentencing For Offences Committed With Firearms Recommendation 58. The use of a fireann in the commission of a crime ' should be regarded as an aggravating circumstance by sentencing authorities. Commonwealth In general the Commonwealth does not . have jurisdiction for offences likely to be committell with firearms. Penalties for Commonwealth offences are the maximum appropriate'for the most serious circumstances for the commission of that offence, which would include the possibility of the use of a firearm in the commission of an offence. Mandatory or minimum sentences are not consistent with Commonwealth policyfor setting sentences. Such sentences may lead to injustice as they do not allow the Court, which alone has before it all the circumstances of the commission of an offence, a discretion to award a sentence reflecting all those circumstances. New South Wales In New South Wales the use of a firearm in the commission of a criminal offence is regarded as an aggravating circumstance by the courts. Victoria A court imposing a penalty under subsection 3A of the Firearms Act 1958 must direct that the sentence not be served concurrently and must not make an order suspending the whole or any part of the sentence. A person who is guilty of an indictable offence in Victoria and who carried a firearm when committing the offence, is guilty of a further offence liable to a penalty of imprisonment for not more than five years for that further offence [section 23(3A)]. Queensland The Criminal Code already contains such sanction. 1993: no change recorded South Australia The Police Department agrees that the use of a firearm in the commission of a crime should be regarded as an aggravating circumstance by senten"" cing authorities. Tasmania The Guns Act creates two new crimes. Namely, carrying a gun with criminal intent and aggravated assault. Northern Territory The Criminal Code recognises weapons as an aggravating factor in relation to several offences. In any event, Courts usually recognise this as a circumstance of aggravation without specific statutory guidance. Australian Capital Territory The ACf Government supports the recommendation noting that the current position in the ACf embodies this principle. Recommendation 66. Police should have adequate powers to seize, and should in fact seize, any firearms or other weapons which may be present at the scene of an assault. Commonwealth This is a matter for State and Territory Governments. The Australian Federal Police (AFP) report that any weapons used in an assault would be seized as exhibits. That police be required to seize all weapons at the site of domestic violence, however, may not be reasonable, insofar as there are many items in the normal household-kitchen utensils, furniture, sporting equipment - which can be and have been used as weapons. Also refer to response to Recommendation 12. New South Wales The NSW Police Service has power to seize firearms in certain circumstances under s.357 of the Crimes Act 1900. Section 35 of the Firearms Act 1989 also gives police discretionary powers to suspend firearms licences and remove firearms. The new gun laws, which came into effect on 1 May 1992, include a provision which states that, when a police officer attends a domestic violence incident, .the police officer must inquire as to the presence of any firearms in the dwelling-house and if informed that there is a firearm or firearms must and take all such action as is reasonably practical to search for and seize the firearm or firearms' (s.357H(I)(al) of the Crimes Act). Victoria This power exists. Section 18A of the Crimes (Family Violence) Act 1987 requires police to seize any firearms of which the officer is aware the defendant is in possession of, where there are grounds for the issue of a family violence intervention order. There is no provision for the seizure of other weapons except as evidence of an offence having taken place. Queensland The newly amended Queensland legislation enables the seizure of firearms or other weapons where there is a concern over the safety of an aggrieved family member. Western Australia No change at this time 'in WA. Forms part of proposed legislation. South Australia Police powers to seize firearms are limited to section 32 of the Firearms Act 1977. and General Order 4520/3. Neither allows for the seizure of a firearm merely due to its presence at the scene of an assault. Other factors or considerations must be present prior to seizure. This is an area which is worthy of some attention. (1993) To complement the introduction of the Summary Procedures (Summary Protection Orders) Amendment Bill, proposals have been suggested to amend the existing firearms legislation. Included is a proposal to amend section 32 of the Firearms Act 1977, to add a new subsection whereby police may seize any firearm registered to or in the possession of a person, whom they suspect on reasonable grounds, is subject to an order pursuant to section 99 of the Summary Procedure Act 1921. Tasmania Police do in fact, seize firearms and other weapons which may be present at the scene of an assault. Police powers in this regard were further increased in October 1992. Northern Territory Currently, Police would seize any weapon used in an assault. There is however, no legislative power to seize any firearm not used, even though the firearm may be nearby. To implement this recommendation legislation allowing seizure has been provided in the NT Police Administration Act, which will commence on 1 January 1993 (in conjunction with the new Firearms Act). The new powers allow police officers to search premises, vehicles or vessels for firearms or offensive weapons if they believe on reasonable grounds that the firearms or offensive weapons could place a person in imminent danger or suffer personal injury or aggravate personal injury. Australian Capital Territory The ACT Government has made recent amendments to the Crimes Act 1990 in the form of the Crimes (Amendment) Act 1992 which give police the power to search premises or motor vehicles for concealed weapons at the scene of an assault. Recommendation 85. All governments should recognise and support: Recommendation 85.1 Uniform laws throughout Australia regarding the use of firearms and other lethal force by police. These laws should reflect the principle that lethal force should only be used as a last resort, involving self defence or the defence of others. Commonwealth On 22 May 1993 the Australasian Police Ministers' Council (APMC) considered a report from the Police Commissioners' Policy Advisory Group (PCPAG) on guidelines for police use of lethal force, which had been prepared in response to this recommendation. The guidelines were modelled, as far as possible, on the UN Guidelines 'Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials'. Where appropriate, however, prevailing local guidelines were preferred where their standard exceeded that adopted by the United Nations. The APMC resolved to adopt the guidelines as minimum national standards on the use of firearms and other lethal force by police. They form the basis of operational instructions for individual police jurisdictions throughout the country. These minimum guidelines are able to be built on if necessary by individual jurisdictions in their administrative and operational procedures. National Guidelines for the Use of Lethal Force by Police The following guidelines are a minimum national standard for the use of lethal force by police. General principles Pursuant to their responsibilities, police officers will only resort to the use of force when strictly necessary and to the extent required for the performance of their duty. Police should use the minimal amount of force necessary to effect arrest and apprehension. Use of lethal force 1. Police officers will not use firearms against another person except in self-defence or the defence of others against the imminent threat of death or serious injury, to prevent the. perpetration of a particularly serious crime involving grave threat to life, to. arrest a person presenting such a danger and resisting their authority, or to prevent his or her escape, and only when less extreme means are insufficient to achieve these objectives. In any event, intentional lethal use of firearms may only be made when strictly unavoidable in order to protect life. 2:.! In the circumstances provided above police shall, where the circumstances permit: (a) identify themselves as police; (b) give a clear warning of their intent to use firearms; (c) ensure there is sufficient time for the warning to be observed before using firearms unless it would (i) unduly place police at risk; (ii) create a risk of death or serious harm to other persons; or (iii) be clearly inappropriate or pointless in the circumStances of the incident; (d) not fire warning shots. 3. When the use of lethal force is necessary, police will: (a) exercise restraint in such use and act in proportion to the seriousness of the offence and the legitimate objective to be achieved; (b) minimise damage and injury and respect and preserve human life; (c) ensure that assistance and medical aid are rendered to any injured or affected persons at the earliest possible opportunity; (d) ensure that a relative or close friend of the injured or affected person is notified at the earliest possible opportunity. 4. Police will report promptly to their superiors, in accordance with established procedures, all instances involving the use of lethal force causing death or injury. 5. Police may use lethal force (other than by use of firearms) in accordance with their training and with reasoned discretion. Training Police managemeht will provide ongoing training for all police officers in accordance with these guidelines. All training programs and operational procedures will be regularly reviewed and evaluated in the light of relevant incidents. Training will include special attention to human rights and ethical issues in the use of force, alternadefence tives including the peaceful settlement of conflict, the understanding of crowd behaviour, methods of persuasion, negotiation and mediation. Counselling Police management will ensure that stress counselling is available to all police involved in situations where firearms or force are used. Independent review Police management will ensure that the use of lethal force causing death or injury, is reviewable by independent processes appropriate to each jurisdiction. . It should also be carefully noted that a police officer will not be able to rely on a defence that he/she is only following superior orders, if it can be clearly shown that such orders were 'manifestly unlawful and the officer had a reasonable opportunity to refuse to follow it'. In any case, responsibility also rests on the superiors who gave the unlawful orders. New South Wales At its meeting on 22 May 1992 the Australasian Police Ministers Council resolved to adopt - uideÂ­ lines developed by the Police CommiSSIOners Policy Advisory Group on minimum national standards on the use of firearms and other lethal force by police. The general principles set out in the guidelines are: * Pursuant to their responsibilities, police officers will only resort to the use of force when strictly necessary and to the extent required for the performance of their duty; and, * Police should use the minimal amount of force necessary to effect arrest and apprehension. Victoria Victoria Police Force Instruction (Force Circular Memorandum 92-2-19), which regulates the use of firearms by police officers, reflects this recommendation. Queensland Uniform guidelines regarding the use of lethal force by police were endorsed by the Conference of Commissioners of Australasia and the South West Pacific Region. These guidelines have been distributed to Queensland Police. South Australia The use of firearms and force by police is strictly controlled by general orders and rigidly enforced by supervisors and senior police. Lethal force is only condoned as a last resort, involving self defence and defence of others. The criminal law Consolidation (Self defence) Amendment Act 1991 sets out the law on selfand reflects the principle that lethal force should only be used as a last resort, involving self defence and the defence of others. Tasmania Tasmania has introduced gun control legislation in the form of the Guns Act 1991, which replaced the Firearms Act 1932. This new legislation is not completely uniform with similar legislation in other states, nevertheless, the legislation exercises much more control over firearm ownership, sales and use than previous law. Northern Territory Section 28 of the Criminal Code governs the use of force which is likely to cause death or grievous harm and is consistent with this recommendation. Any move towards uniform laws of this nature would be strongly supported. Australian Capital Territory The ACT Government supports the recommendation and is aware that Ministers resolved at the Australian Police Ministers Council meeting on 22 May 1992 to adopt the guidelines developed by the Police Commissioners Policy Advisory Group as minimum national standards on the use of Firearms and other lethal police force. The Government support these guidelines noting the importance of jurisdictional uniformity in the use of firearms and other lethal force by police. The AFP Policy and Procedures on Police use of Force are consistent with this recommendation. Further, current policy and practices applying within the AFP generally meet or exceed the standards contained in the aforementioned guidelines. Recommendation 85.2 The provision of adequate resources (including funding) to ensure police receive adequate training in the use of firearms and non-lethal weapons. This training should also include non-violent restraint and conflict resolution strategies. Commonwealth The Commonwealth supports this recommendation. Australian Federal Police firearms training is designed not t:mly to provide members with firearms safety and use skills, but also, through the use of the latest training technology, enhance a members knowledge and decision making relating to when the use of lethal force is required. New South Wales The NSW Police Service's Police Recruit Education Program (PREP) provides detailed training to new police officers on the use of lethal force, with emphasis on the use of non-violent restraint techniques. Additionally, aU operational police attend refresher courses on both firearm use and nonviolent restraint techniques. Victoria A Firearms and Operational Survival Training Unit was established by Victoria Police with funding provided in the 1990-1991 State Budget. The Unit continues to operate within Victoria Police. Queensland Training for new recruits to the Queensland Police Service now includes tertiary level studies through the Queensland University of Technology (QUT) and Griffith University. Mediation, human relations and conflict resolution skills are core elements of that training. In addition significant training in violent restraint and firearm use is provided through the Police Academy. Ongoing in-service professional development for police officers is currently under review with a new curriculum in the formative stage. This will also include detailed non-violent approaches to conflict resolution and regular firearm training. Tasmania Police training in the use of firearms has recently been the subject of a total review and upgrading. New procedures have now been implemented although non-lethal weapons have. not been addressed. Northern Territory The matter of firearm training is presently under review in the NT. A project is currently underway which intends, as one of its aims, to completely review the NT Police firearms training standard. As a consequence a new standard will be adopted, probably before the commencement of the 1993-94 financial year. Training will then commence to this standard as soon as practicable. Non-lethal weapon restraint training has been regularly taught as part of recruit training over the past nine years. In mid-1990 an instructor cadre in this subject involving six police members received specialist training. These members are used for continued recruit training and also to form a future regional training nucleus for regular retraining of operational members. Australian Capital Territory The ACT Government supports the recommendation noting that jurisdictional uniformity amongst law enforcement agencies is difficult to obtain and that the matter is to be considered by the Australian Police Ministers' Council. The AFP's policy and procedures on police use of force are covered by AFP General Orders andÂ· General Instructions. These policies are consistent with the recommendation. Recommendation 85.3 A requirement that wherever practical, a Coroner personally attends the scene of any fatality involving the use of lethal force by police. New South Wales In the event of a death occurring as a result of the use of lethal force by police, the practice is that the Duty Operations Inspector at Police Headquarters would notify, as quickly as possible, the State Coroner and the Coronial Investigation Unit (on secondment to the Attorney General's Department); or, if the State Coroner could not be contacted, the Deputy State Coroner. Whether or not the State Coroner or Deputy State Coroner would attend the scene where the fatality occurred, shortly after nonnotification, would depend on the circumstances of each case. In Â·particular, it would depend on whether it is likely that an indictable charge may be laid, as the Coroner does not become involved if an indictable charge has been laid in connection with a death. Victoria Victoria Police Force Instructions (Operating Procedures Manual, chapter 9) requires the State Coroner to be notified in such cases. In practice, the Coroner attends personally, all scenes of fatalities involving the use by police of lethal force. Queensland Within the Queensland Police Service, the Professional Standards Unit (Internal Investigations) and the Homicide Squad are required to investigate where a fatality occurs as a result of lethal force used by police. Under current law, the Criminal Justice Commission has the authority to take responsibility for, or overview police investigations of fatal incidents involving police. Such incidents would eventually be subject to a coroner's inquiry. It is noted that a review of the Coroner's Act is currently underway and new policy and procedures are likely to emerge from that process. South Australia At present there is no such policy for the coroner to personally attend the scene of a fatality involving the use of lethal force by police, nor has any need been identified previously for such a policy. Tasmania Coroners currently attend fatalities involving the use of lethal force by police. Northern Territory Whilst this recommendation is supported in principle, this matter will need to be reviewed by the Department of Law, particularly having regard to the resource implications that may follow. Australian Capital Territory The ACT Government supports the recommendation. This is normal practice in the ACT. Recommendation 85.4 The provision of funding for the development and deployment of non-lethal incapacitating weapons for use in appropriate situations, bearing in mind the desirability of eventually excluding the use of all weapons capable of causing death or serious injury to persons. The development and deployment of non-lethal weapons should be carefully evaluated, to ensure they minimise the risk of injury to bystanders, suspects, and police. Commonwealth The Commonwealth will ask the National Police Research Unit (NPRU) to evaluate the possibility of greater use of non-lethal weapons. The NPRU is currently working on the development of national minimum standards for police firearms training. These standards will cover training on the use of non-lethal weapons. The Australian Federal Police (AFP) only deploys weapons after thorough evaluation. The NPRU also undertakes equipment evaluation on behalf of all Australian police forces. The CQmmonwealth provides a third of the funding for the NPRU. At the Commonwealth level, policy and procedures on police use of force are covered by AFP General Orders and General Instructions. The Australian Capital Territory Region is of course covered by these policies, which adequately cover these issues. New South Wales The National Police Research Unit Board of Control approved a project to examine present standards of firearms training with a view to developing recommended minimum national standards in relation to the validation and accreditation of firearms training and use of other weapons including non-lethal weapons. This project is progressing in three phases with the phase I considering a standardised approach to firearms training and the development of national competency standards. Phase II will report on safety and judgemental aspects of firearms handling whilst Phase III is planned to address the question of non-lethal weapons. It is expected that Phase III will commence in October 1993 with a report being presented to the Board of Control in March 1994. Victoria The National Police Research Unit, Victoria Police Firearms and Operational Survival Training Unit have been discussing research into non-lethal weapons. The Victoria Police Force Firearms and Operational Survival Training Unit is also currently undertaking research into non-lethal weapons. Queensland The National Police Research Unit is undertaking a study of non-lethal incapacitating weapons. South Australia In regard to the level of funding or other commitment to provide for the development and deployment of non-lethal incapacitating weapons (batons or handcuffs for example), the South Australia Police Department does not have any set specific funding for the development and deployment of non-lethal weapons. The purchase of such weapons is on a needs basis, and training in the use of such is part of normal training procedures. The Department, from time to time, evaluates such weapons as part of normal departmental procedures. Tasmania Tasmanian Police supports, in principle, the concept of non-lethal weapons capable of incapacitating rather than causing death or serious injury. Northern Territory The Northern Territory Police rely upon evaluations carried out by the National Police Research Unit and the larger Australian Police Forces. Such weapons would not be deployed until they have been fully evaluated. Australian Capital Territory The ACT Government supports in principle the concept of non-lethal incapacitating weapons subject to rigorous evaluation. The development of such weapons is not a cost effective enterprise for the AFP particularly in relation to the ACT. The AFP deploys weapons only after thorough evaluation drawing on the experience of other police forces within Australia and overseas. Recommendation 86. All police administrators should: Recommendation 86.1 Adopt and implement rules and regulations strictly limiting the use of force and firearms. These should emphasise the principle that the. use of force and firearms by law enforcement personnel should be proportionate to the legitimate objectives to be achieved, and commensurate with due respect for human rights. In addition, wherever the use of force or firearms is unavoidable, law enforcement personnel should in all cases minimise damage, respect and preserve human life and ensure that assistance and medical aid is rendered to any injured or affected persons at the earliest possible moment. New South Wales NSW Police Commissioner's Instructions strictly regulate the use of force and firearms and require that medical aid be rendered as soon as possible. The notion that police should shoot to wound is rejected for, by having such an instruction, police would be more likely to use firearms. The Commissioner's Instructions essentially state that police are to shoot only if they have a justifiable belief that they or a member of the community is in imminent danger of being killed. See also the comment on recommendation 85.1. Victoria Police Standing Order 4.8 states that police are not to use unnecessary force, and the dignity of persons must be respected at all times. Queensland Instructions currently exist in relation to the use force by Queensland Police. A breach of these instructions may constitute a breach of discipline and can also amount to a criminal offence if force is used contrary to the provisions of the Criminal Code. South Australia As stated previously, the use of firearms and force by police is strictly controlled by general orders and rigidly enforced by supervisors and senior police. Emphasis is placed on the desirability of preserving and protecting life and using other means of resolution. In the event that firearms are used, guidelines clearly outline members' responsibilities to assist and ensure medical aid is rendered promptly. Tasmania Standing Orders currently exist restricting and limiting the use of force and firearms. Northern Territory Rules and regulations limiting the use of force and firearms are in place by virtue of legislation, specifically section 27, 28, 154 and 155 of the NT Criminal Code and Police General Orders. In the latter the legal implications on the use of firearms is explained and members must not use firearms in circumstances which are likely to kill or injure except in extreme circumstances. If a firearm is used in such circumstances, any action is the subject of a thorough, objective and independent investigation. In fact a member must report every instance when he or she discharges a firearm whilst on duty. The NT review being conducted on lethal IUld nonlethal weapons will address the issue of accountability in the use of force and weapons in general. Any final recommendations in this regard are likely to be additional to current arrangements in place rather than as a substitute for them. Recommendation 86.2 Develop and implement a code of conduct for law enforcement personnel which specifies that personnel may use force only when strictly necessary and to the extent required for the performance of their duty. New South Wales The National Police Working Party on Law Reform has recommended that the National Police Code of Ethics be amended by the inclusion of a penultimate paragraph in the following terms-'In the pursuit of their responsibilities police officers will resort to the use of force only when strictly necessary and to the extent required for the performance of their duty'. NSW Police Service supports the recommendation. Victoria of A code of conduct with respect to the use of force by police officers is contained in Force Circular Memorandum 92-2-19 (use of firearms) and Standing Order 4.8 (use of force). These documents are consistent with the recommendation. Refer also to response to recommendation 86.1. Queensland This recommendation has been included in the National Police Code of Ethics. South Australia General Order 3065/2.2 states that when a police officer is effecting an arrest, it should be 'executed with the minimum of force and that unnecessary use of force or restraint is avoided'. Further general orders deal specifically with the use of weapons, for example, batons and firearms. The South Australia Police Department would welcome and support a code of conduct Australia wide as to the use of force only when necessary as that is the attitude which is adopted within the South Australia Police Department. Tasmania See Recommendation 86.1. Northern Territory Besides legislation and General Orders members are expected to follow a Statement of Ethics promulgated by the Commissioner of Police which is consistent with the NT Police Mission Statement 'To Serve and Protect'. Recommendation 86.3 Keep the ethical issues associated with the use of force and firearms continuously under review. Commonwealth The Commonwealth supports this recommendation in principle and will investigate its feasibility Australian Polic.e Ministers Council. New South Wales The Office of Professional Responsibility within the NSW Police Service investigates every incident where firearms are used by police. Victoria The Victoria Police Firearms Operational Survival Training Unit is responsible for reviewing ethical issues associated with use of force and firearms. Queensland These issues are subject to continuous review. South Australia The South Australia Police Department has accepted, in principle, the United Nations resolution on the Code of Principles on 'Use of Force and Firearms by Law 'Enforcement Officials'. The South Australia Police Department was an active participant in research conducted by Professor Harding of the Western Australia University and endorsed the recommended principles 1-24. As a result Assistant Commissioner instituted an Advisory Committee on the use of firearms (PCO 4711/403303). This committee meets twice a year or when required. The Firearms Practice Review Committee reviews training procedures with the Firearms Practice Schedule implemented in 1988. Tasmania Ethical issues associated with the use of force and firearms are continually under review. Northern Territory Police executive and management carry out this recommendation in normal, administrative practice. The NT police review being conducted on lethal and non-lethal weapons will also address the issue of accountability in the use of force and weapons generally. Australian Capital Territory The ACT Government supports recommendations 86.1, 86.2 and 86.3 noting that the AFP is a Federal agency. Recommendation 86.4 Adopt a nationally agreed set of guidelines outlining standard operational procedures for police to be deployed in situations assessed as high risk; Commonwealth The Commonwealth supports this recommendation in principle and will investigate its feasibility at the Australian Police Ministers Council. New South Wales at the At its meeting on 20 November 1992 the Australasian Police Ministers Council resolved to endorse guidelines developed by the National Police Research Unit on the deployment of police in high risk situations. Victoria This recommendation was endorsed by the Australian Police Ministers Council in May 1991. The Australian Police Ministers Council adopted a set .of national guidelines outlining standard operational procedures for police to be deployed in situations assessed as high risk. These guidelines will be adopted on a State/Territory basis. Internal Operating Procedures for Victoria Police comply with those guidelines. Queensland This matter has been researched by the National Police Research Unit and draft guidelines have been circulated to all police jurisdictions for consideration. South Australia Set g1.)idelines are adopted by police attached to STAR Force, who are deployed in high risk situations. There are various such operational practices and procedures. These are not available for general transmission outside the South Australia Police Department, but may upon special request be made available. Tasmania Tasmania Police have recently undertaken a review of its procedures relating to deployment of police in high risk situations and new procedures have been formulated. Northern Territory The principles imposed in these recommendations are supported, though the difficulties involved in some aspects are recognised. Several provisions of the Criminal Code, specifically Sections 27, 28, 154 and 155 govern the use of force, and the members' actions would be the subject of close scrutiny. Police officers must not act in a manner which is not justified. National uniform guidelines for the development of police in high risk situations have been drafted by the National Police Research Unit. The NT police are cooperating in the process of formalising the guidelines. Australian Capital Territory The ACT Government Supports the recommendation' noting that it is an issue which is to be considered by the Australian Police Ministers Council. RecommendationÂ· 86.5 Conduct research on the desirability of psychological screening and on-going assessment'of members and prospective members of police special weapons and operational groups; , Commonwealth The Australian Federal Police carries out initial psychological screening of all new members and undertakes further psychological assessment of prospective Q1embers of special weapons and operational groups. New South Wales The State Protection Group, which is a unit within the NSW Police Service, responds to high risk situations. All members of the State Protection Group undergo a psychological assessment prior to entry into the unit The psychological assessment of each officer in the State Protection Group, both tactical members and negotiators, is reviewed annually. Victoria All applicants for specialist weapons groups undergo psychological assessment prior to acceptance into these squads. There is no formal program for ongoing assessment of members although the police psychologist is available for consultation by any member. In the event that a possible 'psychological problem' is identified, by senior officers in the group, the member is referred to the psychology unit for counselling. Queensland This screening process is currently being applied. South Australia Persons who desire to join STAR Force, where special weapons are used, undergo rigorous and extensive psychological screening. This type of assessment continues if a person joins STAR Force. Tasmania Psychological screening already exists in respect of prospective members of the Police Special Operations Group. Northern Territory No research has been conducted by the NT Police. However, prospective members of the NT Police Task Force undergo a three-day course to assess their suitability, including psychological suitability, prior to being transferred to the group. Ongoing assessment by supervisors and commissioned officers of members in the Task Force is routinely carried out as members perform duties assigned to them. This forum has examined, inter alia, police practice and procedures since 1989. The Task Force will continue to monitor and provide continuous ongoing evaluation of the domestic violence package, and this Department will continue to be receptive to any recommendations made by this groupAustralian Capital Territory The ACT Government supports the recommendation noting that screening is already provided for in selection processes in the Australian Federal Police. Recommendation 86.6 Develop national minimum standards relating to the validation and accreditation of firearms training and use of other weapons, including non-lethal weapons; Commonwealth The Commonwealth supports this recommendation in principle. This recommendation has been referred to the National Police Research Unit. New South Wales Police officers in the NSW Police Service receive extensive training in the use of their weapons. Any person wishing to apply for a NSW firearms licence must successfully complete the Firearms Safety Awareness Course. This course is validated by the NSW Police Service. It should be noted, however, 'that the course' tests knowledge of firearms safety, and does not provide training in the use of firearms. Victoria The Firearms Operational Survival Training Unit is responsible for firearms training. This Unit has accreditation to international standards; Queensland Currently under examination by the National Police Research Unit. Tasmania In Tasmania, as from 1 January 1993, all persons seeking new firearms licences will be required to undertake a Firearms Safety Awareness Course before a licence will be issued. Northern Territory The matter of firearm training is presently under review in the NT Police as a result of the introduction of a new firearm for issue to police officers. The review is because of the recommendation of the NT. Police Firearms Review Committee, and recommendations of a National Police Research Unit paper on the subject of national Police Firearms Training Standards. The final report on this subject from the NPRU has not been released to date, but the NT Police have commented on the final draft of the report. A project is presently under way which has as one of its aims to completely review the firearms training standard in light of both the NT police and NPRU reports. As a consequence a new stand-rd will be adopted, probably before the commencementof the 1993-94 financial lear. Training will then commence to this standar as soon as practicable. The issue of accreditation of members in the use of firearms is an integral part of the review process. Non-Lethal Weapons The project which includes the reviewing of NT Police firearms training is also tasked with a review of all lethal and non-lethal weapons training issues. There may be some changes to the training which has been conducted in this regard for the past ten years. However the changes will be in detail only and not likely to be changes. in principal. The changes required are necessary because of likely Changes to non-\ethal y.'eapons such as batons issued to police officers. The matter of accreditation of police officers using non-lethal weapons is an integral part of the project. Australian Capital Territory The ACT Government supports the recommendation and notes that the matter has been referred to the National Police Research Unit. Recommendation 86.7 Ensure, following incidents where a person dies or has been seriously injured through the use of force by police, that there is a thorough investigation of the incident by police independent of those involved in the incident; Commonwealth The Commonwealth supports this recommendation. Australian Federal Police procedures and practices are consistent with the recommendation. New South Wales The NSW Police Service's Internal Affairs Branch cpnducts a comprehensive investigation whenever a person. has been seriously injured through the use of force by police. Police conducting such an investigation are independent of the police involved in the incident. .. If a complaint is lodged, then the matter may be investigated by the. NSW Ombudsman. Victoria All incidents where a person dies or is seriously injured through use of force by police, are investigated by the Internal Investigation Department of the Victoria Police. Queensland An independent investigation is always carried out when these types of incidents occur. Under current law, the Criminal Justice Commission is to be informed of all incidents where death or injury has resulted from situations involving Queensland Police. The Criminal Justice Commission may exercise its authority to take responsibility for the investigation or overview of a police investigation. South Australia The Internal Investigation Branch, South Australia Police, has the responsibility of administration of incidents in which police firearms are used (excluding destruction of animals) and investigation of any person killed, injured or placed in danger. The results of such investigations are reported directly to the Commissioner. A 'Firearins Incident Investigation Manual' is currently in the process of being finalised for use by Internal Investigation investigators when conducting enquiries into above incidents. Tasmania Provisions currently exist for a thorough investigation by police independent of those involved in an incident where a person has died from the use of force by police. Northern Territory An independent, internal investigation is always carried out into every incident where a person has died or been seriously injured through the use of force by police. Under the Coroner's Act all inquest must be held whenever a person dies: a violent or unnatural death; in a prison or police prison; in the custody of a member of the police, or under any circumstances that, in the opinion of the Minister, requires the manner and cause of death to be more clearly and definitely ascertained. Australian Capital Territory The ACT Government supports the recommenda'tion. The AFP has advised that, based ori the Commissioner's assessment of the situation, he may determine that the police investigation into the incident will be superimposed by a senior officer conducting an inquiry, with the Internal Investigation Division overseeing the matter. Alternatively, the Commissioner may decide to request another police force to assist with the investigation. Recommendation 86.8 Take appropriate action where arbitrary or abusive use of force or firearms by law enforcement personnel has occurred; Commonwealth The Commonwealth supports this recommendation. In the case of the Australian Federal Police, there are comprehensive procedures covering conduct of the nature described in th.is recommendation, including a disciplinary and complaints regime under-pinned by legislation which includes an independent review by the Ombudsman. New South Wales Where there is sufficient evidence to substantiate doing so, the NSW Police Service will lay information before the courts in respect of the alleged use of arbitrary or abusive use of force or firearms by law enforcement personnel. Victoria The PoliceÂ· Internal Investigations Department investigates all allegations of arbitrary abusive use of force or firearms by police and makesrecommendations as to appropriateness of internal or criminal charges. Recommendations are made as to the appropriateness of internal or criminal charges; Queensland Should sufficient evidence exist, appropriate criminal or disciplinary sanctions will be imposed. South Australia The guidelines and legal responsibilities placed on police officers in South Australia are encompassed in police general orders and criminal law jurisdiction. Once an investigation identifies the misuse of a firearm by a police officer or officers, the matter adjudicated by the Disciplinary Review Officer who is responsible for any subsequent action whether disciplinary or criminal. Tasmania Provision already - xists for appropriate action to be taken where there is arbitrary or abusive use of force of firearms by law enforcement personnel. Northern Territory Besides internal police investigations, the arbitrary or abusive use of force or firearms by police is generally the subject of complaints against police. Every such complaint is also sent to the Ombudsman's Office to ensure the investigation has been thorough and complete. There are many recommendations that can be made at the conclusion of the investigation of a complaint against police. These include proceeding with criminal or disciplinary charges against the member concerned. Australian Capital Territory The ACT Govemmentnotes that there are comprehensive procedures covering such conduct including disciplinary and complaints processesÂ· under-pinned by legislation. The Complaints (AFP) Act1981 also provides for independent review by the Ombudsman. Police are subject to legal proceedings where criminal action is involved. Recommendation 86.9 Ensure that all police involved in major critical incidents, which include the use of lethal force by police, or where the police have themselves been subjected to or engaged in a violent encounter, be subjected to critical incident stress debriefing. Commonwealth. Australian Federal Police practice already generally incorporates this recommendation in its operations and occupational health and safety procedures. New South Wales The NSW Police Service employs psychologists and a medical officer who are involved in the debriefing of officers after major critical incidents. Victoria Chapter 7 of the Police Personnel Management Manual require mandatory psychological debriefing in such circumstartces. Queensland Debriefing and counselling occurs in these circumstances. Western Australia Matters relating to firearms and police are currently being addressed at a national level by the APMC. South Australia is Members involved in major critical incidents, such as fatal shootings, receive critical incident stress debriefing. Tasmania Police are required to attend critical incident stress debriefing where they are involved in incidents which include the use of lethal force by police or where police are subjected or engaged in a violent encounter. Northern Territory Critical incident stress debriefing (CISD) is part of normal procedure in the NT Police Department following any incidenf of a major stressful nature. The department currently has access to a clinical psychologist who has undergone specialist trainiJ.lg in critical incident stress debriefing. She is avaIlable (on call) twenty-four hours a day to provide support and counselling to employees who experience some form of post-traumatic stress reaction. A number of employees have also undergone extensive training as peer debriefers and, under the guidance of the clinical psychologist, are assisting her where large scale or on-scene debriefings are required. Additionally, further education programs on critical incident stress debriefings are being investigated and . included in as many induction and staff development courses as possible. CISD and counselling support is also available from the NT Employee Assistance Service which operates under a tri-partite agreement between the Trades and Labour Council, the Australian Confederation of Industry and the Governments of the Commonwealth, the States and the Territories. Australian Capital Territory The ACT Government notes that AFP practice already incorporates this recommendation in its operations and occupational health and safety procedures.

(5) Does the re-establishment of a counselling service on the Gold Coast warrant higher priority for funding than the replacement of furniture?",88
47,Mr LAVARCH,ANNUALSALARY FORTNIGHTLY,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I am aware of the report in the Courier-Mail of 19 October 1993 relating to ergonomic and colour-coordinated furniture for the Family Court's new premises. (2) I am advised that the Court (a) identified a need for a total of $425,00 for furniture requirements for non public areas of its new premises; (b) has been allocated $305,000 for expenditure on furniture in the non public areas of its new premises; (c) did request an additional amount of $120,000 but subsequently accepted the original amount of $305,000. (3) I am advised that the Family Court counselling service on the Gold Coast was withdrawn in late 1991 by the Chief Justice because he considered he was no longer able to fund the service within the resources available to him and provide an effective service. (4) My attention has been drawn to a perceived need for a permanent Family Court presence on the Gold Coast. (5) The Family Court is negotiating an extension of its workload formula arrangements with the Department of Finance which may make it possible for a Family Court registry to be established on the Gold Coast in the 1994/95 financial year. That registry may include provision for counselling services. Birds: Illegal Imports (Question No. 538) Mr Ronaldson asked the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development, upon notice, on 26 October 1993: (1) Are aviary birds being imported illegally Australia. (2) Has his Department briefed him on the nature and extent of the illegal exports. (3) What steps have Customs officials taken to stop the imports. (4) How many persons have been prosecuted since 1988 for illegally importing aviary birds into Australia. (5) What types of diseases are carried by illegally imported aviary birds. (6) Does the carriage of diseases by illegally imported aviary birds pose a threat to Australian agriculture including the poultry industry.",90
48,Mr GRIFFITHS,ANNUALSALARY FORTNIGHTLY,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Australian Customs Service (ACS) has advised me that interceptions of exotic birds at the Customs barrier and the establishment of bird populations, that were not previously available in the aviculture industry or for which no importation records exist, indicate that importation of exotic birds has occurred and is continuing to occur. (2) Within the Industry, Technology and Regional Development portfolio, the Minister for Science and Small Business, Senator the Hon Chris Schacht, is responsible for the administration of the ACS. The ACS briefs Minister Schacht whenever any significant event, relating to wildlife enforcement, occurs. I also receive an information copy of any brief sent to Minister Schacht. (3) The ACS has advised me that in 1990 they commenced a long term national project, for the detection, identification and investigation of suspected or actual offences against the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982. The operation involves the development of intelligence to target groups and individuals involved in the illegal import or export of wildlife, development of close cooperation with the Australian Nature Conservation Agency, state and overseas wildlife enforcement agencies and encouragement of the public to come forward with information relating to any suspicious activities that may involve wildlife. Information derived from this national project has enabled the ACS to better target those shipments which may contain wildlife. The ACS continues to welcome any information that members of the public may be able to provide which will assist in this national effort to prevent the unauthorised introduction of foreign species and potentially dangerous diseases. (4) The ACS has advised me that there have been 28 prosecutions since 1988. Investigations are into continuing and further prosecutions are expected. (5) The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) has advised that serious diseases which may be carried by illegally imported aviary birds include virulent Newcastle disease, pigeon paramyxovirus-1 (PMV-1) and other strains of paramyxoviruses, avian influenza, avian herpesvirus infections, avian papovavirus infections, various salmonella species and exotic ectoparasites and endoparasites. (6) AQIS has advised that diseases carried by illegally imported aviary birds pose a grave threat to the Australian poultry industry and native bird fauna. Virulent Newcastle disease and avian influenza constitute the greatest threat as the introduction of both diseases would have disastrous economic consequences for the poultry industry. An incursion would result in serious economic losses due to high mortalities and the high costs of disease control. Employment Incentive Scheme (Question No. 544)",90
49,Mr COSTELLO,ANNUALSALARY FORTNIGHTLY,"the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 26 October 1993: (1) When will (a) final positive program outcomes for the Employment Incentive Scheme (EIS) and (b) the number and percentage of those who are in unsubsidised jobs three months after participating in the EIS become available.

(4) Are participants who fail to complete labour market programs taken into account when calculating positive program outcomes. (5) Which labour market programs result in participants not being included in Australian Bureau of Statistics Labour Force Survey unemployment figures while they are undertaking the programs. (6) Which labour programs result in participants being (a) excluded entirely from the scope of the ABS Labour Force Survey and (b) recorded as employed while undertaking the programs. (7) What evaluations of labour market programs administered by his Department have been carried out six, twelve and 24 months after participation. (8) What was the positive program outcome at (a) three, (b) six, (c) twelve and (d) 24 months with respect to each program which has been monitored. (9) How many of those re.corded as positive program outcomes at (a) three, (b) six, (c) twelve and (d) 24 months after participation were in unsubsidised jobs. (10) How many of those recorded as positive outcomes in the post program monitoring of positive outcomes conducted on industry adjustment programs were in unsubsidised jobs. (11) How many participants of labour market programs who commenced in 1992-93 were still participating in those programs in 1993-94 (a) in total and (b) with respect to each program.",91
50,Mr BEAZLEY,ANNUALSALARY FORTNIGHTLY,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Participants are surveyed around three months after the completion of their program placement. As the placements under the Scheme are for a period of 26 weeks and it is expected some commencements will occur in November 1993, final survey outcomes will not be available until September 1994. (2)(a) 1Wenty-one employers entered into EIS agreements. (b) There were fifteen private ""Sector employers. (c) Three regional organisations and three government business enterprises participated in the Scheme. (3)(a) The numbers of labour market program participants who commenced programs in 1992-93 and failed to complete (i) in total and (ii) for each program were as follows: IOBTRAIN-Preparatory 2161 IOBTRAIN-Other 10164 Employment Incentive 501 IOBSTART 57453 Job Clubs 5477 Job Search 279 Special Intervention 4805 Contracted Placement 1821 Mobility Assistance 885 Post Placement Support 92 Migrant Professionals 31 Disability Reform (DRP) 420 LEAP Â·2090 Accredited Courses 5106 Aboriginal Employment 1400 OLMA 1585 IOBSKILLS 4262 Other Programs 781 Total 99313 *Provisional data (as at November 5 1993) pending availability of program cessation information for all 1992-93 commencements. (b) The numbers of labour market program participants who commenced programs in 1991-92, carried over into 1992-93 and failed to complete (i) in total and (ii) for each program were as follows: IOBTRAIN - Preparatory 209 IOBTRAIN-Other 1013 Employment Incentive 0 IOBSTART 3484 Job Clubs 104 Job Search 0 Special Intervention 194 Contracted Placement 77 Mobility Assistance 103 Post Placement Support Migrant Professionals Disability Reform (DRP) NA Accredited Courses Aboriginal Employment OLMA . NA . Other Programs Total (4) Yes. Participants who do not complete programs are included when calculating positive outcomes. Post program monitoring data show positive outcomes for 53% of participants who completed programs in 1992-93. Of the 28 % who left program assistance prior to their expected completion date, 42 % obtained a positive outcome. (5) & (6) There is no program which results in participants being automatically excluded from the scope of the ABS Labour Force Survey. How participants are classified for the purposes of survey depends on how they interpret their situation when responding to survey questions. Questions are asked independently of any participation in labour market programs. Questions focus on whether the person was available for work or did any work in the week before the interview and their efforts to find work in the month before the interview. The responses of survey participants engaged in labour market programs are likely to vary according to the nature of the program in question. Thus participants in subsidised employment and work experience programs such as JOBSTART, the Employment Incentive Scheme, the Landcare and Environment Action Program (LEAP), JOBS KILLS and the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme (NElS) would probably regard themselves as being in work and, therefore, be classified as employed. By contrast, participants in programs such as Job or Job Search Training courses would probably consider themselves as looking for work and consequently be classified as unemployed. (7) Since 1991, evaluations of JOBSTART, JOBTRAIN, SkillShare and Job Clubs have been conducted in relation to outcomes six months after program participation. The evaluation of the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme (NElS) assessed outcomes twelve months after program completion. The evaluation of the Australian Traineeship System (ATS) collected outcomes data twelve months and twenty-four months after program cessation. (8)(a) For 1992-93, positive program outcomes three months after program cessation were 59%, 39%, 42% and 47% for JOBSTART, JOBTRAIN, SkillShare and Job Clubs respectively. The NElS evaluation collected employment outcomes data rather than positive outcomes data. 30 These data are reported below in the response to 14 question (9). In 1992-93, ATS participants had 20 positive outcomes of 88% three months after 0 program cessation. 0 (b) At six months after program completion, the 570 evaluations of JOBSTART, JOBTRAIN, SkillShare 221 and Job Clubs collected employment outcomes data 361 only. These data are reported below in the response 224 to question (9). 6624 (c) At twelve months after program completion, positive outcomes data were collected in the ATS evaluation only. A positive outcome was recorded for 92 % of participants. (d) At twenty-four months after program completion, positive outcomes data were collected in the ATS evaluation only. A positive outcome was recorded for 91 % of participants. (9)(a) For 1992-93,55% of JOBSTART, 27% of JOBTRAIN, 30% of SkillShare and 37% of Job Club participants were in unsubsidised employment that three months after program cessation. The evaluation of NElS showed that three months after program completion some 64 % of participants were in self-employment and a further 9% were in other employment. Post-program monitoring data show that three months after program cessation, 84% of ATS participants were in unsubsidised employment. (b) Evaluation results show employment outcomes (unsubsidised and subsidised) six months after program cessation to be 60% for JOBSTART, 34% for JOBTRAIN, 36% for SkillShare and 44% for Job Clubs. (c) At twelve months after program cessation, employment outcomes data were collected in the NElS and ATS evaluations only. The evaluation of NElS showed that 54% of participants were in selfemployment and a further 9% were in other Clubs employment. The evaluation of ATS showed that 87% of participants were in employment. The NElS and ATS evaluations did not distinguish between subsidised and unsubsidised employment. (d) At twenty-four months after program cessation, employment outcomes data were collected in the ATS evaluation only. Some 87% of ATS participants were in employment. The evaluation did not distinguish between subsidised and unsubsidised employment. (10) There were 12,146 program cessations recorded for Office of Labour Market Adjustment programs in the year to end June 1993. Postprogram monitoring shows that around three months after program cessation, 65 % of participants had a positive outcome and 28% were in unsubsidised employment. (11) The numbers of participants who commenced labour market program placements in 199293 and continued into 1993-94 are as follows: JOBTRAIN - Preparatory JOBTRAIN - Other Employment Incentive NA Job Clubs Jobsearch Special Intervention Contract Placement Mobility Assistance Placement Support Migrant Professionals Disability Reform NA Accredited Courses Aboriginal Employment NA SkillShare Jobskills Other Total Aircraft: Incidents and Crashes (Question No. 553)  representing the Minister for Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 27 October 1993: (1) How many general aviation aircraft engaged in (a) commuter services, (b) commercial (i) passenger and (ii) other operations and (c) private and recreational use were involved in aircraft (A) incidents and (B) crashes in (I) 1988-89, (II) 1989- Agricultural 90, (III) 1990-91, (IV) 1991-92 and (V) 1992-93.

Department of Employment, Education and Training: Lismore Office (Question No. 563) Mr Bruce Scott asked the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 28 October 1993: (1) Does the draft report of the Halstead review of the operations of his Department contain a recommendation that the Department's area office in Lismore, NSW, be closed; if not, is it a fact that the office will not be relocated to Brisbane.",91
51,Mr BEAZLEY,OLMA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Services and Structures Review has examined the structures through which the Department of' Employment, Education and Training (DEET) manages and provides services to the public. Phase 2 of the Review has outlined broad recommendations on changes to client service strategies, organisational and management structures and enhancements to various administrative support services, including information technology, training and accommodation. There are nine reports on various topics covered by the Review. One report outlines a nineteen Area configuration which proposes an Area Coastal covering northern NSW and southern Queensland. In this Area there are two existing Area Offices located in Lismore and Upper Mt Gravatt. Upper Mt Gravatt is identified as the best overall option for the proposed Area Coastal's administrative office, with the proviso that some Area functions should continue to be based in Lismore. ing answer to the honourable member's question: (a)-(d) Infonnation about road funding by local councils is shown in the following table. 1980-81 1985-86 1990-91 1991-92 $m $m $m 657.1 1013.9 1055.0 412.0 602.5 557.3 397.8 618.0 566.6 102.0 131.2 132.1 149.3 198.0* 200.0* 44.2 61.3 58.9 6.0 7.8 7.3 These figures may not be comparable with figures . I have considered the reports from the Services and Structures Review and agreed to the nineteen Area configuration proposed, including the location of the Area's administrative office in Upper Mount Gravatt. I have also agreed that elements of the Area Coastal's administrative office should be outposted to Lismore in an Area Coastal (Northern New South Wales) Office. It has been decided to expand the Student Assistance Centre in. Lismore and to open a new Regional Development Office. Department of Employment, Education and Training: Employment of Mr Dan Kavanagh (Question No. 568) Mr Aldred asked the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 28 October 1993: (1) Is Mr Dan Kavanagh an officer of the Department; if so, what (a) is his designation and (b) are his duties; if not, was he an officer of his Department or its predecessors; if so, (i) when did he leave the Department, (ii) why did he leave, (iii) was he transferred; if so, (A) to which Department, (B) when and (C) to what position was he transferred, (iv) was he promoted; if so, (A) to a position in which Department, (B) when and (C) to what position was he promoted, and  officer with a similar name provide a written or oral referee's or supervisor's report supporting or make any statement relevant to the transfer or promotion; if so, what are the details. (2) If Mr Kavanagh has served with his Department but has subsequently left, (a) what acting and substantive positions and classifications did he hold during the five years before leaving the Departinent,  officer with a similar name supervise Mr Kavanagh; if so, in each case, (A) when and (B) in which areas of the Department, (c) was Mr Kavanagh a colleague of (i) Mr  similar name; if so, in each case, (A) during what period and (B) what duties were involved,  delegations, (ii) make any recommendations or (iii) enable other officers to. make decisions or recommendations affecting the career or entitlements of Mr Kavanagh; if so, in each case, (A) when, (B) who was involved and (C) how was the person involved,  officer with a similar name promote or transfer Mr Kavanagh; if so, (A) when, (B) by what meanS. and (C) between which positions, (f) did Mr Gibson make any recommendation on Mr Kavanagh's suitability for promotion or transfer; if so, (i) when and (ii) for what positions,  officer with a similar name involved in Mr Kavanagh's promotion or transfer from the Department; if so, in what way, and (h) was a farewell function organised for Mr Kavanagh; if so, (i) where was it held,  officers of the Department at the time; if not, who invited them and why, (iii) who made the farewell  speak at the function. (3) Is he able to say where Mr Kavanagh is working; if so, is he further able to say when he commenced working there.",96
52,Mr BEAZLEY,OLMA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: See answer to Question No 111. (1) Mr Dan Kavanagh was employed by the Department for about nineteen years to 1990 (a)-(b) See above (2)-(3) See above Greenhouse Research (Question No. 577) Mrs GALLUS asked the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, upon notice, on 16 November 1993: (1) How many applications for Commonwealth grants for greenhouse research were (a) received and (b) unsuccessful. (2) Will she provide a list of the rejected grants. (3) What selection criteria were used to award the grants. (4) Did she choose the selection criteria; if so, with what aim in regard to the greenhouse effect. (5) Has a target been set for Australia to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1988 levels by the end of the century and by 20 per cent by 2005. (6) How will the information from the research referred to in part (1) assist Australia to reach its target.",97
53,Mrs KELLY,OLMA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1)(a) Eighty five applications were received in response to a national advertisement in April 1993 for funding of projects under the Dedicated Greenor (iii) an house Research Grants Scheme. (1)(b) Seventy two applications were unsuccessful. (2) No. (3) The National Greenhouse Advisory Committee (NGAC) assessed proposals and then made recommendations to me. The NGAC assessed proposals against criteria listed below, together with the referee reports provided by independent expert assessors from the research community: the quality of the researcher or research group, the excellence of the proposed research, and the (ii) were Mr likelihood that it will lead to: a significant advance in understanding the scientific processes which underlie climate change (including, but not limited to: the global hydrological system; sources, sinks and transport of greenhouse gases; ocean-atmosphere coupling; land-atmosphere coupling), a significant advance in understanding the impacts of climate change (including, but not limited to impacts on hydrology and ecosystems, the coastal zone, human settlement and health, forestry, agricultural production and land use), the development of effective mitigation and adaptation responses associated with one of the above two areas. The NGAC also considered the following points: relevance of the project proposal to the objectives and scope of the grant scheme, intrinsic scientific value, the appropriateness of the research plan and method to achieving the project objectives, the probable impact of a successful outcome for the research, whether the project leader and the organisation have the capability to undertake the project successfully, appropriateness of funds requested for the proposed research program. The NGAC also took into account the degree of infrastructural support available for the proposal, and the extent to which the research would lead to collaboration between institutions or groups within institutions (especially other researchers involved in the Dedicated Greenhouse Research Grant Scheme or the Core Research Program). (4) The selection criteria were chosen by the National Greenhouse Advisory Committee. (5) Yes. The Government has adopted as an interim planning target, to stabilise emissions (not controlled by the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer), based ()n 1988 levels, by the year 2000, and reduction of these emissions by 20 per cent by the year 2005. The target is subject to Australia not implementing response measures that would have net adverse economic impacts nationally or on Australia's trade competitiveness, in the absence of similar action major greenhouse gas producing countries. (6) The information coming from the research referred to in part (1) is primarily focused on addressing the underlying scientific processes and impacts relating to climate change and the greenhouse effect. Better understanding of the greenhouse effect and climate change science will provide a sounder basis for planning response measures for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Research directed towards understanding and assessing climate change processes is one of the actions identified in the National Greenhouse Response Strategy endorsed by State, Territory and Commonwealth governments. This National Greenhouse Research Program complements other Commonwealth research and development programs which specifically focus on fields connected more directly with reductions of greenhouse gas emissions.

55,Mr BEAZLEY,JOBTRAIN,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Positive program outcomes can be reported on the basis of DEET Areas and Regions. However, given that the geographically smaller regions may by have low numbers of clients on individual programs and that program monitoring survey response rates can vary between regions, the comparative value of regional data is limited. While comparisons of outcomes at Area level are more reliable, similar restrictions may apply. The tables below provide outcomes data by Area. State Offices make some program placements and are included in the tables for individual programs as appropriate. Each table contains data for a particular labour market program on the proportion of persons completing programs in 1991-92. and 1992-93 who obtained unsubsidised jobs, further (non-DEET) education or training places, and positive outcomes in total. As some participants obtain both unsubsidised employment and a further education or training place, the proportion achieving positive outcomes in total may be less than the sum of proportions for the two component categories of outcome. 1991-92 1992-93 Positive Unsub* Education Positive Jobs {fraining Outcomes Jobs {fraining Outcomes % % % % % % 12 28 22 13 32 10 35 32 14 43 12 37 31 15 42 14 30 23 16 35 10 35 30 11 38 13 26 22 15 34 AREA Unsub* Education WESTERN SYDNEY 16 CITY EASTERN NSW 23 NORTHERN NSW 16 WACENTRAL 21 WA SOUTH 21 CENTRALQLD 24 NORTHEAST VIC 15 SA AREA NORTH 19 SOUTH EAST VIC 16 SA AREA SOUTH 19 WANORTH 23 WESTERN VIC 15 COUNTRY AREA VIC 19 ACT SOUTHERN NSW 19 TASMANIA 15 NORTHERN TERRITORY 24 * Unsubsidised.

(viii) Expenditure was necessary to implement a National Middle Management Development Strategy. The strategy consists of ten modules which were developed within the framework of the Joint Australian Public Service Training Council competencies for ASOS and AS06 officers. Five modules (Plan for Results, Resource Management, Leading and Developing People, Managing Change, Self Management for Results) are delivered as ""Managers Making a Difference"", a national five day residential course followed by a 6 week on-the-job project and a two day recall. One module is delivered as the FOCUS program, a five day residential workshop. Efficiencies in terms of cost and greater use of time available are achieved through conducting the two programs as residential courses. Initial evaluation of the pilot programs has confirmed this and indicated a general preference for the residential approach by officers attending these programs.

71,Mr CONNOLLY,ASOS,"the Minister representing the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, upon notice, on 17 November 1993: Did Naval Support Command Headquarters commission a survey of the sewer system of HMAS Cerberus; if so, (a) what was the brief, (b) what did the survey cost, (c) why was it necessary and (d) did the survey result in recommendations; if so, was adoption of the recommendations cos ted and if so what was the cost.",124
72,Mr BEAZLEY,ASOS,"The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes. (a) The brief was for cleaning of sewers, including root cutting and foaming, and closed-circuit television investigations of those parts of the not covered by earlier surveys. It included preparation of a report detailing the scope of remedial and maintenance work required, and a suggested phasing of the remedial work, to assist with maintenance priorities and financial planning. (b) The survey cost is $104,000. (c) Results of a restricted survey of the sewer system, to confirm its capacity to accommodate new developments, indicated that sewers were in poor condition, in need of cleaning, unblocking, root removal and renewal in many places. A full clean and survey was therefore considered to be a high priority to determine the condition of all sewers and extent of remedial maintenance required, noting the potential for hygiene arid environmental problems if a major failure or blockage occurred. (d) Completion of the survey is not expected before the end of December 1993 with a report available in January 1994.

Although the Committee also gave consideration to a number of possible combinations of the above options, only the following two were considered worthy of further consideration: Reduced content (1996) + Full content (2001) and alternately thereafter; Full content (1996)+ Long/short form (2001 and thereafter).

(ii) These refer to collectors and agents who were employed under the Census and Statistics Act 1905 (7) Under the reduced frequency options of a 7 or 10 yearly cycle, there will be no reduction in total staff years for each Census. However, the average annual staff years will be less than that required of a 5 yearly censuS because of the longer cycle involved. For the other options considered in detail, it is estimated that the following staff years would be saved per option:Â· A reduced content census-521 A headcount census-586. A long/short form census-342 A rolling full content census-Not available Reduced content (1996) + Full content (2001) and alternately thereafter-521 Full content (1996) + Long/short form (2001 and thereafter)-342 (8) In addition to input from agencies represented on the Committee and views from the Australian Statistics Advisory Council (which encompassed State Government views), 52 separate submissions were lodged in response to a paper distributed to individuals and organisations known to have an interest in the Census which summarised the options the IDC was examining in detail.

78,Mr EVANS,ASOS,"the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 24 November 1993: Are employers ofÂ· Jobstart trainees in work placement programs required to pay the superannuation contribution levy; if so, (a) is it a fact that in many cases the trainees do not benefit from the contributions made by a short term employer and (b) will the Government amend the requirement.",130
79,Mr BEAZLEY,ASOS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act (SGAA) 1992 contains a number of general exemptions, including for employees who receive a salary or wage of less than $450 per month and for part time employees under age 18. Unless employees meet these exemptions, the Act would require payment of either appropriate contributions or the Superannuation Guarantee charge for Jobstart employees. As the Treasurer indicated in his statement of 17 August 1993, ""National Saving and Superannuation"", the Government is aware that there are difficulties associated with the operation of the SGAA. In that context, the Treasurer noted that a particular concern is the fact that relatively small amounts of money required to be contributed on behalf of many casual and itinerant employees could be eroded by fees and charges applied by recipient superannuation funds. The Government is according a high priority to resolving this and other problems with the SGAA. In the interim, the Government intends to defer quarterly compliance with the legislation until 1994-95. Jobstart (Question No. 692) Mr Reid asked the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 24 November 1993: (1) Have employers received funds under the Jobstart program who were not entitled to receive the funds; if so, (a) what steps is his Department taking to recover the funds and (b) what is the (i) name of each employer in Victoria from whom (A) funds have been recovered or (B) his l)epartment seeking to recover funds and (ii) sum involved. (2) What total sum has been allocated under Jobstart in Victoria.",130
80,Mr BEAZLEY,ASOS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Department of Employment, Education and Training investigates all allegations of employers receiving funds under Jobstart to which they are not entitled and, where appropriate, recovery action is taken. Since December 1992, a total of $4,004 has been recovered in two cases in Victoria. Certain aspects of these cases are still under consideration, including whether,or not to prosecute. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to identify the businesses at this time. Investigations are still continuing in respect of a further 14 cases in Victoria. The sums involved in these cases range from $340 to $7760. (2) In 1993-94 a total of $78.1m has been allocated to Jobstart in Victoria. Paul Kenny Antiques (Question No. 696)",130

(9) Was a booklet prepared to support Dr Miller's nomination for the position; if so, (a) what did it cost, (b) how many copies were produced, (c) into how many languages was it translated, (d) to how many countries was it distributed, (e) what was the distribution cost and (t) who paid for its distribution. (10) Was an interdepartmental task force or any other body established to coordinate lobbying for Dr Miller's election; if so, (a) how many Australian Public Service (APS) officers served on it, (b) how many APS officers worked (i) full-time and (ii) part-time, (c) what was the classification of each and (d) how many travelled overseas in connection with the mission. (11) Which overseas posts were directly involved in lobbying for Dr Miller. (12) What cost was incurred in lobbying by each of the posts referred to in part (11). Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable referred to member's question is as follows: (1) No. The budget for the campaign was $605 000, covering activity in financial years 1992-93 and 1993-94. The budget was funded jointly by DPIE and DFAT from within existing running costs. Pending finalisation of accounts, as at 15 December 1993 expenditure was $590 000. In addition, it has been estimated by DFAT that over the course of the campaign expenditure by overseas posts related directly to the candidature will amount to $145 000. Lobbying host country govemments on such matters is one of the normal priorities of diplomatic representation, therefore these costs have been met from the running costs of Australia's overseas missions. The FAO campaign supported Australia's international object-ves in three important areas: agricultural trade, reform of the UN system and refocussing international development assistance. his The campaign made a useful contribution in these three areas, even though it was ultimately unsuccessful. The quality and integrity of the candidature and the campaign reflected well upon Australia. Dr Miller was the last candidate to be beaten, in the sixth ballot after 9 hours of balloting. Candidates from Greece, Ireland, Bangladesh, Holland, Germany, India and Chile were defeated or withdrew before the final runoff between Dr Miller and the eventual winner, Dr Diouf from Senegal. If ten countries had changed sides, the Australian candidate would have won. Thus the defeat was extremely narrow. This international candidature was publicly endorsed by both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. Also representations in support 'of Dr Miller were made in overseas countries by the Leader of the National Party. (2) Dr Miller visited 66 countries. (3) ,I am advised that, while details of accounts are still being finalised, the cost of Dr Miller's travel is estimated at $285 900, covering fares, travelling allowance and accommodation. This figure is included in the budget of $605 000 referred to in question 1. (4) Dr Miller's campaign travel was undertaken over the period from 3 October 1992 to 12 November 1993. (5) Dr Miller travelled as Secretary to the Department of Primary Industries and Energy from 3 October 1992 to 23 March 1993. Thereafter, he travelled as Associate Secretary for Agriculture, Government of Australia. Much of his travel was complementary with the pursuit of other Australian government business in agricultural trade or development assistance. Some substituted for travel that would have been undertaken by others. Over the campaign period and in the course of his international travel, Dr Miller participated in nine significant international meetings. (6) Dr Miller was paid his normal salary as a departmental Secretary ($124 275 pa) during the period while he was travelling. (7) Yes. Mr John Kerin MP travelled from Australia specifically to lobby other countries. Mr Kerin was asked to lobby selected countries in Africa on Australia's behalf because he had a strong, personal relationship with Ministers in Africa built up over the years he was the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and Minister for Trade and Development Cooperation. The countries selected were those in South and East Africa most of which Dr Miller had not visited. Others from Australia and overseas undertook to lobby in support of this Australian candidature in the course of their other international activities. These included Federal and State Ministers and. Parliamentarians, Ministers and officials from other countries, officers of the APS and other agencies and private citizens. This lobbying was not a cost to the campaign budget. (8) (a) Details of the accounts are still being finalised, however, the cost of airfares, land transport, accommodation and travelling allowance for Mr Kerin is estimated at $12 571. (bY Mr Kerin's travel was planned to cover the following countries: Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Djibouti, Tanzania. Mr Kerin was only able to visit Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi. He was prevented from travelling further as he was unable to depart Burundi for seven days because of a coup. (c) I refer to the answer given in part (a). (d) Mr Kerin's visit was funded within the campaign budget referred to in question 1. (e) My Department authorised Mr Kerin's travel after having advised me of the proposal and the fact. that all costs would be met from within the campaign budget. (9) Yes, a booklet, written primarily by Dr Miller and formatted in DPIE, was produced to support this Australian candidature. The booklet set out positions on many issues of great ongoing significance in agricultural development and international trade. Dr Miller also drafted and issued twenty major statements on important issues on the global food and agriculture agenda during the campaign. These were issued to governments throughout the world and to the international media. (a) The cost of printing and translating the booklet was $44 265. (b) There were 7000 copies produced. (c) There were 5000 copies produced in English, and 1000 each in Spanish and French. (d) Copies were distributed to all 168 FAO member countries and to 10 potential member countries. (e) Where possible distribution of the booklet was undertaken through the regular Diplomatic mail service. Commercial courier services were used where the Diplomatic Bag service was unavailable or not timely. While details of accounts are still being finalised, direct courier and mailing costs as at 15 December 1993 amount to $3935. (0 Costs were funded within the campaign budget referred to in question 1. (10) Yes, an informal interdepartmental Committee (IDC) was established to coordinate the campaign for the FAO Director-General position. The officers on the IDC were drawn from DPIE, DFAT, PM&C, AIDAB, and CSIRO. The committee was chaired by Mr R. Swift, a retired former Deputy Secretary of the department and an expert in FAO matters. Mr Swift also acted as campaign manager. (a) Over the life of the campaign 27 individual APS officers attended the IDC at least once. However, a range offrom 8 to 18 officers attended each meeting depending on the pace of the campaign and projected departmental responsibilities. Not all agencies were represented at all meetings and some officers moved to other work responsibilities during the campaign. (b) (i) Only 2 APS officers of the committee worked fullÂ·time on the campaign. (ii) The other 25 APS staff who at some stage attended committee meetings were involved in a part time capacity, some quite minimally. (c) (i) The officers serving full time were an ASO 5 and a SOG B. (ii) The classifications of the other officers who attended at least one meeting ranged from SES to ASO 4. The were 5 SES officers, 12 SOG Bs, 3 SOG Cs, 2 ASO 6s, 1 ASO 4 and 2 scientists from CSIRO. (d) Five APS officers from the committee, including Dr Miller, travelled overseas in direct connection with the mission. Four DFAT officers, not members of the IDC, travelled from their overseas posts to Rome in support of the mission. One FrenchÂ· speaking, Paris-based DFAT officer, not a member of the IDC, provided support to Dr Miller during his visit to Francophone West African countries. As campaign manager Me Swift travelled to Rome to coordinate the activities of the Australian delegation during the election at the FAO Conference in November 1993. All such travel was accommodated within the budget referred to in question 1. Three other members of the IDC who would have, in any event, travelled to the FAO Council meeting and Conference in November 1993, also contributed part time to campaign activities in Rome. (11) Most of Australia'/'i overseas posts were involved in the lobbying effort to some degree. (12) I refer to the answer given in question 1. Family Allowance Recipients: Fringe (Question No. 726)",133
86,Mr RUDDOCK,COST OF,"the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 13 December 1993: Did his Department send letters to family allowance recipients seeking information about fringe benefits; if so, (a) how many letters were sent, (b) what was the cost of the mail-out, (c) over what period were the letters sent, (d) were some letters sent without the required fringe benefits forms; if so, (i) how many, (ii) when was the omission discovered, (iii) how many complaints were received about the omission, (iv) why were the forms omitted, and (v) what steps have been taken to prevent a recurrence, and (e) has his Department sent any letters again; if so, (i) how many, (ii) what was the total cost including postage and wages, and (iii) over what period were the letters sent. Mr Baldwin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) From 1 January 1994 the value of employerprovided cars, accommodation, low interest loans, health insurance and school fees will be included when assessing entitlement to Family Payment. This measure was announced in August 1992 as part of the 1992 Budget. Since mid-November about 400,000 families have been asked to give my Department details of any of these benefits which they receive. The first stage of the employer-provided benefits data collection involved a mail-out to all incometested additional Family Payment clients and all Basic Family Payment (BFP) clients who indicated that their taxable income was above $50,000. In the week commencing 15 November 1993, 395,776 letters were sent. The second stage of the employer-provided benefits data collection involves progressively issuing fringe benefits modules to BFP clients with high incomes as they return their end of year review forms. (People claiming Family Payment Benefits between 10 November and the end of 1993 will also have to complete a module). The precise number of letters issued to this group is not known. (b) The exact cost cannot be confirmed at this point since the mail-out will not be completed until the end of December 1993. (The numbers issued wmdepend on clients' incomes). (c) See answer to (a) above. (d) Yes. (i) 2,040 clients in Victoria and Tasmania and 3,825 clients in New South Wales. . (ii) The matter was detected in Victoria on 12 November and in New South Wales on 17 November as clients contacted my Department's TeleService Centres. (iii) The number of complaints received was not recorded. (iv) Each day, the DSS state Computer Centres automatically generate the letters to clients and manually pack the modules and multilingual inserts with the letters. At the beginning mail-out, staff at the Melbourne and Sydney Computer Centres did not include the module and the multilingual insert with the letter. This happened for one day in Melbourne (10 November) and two days in Sydney (15 and 16 November). (v) My Department has reminded staff in Computer Centres to ensure that all required enclosures are packed with letters to clients. (e) Affected clients in all three sent another letter, with the fringe benefits form included. (i) 2,040 in Victoria and Tasmania and 3,825 in New South Wales. (ii) The approximate total cost is $6,500. (iii) Letters were resent in New South Wales on 17 November. Letters in Victoria were resent progressively from 12 November. Austrade: Facom Printing Facility (Question No. 729)  the Minister for Trade, upon notice, on 13 of the progressive December 1993: Did Austrade engage Project Consulting Pty Ltd to redevelop the Facom printing facility; if so, (a) what did the consultancy cost, (b) what was its duration and (c) why did the facility need to be redeveloped.
