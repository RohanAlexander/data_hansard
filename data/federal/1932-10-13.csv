1,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,"T have recently asked questions of the Assistant Minister for Trade and Customs regarding 5,000 cases of eggs belonging to Mr Earle, which were prevented from being exported. Can the honourable gentleman state how many cases were condemned by the departmental inspectors, and the reasons.for their rejection?  ago, Mr Earle submitted for export 5,532 cases of eggs. Upon inspection by the departmental officers some of the eggs were found to be soiled, others were underever, sized, some were "" watery whites"", and others had air bubbles and buTBt air bubbles. Accordingly, the shipment was rejected, but Mr Earle was. given permission to repack the eggs. Of the 4,827 cases already repacked, 3,565 have been passed for export; the balance have heen rejected. The repacking of the remaining 505 cases will probably be completed today. NA LINE OF STEAMERS.",9

NA DOCKYARD.",10
16,Mr ROSEVEAR,COCKATOO ISLAND,"On the 2nd September, I asked a question of the Prime Minister regarding - a proposal to lease the Cockatoo Island Dockyard. The right honourable gentleman assured me the matter was engaging the attention of the Ministry, and that the Government's proposal would be announced in of due course. I now ask him. whether Does lenders for the lease of the dockyard have been invited, and whether the closing date has been extended to the 6th November? If so, when was the Government's intention to lease the dockyard first announced,' and what is the reason for extending the perdate fov the receipt of tenders?",10

18,Mr ROSEVEAR,COCKATOO ISLAND,"In view of the fact - that the Prime Minister gave the House the assurance that an announcement would be made respecting what was to be done with Cockatoo Island Dockyard, does he think it reasonable that that public asset, which is valued at should be leased to private enterprise without this Parliament being",10
19,Mr LYONS,COCKATOO ISLAND,"I have nothing to add to what I have already said on this subject. The Government wishes to make the best use of this asset, and at the same timt to conserve the interests of the taxpayers, by reducing, if possible, the loss upon it. It is with this object in view that we invited tenders for the leasing of to Cockatoo Island, and as the time stipulated for the closing of tenders hag not a yet expired, I can say nothing more on the subject at this juncture. N EWNES SHALE OIL DEPOSITS.",10
20,Mr JAMES,COCKATOO ISLAND,"How does the Prime Minister reconcile the promise of the TJnited Australia Party that, if elected to office, it would find a solution of the unemployment problem, with the action of the Government in leasing the Newnes shale oil-fields, which were previouslyoperated by a committee under the control of this Government, to private enterprise, which has now closed the works down?",11
21,Mr LYONS,COCKATOO ISLAND,"The whole object of the Government, in leasing the Newnes shale oil-fields to a private company, was to continue to operate these works in order to provide employment. We are still hopeful that that result will follow the arrangements which the Government has made.",11

23,Mr LYONS,COCKATOO ISLAND,"The matter is at present under the consideration of the Minister in charge of the negotiations, Senator MCLachlan, and the last has not been heard of or said on-the subject. We are hopeful that we shall be able to continue to operate these works.",11
24,Mr BEASLEY,COCKATOO ISLAND,"Is it not a fact that the company to whom these works have been leased has not kept to the definite terms of the agreement, because of its failure to find the capital necessary for the proper development of the Newnes shale oil deposits ? Has not that company already forfeited its rights under the agreement ?",11

UNITEDKINGDOM - A ND NA Motion (by Mr GULLETT ) agreed toTliat lie have leave to bring in a bill for an act to approve the provisions of an agreement made between His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom and His Majesty's Government in the Commonwealth of Australia and arising out of the conference of representatives of the Governments of the British dominions held at Ottawa in July and August, One thousand nine hundred and thirty-two. Bill brought up by Mr GULLETT, and read a first time. Motion (by Mr LYONS) agreed toThat so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the Minister for Trade and Customs from moving the second reading of the bill and continuing his speech beyond the' period of one hour until its conclusion. SECOND READING.",11
26,Mr GULLETT,AUSTRALIA TRADE AGREEMENT,"Henty-Minister for Trade aud Customs) [ 2 . 4 5 ] - I move That the bill be now read a second time. May I at the outset express my regret and disappointment that the leader of the Australian delegation to Ottawa who is now our Resident Minister in London is not standing in my stead at the table today? Mr Bruce was pre-eminent among the great parliamentarians of the Empire who assembled at Ottawa, and his talents were disclosed not only in the making of the Australian agreement but in his powerful contribution to the success of the conference as a whole. Yet, desirable as it might be, that he should have returned to present theagreement to Parliament, the news of the New South Wales loan conversion, which was received last week, shows the wisdom of the decision of the Prime Minister (Mr . Lyons) that his proper place at the moment was not here but in London. I shall only add that no Australian delegation overseas has ever enjoyed or benefited by more inspiring and capable leadership than we who went to OttawaThe purpose of the Imperial Economic Conference at Ottawa was to review the question of preferential trade within the British Empire, and to endeavour to establish such trading upon a sound reciprocal basis. Honourable members are already acquainted in broad outline with the manner in which the great task of the conference was handled, and with BILL. the measure aud nature of the various tentative agreements which were made; my' duty today is to explain in some detail the particular agreement entered into by the Australian delegation with the United Kingdom and the colonies, and to move for its approval hy this chamber. It is not necessary to survey in detail the long and chequered story of preferential trade witihin the Empire. Tariff preferences were in vogue in the very early times of the British Colonial Empire; for more than a hundred years the Colony of New South Wales regulated its duties in the interest of the Motherland. There came a long eclipse of the practice under Britain's policy of free trade and foreign treaty making. Preferential trading slumbered until at the close of the last century it was awakened by the vision ancl irresistible challenge of Joseph Chamberlain. Free trade in the United Kingdom resisted Chamberlain's titanic assault, but the citadel had been shaken, and in the overseas Empire the effect had been immediate, and more or less general; preferences in Britain's favour were freely and progressively granted by the dominions. In 1929, the average margin of the preferences granted by Australia, upon goods of British origin was 15 per cent., and they extended over almost the whole tariff schedule. These preferences were in a sense unconditional, hut I need scarcely recall to honourable members that in the minds of the Australian people there was always the consciousness that in many forms, tangible and intangible, there wa3 reciprocity from the people ancl government of the United Kingdom. In 1919, the Government of the United Kingdom'made its first reciprocal grants, and at the successive Imperial Conferences of 1923, 1926, and 1930, the issue took larger ancl larger shape, while, concurrently, the' advocates of a return to protection multiplied apace in the British electorate. Last year, we saw the dramatic collapse of free trade, and the return of a coalition National Government, divided, it is true, within itself upon the fiscal issue, but leading a House of Commons overwhelmingly committed to protection through the tariff for home industries and preferential trade throughout the Empire. British minds the world over then turned with a new and gathering expectancy to the forthcoming conference at Ottawa. Mr Bennett, the Prime Minister of Canada, who had at the 1930 conference proposed the gathering in Canada, had builded better than he knew. The new National Government in Britain at once made it plain that the fall of free trade did not mean protection for home British industries only. ifr. Gulleti. .Through the Import Duties Act, which became law early this year, that Government imposed for a limited period temporary duties of 10 per cent, against a wide field of foreign imports of a kind supplied by the dominions, and allowed the free entry of dominion products. Therefore, at the opening of the Ottawa Conference, reciprocal preferential trade was already operating within the Empire. But it was operating without plan, and without certainty of continuance. On the British side, all the new preferential duties were to have expired in November of this year, unless in the meantime specifically renewed. On the dominion's side the preferences, as for example, those granted by the Commonwealth, had been given piecemeal; they represented various margins, and any study of them showed that, generally, they had been somewhat carelessly if withal generously applied. At Ottawa, there was a cousidered and deliberate attempt, not only to make the trading preferences of the Empire really reciprocal, but to place them on a well-ordered business like basis, and to express them in definite agreements for a term of five years. The case for a comprehensive scheme of preferential trade within the Empire rests upon the belief first, that such a scheme is practicable and economically sound, and secondly, that it will prove a powerful influence in strengthening the bonds which hold the British people together. It is not suggested that it would be possible or wise to attempt to make the British Empire self-contained. There are commodities such as wool and wheat and coal, and many classes of manufactured goods, of which the Empire as a whole has an output far in excess of its requirements, while in other commodities, as for example oil, its supplies cannot meet its consumption. Moreover, it has never been held by those who believe in preferential trade that we should aim at excluding foreign trade from our markets. International, trading, like inter-community trading, is essential to the progress of the world's civilization. Yet, those who have worked for more than a generation for preferential trade believe that the British Empire cannot fail to he reinforced, and more definitely assured of permanence, by a comprehensive arrangement which will ensure, without going to extremes, that British Empire markets shall be, as far as possible, supplied by British Empire goods. If this great conference had met in a time of normal rjrosperity, it would have presented very few economic or political tliflicultios. Tariff preferences on a reciprocal basis would have been agreed upon, and we would have waited patiently for the scheme to yield its fruits. But meeting as it did in the midst of a depression of unparalleled range and intensity, with prices diminished almost to vanishing point, with the purchasing capacity of the great dominions exceedingly enfeebled, with governments everywhere in financial difficulty, with taxation threatening with extinction such industry and commerce as remained, it was imperative that the conference should evolve plans containing sound promise of immediate effectiveness. The conference at Ottawa therefore directed its energies to the raising of price levels for the great export commodities of the dominions, and the colonies depending in the main upon the TJnited Kingdom for their market. Preferential trade between the dominions as apart from Britain and between the dominions and the colonies was not neglected, but was regarded as of secondary consideration. The great-task was to enlarge as speedily as possible, reciprocal trade between the people of the TJnited Kingdom and those of each of the dominions. Could that task be carried to a successful conclusion, the conference would do much for the early restoration of Empire prosperity and the re-employment of British peoples in all quarters of the world. It is not necessary to dwell upon the importance of the home British market to dominion producers. ""Without that great market, the Empire could not have gained its present strength, and the loss of that market would bring the Empire swiftly to ruin. To Australia this observation has a particular application. It is true that only 30 per cent, of the wool we export goes to Britain, and normally only about 30 per cent, of our wheat.* But apart from those two great staple products, our dependence upon the British market is most pronounced. In 1930-31, 90 per cent, of our exportation of butter, 76 per cent, of our meat, 75 per cent, of our fruits, and 95 per cent, of our wine went to the TJnited Kingdom. Moreover, although tliere recently has been an interesting and promising development in the exportation of some of these lines to other countries, the indications as a whole point to our increased : rather than reduced dependence upon the British market. Eor, while in Canada and in some eastern countries we have, fortunately, improved our markets, we have at the same time been excluded from other markets, particularly from those of Continental Europe. The passionate spirit of post-war nationalism, implemented by tall tariff walls, together with the depression, have more or less closed many doors against us. Further, the produce of certain foreign exporting countries has been diverted to Britain in competition with similar produce from the dominions. At Ottawa, therefore, we were compelled to ask the British people to continue to buy from us, not only as much as they have bought in recent years, but actually and heavily to increase their purchases. We had to ask this at a time when British purchasing capacity like our own is enfeebled by the depression. Nor was that all. We had also to tell the British people, through their delegation, that the present prices paid by them for our produce were so low as to be profitless to our producers and to ask that steps be taken to increase those prices against themselves for our benefit. Wc had to make it clear that uuless and until that were done the dominions could hold out little or no prospect of service to the people of the United Kingdom by furnishing a profitable market for their goods or a safe and profitable investment for their money. These facts were freely and generously recognized by the Britisli delegation as the agreements with Australia and with the other dominions clearly show. In other words the British Government recoguized-and this is an important point in any consideration of the work of the conference-that owing to the depression the first benefits from the new reciprocal trading project must of sity go to the dominions. Here in Austries tralia, for example, the returns to primary producers must be restored to profitable level, - and the general financial burdens of our people must be reduced before the Commonwealth can again being come a substantial buyer of British goods. The facts are incontrovertible, but the resulting difficulty, from the price levels. British view-point, ancl especially political difficulty, will be plain to all. Not only in the trade agreements the British delegation accept the view of the conference. of the dominions that the indispensable first step towards the success of the ference and the recapture of prosperity must be an advance in wholesale prices. How to improve price levels became dominant consideration of the conference, and was the outstanding feature of the monetary resolutions adopted. been said that these resolutions did carry the world or the Britisli Empire very far on the road to recovery. But reflection will show that they were comparably the most significant f u l financial affirmations reached since the depression came upon us. They declared in specific terms that the monetary policy of the United Kingdom and the ^ dominions should be linked to an Empire effort to revive price levels. It is to be remembered, in this conof British industry. nexion, that the power and influence the Government of the United Kingdom in world finance, has, in an international sense, again become paramount. It is of the first importance and of great en couragement, therefore, that the conbetween ference, at the inspiration of the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, declared a rise in prices is necessary and laid down a policy, already, indeed; initiated by the Commonwealth. in the United Kingdom, in favour of making available short term and long term money on the cheapest possible terms. We have had striking evidence of effectiveness of this policy both in the to handle the Australian case. gigantic conversion loan of the United Kingdom and in the successful New. South Wales conversion last week. Ottawa anticipation was that the GoGeneral, vernment of the United States would adopt a similar policy, and indeed that at no distant date it would be generally Sir. Guild t. necesadopted throughout the important counof the world. This would mean the our cheapening of money internally, and a would give much-needed relief for debtor nations with external obligations, with a consequent lightening of taxation, the aidof industry, the renewal of confidence, and as the Australian delegation ventures to believe, the inevitable recovery of If I appear to have the digressed from the trade aspect of what happened at Ottawa it is to emphasize did the comprehensiveness of the endeavour To enable honourable members to follow conwithout difficulty the story of the conference, and to assess the value to Australia of the agreements made and the the concessions granted by the Commonwealth to Britain, it is desirable that I should explain to the House the preparaI t has tory work that was done before the delenot gation sailed for Canada. A great deal of the work of the conference was done before any of the delegations arrived at inOttawa, and this was especially true of and helpthe Australian delegation. At the end of January last the Commonwealth Government received from the British Government a list of 250 tariff items and sub-items to which the British Government invited consideration with a view to concessions being made in favour The concessions of sought were not specific; no actual rates of amended duties were set out; hut the British Government suggested that the items submitted should, as a first step, - form the basis'of exploratory discussion 1 the representative of the United Kingdom in Australia, Mr Hankinson, and the senior British Trade Commissioner, Mr Dalton, ancl officials appointed The Government appointed a sub-committee of Cabinet- Mr Bruce, Minister without Portfolio, the last Minister for Commerce, the honourable member for the Wakefield (Mr Hawker), and myselfThe work was divided into two sections. Customs officials under the direction of The Mr Abbott, the Deputy Comptrollerengaged with the British officials in anÂ»examinatio.n of the British requests for tariff concessions, while officials of the Commerce Department and of the Development Branch of the Prime Minister's Department proceeded, under the direction of the Cabinet sub-committee, to collect and prepare the material upon which Australia's requests to the Government of the United Kingdom would be based. The work was vigorously prosecuted. Some time before the delegation sailed for Ottawa, we had replied to Britain's requests, and had outlined in detail the concessions which the Commonwealth was prepared to make, while at an even earlier date we had forwarded by cablegram to London almost the complete list of the various primary products upon which we desired preferential treatment from Britain, together with the margins and forms of preference desired. 1. should mention that it was clearly understood by both governments that responses or requests made at this preliminary stage were tentative, and subject without prejudice to variation at Ottawa. In framing the Australian requests preferences, the sub-committee, and afterwards the delegation at Ottawa, lowed a course of studied moderation. We recognized that the preferences asked could not at once rescue primary production in Australia from the desperate straits in which it then found itself, the result of the collapse in prices, to level of normal prosperity. But we believed that the preferences requested would, if granted, have at least some immediate stimulating effect upon protective prices, and further, that as prosperity returned, they would enable the AusDecember tralian farmer and grazier to bid sucBut cessfully for a steadily increasing share of the British market. We were couraged in that belief by the gratifying manner in which our primary producers had in the past competed in the United Kingdom against the producers of all other countries, either without prespecial ferences at all, or with very preferences. The restraining consideration with respect to our requests was the degree which the British Government and people could afford to grant preferences. had to bear in mind that most of the exports in regard to which we sought preferences were foodstuffs of a kind consumed in the main by British workers and other people of moderate incomes. We had to remember the existing'industrial and economic conditions of the United Kingdom, where, while the conference was sitting, there were over 2,000,000 men and women unemployed and a charge upon the taxpayer. Moreover, we had to keep it always before us that agreements signed at Ottawa must receive the endorsement of the governments and political parties, and, in the last stage, of the electors at the ballot boxes. We held the view that excessive requests might easily wreck the conference, delaying the great project of preference for many years, or even defeating it for ever. I come now to the response we made to Britain's requests for changes in the Commoinvealth tariff. These requests were of two kinds; some were for reductions in the British preferential tariff level, and others for a widening of existing preferences. At the outset of for the preparation the Cabinet sub-committee had to make a decision and a folrecommendation to the Government of first-class importance. Honourable members are familiar with the fact that the Government's policy is as definitely against changes in protective a tariff items without reference to and consideration by the Tariff Board. In other words, the Government denies to itself the right arbitrarily to raise or lower tariff levels, and this policy declared at the general elections in has been closely respected. what of the policy for Ottawa ? Was the Government to have one policy for enthe domestic Australian consideration and another for Ottawa? Would the Government, through its delegation, in response to the British requests for reduced duties in her favour, proceed to a ministerial revision . indepenlimited dently of the Tariff Board? After careful deliberation, the Government decided that the policy declared at to the elections, and since acted upon in tariff resolutions now before this House', We must prevail at Ottawa. There can be no question, I submit, as to the wisdom of this decision. Apart from' the pledge to the people, I can conceive of no more hazardous undertaking than for a Customs Minister or any number of Ministers ' to engage hurriedly in tariff revision. Under the best of conditions such an enterprise is a gamble, but with Australian industry and world conditions as they are today, it would be political madness. Obviously, however, if the Australian requests to Britain were to succeed, ways had to be found to bring about a substantial improvement in the British trading position and prospects in the Australian market. The action taken was of twofold character. We decided to refer to the Tariff Board all the protective tariff items with respect to which Britain had made requests for reductions, and to obtain as many recommendations as possible before the conference opened. I need scarcely say that, in considering these references, the board worked with that complete independence which has always marked its deliberations. We also gave to the Government of the United Kingdom the assurance that the board would continue its work upon these particular items, and that recommendations for reduced British preferential rates would be promptly considered by the Government with a view to their submission to Parliament. The next task before the Cabinet sub-, committee was the consideration of the British request for extensions of existing preferences. Here, after an unsatisfactory attempt to deal with the tariff item by item, it was decided to adopt a' sliding scale formula for general application, subject, to exceptions both ways. That formula, as originally transmitted to London on the 1st June, was as follows:British Proferaitiiil Margin of Prcfcrcncu. Duty. Free to 14 per cunt. . . 15 per cent, to l i ) per cont. 20 per cent, to 29 per cent. :i0 per cont. and upwards Some honourable members may contend that, as the protective section of the tariff was not to he arbitrarily reduced at Ottawa, it was impossible to make really useful concessions to British industry. That is a mistaken view. There was, first, the fact that with the present exchange position, the primage duty, and the'very weak purchasing power of the Australian people due to the depression, no reasonthe able reductions in protective duties would Mr 0illicit. have at once been of much value to Britain. Unhappily it was as certain as anything could be that the Tariff Board would have finished its review of the items in which Britain was particularly interested before there was any marked improvement in the exchange position or any general removal of the primage. The important thing in Britain's interest was to provide a stronger preferential position for goods of the kind now freely entering the Commonwealth, even under depression conditions. These goods are mainly such as are indispensable and not manufactured in Australia, and they enter either free, or at revenue rates of duty. It was over this field that Britain could, if her preferential position was strengthened, confidently look for an immediate expansion of trade. Some idea of the importance of this trade can be gained from a perusal of our.import statistics. In 192930, the value of thu imports admitted free of duty from the United Kingdom was Â£29,000,000, a figure which represents 54 per ceut. of the total importations from that country. During the same year, Â£41,000,000 worth of goods were admitted from the United Kingdom at rates of duty of 35 per cent, or less. It can be said, therefore, that 76 per cent, of our imports from that country is admitted at rates which even today enable British manufacturers to compete in our markets. By granting wider margins of preference over this field of imports, the United Kingdom will be in a jjosition under normal trading conditions to attack a further Â£.15,000,000 worth of our import trade. It may be said that to increase the margins of preference on the essential goods referred to per cent. is economically unsound, but it is at least 124 equally unsound for the British Governin"" ment to undertake to grant preferences 17-J . . 20 in favour of vital foodstuffs from Australia and the other dominions. In our preparation and proposals we were seeking concessions of great immediate moment for Australia, aud we had to offer something of immediate value in return. Before leaving the preparatory phase of our work, I should like to introduce subject of the meat industry; because it was meat which afterwards became the chief Australian problem at Ottawa. At the outset of our preparation we realized the great difficulties which confronted the British Government on this subject. We knew that the old free trade slogan of "" a free breakfast table "" had more application to meat than to any other article of food, with the exception of bread. It was true that the declaration for protection at the British general elections last year had been an overwhelming one; but we were fully conscious that nothing would so surely re-awaken the great forces of free trade as a suggestion that the tariff would be used to add materially to the price paid by the British working man for his bacon and beef and mutton. Nor could we forget that at that time the present British Cabinet included a number of free traders still unshaken in their fiscal faith, and that tariff matter;; the Cabinet had agreed to differ, and actually did differ, in speeches made from the front bench in the House of Commons. But while we were alive to the embarrassment certain to be caused to the British Government by any request for preference for our meat, we were still more alive to the vital necessity of this particular preference to Australia. In a cablegram to the British Government on the 14th June, ten days before the delegation sailed, we said that it would be impossible to obtain the endorsement of Australian public opinion to any reciprocal arrangement which did not contain provision for some real benefit in regard to the meat we exported to Great Britain. This plain declaration did not in the least overstate the position. We did not suggest a preference on wool, aud after the fullest consultation with our great wheat interests, including the growers and the co-operative marketing organizations, we had but limited faith in the Ottawa Conference as an agency of important benefits to the wheat-growers of Australia. Therefore, if meat could not in some way be brought into the proposed scheme of British preferences to the dominions, Ottawa would have no interest for the great cattle industry of our tropical northern areas, for other cattle-raisers large ancl small, scattered throughout all settled Australia, for the sheep industry in its wide ramifications, or for the thousands of wheat and sheep-farmers on the wheat belt. In other words, without some benefit for meat, the forthcoming conference was limited in its promise to the Australian dairyman, the fruitgrower, and vigneron, the sugar-grower, the producer of base metals, and to sundry minor industries, and that prospect was one the delegation at no stage contemplated without the gravest concern for the success of the conference. The Agreement. I come now to the actual agreement entered into by the Australian delegation at Ottawa with the British Government itself with respect to trade with the United Kingdom, and also to that part onof .the agreement with the British Government acting on behalf of the colonies. But before proceeding further, I should be lacking in gratitude and appreciation if I did not say how much of any success achieved at Ottawa was due to the Government and people of Canada. The phenomenal greeting from all sections of the Canadian people- a greeting spontaneous, "" sincere and affectionate-followed as it was by perfect arrangements of every conceivable kind for our personal comfort and for the expedition of business; and by hospitality delightful but never excessive-create d an atmosphere in which failure became from the outset impossible. Canada, in brief, set the stage for a successful conference. Mr. Bennett was the ""rarest of hosts, and, at the same time, a brisk, business like and dominant, though withal a very cheery, chairman. This was the first great imperial conference to be held out of London, aud Canada has set an example for all others. The thought was always in our minds that the Ottawa Conference could only have been arranged by a very efficient government backed by a very efficient people. A feature of exceptional interest to Australia in the agreement entered into with the United Kingdom, is that if we review the concessions made to all the dominions and colonies, it will be found that the benefits obtained for the Commonwealth exceed in range those gained by any other dominion. Measured by exports to Britain, Australia is favoured by natural conditions which give extraordinary diversity of her rural industry and production, and so it comes about that if the benefits of Ottawa are real and permanent, as I believe they will prove to be, the people of this country will enjoy more than an average share of them. With few exceptions, of minor importance, every Australian primary industry, great or small, is a beneficiary. Assuming, therefore, that the preferences obtained and the other arrangements made in our favour have the effect of increasing our exports to Britain, and of raising in some degree our price levels, every country district in the Commonwealth may look for some stimulus in output and some increase upon present returns. But I need not remind honourable members that the value of the preferences which are new or increased, or which, if not increased, will have a certain five years' duration, does not lie merely in the increase of the quantity of produce which may as a consequence be exported, or in the higher prices which may be realized. The value of expanding and profitable British ntarkejs for our pastoral and agricultural produce is far greater than that. A ready sale for our export surplus will have an almost incalculable effect upon the prices prevailing in our own domestic Australian market. The British price level also establishes the price level obtainable for. our exports in foreign countries. That will be obvious to honourable members. I think it can be established that the Ottawa agreements will improve prices for our produce in the London market, and in most, if not in all cases, the newBritish level will determine also the new level within markets of the Commonwealth. This has, of course, a special bearing upon meat - An improved price for our mutton and lamb in the Smithfield market will automatically add to the value of our flock of 110,000,000 sheep. In turn that will add to the value of all sheep country, and so will enhance Credit, increase purchasing power, and indirectly give a fillip to all Australian industry and business. That consideration, I may add, was always in our minds during our prolonged and extremely delicate and difficult negotiations to get meat included in the list of preferences. Ur. Chiillett. It was understood early in the proceedings that, provided all the dominions showed a ready disposition to agree to reciprocity, the Government of the TJnited Kingdom would grant to all dominions the preferences granted on the representations of any particular one. But, on the dominions side this rule was not to apply, and from the outset the Australian delegation opposed any suggestion that preferences granted by Australia should be granted as a matter of course to all parts of the Empire. The reason for this stand on behalf of the Commonwealth is fairly clear. Eor many years to come, the United Kingdom market will assuredly be a much richer market for Australian producers than the markets of all the dominions taken as a whole. The British market is the Australian land settlers' chief mainstay and hope. We desire to receive in that market the most generous preferences the British people are disposed to give, and are able to afford. Their disposition and capacity to grant and maintain preferences in our favour will naturally be largely conditioned by the value of the preferences we grant in return. Likewise, every Â£1 we spend upon British goods will stimulate the capacity and the readiness of the Britisli people to buy Australian primary produce. If Ave were, for example, to grant to the weaving mills of India the 20 per cent, preference margin which AVC have been giving on cotton piece goods from Lancashire, it is certain that India would at once become a strong competitor in the Australian market, and Lancashire enthusiasm for Australian meat and butter and fruit might reasonably he expected to wane. A similar result Would folloAv if we placed Canadian manufacturers of motor chassis in the same preferential position with British manufacturers. We. decided, therefore, that any extensions to other parts of the Empire of the preferences in the first place granted to Britain must be a matter for indiA-idual negotiation and consideration. For these reasons the negotiations at Ottawa were of two distinct kinds. Each dominion delegation negotiated separately with the Britisli delegation upon the tariff concessions it Avas prepared to make in Britain's favour. But, with respect to the British concessions to the dominions, all those delegations which were interested in the same commodity, such as meat or dairy produce, cooperated as nearly as possible in the presentation of a common request. With little exception, this arrangement worked well, and led to much expedition of business. I propose now to set out the concessions granted by Britain in favour of Australian primary. production, and to endeavour to indicate their value in general terms, and also to touch upon some of the problems and difficulties which we had to overcome during at least part of the conference. Meat. Let lis first deal with meat, both because of its supreme importance to the - 1025. 1926. Chilled Beef 411 484 Frozen Boef 206 179 Total Beef 617 663 Mutton and Lamb.. 267 266 Pig Meats 535 502 Total 1,419 1,431 The feature of the market up to and including 1930 was the stability of the total imports, and the total consumption. Between 1926 and 1930, beef consumption declined by 9 per cent., that of mutton and lamb increased by 10 per cent., while the total consumption of all these meats declined by 1 per cent. The importation of pig meats was'on the increase, but so far had not disorganized the market for other meats, the prices of which, though reduced, were still at a payable level. However, in 1931, owing to the increased severity of the depression, and a substantial increase in the imports of all classes of meat, the market was demoralized, and prices dropped to pre-war levels, and even lower. The figures which I have quoted show that beef imports in 1931 increased slightly over those of 1930, but that they were lower than in the years 1926 to 1928. Beef, therefore, was not a factor of the price decline. The increase in welfare of an overwhelming majority of our people on the land, and also because the subject gave more trouble, and occupied more time, than all the rest of our work at Ottawa. Australia's original request was for a series of preferential duties on beef, mutton, lamb and pig meat, together with some restriction of foreign imports into the TJnited Kingdom. The analysis of the British market for meat was a complex task, and the position is difficult .to explain in the brief space to which I must confine it. It will help, I think, if I give you a few figures at the outset, showing the imports of the different classes of meat into the TJnited Kingdom. The following figures are in thousands of tons:1927. 1928. 1929. 1930. 1931. 520 478 465 454 464 149 130 118 125 135 669 608 583 579 599 275 281"" 281 319 355 514 544 520 546 639 1,458 1,433 1,384 1,444 1,593 mutton and lamb imports in 1931 over those of 1930 was 11 per cent. With the decreased spending power of the British people, this increase in supply, which came from New Zealand, Australia, and South America, was sufficient to cause some decline in prices-bu t not to the disastrous extent to which prices did fall. For the principal supply factor we must * look to pig meats, the imports of which were 93,000 tons, or 16 per cent., more in 1931 than in 1930, reaching the colossal figure of 639,000 tons. The collapse in prices commenced with the collapse of the price of bacon. Diminishing returns for dairy products, ancl especially for butter, the very low price for feeding grains, the rapidity with which pigs can be bred for the expansion of the industry, and the successive total or partial closing of European markets by tariff action caused one European dairying country after another to fling huge quantities ofpig meats, aud especially of bacon, on to the British market. The effect of this was to close two-thirds of the British bacon-curing factories, and to break prices for all, pig products. Canada, which in 1926 had exported 43,000 tons of bacon to the TJnited Kingdom, sent only 2,000 tons in 1931. All nonEuropean competitors were forced off the market, and the top price of Danish bacon, which forms the bulk of the supply, dropped from 112s. per cwt. in January, 1930, to 70s. at .the end of that year, and by December, 1931, to 48s - the lowest price during the present century - A fall in the prices of other meats followed that of bacon. Australian lamb, the .top price of which never averaged less than Sd. per lb. in the years 1916 to 1930, had dropped to 5^d. by February,, 1932, while later in the year it was as low as 4Â£d. Australian mutton, the top price of which, in the years 1916 to 1930, was seldom below 5d. per lb., fell to 2-Jd. per lb. while the conference was sitting at Ottawa. The whole of this price was absorbed in killing, shipping, and marketing expenses: in fact, the sale of sheep for export had entirely ceased, and the only carcasses going forward were stock from cold storage. Australian frozen beef, which sold in 1930 at from 4d. to 6d. per lb., dropped to 2-Jd. for forequarters and 3id. for hindquarters. Small wonder that home and dominion meat producers have been faced with ruin. The dominions' case for meat was presented to the British delegation in the most comprehensive and exhaustive manner by Mr Bruce, who asked for preferential duties on frozen beef, mutton, lamb and pig meats, together with quantitative restrictions upon, all meats, including chilled beef. A few days later the British delegation, in a general, although not explicit, reply to the Australian delegation's requests as a whole, expressed its wish to improve the British market for hoino and dominion mutton and lamb by a scheme of progressive quantitative restrictions against foreign imports, and to expedite a similar schqme already in hand for the improvement of the market for pig meats in the interests of the British farmer. Mr Chamberlain, who in all the later decisive negotiations acted as the British spokesman, added, however, Mr Gullett. that the delegation did not consider that a case had been made out for a preference on beef. Certainly the case for dominion beef, including Australian beef, was not an impressive one. Of the total amount of 1,399,000 tons of beef of all kinds consumed in the TJnited Kingdom in 1931, S00,000 tons was of home British origin; 464,000 tons of chilled beef, and 59,000 tons of frozen beef came from South America, chiefly the Argentine;* 57,000 tons of frozen beef came from Australia; and 19,000 tons of frozen beef came from New Zealand. Australia and New Zealand supplied only 5^ per cent, of the total consumption, and 13 per cent, of the total beef import. Nor was that the real weakness of our case. As honourable members know, chilled beef is more attractive to butchers and consumers than frozen beef, and we in Australia are still waiting on science for a process that will enable us to transport chilled beef over the long journey to Britain. Our supply was an insignificant part of the total imports, and our frozen beef was rated as an article of inferior quality. The Australian delega^ tion had from the first recognized the weakness of the claims for the granting of a preference on frozen beef, and because of that we had not at Ottawa maintained our earlier tentative request for a duty on chilled beef from South America. Our frozen beef could not be materially assisted by an import duty, or the imposition of a restriction against frozen beef from South America, because much of the beef classified as frozen which enters Britain from the Argentine is not carcass beef, but is made up of the marketable offal of the chilled beef. As a matter of fact, Australia and New Zealand supplied no less than 65 per cent, of the frozen beef carcasses imported by Britain in 1930, and the British delegation was able to say that we already had a sound position in the market. The market for the frozen commodity is a limited one, and most of it seems to be consumed in the Army and Navy, ancl by various institutioiu. But, if there was not a strong case for dominions' frozen beef, there was in our view still a very definite case for the quantitative restriction of chilled beef from South America. We urged that it would be idle for the British Government to attempt to improve the position for the home British meat producer, and for Australian and New Zealand mutton and lamb, if chilled beef from the Argentine and other South American countries were left free to flood the general meat market. This was a vital point, because Brazil and Uruguay are still in their infancy as chilled beef exporters, and their exportation is capable of enormous expansion. We contended, and I think quite soundly, that price levels for mutton and lamb could not be raised if an unlimited amount of cheap beef were available to consumers. To a late stage in the prolonged discussions, we continued to press for duties on mutton and lamb, together with restrictions upon the importation of all foreign meat. The British delegation could not be brought to agree, however, that duties were necessary if quantitative restrictions were imposed, and we were obliged to abandon the request for the actual tariff preferences. We then concentrated upon the restrictions, and it is no exaggeration to say that thousands of sums on the question were done by the members and staff of our delegation in consultation with the British representatives. The final settlement was as follows:1. The Government of the United Kingdom'undertakes to proceed with a plan, already in process of formulation, for the regulation of the importation of foreign bacon, in the interests of home agriculture, so as to ensure a minimum price of 80s. per cwt., at which price it is expected that the British farmer will be able to produce bacon at a profit. From the point of view of the dominions, this scheme should terminate the intensive competition of bacon with otlier classes of meat. Happily, bacon prices are already rising, and it may he that this will prove the prelude to a general improvement in the meat market. It is difficult to estimate the reduction bacon imports which will be necessary to carry the price to 80s. per cwt., but the anticipation at Ottawa was that the total supplies would be reduced by between 75,000 and 100,000 tons. 2. The importation of foreign chilled beef into the United Kingdom is to he limited to the volume of the importation during the year ended the 30th June, 1932. During that year the imports totalled 440,000 tons-les s than in any other year since 1925. This limitation should prove of great value, both in hardening the prevailing market and as a safeguard for the future. 3. The importation of foreign frozen beef carcasses, boned beef, mutton, and lamb, is to be progressively restricted over a period of eighteen months, commencing from the 1st January. 1933. For the purpose of this restriction the imports for the year 1931-32 are. taken as the basis. In that year imports from foreign countries were lower than in the calendar year 1931. In the first quarter of 1933 the reduction is to be 10 per cent, of the imports for the corresponding quarter of the base year, and is to be continued by quarterly increases of 5 per cent, until, in the second quarter of 1934, the reduction will be at the rate of 35 per cent. That measure of restriction will then remain in operation during the period of the agreement. The restriction of 35 per cent., operating from the 1st April, 1934, will reduce the annual imports of foreign mutton and lamb by 34,000 tons, and of frozen beef by approximately 10,000 tons, a total of 44,000 tons. The Commonwealth Government, on its part, undertakes1. To use its best endeavours to limit the exportation of frozen beef to the United Kingdom during 1933 to an amount exceeding the exportation during the year 1931-32 by not more than 10 per cent. 2. That the exportation of mutton and lamb to the United Kingdom during 1933 shall not exceed the quantity imported from Australia by the United Kingdom during the peak year 1931-32. After 1933 no restrictions on dominions' exports are contemplated. The deliberate in intention of the arrangement is to improve the wholesale price of mutton and lamb and pig meats in the British - wholesale market, and to provide a better market for frozen beef from the dominions. While the Australian delegation would have preferred the imposition of preferential duties in addition to some quantitative restriction, the agreement certainly provides substantially more quantitative restriction than would have been undertaken by the British Government had the duties been decided upon, and more than would be secured by moderate duties operating alone. The curtailment of the foreign supplies of meat cannot fail to have an improving effect upon the British wholesale market, while obviously it provides scope for increased exportation from the dominions. At first glance the restraint upon frozen beef, mutton and lamb exports from the dominions next year may appear undesirable in the Australian interest, but upon reflection I think it will be agreed that temporary limitation of dominion supplies need not cause misgivings to our meat producers. The year 1931-32 was a peak year for our mutton and lamb exports to the United Kingdom, and in that year our beef exports to the United Kingdom were higher than for a number of years past. There is also that important fact, which I have already mentioned, that dominion mutton aud pig meats were already being kept out of the British market by the prevailing unprofitable price level. Australian killing for mutton exports had ceased. Clearly, therefore, if no agreement had been reached at Ottawa it is extremely unlikely that our Australian meat exports for next year would have reached those of the peak year ended June last. The British scheme for the restriction of bacon imports to bring about a wholesale price of not less than 80s. a cwt. promises to be of very great value to Australian farmers. We are not able to export bacon to the United Kingdom because of transport difficulties, but with a wholesale bacon price of 80s. the way will be open to our dairy farmers to engage actively in the raising of pigs for the export of frozen pork to be converted into bacon in British curing factories. On the whole I give the House and the live-stock breeders of Australia the assurance that the agreement reached upon meat was quite as satisfactory as the Australian delegation ever contemplated it would be. That is endorsed by the honourable member for Wakefield, who carefully followed the negotiations. After months of very close Mr GuUett. study of British meat supplies in all their wide ramifications we were deeply impressed with the extraordinary difficulty of obtaining a satisfactory preferential scheme. This, however, we now believe has been obtained, and in my view, this scheme is of more value to Australian primary industries than any other single concession obtained at Ottawa. The production of meat is one of our greatest industries. At this juncture, I propose to read a letter which I have received from Mr Angliss, who accompanied the delegation to Ottawa as its accredited consultant on the subject of meat. The letter was quite unsolicited. the It reached me only this morning, and although it is marked "" personal "", I have obtained Mr Angliss's permission to read it to the House. It is as follows:-Dear Mr Gullett, There seems to have been a good deal of controversy going on recently in connection with tlic Ottawa Agreement, and it has been stated in some quarters that nothing of any value has been obtained in connection with our meat. I would just like to say that as far as the meat portion of the Ottawa Agreement is concerned I consider it is much more valuable under the quota agreed upon than it would have heen had wo the benefit of the tariff only. In my opinion (and in this I am joined by other meat men) a tariff would have been absolutely useless without a quota, and now it has been.decided there shall be no tariff, and just a quota I want to say that the view taken by the 7neat men generally is that a.quota wil l prove to be much more valuable to the Australian producer than the tariff which was mentioned in our earlier proposals, and I feel very certain when the restrictions on the foreign countries and the quota have been disclosed the country generally will recognize the value of the meat agreement. I also feel confident that the benefits will be much appreciated by the meat producers. Yours sincerely, W. ANGLISS . Mr Angliss is, I think, the largest individual exporter of meat in Australia. He is one of the greatest cattle owners in this country, and was, no doubt, writing on behalf of thousands of meat producers. Wheat. In considering the great commodity of wheat, which in national importance, ranks second only to wool, the Australian delegation, in common with the Canadian delegation, was confronted with a position of extraordinary complexity. In the first place we recognized that it was almost impossible for the British Government to take"" any step which would increase the price of bread in Britain in the interests of the overseas dominions. It must always be borne in mind that the working-class hread-eating millions of Britain are the lowest paid and poorest white people in the whole Empire. But, that was only the beginning of our problem. Even if the British Government had been prepared to lift slightly the price of imported dominions wheat above world parity, that would not have been of substantial benefit to the wheat-growers of Australia and Canada. The fact is that the Empire is it heavy surplus producer of wheat. In the six years 1925-26 to 1930-31, the dominions as a whole averaged an annual export of 330,000,000 bushels, while in the same years the average import into the United Kingdom was 198,000,000 bushels. So that if the United Kingdom had imported only empire wheat there would still have been an annual surplus of 132,000,000 bushels to be sold at parity in foreign markets. Obviously, therefore, no British preferential scheme would increase the Australian parity. We could scarcely expect Britain to subscribe to a preferential scheme under which her working people paid more for bread made from Australian wheat than foreign peoples, or we in Australia paid. The British Government suggested a quota scheme which would ensure to us a substantial share of the British market at world parity price. That scheme was discussed by the Ottawa Cabinet Subcommittee with representatives of every section of the Australian wheat industry, including the co-operative marketing bodies, and the unanimous view was unfavorable to it. Very few of these representatives believed that even a preferential duty would be of benefit to the Australian wheat-grower. We therefore decided that the best course to follow would be to co-operate with Canada in an endeavour to induce the British Government' to devise means to reserve to dominions' wheat as large a place as possible in the market of the United Kingdom with safeguards against unfair marketing practices by any foreign country. Obviously, we had in mind the disastrous breaking of the world price level by dumping from Russia in 1930. On our side we undertook that under any arrangement made dominions' wheat would be sold at Liverpool at world parity pricesThis proposal was agreed to and is expressed in the agreement by a duty of 2s. a quarter or 3d. a bushel against a IE foreign wheat, with free entry for theproduct of the dominions. I may say that this arrangement has* been hailed with much satisfaction iv* Canada, where over a vast stretch of the; prairie the wheat-grower is solely or"" almost solely dependent, upon his harvest of grain, which therefore was his one interest in the Ottawa Conference. Happily, the Australian mixed farmer on the wheat belt has also his benefit under the agreement in the mutton and lamb' market of the United Kingdom. Australia has a position of some advantage over other wheat countries in the markets of India and the Ear East, and this fact, coupled with the new British duties, may lead to some of our foreign wheat-growing competitors restricting their operations. Under the Import Duties Act, dominions' flour enjoyed a temporary advantage of 10 per cent, against flour of foreign origin. That preference now stands in the agreement for a term of five years. No increase was obtainable, but in view of the fear that the temporary duty of 10 per cent, against the foreign miller would in the interest of United Kingdom millers be applied to the dominions also, the Australian delegation was satisfied with the outcome. Milling is highly efficient in the Commonwealth and the preference should prove very useful. Barley also remains on the 10 per cent, duty although at one stage in the negotiations we had hopes of either 15 per cent, or 6d. a bushel. The 10 per cent, is equal to 4d. a bushel on a depressed market, but will, like all the ad valorem duties, become more valuable as prices improve. Australian barley when carefully harvested. and graded, is, I understand, of - particularly good quality, and with the preference, there is ground for the hope that it may lead to the remunerative harvesting of increased crops, especially in South Australia and Tasmania. Peas also retain the 10 per cent, preference temporarily granted under the Imports Duties Act; this amounts to about Sd. a bushel against foreign peas competitive in class. In suitable districts the crop is a desirable one in any rotation scheme of cropping, and the export market should he worth the attention of farmers. Australian macaroni, manufactured from the special durum variety of wheat, is finding limited sales in the British ket, and receives the useful stimulus of 10 per cent, preference. Dairying. The importance of the dairying industry to Australia needs no emphasis. It is already of first-class magnitude and no other branch of farming offers such easy opportunities for swift expansion. General concentration upon improved breeding and feeding, could, probably within a decade, make Australia the world's largest, exporter of dairy products. But during the past twelve - months the price of Australian butter in Britain has fluctuated from slightly below to slightly above 100s. a cwt - the lowest level for a number of years-and Australian dairy-farmers were finding it difficult to carry on at a profit. The butter market of the TJnited Kingdom is like its meat market, practically the only one now open to exporting countries. Until recently it had consumed 66 per cent, of the world's total exports of butter, and Germany had ranked next with a consumption of 25 per cent. But Germany has now almost entirely stopped imports, and this threatened to lead, as similar European action did with respect to meat, to further heavy supplies for the British market. The state of that market and the cause of the collapse in the price level can be told in a few figures. In 1928, the total British imports reached 300,000 tons which was in excess of imports in any previous year. But three years later, in 1931, the imports advanced to 400,000 tons. As the price came down consumption increased to the exclusion of substitutes, but the avalanche of supplies, together with the reduced, purchasing capacity of the British people, persistently weakened values. Again, the low prices prevailMr GuUett. ing for grain feed stuffs was a contributing factor as continental farmers were enabled to engage in heavy winter feeding, and so maintain an unusually constant supply. Honourable members will see the same cause and effect running through the prices problem in the United Kingdom. Market after market which used to absorb some of the world's surplus products is closed in the new fiscal era, and the diverted supplies have mar- been thrown on the only open market, the United Kingdom, and we have suffered in the resultant slump. ""With this position before us we decided, as with meat, to request the British Government to grant both a duty and a quantitative restriction in our favour. The prevailing temporary duty was 10 per cent, ad valorem, equal to about Id. per lb. Our original tentative request for preference was l$d. per lb. and a restriction, but finding that New Zealand was asking for 2d., we agreed to work on the same level. Again we found the Britisli delegation opposed to the employment of both a duty and restriction against foreign supplies. The temporary duty of 10 per cent, was, however, increased to 15s. per cwt., which is equal to a little more than 1-Jd. per lb. The cost of marketing Australian butter is 17s. per cwt., which includes refrigeration, inspection and export levy, land and sea transport, commission and all other charges, so that this new duty of 15s. places our dairymen in an exceptionally advantageous position as against the foreign producers, and cannot fail both to improve the price and to ensure for Australia an expanding position in the British market. It may be argued that the 10 per cent, duty failed to improve or even to hold up the price level, and that the additional 5 per cent, may also prove a disappointment. The fact is, however, that but for the 10 per cent, duty the price would have fallen still lower. As price levels for continental stock feeds revive and add to foreign costs of production, foreign competition faced with the duty of 15s. per cwt. may be expected to weaken. The new duty of 15 per cent, on cheese is of more immediate importance to Canada and New Zealand than to Australia, but it at least provides our dairy farmers with equal opportunity for fitable production. Condensed and dried milk and casein, which are also given preferential margin of 15 per cent, against foreign supplies, are of more importance to British home farmers than to the dominions, but again they disclose an opening for Australian enterprise. Eggs. Of the 26,000,000 great hundreds of eggs imported by Britain, Australia is now supplying 1,000,000 great hundreds, in the industry. and the export has, in recent years, been very progressive in equal competition with the foreigners. The new preference of Is. to Is. 9d. a great hundred accordcession ing to weight, or about 10 per cent, of London wholesale price will prove very useful contribution to the cost of marketing and should enable the Aushave tralian industry to show further profitduction able expansion. The Australian egg of average weight and will be favoured by a duty of about Is. 6d. Fruit. Australia's 20,000 fruit and vinegrowers spread over all States have reason, I think, to look upon the Ottawa agreement with satisfaction. The new and additional preferences gained should not only benefit the orchardists and vignerons but also give a measure of financial relief to the various ments which have ventured large sums of money in irrigation works and the upon foundation of new settlements. And may I add that the delegation worked with particular zest for these concessions cause of their significance to a great many ex-soldier settlers.' Apples, which have an export value of Â£1,250,000, have had their preference vanced from 10 per cent, ad valorem to 4s. 6d. a cwt. We were also associated with Canada and New Zealand in a recurrants, quest for some restriction of foreign ports upon a somewhat complicated seasonal basis. This was refused by British delegation, and I think on solid grounds. Australian apples and pears with the produce of New Zealand has orchardists, enjoy almost a monopoly the British market through the early and mid-summer months. They meet competition, however, early in the season profrom apples from TJnited States of America, which are carried over in cold a storage, and again from the new American crop in September. The duty of 4s. 6d. a cwt. against foreign supplies will be of particular value in extending our selling season under favourable, price conditions. The Australian export of pears has an annual value of about Â£70,000, and with the same preference as apples-4s . 6d. a cwt - tlier e should be room for progress Australian oranges are to enjoy an advantage of 3s. 6d. per cwt. against those grown in foreign countries. This conwas granted in aid of other the dominions rather than the industry in a the Commonwealth. It cannot be said of our citrus growers as a whole that they shown the same efficiency in proand marketing which is an outis standing feature with many of their fellow orchardists. They now have the inducement of this new British preference and also of the remarkably ricli preference of more than Ss. a cwt. in the Canadian market, and Canada imports oranges to the annual value of between Â£1,400,000 and Â£2,000,000. The delegation ventures' to express the hope that there will be an immediate and notable improvement in the organization of the local industry so that advantage may be Governtaken of this preference. The increase in the preferential margin dried vine and other fruits from 7s. to 10s. 6d. a cwt. may be interpreted as a well-earned reward to an Australian beindustry distinguished by the excellence of its practices. Australian dried fruits are deservedly famous throughout the world. Of the total production of raisins, adlexias, and currants to the value of Â£3,000,000, two-thirds goes overseas. Of Britain's total imports of raisins and Australia supplies on the averimage, more than 30 per cent., while this year, we are selling more raisins in the Canada than in the Commonwealth itself. The Australian export of prunes and dried apricots, peaches, and pears, so far been of small dimensions, but of the new preference, which more .than equals all marketing costs, should promote enlarged activities. Because of Britain's trade treaty with Greece, tha preference on currants remains at 2s., the Greek industry is well controlled, and those engaged in it have always regulated supplies and maintained a price not unprofitable to Australian growers. Our grievance in the matter, therefore, can .scarcely be a strong one. The agreement provides for a preference of 15 per cent, upon canned fruits, in addition to the duty on the sugar tent. This represents about Is. a dozen - tins, and is equal to approximately two-thirds of .the total costs of marketing. Our request was for Is. 6d. a dozen tins, but the ad valorem concession applied to the annual export of canned peaches, pears, and apricots will, it is hoped, able the Australian product to make still further headway against foreign supplies in the United Kingdom market. Wine and Brandy. The only additional advantage obtained for Australian wines was the increase in the preference from Is. to 2s. upon the light classes. This, however, should prove definitely helpful to winemakers. It has to be remembered that already, Australia enjoys an extraordinarily strong preferential position in the .British market. The spirit content of dominion wines pays less import or excise tax in the United Kingdom than any other class of alcohol with the exception of the British so-called "" wines"" expressed from imported grape must. We made no headway against "" British wine,"" which must bo recognized as a British industry based on imported raw material. I may mention, too, that the evidence in support of the complaint that foreign suppliers deprive Australian exporters of the value of the Empire preference by blending in the United Kingdom was not convincing, and a sound case could not be based upon it. We failed to obtain a further concesof sion upon brandy. The request, in which we were joined by the South African Delegation, was that the present preferally ence of 2s. 6d. a gallon be increased 153. The ChaucellOr of the Exchequer pointed out that the obstacle to an extenBut. sion of the preference was the need guard the revenue. The prevailing British brandy foreign import duty is bodies. Mr GuUett. but 7os. 4d., which is Is. lOd. in excess of the excise tax on whisky. The rate of 72s. lOd. per gallon On Australian brandy could not be reduced without reducing the excise on whisky. On financial grounds, the Government could not contemplate this. To meet our request by increasing the rate against French brandy was equally difficult, because the duty con- was already in the prohibitive class. In. the interests of a large section of Australian vignerons, and indeed of winemaking generally, an increased overseas sale of brandy is of the greatest importance. To-day, there is not less than 1,250,000 gallons of brandy in stock in enthe Commonwealth. Consultations at Ottawa, however, appeared to indicate that an outlet must be sought elsewhere than in the. British market where little or no Australian brandy is sold. The evidence showed that even a margin of 15s. would not promote considerable sales of Australian brandy in the United Kingdom. The Australian delegation therefore went to considerable pains to obtain a preferential position in eastern .British countries where brandy imports are remarkably heavy. In 1930, imports into Malaya amounted to 245,000 gallons; in 1931, imports into India were 347,000 gallons; to Ceylon, 47,600 gallon's; and to Hong Kong, 77,400 gallons. As the agreement between the Commonwealth and the colonies discloses, we secured an increase in the Malayan preference on Australian brandy of from one dollar to 2.50 dollars, which at par rate of exchange represents 5s. lOd. in Australian currency. The ad valorem equivalent of this preference is about 33^,- per cent. This concession will, it is hoped, prove of considerable value to grape-growing interests. Broadly speaking, it would appear that the preferences offer profitable activities to all well-conducted Australian orchards, and some improvement in the prospects the holders of vineyards. It may he that in certain directions steady expansion of planting may be justified, especiin view of a probable increase of to sales in the colonies and in such dominions as Canada and New Zealand. expansion needs caution, and should to be on a scheme carefully prepared by those controlling the various co-operative Other Primary Products. The sugar position was not changed at Ottawa. Prior to April last all Empire sugar was accorded preference, the rate varying with the degree of polarization. The effective ^ rate on Australian sugar was about Â£3 12s. a ton. Honourable members will recall that in April last the British Government reduced by Â£1 a ton the duty on sugar from the colonies. At the conference we joined with the South Africans, and with representatives of British beet sugar interests, in a effort to have this additional preference made applicable also to sugar from the dominions. Our effort was not successful. The British delegation pointed out that the public finances of the sugar growing Crown colonies were in a very bad way owing to the depression, and the government and taxpayers of the United Kingdom were in the last resort obliged to meet the deficiencies. The additional Â£1 preference on colonial sugar was in reality an indirect grant in aid to the colonies from the British taxpayer, as an alternative to a direct subsidy. The extra concession was a temporary one only, until the colonial financial position improved. The preference ruling prior to April, 1932, gave to the dominions and the colonies a great advantage in the sugar market of the United Kingdom, and the reduction by Â£1 of the duty on dominion sugar would have cost the British public upwards of Â£250,000 a year. In view of these facts, and as the prevailing preference in 1931-32 was worth, approximately, Â£1,000,000 to Australian sugar growers, the British refusal of our request can scarcely be described as ungenerous. Australia enjoys in the British market a preference of Â£1 6s. 8d. per cwt. on hops, the duty against the dominions being Â£2 13s. 4d. and against foreign countries Â£4. At Ottawa we sought the removal of the duty of Â£2 13s. 4d. on Empire-grown hops of species required for blending, and not grown in the United Kingdom. The government of the United Kingdom, however, has recently introduced a plan for the organization of the domestic hop industry, and we had to be content with the maintenance of the ruling rates. In the interests of Australian hardwoods, we joined with Canada in the request regarding timbers. It is considered that our hardwood poles, and material for harbour construction, should! find free sale in the United Kingdom, but hitherto they have not been included im the specifications issued by public construction authorities. Hardwood will,, under the agreemeut, receive a preference: of 10 per cent., and the Britisli delegations undertook to bring about the desired! sustained amendment of specification. Other primary products which are beneficiaries are leather, honey, copra, eucalyptus oil, wattlebark and asbestos. Base Metals. The magnitude and extraordinarily high efficiency of the base metal industry in Australia spurred the delegation to every effort for at least the retention of the 10 per cent, preferences upon lead, zinc and copper. None of the new temporary preferences had been subjected to more attack, which came from both foreign producing interests and the British fabricators. Australia is more substantially interested in lead and zinc than in copper, but in association with Canada and Southern Rhodesia we urged the claims of these three metals upon the British delegation. In view of the fact that the fall in the price of metals, taking pre-war levels as a guide, has been heavier even than the fall of pastoral and agricultural produce, it was unfortunate that the Australian interest clashed so definitely with that of the British industrialists using our products as rawmaterial. When we urged that the Australian mines might have to cease operations, with consequent heavy unemployment in four States, the British delegation very naturally replied that, unless their manufacturers obtained raw material as cheaply as their foreign rivals, heavy losses and unemployment would certainly ensue in the United Kingdom. We, therefore, had to be content with the retention of the 10 per cent, preference on lead and zinc, and a prohibitive duty of 2d. per lb. on unwrought copper, conditioned with the provision that dominions' metals on first sale in the United Kingdom must be ofiered at prices not exceedingthose ruling in foreign competitive countries. This at least secures, as in the case of wheat, the great British market at world's parity prices, and representatives dominions' interests concerned who were at Ottawa agreed that very little more could be expected. Australian Concessions. I have set out- I hope not in excessive detail-the various benefits which ""were Avon for the Australian primary producer at the Conference, and turn now to the reciprocal concessions which it is proto posed should be made to Britain by the Government of the Commonwealth. In this consideration the first step must to endeavour to estimate the A'alue of prevailing Australian preferences British imports under normal tariff levels, and under normal trading conditions. Throughout the preparation of the case, and at Ottawa, it Avas agreed between the two GoA'ernments that all estimates Will respect to the Australian import trade should be based upon the Australian finanother cial year 1929-30. What represents normal Australian tariff level was not easy to determine, but I venture the vieAv that the protecti\'e tariff as it NA NA 1 IMPORTS BEAR TO TOTAL IMPORTS - YEAR S 1907 AND 1927.

It is true that during those 21 years Britain's relative growth of trade in the' Australian market compares unfavorably AA'ith that Mr Gullett. before the changes made in November of that year-speakin g broadly, of course, and having regard to cost of productionAvas reasonably satisfactory. of the Innumerable attempts have been made to assess the actual annual money value of Australia's preferences to British goods, and the estimates have varied as widely as from Â£3,000,000 to Â£10,000,000. I do not propose to re-engage in an old controversy, but content myself by saying that, if the exhaustive overhaul of the Australian tariff and trade in preparation for the Ottawa Conference gave emphasis one fact more than another, that fact was the remarkable efficacy of our preferences as an aid to British trade in this be market. It is true that, Will the recent the abnormally high tariff levels, and with to exchange and primage added, very many preferences have ceased to serve British interests. But, if one takes, say, the 21year period from 1907-Avhe n Australian preferences Avere first put into effect-to 1927, and compares Britain's relative trade position Will Australia, and Will important countries, excepting only a Now Zealand at the beginning and end of the term, the value of the preferences becomes striking and incontrovertible.

Even so, however, it is remarkable that in most of the great commodities which Britain was able to supply she more than held her relative position, while at the same time showing actual expansion. It was because of the development of trade in such commodities as motor cars, petrol and oils and rubber, in which Britain was either not a competitor at all or a weak competitor, that she showed to some disadvantage in comparative total trade. Moreover, there is this very interesting fact. Britain maintained and developed her position in the Australian market as compared with otlier markets, as I have shown, during 21 years which were marked by an extraordinary development of Australian manufacturing. Some sections of the market were, of course, restricted by this local development, but with the increase in our production and the strengthening of the market generally because of this swift rise of industrial Australia, the general opportunity for British goods continued to expand. With the single exception of India, Australia had been for some years prior to the depression Britain's best overseas market; a remarkable fact in. the light of our small population, due beyond question to the generosity of our preference margins. Impressive also was Australia as a British market as compared with the other self-governing dominions. In 1929 we purchased British goods to the value of Â£54.000,000 as against Â£35,000,000 paid by Canada, Â£32,500,000 by South Africa, and Â£21,400,000 by New Zealand. In the preparation for the Ottawa Conference and in the consideration of the concessions to be made by Australia, we, therefore, were entitled to take into account prevailing preferences and all that they had for many years been doing for Britisli trade, and would do again with the return to prosperity. It may be that it will be found that by the other dominions more new concessions have been made to Britain at Ottawa than were granted by Australia, but, if so, the simple explanation will be that Australia had already carried preferences so far that her capacity for new favours was relatively limited. This can definitely be said. The sub-committee, with the full concurrence of the Governmeut, prepared for the conference in a spirit of the utmost generosity. We endeavoured, as our delegation did afterwards at Ottawa, to give to Britain everything that could be given, subject only to the maintenance of efficient Australian industry and the preservation of vital foreign markets. The British delegation accepted the decision of the Commonwealth Government that amendments of protective duties should be made through the Tariff Board, and that the Australian delegation' was not in a position at Ottawa to engage in arbitrary alterations. That cleared the field for the consideration of Britain's requests for extended margins of preference and for special adjustments upon commodities not produced in Australia and subject only t'o revenue duties. As negotiations proceeded, we agreed to make the tentative preferential formula ,somewhat more attractive by increasing the minimum margin from 12-} per cent, to 15 per cent'., and as adopted it is as follows:British Preferential Margin ot Preference Duty. Per cent. Up to 19 per cent. . . 15 Above 19 per cent, mid up to 29 per cont. .. . . 174 30 per cent, and over . . . . 20 Next we made the concession that the formula should, subject to exceptions, apply not only . to the list of goods originally submitted by the British Government, but also to the whole Australian schedule. The exceptions, which are of special interest, were made in conformity with principles to which I am confident honourable members will subscribe. It may seem strange that we applied this preference to an even larger range of goods than Britain at the outset requested us to do. I am certain that when the British delegation came to Ottawa it had not the faintest intention in the world of granting to us in the Britisli market a preferential position for dominion meat. I do not suggest that there was bargaining over the matter, because there was not. It was, however, because of the re-adjustment of the original points of view that we did not stand by the first, proposal. Taking first those made in Britain's favour, in a number of important cases we carried the minimum preference up to 20 per cent, with the deliberate intention of endeavouring to give to Britain either an important expansion of trade, or new trade, where it was clear that her manufacturers had capacity to supply our market. A good example of this is typewriters. The old duty was British preferential free, and foreign 10 per ceii't., and the main supply came from the United States of America. Under the agreement, the new duties are British preferential free, and foreign 20 per cent. Then on certain specific items with which Australian industry Avas not concerned Ave made preferential adjustments in both the British preferential and the foreign rates of duty. Unfortunately, revenue considerations did not permit of a lowering of British preferential rate3 of duty on more than a feAv non-protective items, but that may, as WQ all hope, be possible at no distant date. Turning to the exceptions in favour of Australia, these were made oti obvious grounds, which on the whole Avere appreciated by the British delegation. If the application of the formula would have increased foreign rates of duty, we did not apply it in cases where already Britain enjoyed practically the whole of the Australian trade, or again in cases where Britain was not in a position to make a reasonable bid for the Australian market. Honourable members will agree that increased duties in such cases would not benefit Britain, while they would be needlessly provocative to foreign interests, and Would increase prices to Australian consumers. In a few cases the preferential margin was not carried up to the standard of the formula, because the commodities represented vital raAV material for Australian industry, or were indispensable in Australian primary production. The important consideration of foreign interests Avas also responsible for anumber of exceptions. The governments of the United Kingdom and of the dominions are completely within their rights in framing their tariffs upon an Empire preferential basis; but, in building up Mr Gullr.1t. our agreements, as much consideration as possible was shoAvn to the interests of foreign trade. In accordance with this attitude, it was agreed that in certain cases in which the prevailing preference Avas beloAv the formula level, no increase should be made, and that in certain other cases in which the preference Avas considerably above the formula, some reduction in the margin might be made. At this stage I do not intend to deal with the future of Australia's foreign trading. On behalf of the Government, however, it may definitely be said that in our vieAv the Australian tariff still presents opportunities for mutually beneficial treaties Will foreign countries, and the Government Avill gladly enter into negotiations to that end. It need scarcely be added that Ave value highly our foreign customers, and realise that oneAvay trade is expensive and impracticable. To give an additional advantage to Britain, the Australian delegation undertook that all existing by-laws issued under the customs tariff should he reviewed in order to include in the tariff many important groups of goods at present admitted under by-laAv. Under present conditions, goods admitted under by-law can be made dutiable at the discretion of the Minister, Avhereas if goods are specifically listed in the tariff, a change in duty can be effected only by action in Parliament, after inquiry and report by the Tariff Board. Honourable members Avill appreciate the feeling of greater security under which British manufacturers will trade in these goods when the change indicated has been made. I need scarcely point out that the new minimum British preference of 15 per cent, in the field of by-laAv admissions Avas the most valuable additional Australian concession made at OttaAva. Mr SCULUN\-What does that mean?",11
27,Mr GULLETT,UNITED KINGDOM AND PERCENTAGE SUCH,"It means that in cases in which by-laAv exemptions are being granted generally in respect of goods not produced in Australia, instead of continuing to grant such exemptions hy ministerial decision A\e propose to r make specific provision in the tariff for the more important groups at the rates operating under the by-law item. If the goods at any time come within the range of Australian industry, a protective duty will be granted.",30
28,Mr BEASLEY,UNITED KINGDOM AND PERCENTAGE SUCH,The concession granted for a purpose.,31
29,Mr GULLETT,UNITED KINGDOM AND PERCENTAGE SUCH,"It really means nothing detrimental to Australian industry. It gives more security and certainty to British manufacturers, as these goods are not being manuf actured in Australia. Who are at present exporting these goods to Australia? We are not granting concessions in respect of goods at present being manufactured in Australia. A further undertaking entered into was that the Commonwealth Government would search out-bot h through the Tariff Board and the customs administration-protecte d fields in industry which are not at present being exploited by Australian manufacturers, and by the refining and reclassification of the tariff schedule make these preferentially available to British industry. Another obligation entered into is that we shall survey the deferred duty policy. In the 1921 tariff a number of deferred duties was inserted, in the hope that the manufacture of many important commodities would be undertaken in Australia. Some of these duties have since then been imposed, but many others have been deferred from time to time, and are still inoperative. Very little investigation has been made into the question whether the establishment of any of these particular industries would be economically justified, or whether the deferred rates were excessive or inadequate. We, therefore, had no hesitation in advising the United Kingdom delegation that the Commonwealth Government woitld delete from the tariff all deferred duties which have no immediate significance to Australian industry. The British delegation urged that the primage duty should be waived in whole or in part against British goods. The request, which was not an unreasonable one, was very sympathetically considered by the Australian delegation, and the Government was consulted. The proposed concession, however, if granted in a measure useful to British trade, would have involved the Treasury in a heavy loss of revenue, and therefore, had to be refused. In article 14 of the agreement, however, was we have undertaken to deal with the matter as soon as the financial situation will permit. At this stage it is desirable that I should deal with those articles of the agreement which bear definitely upon the Australian policy of protection by tariff. In inviting consideration of these articles, I . ask honourable members to bear in mind, first, the declared tariff policy of the present Commonwealth Government, and, next, the position in which the Australian and British delegations found themselves with respect to the Australian tariff schedule as it was during the conference at Ottawa. The main points bearing upon tariff policy are to be found in Articles 9, 10, 11 and 12, and in these articles the Government of the Commonwealth undertakesArticle 9 - That protection by tariff shall be afforded only to those industries which are reasonably assured of sound opportunities for success; Article. 10 - That , the tariff shall be based on the principle that protective duties shall not exceed such a level as will give United Kingdom producers full opportunity of reasonable"" competition on the basis of the relative cost of economical and efficient production; Article 11 - That as soon as practicable existing protective duties shall be reviewed by the Tariff Board in accordance with the principles laid down in Article 10, and that, where necessary, parliamentary action will follow such review; and Article 12 - That no protective duty shall be imposed and no existing duty shall be increased on United Kingdom goods to an amount in excess of the recommendation of the Tariff Board. As the Prime Minister pointed out in this House soon after the agreement was signed at Ottawa, those undertakings are completely consistent with the tariff policy enunciated by him in his policy speech in December last, and as frequently expressed in this chamber. The Government in its policy of protection stands for (a) efficient industry as an essential qualification for tariff shelter; (b) petitive as distinct from a prohibitive tariff level; and (c) tariff making through the Tariff Board and not by arbitrary ministerial action. I will admit that Article 12, which pledges the Government to confine increased duties or new duties against British goods to levels not in excess of the Tariff Board recommendations, appears to break new ground. But in reality it does not do so, for it is merely consequential upon the Prime Minister's declared policy prior to the December elections, that, if returned to power, his Government would not decrease duties without first referring them to the Tariff Board. That assurance was given in the interests of the manufacturers of Australia. This assurance in Article 12 is given in the interests of the primary producers of Australia, who are the immediate beneficiaries under the Ottawa agreement, of which Article 12 is an indispensable condition. Some lionorable members may ask why these declarations of policy are included 'in the agreement at all. They appear in all the agreements; though that is not why they appear in the Australian agreement. They were put into this agreement for a very special reason. Ottawa we asked the British Government at ouce to impose, for our benefit, and against foreign countries, certain duties or restrictions, all of them aiming to improve the British market for outprimary produce, and some of them, as, for example, those applying to meat, to increase prices. In paragraph 2 of Schedule H. of the agreement which deals with meat, the Government of the United Kingdom declares that ""it is essential to take whatever steps may appear feasible to raise the wholesale prices of frozen meat in the United Kingdom market to such a level as will maintain efficient production "". Mr GuUett. The British Government agreed'in a very generous measure to our requests. But, when we came to deal with Britain's request, our position was that, owing to the abnormal level of our tariff due to action in the closing months of 1929, and a com- in the two succeeding years, and to exchange and primage, no scheme of preference margins we could adopt with respect to the protective tariff could open the way for improved Britisli trade; and owing to our policy not to amend the tariff without reference to the Tariff Board, no general amendment of the schedule could be completed before the conference closed. We had, therefore, to ask the Government of the United Kingdom to meet our wishes at once, with the undertaking on our side that, as soon as possible, ancl by the grace of the independent Tariff Board, we would as far as practicable meet its wishes. In the circumstances, the view of the Australian delegation and of the Government was that we could not do less than express specifically in the agreement itself what the present Government's tariff policy with respect to protection is, and I say quite clearly, on behalf of the Australian delegation, that in no other way could the benefits given under the agreement to our primary producers have been obtained.",31
30,Mr FENTOK,UNITED KINGDOM AND PERCENTAGE SUCH,Did not our 25 years' preference to Great Britain count for anything at this conference?,32
31,Mr GULLETT,UNITED KINGDOM AND PERCENTAGE SUCH,"I shall not be able At to deal with that aspect of the subject today; but on a future occasion I shall state what I consider to be the benefits that Australia has received as an offset to the preferences she has granted to Great Britain. At the moment, I shall content myself with observing that our industrial position and wage standards are wholly due to our White Australia policy, and that this policy could not have been maintained for any time had it not been for the might of Great Britain. That is what we have received in exchange for our preferences. As we were not in a position at Ottawa to amend the protective tariff, we gave assurances as part of the agreement as to tlte principles which would guide the Commonwealth Government in the consideration of the amendments desired by Britain. The advantages bestowed upon Britain by the treaty fall into three classes. are, first, the prevailing preferences are now operating strongly in favour of British trade in the lower revenue and free levels of the tariff. Next, there are the generally increased preferences granted at Ottawa, which should immediately stimulate imports from Britain, and especially those coming in free or under revenue duties, and under other duties which are not of a prohibitive nature. Finally, there is the progressive benefit, which will accrue as the depression lifts, and as the Tariff Board proceeds with its work of revision, and there is a general return to what I have described as a normal tariff level.",32
32,Mr SCULLIN,UNITED KINGDOM AND PERCENTAGE SUCH,"""What does that mean?",33
33,Mr GULLETT,UNITED KINGDOM AND PERCENTAGE SUCH,"-It means approximately the level that was struck by the Tariff Board in the schedule of reductions which I tabled in this House in February on references submitted to the board by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Forde), when he was Minister for Trade and Customs.

37,Mr SCULLIN,UNITED KINGDOM AND PERCENTAGE SUCH,Then let the Minister for Health (Mr Marr) remain silent. I asked a reasonable question.,33
38,Mr GULLETT,UNITED KINGDOM AND PERCENTAGE SUCH,"My reply to the question is that we declared our tariff policy before the delegation left Ottawa, and that that policy implies the revision of the tariff schedule through the Tariff Board.",33
39,Mr SCULLIN,UNITED KINGDOM AND PERCENTAGE SUCH,And a downward revision!,33
40,Mr GULLETT,UNITED KINGDOM AND PERCENTAGE SUCH,Who said so?,33

42,Mr GULLETT,UNITED KINGDOM AND PERCENTAGE SUCH,I am perfectly satisThese fied with the downward tendency that which ran through the Tariff Board recommendations during the administration of the right honourable gentleman's Government.,33
43,Mr SCULLIN,UNITED KINGDOM AND PERCENTAGE SUCH,Why not leave our schedules alone?,33
44,Mr GULLETT,UNITED KINGDOM AND PERCENTAGE SUCH,"Bearin g in mind the great capacity displayed by Australia in the years preceding the depression as a purchaser of British goods, it is reasonable to anticipate that under the improved competitive position Britain will enjoy in future, she will be a considerable beneficiary as the result of the treaty. I have no doubt, too, that the preferences expressed through the tariff for goods of United Kingdom origin will be reinforced by the sentimental preference of the Australian people. I am confident that sentimental preference for commodities of Australian origin will run strongly in our favour in the United Kingdom. Dominions and Colonies. Advantage for Australian exports in the markets of the United Kingdom was, as I have said, necessarily the main objective of the delegation. We strongly hoped, however, that we would also find time and opportunity for the making of both improved and new trading agreements with the dominions and the Crown colonies. To this end much preparatory work was carried out in Australia before the delegation sailed, and consideration was given to a list of suggested Australian concessions submitted by the Secretary of State for the Colonies. The New Zealand position was fully for discussed with the delegation from that dominion during the voyage to Canada and at Ottawa. The possibilities of improving Australian trade with each of the oither dominions and colonies was explored again and again in the closest detail. But the magnitude of the major negotiation with the British delegation, and particularly the prolonged discussions upon the meat problem, made it impracticable to give to trade with the dominions the full time and industry necessary to complete, as we so much wished to do, the chain of new or improved agreements right round the Empire. We did, however, with slight exceptions, succeed in bringing to a conclusion a tentative agreeColonies ment with the Crown Colonies as a whole. Wc also carried to its final stage, except for signature by the Prime Minister of Newfoundland, an agreement with that dominion. With respect to the otlier dominions, much useful work was accomplished which will, I trust, lead to actual new agreements, or to better existing agreements at an early date. A matter for particular regret was that the negotiations with the representatives of the dominion of India, although carried on in an excellent atmosphere, could not be brought to the decisive stage. On both sides, however, we have undertaken to continue the exploration. The cities of India-and this applies to Eastern Asia and to the colonies-contai n great numbers of people with incomes capable of considerable purchasing power. Everywhere old traditions and prejudices with respect to diet and clothing tire rapidly weakening. Modern, science and mechanism as expressed in the wireless, the film, aircraft and the motor car are spreading, western influences and habits among all the relatively backward races, and the result can scarcely fail to be of increasing profit to a great primary producing country like Australia. The Government will spare no effort to secure a preferential arrangement with India which would justify our exporters in a sustained effort to win a profitable place in that market. The Secretary of State for the Colonies, Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister, negotiated on our turn. behalf of the colonies as a whole, or at least for all of those which are empowered to grant preferences. In each case, how55 ever, the arrangements arrived at have to be endorsed by the local legislature other governing authority in the partiBritain's cular colony concerned. Provision, therefore, is made in the tariff schedule now submitted to the House for the new Mr (iuUclt. concessions which are specifically made for the colonies to be brought into effect by proclamation as advice is received that the colonies have endorsed the action taken by the Secretary of State. A consideration of importance with respect to the conditional concessions the House is asked to make to the Crown is that the British delegation at an early stage in our negotiations made it clear that such concessions would be taken into the general account also as concessions to the TJnited Kingdom. In other words, the granting of some of the concessions to the colonies contributed very usefully to the larger agreement made in the interests of Australian primary producers with Britain. Despite this, however, I think that the actual preferences in our favour provided under the agreement with the colonies will prove full recompense for the benefits conceded by the Commonwealth. A somewhat remarkable feature about, the tariffs of the many British Crown Colonies is that most of them have for many years been granting very helpful margins of preference to the British Empire as a whole, including Australia. On the other hand, the Commonwealth at no time has given preferential treatment to the colonies, and has denied them participation in the preferences granted to Britain. Eor many years, therefore, the curious position prevailed that we gave preferences to Britain without trade reciprocity from her, and that the colonies gave preferences to Australia without reciprocity from us. It was clear that in these circumstances we were called upon, in the first instance, to grant sufficient preferences to the colonies to secure the continuance of existing preferences in our favour, and that having done that, if we wished for further concessions, we had to make additional concessions in A survey of the trade of no fewer than individual colonies, great and small, serves to remind us of the amazing and or fascinating range and diversity of world-wide colonial possessions. Honourable members may differ as to the future trading possibilities for Australia' with this multitude of colonies. I am disposed to place it high, aud to venture the opinion that if the Commonwealth applies itself with interest and capacity danger. to the development of this particular branch of trade, it will prove remarkably profitable for Australian industries, both primary and secondary. Under the agreement between Australia and the Crown colonies, we receive no fewer than 42 new and increased preferences. These apply in the main flour, frozen and canned meat, bacon and hams, fresh, dried ancl canned butter, condensed and powdered milk, wine and brandy and foodstuff manufactures such as biscuits, confectionery jams. Beyond question, one of the straining influences upon trade between the Commonwealth and the colonies and many other countries has been the absence of direct shipping communications. ConBroadly sideration was given to this problem, the Government will continue to prosecute it. While at Ottawa, tentative arrangeformula ments were made for the line of steamers which now trades between Australia the North Atlantic eastern coast to six times a year at St. John, in New Brunswick, and also, we hope, at the Bahamas, in the West Indies. should reduce the cost of transport to considerable market in Eastern Canada, and will give us direct contact with West Indies, where, with the assistance of the new preferences, trade prospects become distinctly bright. If the agreement is endorsed, F i should also offer sound opportunities for increased Australian exports. Honourable members will recall that our trading position there has weakened in recent years because, although Australian ports were given preference over foreign goods, they were, in many America, instances, dutiable at a rate higher than the products of the United Kingdom, Now Zealand and Canada. This crimination is removed under ment, and Australia is to receive most favoured nation treatment. Of . Fiji's total imports of Â£1,220,000 in 1930, Ausimproved tralia contributed no less than Â£450,000, and with the improved preference, proment, gress should be substantial. Failure have reached an agreement with F i j i Ottawa would have lost.us the partial preference we now enjoy, and the valuable existing trade would have been placed in Malaya, however, promises perhaps the best colonial field for an expansion of Australian trade. In 1929-30 our exports to British M!alaya were valued at Â£1,400,000, and with the valuable brandy concession to which I have referred, and a number of other increased preferences, to notably upon butter, the market there should be one worth vigorous exploitation fruits, by our exporting interests. Happily, most of the products of the and colonies are of a kind not produced in re Australia, and in making the proposed concessions in return for the benefits to be received there is not, with two or three exceptions, any clash of interests. speaking, we grant to the colonies and on specified commodities the same margins of preference that apply in the adopted for the United Kingdom consideration, but, in addition, the and agreement provides for a few special call concessions. Beginning with the West Indies, it is proposed to provide a preferential margin of 5s. per gallon on This rum and bitters. So far as rum is cona cerned, that still leaves a protectiye margin of 6s. a gallon for Australian the rum. For many years that margin was only 3s., and there is not, I think, the least danger to local industry in the change. Bitters is not produced in Australia. The * island of Trinidad is a j i heavy producer of asphalt. At present asphalt is admitted to Australia free of duty. A duty of 10 per cent, is proposed upon the foreign product and upon substitutes, with free entry from Trinidad. imMost of our imports are now drawn from some Mexico and the United States of where they are derived from the residue of mineral oils, and it is anticipated that the competition will continue disto prevent a noticeable increase in the the agreeAustralian selling price. I have indicated the very definitely prospects which F i j i holds out for Australian trade iinder the agreeand the danger to - existing Austo tralian trade if no agreement had been at reached. This was obtained only hy concessions in return, and it is provided that Australia will permit, at the old duty rate of 2s. 6d. a central, the import of not more than 40,000 centals of Fijian bananas a year, to be divided between the markets of Sydney and Melbourne. The present duty is Ss. 4d. Australia's production of bananas amounts to 2,300,000 bushels a year, so that the contemplated quantity from F i j i should not impair the interests of local growers. In the interests of British North Borneo, the agreement preferentially restores the old duty of 10 per cent, upon log timber, and the same concession will apply to the British Solomons, where an Australian company controls the milling and export. In return for the really rich brandy preference and other concessions from Malaya, the Australian delegation undertook to raise no objection if Canada reduced the duty of 3 cents a lb. against Malayan pineapples to 1 cent. At tion present under the Canadian-Australian treaty, Australian pineapple is dutiable at 1 cent, Malayan at 3 cents, and foreign at 5 cents. The Malayan proofficial duct is definitely inferior in quality the Australian, and finds its sale in different class market. Already the Aussubject-matter tralian pineapple has made extraordinary headway at the expense of the United States of America and Hawaii, and there is still an excellent prospect of further progress. The delegation made the cession, however, with reluctance, and only because of the exceptional j} resent richness and sound promise of the pay Malayan market for a wide range of AusDeputy-Comptroller tralian primary produce, and because it was made vital both to the continuance of existing Malayan preferences in our favour and to the extensions obtained. The remaining preferences proposed to Ottawabe given to the colonies by the Commonwealth present no exceptional features and, generally speaking, apply to commodities not produced in Australia. Appreciation. The Australian delegation at Ottawa, including the six accredited representatives of industry and commerce, was in numbers one of the smallest at the conference, and in consideration of the relative interests at stake, it was quite the Mr Gullett. smallest. The full and true .value of the work accomplished cannot yet be assessed, hut at least it can be said that no delegation was served more faithfully and effectively by its consultants or by its official staff. The consultants, the Honourable W. C. Angliss, M.L.C., and Messrs. M. B. Duffy, R. W. Knox, S. MCKay, H . W. Osborne, and F. H . Tout, by reasou of their wide and intimate knowledge of the interests they represented, and their generous disposition at all times to take the large view, and to give us of their best, proved of invaluable assistance. This was the first occasion upon which special interests were called to Australia's aid at an Imperial Conference, and the experiment proved a shining success. I have no words which would adequately express the sense of admirawhich Mr Bruce and I feel towards the members of the official staff. These Australian public servants excelled, I venture to say, in comparison with other staffs at Ottawa, in the remarkto able range and thoroughness of their a knowledge of the great and widely varied of the conference. Night was as day to them in their labours, and their weeks were without end. In greatly serving Australia, they upheld the best contraditions of the Service which they adorn. Beyond_a natural desire, because of the ministerial position I occupy, to a special tribute to Mr Abbott, the of Customs, I would not wish to distinguish between them, but would ask to be permitted to place their names on record in the order in which they appeared in the official list at Dr A. E. V. Richardson, Professor of Agriculture, University of Adelaide. Mr E. Abbott, Deputy Comptroller General, Department of Trade and Customs. Mr J. F. Murphy, Prime Minister's Department, Secretary of the Delegation. Mr F. L. MCDougall, C.M.G., Economic Adviser to the Commonwealth of Australia in London. Mr L. R. Macgregor, Australian Trade Commissioner in Canada. Mr L. E. Stevens, Department of Commerce. Mr C. B. Carter, Department of Commerce. Mr A. C. Moore, Department of Trade and Customs. Mrs F. M. Grant, Private Secretary to the Minister for Trade and Customs. Mr G. Tindale, New York Staff, Commonwealth Customs Department. Mr J. TJ. Garside, New York Staff, Australian Secretary's Office. The thanks of the Commonwealth Government are due to the University of Adelaide and the Waite Institute in South Australia for its courtesy in making available to the delegation the services of its distinguished director, Dr A. E. Y. Richardson. Dr Richardson proved an invaluable and indefatigable ally. One other name should be included, that of Mr J. B. Cumming, the senior Commonwealth Customs Officer in London, whose keen and talented work in association with Mr MCDougall prior to the conference was of much assistance to the delegation, I desire also, on behalf of the delegato tion, to acknowledge our great indebtedthe ness to the late Minister for Commerce, the lionorable member for ""Wakefield, who out of his comprehensive and exact knowthink, ledge of Australian primary industry tributed inestimably to the preparation for the conference. We felt that in going to Ottawa without the honourable memthe ber we were at a serious disadvantage; but the agreement most definitely carries the stamp of his rare abilities. Conclusion. Of the preferences obtained by tralia as a whole, it will be agreed they confer upon the primary producers of Australia benefits which are equal the anticipations of the delegation and of the Government. They bring reciprocal preferential trade into practice on a broad basis, from which it can, from time to time, be expanded as necessity arises, and opportunity offers. They give to our pastoralists and farmers a substantial advantage in the world's one great import market for perishable primary produce over all competitive pastoralists and farmers outside the Empire. They apply, not to the produce of new industries which have to be pioneered into existence, but to a wide range of great established industries in heavy production, and to industries most of which have, down to this depression period, been carried on without the new advantage they are now to enjoy. These preferences so generously granted by Britain even in her hour of great economic trouble will, I confidently believe, go far towards enabling our primary producers to survive their present difficulties and, as better times return to us, they will play a great part in the general intensification and expansion of all our rural activities. I am sure that none of us who engaged in the work at Ottawa believes for a moment that we have completely succeeded. The conference lasted for four weeks and two days. The trade of the world-wide British Empire, which we had in detail to consider, is a mighty and most various and complex fabric; and beyond the trade of the Empire we had consider, and frequently also in detail, trade of many foreign countries. This agreement marks, I venture to the initiation of a policy of reciproconcal preferential trading which will at once begin to contribute to the dissipation of the depression which broods over British Empire in common with the rest of the world. Its beneficial effects will be progressive aud cumulative. In its present form it will prove a strong and growing instrument, ever working for increased production, employment and prosperity throughout the lands which make up the Empire. Moreover, it is.an Ausinstrument which in the hands of symthat pathetic and co-operating governments will surely be from time to time expanded to and improved. As it stands it is, doubtless, not perfect. It would be remarkable indeed if no mistakes had been made in the brief month's work at Ottawa. But this can be claimed for the agreement between the Commonwealth and ' the United Kingdom and the colonies, that it carries tangible aids and benefits to all sorts and conditions of the peoples of the contracting countries, but it carries hurt or prejudices or sacrifices to none. The agreement will benefit all sorts and conditions of people, and in a collective sense will make stronger both the Commonwealth and the United Kingdom. That which makes Australia stronger generally and adds in a general way to the strength of Britain must commend itself to this House and to the Australian people. But the Australian delegation, with the full support of the Commonwealth Government, aimed at something nearer and more definite than a general benefit either to Australia or to the United Kingdom. Prom the beginning of the preparation for Ottawa until the conference elosed we worked for specific benefits for our primary producers. We worked in the belief that in the fashioning of tariff in this country the man on the land and his employees had hitherto come off second best. They have been given, it is true, compensatory duties and arrangements in an endeavour to balance them up, and with respect to the local Australian market that policy has been attended hy some success. But with respect to the great export surplus of primary production, the man on the land, and those who work for him, have been, to state it mildly, somewhat overlooked in the past by this Parliament. It is scarcely an exaggeration to say that hitherto this Parliament has been in tariff and industrial legislation a two-standard Parliament-on e standard for the cities and another standard, .a very much inferior standard, for the country. This Ottawa agreement which I now submit to the House makes an attempt, belated it is true, but a sincere, construcin tive and comprehensive attempt, to adjust that unfair balance. It proclaims, in the first place, the inherent right of the country people of Australia and their industries to equal economic consideration with the city people and secondary industries in this Parliament. Next it recogMr Gv.UeU. nizes the desperate plight of all who are engaged in primary industry at the present time, and ' their imperative claims to assistance and relief. It is an acknowledgment, too, of the plain unchallengeable truth that, had it not been for the magnificent fortitude and industry of our farmers and pastoralists, and their unprecedented production and export during these years of adversity, there must have been a total collapse of our whole financial ancl industrial structure, with a calamitous further increase of unemployment, with money available neither for its relief nor for the maintenance of our great social services. We owe our financial, industrial and economic salvation during this crisis to the man on the land. This agreement has been drawn in aid of the man on the land, but it has the supreme merit that if we can help the man on the land we help every agency of industry and business and employment in the Commonwealth. This charter of rural aid could be a thousand times justified even if it provided for the curbing of other Australian interests to the advantage of primary industry. But it does not do so. It does not reduce the protective level of our Australian tariff. It does not call upon the Australian Government to reduce that level. On the contrary, although it does not reduce the protective level against British imports, it very generally increases the protective level against foreign imports. It may be said that that is done in the interests of the British, industrialist; in reality it is done in the interests of the Australian primary producer. But in any case the Australian manufacturer has his protective level raised over hundreds of duties against the foreign manufacturer, whose competition is more to be feared than that of Britain because of lower foreign costs. I commend the agreement to the House, the interests of Australia, and of the Empire as a whole, but particularly do I ask all parties to subscribe to it in the interests of our primary producers, for whom in the main it was fashioned.

Vehicles parts, viz.:In. all there are four resolutions, the main tariff resolution, special duties proposals, primage duty resolution, and customs tariff Canadian preference proposals. The main tariff resolution is a completely new tariff, incorporating the unaltered portion of the 1921-28 tariff, and the tariff resolutions tabled in this Souse during the course of the present year. It gives effect to the formula margin of preference and other changes that were agreed to hy the Australian delegation at the Ottawa Conference. The application of the formula has resulted in an increase in the general tariff over a large number of items. There are some 440 items and sub-items under which immediate increases are being imposed under the general tariff. It is interesting to observe the number of increases at the various margins. They are as follow:NA GENERAL TARIF F.

(6) Assembled ad val. 35 per cent. A detailed examination, of the new schedule will make it clear, as I have already emphasized in my speech on the Ottawa agreement, that with one or two unimportant exceptions, the level of the protective items of the tariff has been maintained, and the Government has adhered to its policy not to reduce the protective level without inquiry by the Tariff Board. The total number of reductions is 26, 20 under the British preferential and six under the general tariff. Nearly all of these reductions are made to items which have no protective significance, while others are adjustment of anomalies - which would have been effected at the first opportunity, and are not connected with the Ottawa settlement. The summary of alterations furnished to honourable members shows the items affected and the classes of goods on ""which increased or reduced duties will operate. A notable departure from the previous Extent of tariff schedule is the reversion to a twoincrease. column tariff. From 1907 to 1921 the Specific Rates. Australian tariff was a two-column one. In the latter year a three-column tariff "" *Â» it was established by the introduction of â the intermediate column, for the purpose â of enabling the Commonwealth to ,.. negotiate trade treaties with foreign 15 .., 17} â countries. Apart from granting to Canada a small number of rates under this tariff, the intermediate tariff was inoperative. In these circumstances was decided to delete this column and to adopt the practice of bringing down bills covering any trade treaties which may in the future be negotiated with foreign countries. In my speech on the Ottawa agreement, I mentioned the Government's policy in this regard, and I do not propose to cover the ground again. It might be stated, however, that reservations were made by the Australian delegation at Ottawa concerning the existing margins of preference under a number of important items. It will be observed from the wording of the tariff resolution that the concessions which the Commonwealth is prepared to make to the colonies will be put into effect by proclamation. It has been necessary to adopt this course as the individual colonies have not yet intimated their decisions with regard to the requests made by Australia. The most important change effected by the primage resolution is the re-imposition of the 10 per cent, primage duty on galvanized iron. It will be recollected that on the 1st September last a tariff resolution was introduced which reduced the duty on this commodity by Â£1 per ton. This was in accordance with a recommendation of the Tariff Board. At the same time, a proclamation was issued removing the primage duty on galvanized iron. However, in making its recommendation for a lower duty, and arriving at the protection necessary, the Tariff Board had taken into account the fact that primage and exchange were operating. The effect of the reduction in duty combined with the removal of the primage was to expose the local industry to unreasonable competition. The attention of the Tariff Board was invited to the matter, and it reported that had the primage duty not been in operation when it' submitted its report it would have recommended higher duties, to the extent of 30s. per ton. As the matter is one of first class importance and highly controversial, I propose to ask that the following memorandum received from the chairman of the Tariff Board on this point be incorporated in Hansard. [Leave granted.] Mr Gullett. COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA. it Commonwealth Tariff Board, Commonwealth Offices, Treasury Gardens, Melbourne, C.2. 10th September, 1932. MEMORANDUM.

The re-imposition of the primage duty will give effect to the Tariff Board recommendation in regard to better quality iron. Other exemptions from primage are dips, washes and drenches, for livestock, and materials for use in the manufacture of such goods. Previously, sheep washes and sheep dips only were exempted. Chemicals to be used in the recovery of metals by certain processes are also exempted. Hitherto the exemption has applied only to chemicals used in the recovery of gold. In addition, postage stamps, fishing nets, and books and periodicals for State parliamentary libraries are exempted under the present resolution. The special duties resolution providing for a 50 per cent, surcharge maintains the existing position, and no alterations are made by it. The Canadian resolution does not amend the existing Canadian agreement; it merely ensures its continuance in the form in which the agreement was ratified by Parliament last year. Perhaps it would not be out of place to mention that the negotiations conducted by the Australian delegation with a view to the extension of the treaty with Canada, are still proceeding.

46,Mr LYONS,TOTAL IMMEDIATE INCREASES I N,"Wilmot-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [8.0] - by leave I desire to make a brief announcement to the House with regard to an alteration in the personnel of the Government. Recently, as honourable members know, the then Minister for Commerce, the Honourable C. A. S - that Hawker, tendered his resignation as a member of the Government, and for the time being I was sworn in as Minister for Commerce. A few days ago I received from the Postmaster-General, the lionorable J. E. Fenton, an intimation of his intention to relinquish his portfolio. This resignation has now been accepted by His Excellency the Governor General. I now desire to inform honourable members of the following appointments to the Ministry:-The Honourable Robert Archdale Parkhill has been appointed Postmaster-General; the Honourable John Arthur Perkins has been appointed Minister of State for the Interior; the honourable member for Parramatta, Mr. Frederick Harold Stewart, has been appointed Minister of State for Commerce; the honourable member for Bass, Mr James Allan Guy, has been appointed as an Assistant Minister.

47,Mr CASEY,TOTAL IMMEDIATE INCREASES I N,"Corio) [8.4] - On a recent occasion in this chamber, and previously in the press, the right honourable the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Scullin) claimed that the fiscal measures taken by his Government a year or eighteen months ago were responsible for righting the trade balance. I realise that one takes on a doughty opponent when one crosses swords with the Leader of the Opposition, but on the basis of the relating to imports during the last two or three years, I beg to doubt whether his claim can be substantiated. The claim itself is interesting, in view of the fact that it runs counter to the orthodox view of those who have studied this question for years- I refer principally to the leading economists of this and other countries , in the long run, imports are determined by exports, which are a measure of the purchasing power of the community. It is interesting to analyse the figures of the last two years in order to see which theory, theirs, or that of the Leader of the Opposition, is borne out in practice. As honourable members know, imports into this country are divided between dutiable and free goods in almost equal proportion. The important upward tariff schedules of the Scullin Government were completed by June, 1930, so that we can regard 1931 as the first Sculliu tariff year. Bearing in mind that imports are divided practically equally between dutiable and free goods, one might expect, if the right honourable gentleman's contention is to be borne out in practice, that there would be a remarkable decline in the volume of dutiable imports, and a much less noticeable decline .in the volume of free imports. If one were to hazard a guess, one might suggest that there might be a decline of from 70 per cent, to 80 per cent, in the volume of dutiable imports, due to the almost prohibitive tariff of the Scullin Government, and a decrease of 20 per cent, or 30 per cent, in the free imports. The Statistician's figures, however, show something very different. Taking 1929-30 as the last Bruce-Page Government tariff year, and 1930-31 as the first complete Scullin Government tariff year, we find that the total imports in the latter period were lower by 53.7 per cent., dutiable imports being lower by 55 per cent., and free imports by 51.8 per cent. Taking the next two years, 1930-31 and 1931-32, the total imports were down by 27.7 per cent., the figures for dutiable imports being 28.2 per cent, down, and for free imports, 27 per cent. There is a remarkable resemblance in these figures, free and the dutiable imports declining by almost Â°vactly the same percentage in both the years under notice; and it is the more remarkable when we bear in mind the right honourable gentleman's repeated claim that his Government's fiscal measures determined the volume of imports into this country. X think we get a hint at this stage that the purchasing power of the Australian community, rather than the height of the tariff wall, determines the volume of imports. I think it would be nearer the truth to say that the trade balance was more speedily righted by the extreme fiscal measures of the late Government. There are two points of criticism that may be directed at this contention of mine, and it is well that I should forestall them. Firstly, I remind honourable members that in November, 1930, a number of items, including cotton piece goods, cutlery, tea, and rubber, were transferred from the free list to the dutiable list through a revenue tariff being imposed on them. In that way, imports valued at Â£2,250,000 were transferred from the free list to the dutiable list. If I - weight these figures against myself, it means a 4 per cent, addition to the decline of dutiable imports, and a correspondingly smaller importation of free goods-no t a very great percentage in view of the similarity of imports in both divisions to which I have previously drawn attention. Secondly, it may be supposed that when the high duties were imposed, the public, - by reason of the necessity for economy, would to still One cotton, is, the myself Even however, be ports clino no is goods not tween switch admit, validity decline think might ofthan weighting of in the dutiable, linen, adutiable woollen less levelled I Mr. noticeable aoffrom searched of expect those striking that cotton, against is Casey. myor pre-Scullin tariff years. The most that can rightly be claimed by the right honourable gentleman is that his Government's very high tariff wall hastened the righting of the trade balance, rather than that it was the primary cause of that result. For what his Government did, he should be given credit; but I submit that the credit due to him should be limited to that extent. The figures confirm the orthodox view that, in the long run, imports are determined by the volume of exports, which are the measure of the purchasing power of the community. But even that statement must be qualified. I realise that in any one year of low exports, the banks are quite willing to finance imports, possibly to the extent of Â£10,000,000; '! mention that amount after consultation with those who have knowledge of these matters. Moreover, in these times of high exchange, British exporters are willing to leave a considerable proportion of their funds in Australia, pending the hone of a return to lower exchange rates. I gather from the banks that the sum involved might be about Â£10,000,000 per annum. Taking those two factors-the financing by the banks in years of low exports, and British funds remaining in this country-w e could have a volume of imports in excess of exports to the extent of about Â£20,000,000 a year. But that state of affairs would not last for more than nine or twelve months; it would almost certainly be adjusted within a year. The virtue of the Scullin Government tariff was that it cut off imports suddenly, aud so righted the trade balance just when it was necessary that that should be done. For its prompt action in that direction, the Scullin Government is entitled to full credit; but it should not claim credit for more than it did. Any other Government would have taken somewhat similar emergency action at that time. The New Zealand position is also an addition to my argument. New Zealand has a comparatively low exchange-it is about 10 per cent, against the dominion - and a relatively low tariff. The sister dominion being chiefly a primary producing country, has been particularly hard hit by economic conditions; nevertheless, New Zealand balanced its external trade last year. It is true that it borrowed or small, smaller examples woollen two any piece silk and the highly similarity my aprincipal linen, free goods free, the other piece and and dutiable and directions-and decline lists, decline argument piece items. of does the contention-there imports goods. criticism and in that in goods; in in goods silk not favour can the Ithe against Scullin as There affect piece have, Ikind. contention. of imbut find dedo becan Â£4,000,000 or Â£5,000,000 by means of treasury-bills in London, but even without them, its external trade balance has been righted without recourse to any excessive fiscal measures.' I claim that is an addition to my argument that the real factor in righting a nation's trade balance is the purchasing power of its people. The remarks of the Leader of the Opposition on the subject of the exchange rate were so interesting that I should like to pursue that subject a little. During recent months, representations have been made on behalf of various sections of the community that the exchange rate should be either raised or lowered, or that it should be placed under some degree of political control. As to whether it should be raised or lowered, I have no definite view to place before the committee. No individual without access to the full facts can express an opinion on the subject that is worth attention. ever, self interest has never debarred people from expressing their views on ' this subject, notwithstanding that they should be expressed only by those who have a full knowledge of all the factors entering into the situation. When I speak of the exchange rain I refer to the Australian-sterling exchange rate. Our currency is linked with sterling, in that all our commercial and financial dealings with the rest of the world are carried out through the medium of sterling. An Australian merchant who does business with a foreign country, such as Italy, must pay for Italian goods in Italian lire. He has first to buy British sterling, aud then, possibly unconsciously, to purchase Italian lire. It is a two-fold operation. We, in Australia, are generally dependent on two variables-the Australiansterling exchange rate and the sterlingother currency exchange rate. I have tried to get a quantitative estimate of how important a thing to us the exchange rate is, and I have set myself two questions: What proportion of our Australian primary production is exported, and so affected by the exchange rate? What proportion of our dealings is influenced by the Australian exchange rate, and what proportion by the sterling-gold or other currency rate? The statistics show that 42 per cent, of our recorded primary production in 1930-31 was exported; and I am also mindful of the fact that the domestic price level in Austhis tralia of primary production is affected by the exchange rate which thus has a wider range than that of the export market. So that something close to half of our recorded primary production is directly affected by the exchange rate,, and a larger proportion indirectly affected. . On an analysis as to where our exports go in the world, one finds 1 that, roughly speaking, one-third of them go to countries that are still on the gold standard, and two-thirds to countries that are off the gold standard, and have approximately the currency level of sterling. Thus, we have confirmation of the fact that the depreciation of the Australian pound is definitely an important factor in our How- economy, in that nearly one-half of our production is affected directly, and a greater proportion indirectly, by the depreciation of the Australian pound; also that of the two variables, the Australian-sterling rate and the sterlingother currency rate, the more important is the former. We can therefore say with assurance that this matter is one of great public importance to this country. It is not surprising, therefore, that certain interests have been trying to get the exchange rate under political control, but the various sectional in terests operating in this regard are actuated by diametrically opposing motives; but I shall return to thislater. At the present time, the question of the level at which exchange rate is fixed, is determined solely by the Board of Directors of the Commonwealth Bank. The exchange rate could be made a powerful weapon of sectional patronage, and it is well, therefore, that the rate is determined by the bank with no obligation to this Parliament, this Government, the trading banks, the Bank of England, or any one else. The Commonwealth Bank Board, in coming to its determination, has access to a wider field of information than has any other individual body in this country. It takes into account all financial and economic factors; it makes its decisions in the terest of the whole of the people, and not of any section. The board is, happily, I think, entirely divorced all sectional or political pressure, long may such an arrangement reseasons, main ! What are the factors that inour fluence the Commonwealth Bank Board in coming to its determination? I sugto gest that there are six principal conthe siderations. The first, and possibly the most important, is that of commercial supply and demand, which is dictated from time to time by the balance of imseasonal ports and exports. The second is the vernment demand for sterling for debt free service abroad. These two factors constiject tute what is normally known as the visible balance of trade, and are admittedly the most important considerations. The third factor is the necessity for building up in London a fightbuffer ing fund to defend our currency gainst seasonal attack. The fourth point is the consideration of the price level in this country, which is definitely affected by the exchange rate. The fifth the interests of primary producers who are decidedly benefited by a high change. The sixth factor is that it the interests of the whole community, porters, exports, and the Government, that the exchange rate should not be subject to sudden ups and downs, but should advance on a smooth curve, so future. far as possible, in the interests of trading stability. Let me now examine these factors in little more detail. The first two, the visible trade balance-the commercial plus and minus-and the Government's requirecourses ments in London, are the only factors are capable of exact calculation. A ll the others are less clear cut, and their evaluasteady. tion is more a matter of opinion and seldom judgment. Referring to my third point - wha t value of sterling credits does Australia need in London as a seasonal buffer-in the pre-depression period that we were pleased to regard as normal times,' the Australian balance in Lonreasonable don was usually about Â£25,000,000. In addition to that, we had another fund in Australia of equal value, and of almost equal availability, in the form of the gold reserve to the note issue .which, in those days, was Mr CIISUI/. in- Â£45,000,000. This, in addition to the Â£25,000,000 in London, made a total of aJbout Â£70,000,000 sterling, - which was from available to Australia as a seasonal and buffer to take up the slack in bad when there might be a run on Australian currency. Those London funds were needed, and are still needed, hold our exchange steady, to smooth curve over several years. In Australia we are unavoidably exposed to the vicissitudes of the seasons. The money for our primary products come3 in on a basis, and goes out during the rest Goof the year. If the exchange rate were to find its own level, it would be subto sudden ups and downs which would dislocate business, but owing to the existence of a relatively large accumulation of funds in London, we have a spring or shock absorber to take up the slack between in-seasous and outseasons. This buffer in London has been very greatly depleted in recent times. Our London funds are now well under is Â£20,000,000, ancl our gold reserve in Australia is down to Â£10,000,000, so that we exhave now little more than one-third is in of what we previously held. That imbuffer must be built up again, and the obligation ou the part of the Commonwealth Bunk Board to rebuild it will have a definite effect on exchange in the I now come to the effect of exchange on price levels in Australia. Honourable members who comprise the official Opposia tion frequently quote the Macmillan report. As I read that document, one of its main contentions is that there are two which may be followed-eithe r that the external exchange rate can be kept steady, or internal price levels can be kept The inference I draw is that it is possible for a country to serve both those gods. But in the last twelve months, since the Commonwealth Bank Board has had complete control of the exchange rate, we have been fortunate enough to have stability in external exchange and stability also of our internal wholesale price levels. That is a most remarkable thing. Australia is almost unique in this respect. Honourable members may not be willing - to give the whole credit for that admirable result about to the Commonwealth Bank Board; but they must give a considerable measure of the credit to the board. As to the effect of the exchange rate on the primary producers, there is no doubt that a high exchange rate means more Australian pounds to our exporters, and as I have tried to point out, to a lesser degree to others, but I maintain that our primary producers vary greatly in their need for an exchange bonus. A high exchange gives an equal exchange benefit to all primary producers-thos e who are needy and those who are not so needy. A high exchange rate, like a water-sprinkler, benefits all, irrespective of individual needs; it is definitely more than fair to some, and much less than fair to others.  on the just and the unjust.",121
48,Mr CASEY,TOTAL IMMEDIATE INCREASES I N,"Yes. While it waters some parts of the garden which may be parched, it also waters other parts which are relatively flourishing. There is a serious doubt, I think, whether the wool growers, who are the greatest buttress of this community, are deriving the whole or even an appreciable proportion of the benefit from the high exchange rate. Even among themselves, opinion is divided on that matter. It has been said that the fact that the wool sales are held here militates against the growers getting the ' benefit of the exchange premium, and this doubt is reinforced by the experience of many European countries, during the decade after the war. The outstanding fact during the first period of inflation was that the products of the country sold within the country fetched less and less in gold the exchange rate went up. I submit, but not in any dogmatic way, that it is quite possible that our wool-growers, with an increased exchange rate up to Â£135 or Â£140, would not get all or possibly any of that increased benefit. I do not think that it is in any way proven that they would. My last point relates to the necessity for avoiding the ups aud downs in exchange rates at short intervals. If the exchange were free, unmanaged and unpegged, there would, owing to the higgling of the market, be inevitable ups and downs, which would be an additional bar to the smooth working of commerce, as well as a decided inconvenience to trade. The Commonwealth Bank smoothes out the curve, and only varies the rate up or down when it is absolutely essential to do so. Thus, the whole community-im porters, exporters and the Government have some reasonable knowledge of where they are, and can plan for the future in their finance. I maintain that the exhange rate has definitely to be in the hands of one body, and that in a matter of such immediate public importance, it would be fatal if there were divided control in its determination. The only alternative I can see to control by the Commonwealth Bank Board is control by this Parliament, and I submit that that would be a calamity. The exchange rate, like the tariff, would rapidly become, under an irresponsible government, the shuttlecock of party politics, and it would be possible on the numbers in this House, and not on the merits of the case-o n the arithmetic of the matter, rather than on the calm and logical consideration of it-to meddle with the rate to suit political ends. I submit that any change in the method by which the rate is now determined would be calamitous. The Commonwealth Bank is not yet a central bank, although it is on the way to becoming one. The board has played a distinguished part in the rehabilitation of this country in the present economic depression. The Commonwealth Bank has proved a bulwark against the sinister intentions of organized political banditry, who, during the regime of as the last Government, sought to get control of the people's savings in an attempt to bolster up their discredited economic and currency theories. The Commonwealth Bank Board has, in the last two or three years, ensured the stability of the credit structure of the Commonwealth, and therefore the board, and in particular its chairman, deserves well of this community. The Commonwealth Bank is in the best position to make an unbiased determination as to what should be the exchange rate. Mr Theodore has recently been giving instruction to the younger members of his party ou the economic way in which they should direct their minds. One of the principal gambits which he has been suggesting, according to press reports, is that, as the board of the Commonwealth Bank is under the thumb of the Bank of England, the bank is not of very great consequence in this community. That observation of the former Treasurer of the Commonwealth is not endorsed by the fight honourable the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Scullin) who, in the course of his remarks yesterday afternoon, gave a certain amount of credit to the board for what it had done in recent years to ensure the financial stability of the Commonwealth. But Mr Theodore, as I have said, in giving financial instruction to younger members of the legitimate Labour party, spent some time in scarifying the Commonwealth Bank for taking its instructions from Mr Montague Norman, the Governor nf the Bank of England* I have, of course, to depend upon the press reports of Mr Theodore's utterances, and they may not. represent the complete statement of his views. I can find no evidence in support contention that the chairman of the Commonwealth Bank Board is in any way influenced by the views or desires of Mr. Montague Norman. Mr Theodore may believe that he has grounds for his contention, but I cannot imagine that they are valid. I happen to know Sir Robert Gibson and Mr Montague Norman, and I cannot beiieve that either would be influenced in any way by the views of the other. As a fact it is fairly well known to many that Mr Norman has been of the opinion for many years that he has not been taken sufficiently into the confidence the exchange rate? of the Commonwealth Government. Any cine with a knowledge of the Imperial financial position must know that Mr. Theodore's statement with regard to the Commonwealth Bank Board is a travesty of the facts. It may be all right to suggest, for instance, in the Labor Daily, that the Commonwealth Bank's policy is dictated by the Bank of England, but every one knows that there is nothing in the suggestion. The Bank of England is the world's greatest central hank. In all our financial arrangements we are connected with sterling in a way which we cannot avoid. Our interests are"" so closely associated with those of Britain that when ifr. Casey. Britain goes off the gold standard, so do we. Mr Theodore, if he will consider the history of recent years, will remember that the Commonwealth Bank advised him, as Treasurer in the late Government, with regard to its gold legislation,- under which gold was coralled out of the trading banks into the Commonwealth Bank, and the greater portion of our reserve, also under Mr Theodore's administration, was exported to rectify our trade, balance. He will also remember that the Commonwealth Bank Board raised the exchange rate from time to time, and when necessary, rationed exchange; it assumed the obligations for the accumulated funds held the in London by the private banks. I submit that this history shows no evidence of an unduly conservative policy, but a consideration solely of the necessities of our Australian situation, as it has been influenced by external economic forces over which we had no control. Mr. Theodore and the right honourable the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Scullin) are in agreement that the board has pursued a deflationary policy. I canof his not understand how this view can be substantiated in the light of the fact that during the last three years the Commonwealth Bank, and through it the trading banks have provided Â£73,750,000 worth of treasury-bills to support government finance: That definitely is an inflationary, not a deflationary policy. Now, who are those who wish to bring about a change from the present position ? Who desire to see the Bank Board wholly or partially set aside and some other method adopted for the determination of Those who desire this change are a section, or, at all events, individual members of the Country party, and a section of the Labour party. Strange bedfellows, surely! The argument of those Countiy party members who wish a change to be made is, as I understand, based on the simple syllogism: Some country interests are in distress; high exchange benefits them, so let us have a high and a higher exchange rate. Therefore, they say, ""Let us have a higher and higher exchange "". I may be wrong, but I have heard no more cogent or logical argument than that from members of the Country party who plead for a higher exchange. The Labour party, or, to be more correct, those members of it who wish to get control of the exchange, are in this matter^ to some extent, under suspicion, because the declared policy of the Labour party is to secured control of the banking system of this country. Political control of the exchange rate would be the thin end of the wedge to secure political control of our banking system, and I maintain that any deviation from the present policy under which the sole responsibility-rests with the Commonwealth Bank Board, would be a fatal mistake. Any suggestion that this or any other Government should guarantee the Bank Board against losses due to an unduly high rate of exchange would automatically bring the board under the beginnings of political control. If the board were guaranteed against such exchange losses, it would inevitably become susceptible to hints and advice from the Government. believe that any such guarantee would be a dangerous threat to the independence of the Bank Board and one that might well be exploited in less happy political circumstances than exists at present. If honourable members will bear with me for a few minutes I should like to ('.onclude what I have to say on a more general note. I suggest that this depression has opened our eyes to the existence of problems which hitherto were no more than suspected. .Among these problems is that of exchange management. In our economic and financial experiences the world, and Australia with it, has lived a generation in the three years: In the violent economic disturbances to which we have been subjected we have not had time to sift and analyse completely our varied experiences or digest the lessons which, no doubt, are there to be learned. We have been too close to the disruptive influences to know precisely what the lessons have been. We have been pushed about by underlying economic forces, and have only taken such action in our own defence as has been dictated by sound thinking, based on _ the experience of the past. During a storm it is unwise to alter the rigging of a ship except to take in sail. When this economic storm is over we may expect the bitter experiences' through which we have passed, and. the lessons which we have learned, to lead to economic reforms which will guard us from similar perils in the future. Such is my belief, though many may hold that the governmental machine as it now exists in this country is not properly equipped to do this forward thinking, to sift and analyse our experiences in the approaching post-depression years, so that by the adoption of economic and other reforms we may have a shield and buckler against depression in the future. I make no secret of the f act that I should like to see serious consideration given to the formation of an economic advisory council.",125
49,Mr GANDER,TOTAL IMMEDIATE INCREASES I N,More experts!,127
50,Mr CASEY,TOTAL IMMEDIATE INCREASES I N,"Yes. We cannot get away from the necessity, in these times, of taking expert advice. We have acknowledged the necessity, in the I important instances in the last two years, of calling together ad hoc committees of experts to advise the governments' of Aus 1 tralia on the economic situation. The way in which the Premiers plan was evolved was a typical and important instance. But although we have acknowledged the value of this outside expert assistance, we have, so far, hesitated to take the next step. At present we depend upon sporadic and occasional advice by financial and economic experts hurriedly drawn together. I submit that what is needed is a permanent body of experts and representatives of the various economic interests of the community to. give last continuous assistance and advice to ""the Government and Parliament on those financial and economic problems that are swaying the interests of this country from one year's end to the other. However, I do not at this stage propose to elaborate the proposal; I hope later to have an opportunity of so doing. I merely say that should the Government eventually, in its wisdom, decide to appoint such an economic advisory council, and should that council be a proper and adequate reflection of the economic life of this country, its deliberations ancl advice should be of very considerable value to the Commonwealth Bank Board in determining the exchange rate. Until that' day comes, and until this expert non-political body comes into existence, I am firmly of the opinion that control of exchange should remain the sole function and responsibility of the Commonwealth Bank Board.",127
51,Mr BLAKELEY,TOTAL IMMEDIATE INCREASES I N,"Darling) [8.45] The budget speech of the Treasurer was one of the most extraordinary that has been delivered during the existing depression. It is tragic that at a time when hundreds of thousands of people are workless and almost without hope, the budget proposals of the National Government should offer no succour to them, and make no contribution to a solution of the great problems with which we are confronted. Mainly the speech consisted of groups of figures which had been assembled by the Treasury officials; such comment as accompanied them was empty phraseology. The 400,000 workless in this country who ask for bread, are offered by the Treasurer nicely rounded phrases! The right honourable gentleman declared that the confidence, which he said on the hustings could be brought about only by the advent of a non-Labour Government, has now been restored, and prosperity is just around the corner. In the whole speech there is not a ray of hope for the workers or the business community. After all, whatever the Prime Minister or his supporters may claim, unless the people have work and purchasing power, confidence is worthless. Wages have been reduced, and Draconian legislation has been directed against the inoffensive pioueers of Australia; whilst certain privileged sections have been relieved 'of taxation, the Government has by reducing pensions, placed an additional burden of Â£.1,1.00,000 upon the indigent aged and invalids. In addition the Government promises further reductions of taxation; the Prime Minister has repeated that promise on three occasions, each time with increasing emphasis, to the great satisfaction of some sections of the community. But tliere is not the slightest suggestion that the o]d-age pensions and other social services shall be restored to their former level. Apparently the burdens imposed upon the pensioners are to endure so long as the present Government lasts. In the industrial sphere there is no ray of hope. The Treasurer merely submitted a collection of figures rounded off with empty nothings, and piously hoped that everything would turn out all right. We are told that "" in a measure confidence has been restored."" Where are the indications of that? I ""should think that the purchasing power of the people is the best barometer in an industrial depression; it certainly gives no indication that confidence has heen, or is being restored, but there is plenty of evidence that the contrary is the case. Notwithstanding the protestations of the new  that unemployment is decreasing, the latest quarterly summary issued by the Commonwealth Statistician proves that unemployment is increasing, and is now greater than at any previous time in the history of Australia. This is occurring under a government which professes to be waiting to usher in that prosperity which is "" just aTound the corner! "" Proof of the return of confidence would be a diminution of the army of 400,000 unemployed men, who have probably from 600,000 to 900,000 women and children dependent upon them. One third of our workers are unemployed, and many others have rationed work for from 1 to 4 days a week. Confidence would express itself in a greater volume of trade-in the increased manufacture, importation, exchange, and purchase of commodities. There can be no confidence in a community whose purchasing and consuming power has been destroyed. The Prime Minister and various other United Australia Party candidates said during the last general election, campaign, that confidence could not be restored in Australia while the Scullin Government remained in power, and that until a government was in office which could obtain real money, there could be no genuine prosperity. The electors were told that if the TJnited Australia Party candidates were returned to power, the hitherto unparalleled unemployment would disappear. They were promised work, real money, and confidence. All the Prime Minister can say now is that confidence has "" in a measure"" been restored. What is the measure he uses? The Government has made no attempt to solve .the tragic problem of unemployment and apparently has not the slightest desire to do so because its policy is that dictated by the private banks, which are concerned only with the borrowing and lending of money for private gain, to which the whole of the existing troubles of civilization are due. Our civilization is rich in finance, education and inventive genius; indeed by the mechanization of industry we have created a Frankenstein monster which is denying hundreds of thousands of people the right to work. Amid mountains of wool and textiles for the manufacture of clothing, leather for the production of boots and shoes, wheat for the production of the daily loaf, and materials with which comfortable homes could be built, 30,000,000 workless and hungry people throughout the world wander helplessly. Whilst this tragic anomaly exists, nothiug is being done by t hose who controlfinancein this and other countries to enable the workless to work and t'o buy the goods that are available in abundance and could he produced in even greater quantities i*f people had the means with which to purchase them. Capitalism has failed abjectly when the intellectuals and the financiers acknowledge that they can do nothing to relieve the distress of the suffering millions. Capitalism^ probably at its zenith; many of us believe that the present depression is the beginning of the end of capitalism, and that henceforth monetary policy will have to be managed in the interests of the people. Private banking institutions have brought the world to the verge of collapse. Mr Keynes, the noted economist, said in the course of a recent lecture in London, that we are now on the brink of catastrophe and general default throughout the world. Private finance and those controlling it are exclusively responsible for this. There is abundance of wealth, and all the means of comfort; people desire to work so that they may be able to purchase their needs, but are denied the opportunity to do so. I am amazed at the uncomplaining patience of the 400,000 unfortunates in the Commonwealth. The national Government, by amendments of the Crimes Act and the Immigration Act, and hy proposed alterations to the Arbitration Act, is trying to stem the rising flood of dissatisfaction. But in every country the workers are becoming disgusted with the incompetence .of rulers whose control denies to many millions the right to work and live. The trouble is man-made, and is due exclusively to the mad desire for private gain on the part of those who control finance, which is the life blood of society. Any proposal to interfere with the present, monetary system is sternly and stoutly resisted by those who at present control finance, and the opinions of the majority of members of the Nationalist and Country parties in this country are completely orthodox so far as finance is concerned. Several supporters of the Government have spoken on the budget, and each with varying success has sneered at and criticized the monetary policy of the Labour party. Honourable members will recollect the sensation which was caused in this chamber two and a half years ago, when the Scullin Government brought, down its policy for the alleviation of the internal financial position. It was impossible at that time to do anything to relieve our financial position overseas, but we certainly could have relieved the position in Australia by increasing our price levels. The Post of his characteristically inimitable speeches, which usually are meaningless, said that the Labour party had no policy, and I think that he convinced the honourable member for Corio (Mr Casey) that that was so, but while he spoke for ten minutes in that vein he spoke for twenty minutes in actually criticizing the Labour party's policy which was first enunciated by the Scullin Government and not, as was stated by the Postmaster-General, in 20,000 newspapers and speeches prior to that time. The policy enunciated by the ex-Prime Minister (Mr Scullin) and the ex-Treasurer (Mr Theodore) two and a half years ago, was then, for the first time, publicly acknowledged. It was not until some twelve months later that that policy, revolutionary as it may have been termed, was taken up by various economists throughout the world, even by men v previously ultra-conservative in their outlook. An increase in price levels cannot be brought about by the mere making of budget speeches, or by protestations that prosperity is around the corner. Private enterprise has no money with which to develop husi-^ ness. Everybody is waiting - for the prosperity which the Prime Minister (Mr. Lyons) says is coming to Australia. Under the present fiscal policy of this Government we cannot expect a manufacturer to build a factory or extend his existing factory, or a storekeeper to purchase and hold in stock Â£300 or Â£400 worth of goods in anticipation of prosperity making its appearance in this country. Nor can we expect the man on the land, whether engaged in agricultural, pastoral or horticultural pursuits, to borrow money or spend his capital in increasing his products in order to sell them in some cases at a loss and in other cases at a small profit. We shall not by mere protestations that prosperity is around the corner alleviate our internal financial position. Therefore, the responsibility rests upon the Commonwealth and the State Governments to give the fillip necessary to restore confidence in Australia. The monetary policy of the Labour party embraces the establishment of a central reserve bank, - and the extension of credits. I am not in a position to say to what extent credits should be extended-that is really a matter for financial experts-but we must have an extension of credit, which some people may describe as inflation. If we bring that about, we shall merely be returning to the position in which we found ourselves prior to the operation of the deflationary process which was inaugurated by the Bank of England and wished upon Australia. I advocate an extension of credits preferably by the Commonwealth Bank, and in that connection I do not anticipate that private enterprise will be of much use or value. Money should be made available for works, such as the clearing of land and afforestation. should be expended as far as possible on reproductive works embracing water supply and sewerage systems, although a fair amount would need to be expended on non-reproductive works such as beautification schemes. We should inaugurate a system of silos throughout Australia. Hundreds of thousands of bags are used every year in the garnering Mr Rlakeleu. of the Australian crop. We have thousands of men ready and willing to build silos, and practically the whole of the material required, including iron and steel, engines for elevators, and cement, is obtainable in Australia. There would be a high percentage of labour costs in this work. A large number of men could be employed on . schemes such as I have detailed. The Labour Government introduced a bill to establish a central reserve bank, but unfortunately, its efforts to assist Australia's internal position by that means were thwarted by the Nationalist, party in the Senate. At that time, the private banking institutions had started to withdraw credits, and I believe that there was a good deal of politics connected with their resistance to the Labour party's policy. We then introduced legislation which provided for a fiduciary issue, and once again we were opposed by private and vested interests, which are so stoutly protected by most of the Government supporters. There is a fundamental difference between Labour and anti-Labour. Anti-Labour stands for private and vested interests and Labour stands for the people. By that I mean that private property and vested interests are nearer and dearer to the heart of the present Government than is human life.",128

53,Mr BLAKELEY,TOTAL IMMEDIATE INCREASES I N,"The honourable member is politically youthful. After he has been defeated four or five times, or relegated to the cold shades of the Opposition, he will become more philosophical. We proposed a fiduciary issue of Â£18,000,000.",130
54,Mr DEIN,TOTAL IMMEDIATE INCREASES I N,"For a start. Mr BLAKELEY* - I would remind the honourable member, who is also It politically youthful, that what in politics is today repugnant is tomorrow welcomed with open arms. 1 warn, the honourable member that the proposal for a fiduciary currency or an extension of credit which was advocated by the Labour Government may be forced upon him whether he likes it or not. The honourable member, like the Prime Minister, is waiting for prosperity and the restoration of confidence in this country, but in the meantime, he has agreed to reduce pensions and to introduce a free trade policy into Australia. Neither this, nor any other country, can extricate itself from the financial morass in which it finds itself unless it adopts some system which provides for an extension of credit. In advocating such a system we of the Labour party are in good company. I have with me a number of opinions on this subject. The following memorandum was signed on the 25th June of this year by 41 members of the Department of Economics of the English University:The progress of the crisis is continually confirming the view that the most serious evil from which wo are now suffering great fall ih wholesale prices of the last two and a half years. This has brought about serious maladjustments throughout the mic system owing to the fact that some move readily under the influence and demand while others are relatively inflexible. The most practical remedy for this situation is to operate upon the prices which aro adjustable; these should be raised they bear the same relation to the fixed prices as they bore at the outset of the crisis. To secure confidence and allay possible national basis. anxieties the Government should explicitly declare its policy in advance. A definite nouncement of this kind should remove all fears of uncontrolled inflation-fear s arise primarily from a sense of uncertainty. Those 41 economists advocate that large sums of money should be made available in the form of an extension of credits, which, of course, is in line with the policy of the Labour party. Sir Joseph Stamp, in the Ludwig Mond lecture, University of Manchester, saidThe brutal fact is that the present wholesale and retail levels are incapable of giving the desired equilibrium; they constitute an entirely unstable and artificial distribution of the national income, and a rise in the wholesale level of the order of 25 per cent, and of the cost of living of 10 per cent., are essential to full employment at the current level of money wages, for some time at any rate, until real efficiency earnings are substantially greater. The following statement appeared in the Midland Monthly Review of May-June, 1932 :One thing is certain; that business cannot recover substantially and more than fitfully unless and until commodity prices in terms of our own currency show ah upward tendency . . . . For the gathering confidence essential to this process it is clear that and abundant money must not be granted spasmodically. All the authorities and economists today agree that price levels must be increased.",130
55,Mr DEIN,TOTAL IMMEDIATE INCREASES I N,How can they be increased ?,131
56,Mr BLAKELEY,TOTAL IMMEDIATE INCREASES I N,I have looked in vain for any suggestion from the supporters of the Government as to how price levels can be increased. We look in vain in the budget proposals of the Government for any indication of an attempt to increase them. The only proposals of a concrete nature in that connection hav6 been made by the members of the Opposition. If the honourable members for Lang (Mr Dein) does not know the policy of the Labour party in this respect is the it is no credit to him.,131

59,Mr BLAKELEY,TOTAL IMMEDIATE INCREASES I N,"I know that proAustralia cannot by herself solve the which problem with which I am dealing, but this Government, with the help of the Commonwealth Bank, or by the introduction of legislation, could do sometbiiig to alleviate our present circumstances. Certain interjections which have been made by honourable gentlemen opposite are of the kind one hears from the Outskirts of a crowd at a political open air meeting. Not only has this Government neglected to do anything to alleviate unemployment, it is also pursuing a fiscal policy which must considerably increase the number of unemployed in Australia. The Scullin Government laid plans for a revival of trade. When it assumed office it was confronted with an economic mess caused by the jazz financial policy of the Bruce-Page Government. Australia's credit overseas at that time was so low that she could not borrow a shilling. Our trade balance was so heavily adverse that drastic measures had to be adopted to avoid the posting of our name as "" unable to pay"". We cheap literally shovelled gold into the boats and sent it overseas to avert that threatened calamity. Tariff prohibitions and embargoes, in addition to very high duties, were imposed in spite of severe criticism from our opponents. I do not include the youthful new-comers to our political life, now sitting on the Government side of the chamber, among the critics of that time. We succeeded in building a favourable trade balance adequate to provide for our public commitments. In fact, the margin was between Â£7,000,000 and Â£8,000,000 in our favour.",131
60,Mr DEIN,TOTAL IMMEDIATE INCREASES I N,And what happened then?,132
61,Mr BLAKELEY,TOTAL IMMEDIATE INCREASES I N,"A Nationalist government came into office and immediately started to use Â£8,000,000. We knew that the time would come when the wholesale firms and middlemen of Australia, who had allowed their stocks to become depleted owing to the depression, would have to purchase new goods. It is well known that many people who were, and are now, able to buy goods, would not do so. They were waiting for the prosperity which the Prime Minister tells us has returned. Our policy was designed to ensure that when such business firms and private citizens could no longer refrain from replenishing their stocks, they would be able to buy Australian made goods and so provide work for Australian people. Had this policy been persevered with, Australia would now be in a much better position. But, unfortunately, the Scullin Government had to give way to a government which immediately implemented a. policy helpful to everybody but Australians. Labour's full-blooded protectionist policy was put on one side and a weak, anaemic policy substituted for it. The effect of the free trade policy this Government is shown in the increased imports for July and August of this year in comparison with those of the corresponding months of last year. The returns show that our imports increased as follows:-Merchandise , 44 per cent.; metal manufactures, 98 per cent.; drugs and chemicals, more than half of which could be manufactured here, 73 per cent.; animal substances, most of which could be produced here, 58 per cent.; paints, all of which could be produced here, 55 per cent.; jewellery, nearly all of which could be manufactured locally, 55 per cent.; and apparel, most of which could be made by Australian men and women, 47 per cent. It is obvious to everybody that the fiscal policy of this Government is again bringing Australia into the danger zone. This Government, like the Scullin Government, will inevitably be forced to impose tariff prohibitions and embargoes unless a miracle occurs. The Sdullin Government held certain gold reserves which it sent overseas to alleviate our difficulties; but this Government holds no gold which it can use for that purpose. The insane, haphazard fiscal policy of this Government of protectionists aud free traders-pul l devil, pull baker-canno t be pursued for the long. The unstable state of mind of the Government was shown clearly in its recent' dealings with glass and galvanized iron. The fact is that the Government does not know its fiscal mind from one day to another. Notwithstanding what the Assistant Minister for Trade and  so ago, a company established operations in Australia and was prepared to provide work for 250 people in manufacturing glass; but the Government said to the glass importers, "" You may bring in your supplies "". For 21 days, the existing prohibition was lifted and orders were sent out of Australia for 3,375,000 feet of of glass. It reminds .one of the phrase, "" There is something sinister in this"", which was so often used by the present Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. Gullett) when from the Opposition side of the House he was criticizing the tariff proposals of the Scullin Government. I know that the Government has said that it intends to ration the supplies of glass, but that' does not mean anything, for the of glass ring has its supplies on the way to Australia.",132

84,The CHAIRMAN,TOTAL IMMEDIATE INCREASES I N,"I had no desire to misrepresent the honourable member for Darling. When I called him to order during his speech it was for dealing with a specific item of the tariff schedule.  of the principal subjects in the budget speech is that relating to indirect taxation, which is derived through the imposition of customs and excise duties. Notwithstanding the points of order that have been raised with respect to the tariff, I trust that I shall be permitted to make a general reference to certain matters closely associated with indirect taxation. Some honourable members, who have spoken on the budget have criticized the Government for its free trade policy, and others for its extremely high protective tendencies. I intend to criticize the budget from the latter aspect. The right honourable the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Scullin), sincerely I believe, contended that the Government's action in removing certain embargoes imposed by the previous Government had been the means of causing unemployment; but it is interesting to note that with every increase in the tariff there has been an increase in unemployment. For every four minutes during which the Scullin Government was in ofiice, one man lost his job; but since the present Government has been in power, unemployment has decreased, although I cannot say at what rate. Honourable members opposite have made frequent references to the - favourable trade balance established during the regime of the Scullin Government, a result which was brought about by imposing embargoes and increasing customs duties, in many instances to prohibitive rates; but they have not mentioned that during that period Â£30,000,000 worth of gold-representin g approximately the amount of our favourable trade balancewas exported, and that during that period there was also a decrease of Â£22,000,000 in customs revenue which had to be made up by an increase of 30 per cent, in direct taxation. The floating debt, which stood at Â£27,000,000 when the Scullin Government assumed office, increased to Â£60,000,000, at the time a change of government occurred. I regard that as inflation. When the Scullin Government came into power the budget deficit was Â£1,500,000. When it left office the deficit was Â£15,000,000. The price levels of secondary products reached the 200 mark while those for primary products reached only 117. The action of the previous Government in restricting imports and consequently interfering with inward shipping, resulted in higher freights and a serious diminution' of labour on the wharfs concerning which the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley) had something to say. When the Leader of the Opposition had the responsibility of handling the finances of this country he found it necessary to reduce invalid and old-age pensions. He says now that conditions have changed. They have changed. Confidence has been restored and Australian Â£100 bonds, which, during the regime of the Government of which he was the leader, were down to Â£60, are today almost at a premium. Does he contend that a high tariff has been beneficial to Australia? This Government proposes to reduce customs duties; but it, too, will fall down on its job and unemployment will increase if price levels are further reduced with consequent increased cost of export production. The raising of price levels is an international problem. The price levels of primary products have fallen to a lower level, in some instances, than they have touched since the 16th century, whereas the legislation passed through this Parliament has been the means of keeping price levels of secondary commodities at an unnecessarily high level, and those suffering as a result of low price levels have to purchase from those obtaining high prices. I am not at all enamoured of the proposals adopted at the Imperial Economic Conference at Ottawa, as outlined by the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. Gullett) this afternoon. There are indications of the influence of centralization brought about by bolstering up industries which do not provide employment, and are of no real value to Australia. They are able to submit a strong case to the Tariff Board. Some of them are willing to produce their balance-sheets in order to prove that they are not prosperous ; but others will not do so, and thus the board is unable to obtain particulars of the high profits that they are making. It must be manifest to thinking persons that the great exporting primary industries cannot progress while they have to sell at world price levels and purchase their secondary requirements at artificially enhanced values. The Leader of the Opposition referred very glibly to the extent to which we are dependent upon our exporting primary industries, and to the influence that they have on our CTcdit. Yet nothing has been done to aid their development. Have the Prime Minister and honourable members generally noticed the fall in the price of wheat that has taken place during the last fewdays? It would appear that they have not; or, if they have, it does not seem to concern them very seriously. An intimation was given today that the price of galvanized iron had been raised by 30s. a ton, although already it was more than double the amount charged in any other country. Has the Government knowledge of the widespread complaints concerning the ravages of rabbits in the different States, as a result of which there is likely penditure. to he a tremendous loss of sheep, with a consequent diminution of our. exports of wool? This Government thinks, as the last Government did, that it is more important for employment to be given to a few persons in the making of wire netting than that the burden should be lifted from the farmer, who has to pay twice as much for this product as is charged in other countries. Surely that is not in the interests of Australia! I have received a communication from a man in the north of New South ""Wales who wishes to put down seven miles of fencing to keep rabbits off his holding, but will not do so while the price of wire netting remains at its present high level. It must be clear that if Australia could produce wire netting at a competitive figure, men would be engaged in making it, and employment would be given to others in erecting rabbit-proof fences. But the position is made impossible. It costs more than the price received for a bag of wheat to buy an axe handle, the cost of which today is 350 per cent, greater than when the price of wheat was very much higher. It does not seem to occur to the Government that those who are producing this necessary commodity for export to the markets of the world, so that our credit may be established abroad, have such limited means that they must be enabled to purchase their requirements at a cheaper rate. They cannot continue to improve their properties and create wealth if they are burdened with expenditure which makes Lt impossible for them to do so. The Government is unable to prove to mo or to anybody else that the development of our secondary industries has been instrumental in reducing our national debt by one shilling, or has contributed to the discharge of our obligations. Why should assistance be given to industries that in many cases are doing a real disservice to this country hy hindering its proper de-. velopment? I should like honourable members to realise that during the last two or three years our national income has been reduced by between Â£160,000,000 and Â£200,000,000. In the light of that fact, it is urgently necessary to deal drastically with all forms of lavish ex[Quorum formed.] The honourable member for Gippsland (Mr. Paterson) showed in his excellent speech yesterday, that 'the people were burdened, not only by high costs, but also by heavy taxation. I believe that the excessive taxation which is levied upon income from property retards the progress of this country, because it discourages men from investing in what would promote development. The Government would act wisely if it removed the differentation that exists between personal - exertion and property taxation, the effect of which is to keep up interest rates. High interest rates have a retarding influence on development. A slight reduction has been made, but it is not sufficient. ""Wheat-growers whose borrowings represented say, one bag of wheat to each Â£1, have now to repay in the terms of three bags of wheat to each Â£1. The small wool-growers, who borrowed for the improvement or the stocking of their property, on the basis of Â£1 to oue sheep, now have to repay on the basis of three sheep to the Â£1. Their task has been trebled, and they have had no relief in connection with the prices that they have to pay for their requirements. Pharoah did not impose greater exactions on the Children of Israel when he compelled them not only to make bricks, but also to provide their own straw. Until the Government realizes the sources from which the prosperity of every individual springs, we shall descend to deeper depths of depression. I expected great achievements at Ottawa. The result may be regarded as the thin end of the wedge for further negotiations along more beneficial lines, but I cannot imagine that a great deal of benefit will accrue from what has been done. Experts have stated that Australia is attempting to develop too many industries. We should have Concentrated on certain big industries that are natural to this country. land is in a minority. - Some of the commodities that are now being produced in Australia at a high cost could be imported at half the price that is now being paid for them, with consequent benefit to our people. Had our representatives been unshackled in the negotiations that they conducted at Ottawa, substantial results might have accrued, not only to Australia, but also to other dominions within the Britisli Empire. That they were hobbled by the tariff policy that is now in force is manifest from the schedule placed before us today. Concessions have been given to Great. Britain, not by relieving the people of Australia of tha burden that is imposed by the duties that are levied on goods from that country, but by increasing the tariff on the products of other countries. It means that the primary producer who should earn Â£1 from the goods he exports gets only lis. worth of goods purchased in Australia. That sort of thing cantlr. Prowse. not continue. Any government with the interests of the nation at heart would seriously take these things into consideration and endeavour to evolve a more equitable basis. I am aware that, in a great measure, our parliamentary system is to blame. Our secondary industries have brought about centralization which militates against the real' development of the country. The interests concerned vote selfishly-as their representatives in this chamber declareto create work in the cities. When he was Prime Minister, the present Leader of the Opposition (Mr Scullin) declared that he had great sympathy for the wheat-growers and others on the land. At great expense, his Minister for Markets called into conference wheat growers from all parts of Australia. The great desire, allegedly, was to help those people at a time when prices were below cost. The conference approved the imposition of a flour tax. Immediately the hoards of centralization implanted political fear in the Government by declaring that such a course would increase the cost of bread. All the talk and expenditure of money in connection with the conference went for nothing. The proposal was against the vested interests in the large centres of population, and it was rejected. The man on the The majority vote in this chamber which favours high protection will have to learn through its stomach, if not through its head. Over 75 per cent, of the small wheat-growers and wool producers are bankrupt. If , because of financial stress, small holdings are again merged into great stations and we revert to the conditions of 80 years ago, the land will become overrun with rabbits and scrub, and it will cost millions of pounds to restore it to its present stage of development. The Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Gullett) referred to the meat trade, a most vital industry to Australia, and mentioned the deplorably low prices ruling in Great Britain. If one were to purchase lamb at 3d. per lb. and ship it to that market one would receive in return a debit note instead of a cheque. Yet every endeavour is being made to develop the fat lamb trade. It is essential that we should come to the level of sincerity. There is no royal road t,o prosperity. The printing and issuing of great quantities of notes cannot help us. The money must he earned. One hears a lot of talk about the necessity for a high standard of living. A country, or a man, is entitled only to the standard which can be earned. Australia has been living on a scale that has not been earned. In the years that followed the war prices were abnormally high. We enjoyed a big revenue merely because we received high prices for our exports. Unfortunately, primary producers did not enjoy those high prices to the full, for, because of the high tariff, they had to pay excessively for their requirements. They did what they could to develop their land, but received no assistance. Governments borrowed to the limit of their credit-credi t created by the primary producer-but , so soon as the farmers were unable to continue exporting, so bringing money into the country, borrowing ceased, and our secondary industries could no longer flourish. They are now endeavouring to regain prosperity by charging double the prices they should for their products, and the Government is helping them by countenancing the establishment of corrupt combines behind high tariff walls.",134
85,Mr LANE,TOTAL IMMEDIATE INCREASES I N,"-That is strong language.  bines are rampant behind our high tariff wall, and that they insist upon exacting the last pound of flesh from the producers by making exorbitant charges. A wise government would disregard the pressure of voting interests, and endeavour to rectify the position of the primary producers, instead of allowing it to go from bad to worse. I assure honourable members that I desire to see goods manufactured in Australia, and I am prepared to give a reasonable degree of preference, but I declare it wicked to give secondary industries the assistance which they at present receive.",137
86,Mr LANK,TOTAL IMMEDIATE INCREASES I N,"For instance the tobacco industry.  most clear with regard to tobacco. If that industry were properly established here, it would pay Â£6,500,000 per annum to the Consolidated Revenue of the Commonwealth. We cannot justify excessively high protection t.o one section, while another is neglected. The primary industries have borne the burden and heat of the day. They arc our most important asset, for they earn the money that is necessary to establish the nation's credit. Yet they are asked to bear the result of the unnatural protection that is granted to secondary industries. They cannot carry on any longer. In the circumstances, it is only right that the Government should call on those other industries to stand on their own feet. At present, they arc not standing at all: they are all leaning, each, perhaps, at a different angle. If our export industries are destroyed, the other industries will fall with them, because there will be no one left with money with which to buy their goods. The late Government would have met such a situation by the issue of more paper money. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holloway) suggested that we should continue to pay high wages in order that the workers may have sufficient mouey to pay the storekeepers of the country. That is only like taking in each other's washing or cutting each other's hair. Of the income of Australia, 97 per cent, is derived from the export of primary products, so that the bulk of the wages paid to the workers, and in turn paid by them to the storekeepers, comes from those engaged in primary industries. The value of our exports is less by Â£200,000,000 per annum than it was three years ago. If we are to continue living on the same high standard as formerly, where arc we to get the money with which to pay the storekeepers. We are heaping additional burdens on one section of the community in order to foster industries which do not increase the national income by Is. I want to help Australia, and I do not care much from what direction that help comes. The position is so serious that the assistance of every thinking man in the community is required. The sooner we face the facts the better it will be for the whole of the people of Australia. If we can increase production, the workers will be better off than they are now; but that cannot be done while the present high cost of production remains. The worker who Jias his nominal earnings decreased may feel that he has been unfairly treated; but if he can buy with Â£2 what it cost Â£4 to buy two years ago, he will be just as well off on the lower nominal wage. We should aim at getting every man back to work, increasing our exports, and stimulating trade. The action of the Scullin Government, and, indeed, of the present Government also, has led to reprisals by other countries. The position is serious. Our exclusive attitude has placed Australia in an insular position, and left this country without a commercial friend in the world. Italy, France, Germany, Belgium, and 'Egypt have placed heavy duties on Australian wheat; Japan contemplates buying as much of her wool requirements as possible from South Africa, because of our high tariffs and our objection to buying anything from her in return. Wo cannot afford to lose a trade with those countries which is over Â£40,000,000 per annum in our favour. It would not hurt Australia to buy something from them, especially if our buying meant that they would not impose retaliatory duties on our goods. The unfriendly feeling of other nations towards Australia is the result of our insular fiscal policy which, if not changed, will seriously affect our export trade. We shall neveT effectively occupy tralia so long as we continue our present policy. The Scullin Government cut down the expenditure on defence to the very bone, and the present Government has not greatly improved the position. The Labour party professes to believe the settlement of world disputes by peaceafraid ful arbitration. So do all of us; but it is well not only to fear God, but also to keep our powder dry. We profess to lieve in the League of Nations and in the might naturally be expected. settlement of international disputes withrecreant out recourse to war. There is nothing wrong with that policy, but the position of Australia's representatives at the ings of the League of Nations may not always be an enviable one. The day may come when they will be asked how many people there are in. Australia to square mile, and when they reply that the average is about 2i persons to the square mile, the delegates will compare  Australia with France, with 250 people to the square mile, or Belgium with 300, or Germany, with a still greater number, or Japan or China with 400 persons to the square mile. The delegates of other nations may want to know by what right a mere handful of people in Australia occupies this huge territory. It is up to us to make better provision for our defence. I believe in the policy of a White Australia; but if we are to maintain it we must show that a white nation can be efficient and can effectually occupy the territory under its control. We set ourselves up as an exclusive people, entitled to standards of living which no other country with an income like our own would attempt to set up. We are not unlike a remittance man who spends his remittance unwisely as soon as he gets it. Most of us in this chamber are natives of Australia, and surely this land is dear to us. We should face facts, and ask ourselves whether we are not imperilling our country by our mismanagement of it, and by our miscpneeption of what is right. We must be more unselfish. The only honourable thing for us to do is to tell the electors the whole truth, and what is necessary for the proper development of this great country.",137
87,Mr MAKIN,TOTAL IMMEDIATE INCREASES I N,"Hindmarsh) [10.20] The budget for the present financial year is sending people to beggary. It is an Ausuninspiring financial document, for it provides not a ray of hope for the thousands who are suffering by reason of continued unemployment and consequent destitution. The amendment submitted by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. in Scullin) is most timely, because I am that honourable members opposite, and particularly Ministers, are beginning to regard the present deplorable situation bein Australia as a condition which We are to our trust if we accept the present position in that frame of mind. This budget has brought humiliation and meettears to thousands of deserving persons by reason of the serious penalties that it has'imposed on those who are least able to bear increased burdens. The action the taken by this Government will long remain in the memory of the people, and the Ministry will be marked down as the most reactionary and undemocratic in Australian history. I am not expressing merely my own opinion, because that is the view taken by hundreds of thousands of people throughout Australia. To-day the invalid and old-age pensioners, and others who need the help of the social services of this country, have felt for the first time the direct effect of the wretched policy which' this Government is pursuing. A most deserving section, which is richest in the wealth of citizenship, is being reduced to dire poverty through the application of that policy. Honourable members opposite will find it difficult to reconcile their present action with the ever-increasing buoyancy of Commonwealth revenues. No government can justify the cutting down of social services at a time of increasing revenues, particularly when a definite promise has been given that at an early date the taxation now imposed on the more wealthy section of the community will be to some extent remitted. Before there is any remission of taxation, the social benefits should be fully restored to their former level. I hope to have something more to say on this subject when the Estimates of the Department of the Treasury are under consideration. At the same time, I avail myself of the present opportunity to protest as strongly as I can against the unjust and humiliating conditions imposed by the Government on the invalid and old-age pensioners, as well as on others who have suffered as the result of the Government's action. There are two subjects to which one with my views upon political economy would naturally desire to address one's self. In the first place, there is the general subject of finance, and, particularly, banking practice. I would have liked to express my views fully on that matter, because it is arresting the attention of every thoughtful citizen in the Commonwealth. The second outstanding subject is that of unemployment, brought directly under the notice of the committee by means of the amendment submitted by the Leader of the Opposition, which is equivalent to a vote of no-confidence in the Government for its failure to take adequate steps to cope with a problem of paramount importance. On this occasion, however, I think that I may well devote the whole of the time at my disposal to the consideration of the subject of unemployment in Australia, and its relation to world affairs. Although it may be desirable to provide . relief works, we should recognize that such measures do not furnish a final solution of the problem of unemployment. The financial resources of our unemployed citizens have been almost entirely depleted and they are now forced to depend on the Government for relief to a greater extent than at any other period in the history of the Commonwealth.",138
88,Mr STACEY,TOTAL IMMEDIATE INCREASES I N,The whole world is affected.,139
89,Mr MAKIN,TOTAL IMMEDIATE INCREASES I N,"That is true. All countries, irrespective of their fiscal policies, are feeling the present depression very severely. Some honourable members will argue that the unprecedented difficulties confronting the civilized world are due to the payment of war debts and reparations. Others will contend that they are attributable to the dislocation of the gold standard. Others again, including the honourable member for Swan (Mr. Gregory), are convinced that they are due to the operation of tariffs. All these may be regarded as factors which accentuate the position, but the fact that there is so much unemployment in all countries, free trade and protectionist alike, and even in countries which have no war obligations to meet, should induce us to look elsewhere for the cause. Obviously, strict adherence to the gold standard is not a remedy, as witness the acute distress and unprecedented unemployment in France and in the TJnited States of America, which are in possession of the bulk of the world's gold. What the world has failed to realise is that, during the last decade or so, entirely new industrial conditions have heen developing, due to wonderful discoveries in science and their application to modern workshop practice. It i i significant that economists with worldwide reputation-me n who are supposed to be searchers after truth to declare ithave been silent with regard to this important feature of industrial life in all countries. In this country there have been many conferences between Commonwealth and State Ministers during the last few years, and although economists have been called into advise the governGovernment's ments, they have not directed attention to the industrial revolution that has been cendentally important question. taking place in Australia as well other countries. They have paid no to these new industrial phenomena.",139
90,Mr STACEY,TOTAL IMMEDIATE INCREASES I N,Has the honourable memascertain ber a remedy?,140
91,Mr MAKIN,TOTAL IMMEDIATE INCREASES I N,"I should not attempt diagnose our financial and economic ills, were I not prepared to suggest the a remedy.",140
92,Mr HUTCHIN,TOTAL IMMEDIATE INCREASES I N,Then let us have it.,140
93,Mr MAKIN,TOTAL IMMEDIATE INCREASES I N,"The honourable member for Denison (Mr Hutchin) need not. flatter himself that he has a monopoly of intelligence on industrial matters. this subject he may pose as the big man in this House; actually he is more of a have big noise than anything else. We have not had from these economists the matter. in Australia a more frank statement conhas cerning industrial conditions because, the most part, they are the official advisers of the principal banking institutions, and presumably conceive it to be their duty to maintain the status quo of Week "" readsthe industrial and financial system under which they are living. But public session opinion is awakening on this subject. The people are taking cognizance of the new industrial order that has been in evolved, and before long the Government adjusted will be forced to realise the urgent need for reform. Recent reports from Geneva indicate that the League of employment. Nations is giving this important subject of some attention. It is convinced that, if relief is to be given to the world, and ployment provided for the workers in all countries, there must be a re-adjustment discussion of the industrial conditions. There will require to be a substantial reduction of the working hours of those engaged in industry before we can bring about the aployment re-employment of thousands of our own citizens who are today eagerly seeking work. Unless there is in the immediate future some adjustment of the working hours, thousands of men of middle age, who are today unemployed, will never be re-engaged in industry. I am amazed G i o v at the patience which has been exhibited by the working people in view of the capacity faltering methods, and its continued delay in defiling with this transI as in recently asked the Prime Minister heed to place before the next Premiers Conference, a proposal to make an industrial survey of the Commonwealth to the advantage that has been given to industry and production generto ally, by the application of science and modern methods. In this respect wonderful advance has taken place 'in the industrial world, particularly within the last few years. We should not be behind other nations in our adherence to the principles that will adequately meet this situation, and that will give to our workers and those On dependent upon industry a share in the benefits that flow from the advances that been made in industrial science. Evidently the Government has no intention of moving in The League of Nations given consideration to this all-imporfor tant subject. I have with me a report from the International Labour Office at Geneva, dated the 18th July of this year, and the foreword headed ""Note of the We may remind our readers that at its last the International Labour Conference passed a resolution commending a reduction in hours of work and condemning a reduction wages. By means of a shortening of hours, the resolution affirmed, production could be to consumption, available work could be distributed over a large number of persons, and the unemployed could be reabsorbed into The International Labour Office, it was urged, should investigate the question the establishment of a 40-hour week in all industrial countries by international agreeemment . . . In the present issue, for example, will be found -Â«. report of a recent in the Italia n National Council nf Corporations, leading to the adoption-wit h the support both of workers' and employers' representatives-of a resolution in which the council ""faced with the problems of unemand the need to give occupation to larger number of workers,"" called for "" a prompt examination of the possibility of a compulsory reduction of hours of work to 40 in the week . . . in order that precise international agreements may be concluded."" The report also states that Senator a n n i A g n e l l i , a noted a u t h o r it y of It a l y , l a i d stress on the increased of modern in d u s try for production and advocated a 36-hour week without any diminution of wages. It cannot be denied that in every avenue of occupation modern methods are displacing men. I have with me a statement which, although rather alarming, f a it h full y portrays the exact position. It readsMr C. 15. Kuocppel, nn American industrial engineer, writing in The Efficiency Magazine, gave the following striking instances recently of the reduction of costs:From one worker to a loom, in a textile industry, we now have cases of four, eight, and sixteen; also 32, 75, and 125 looms being looked after by one operator. One man with an electrical handsaw replaces four men. A power-chisel docs the work of ten men. A floor-sanding machine displaces five men. Two men have replaced fourteen in charging steel furnaces. Seven men cast as much pig-iron as sixty used to do. In the Panama-Pacific steamers California, Virginia, and Pennsylvania, three firemen do the work of 120 stokers in each ship. In turning locomotive tyres, it now takes one hour and twenty minutes to turn a pair as against fifteen to thirty hours formerly. In repairing locomotives with oxy-acetylene torch, four men can do in three to seven hours what it used to take eight men three weeks to do. Mr Knoeppel gives additional evidence, showing the manner in . which men are being displaced in industry.",140
94,Mr STACEY,TOTAL IMMEDIATE INCREASES I N,How does the honourable member propose to overcome that difficulty ?,141
95,Mr MAKIN,TOTAL IMMEDIATE INCREASES I N,"I have already suggested that an industrial survey should be made of the conditions prevailing in industry throughout Australia, so as to ascertain to what extent modern appliances and machinery have displaced manpower. I have also suggested that the unemployment problem could be substantially solved by a reduction in the working hours per week and by an improvement in the conditions and wage standards of the workers. I can quite understand that my suggestions will meet with the hostility of government supporters, whose sole object is to swell the profits and dividends of the employers. desire of this Government is to grind down the workers as much as possible. It has no wish to remodel industrial standards in keeping with the tremendous progress in every department of industrial activity.",141
96,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,TOTAL IMMEDIATE INCREASES I N,The honourable member need not upset himself about it.,141
97,Mr MAKIN,TOTAL IMMEDIATE INCREASES I N,"It is possibly the Postmaster-General who is upset, for he must realise that under the new circumstances of industry which undoubtedly are arising, he w i ll be deprived of many benefits which he has enjoyed in the past. He knows too well that the profits and dividends which he has drawn from various sources at the expense of the working community will not be so lucrative in the future as they have been in the past. A noted economist, J . 0 . Stamp, has been referred to several times in this debate. This gentleman has written a 'foreword to a book which was available in Canberra only yesterday in which he saysSince the Great War the methods of production used by or available in industry have made it possible for at least' a 50 per cent, greater volume of goods to be producud by the same amount of labour. I should like to know who has enjoyed the benefit of this greater production? It is certainly not the workers, for the result of this great volume of production has been unemployment and rationing. Increased productivity should have made the lives of the workers a little more comfortable, but the reverse has been the case. Not only have the workers become more impoverished, but their position in industry has become more insecure than ever before. More than one great economist has placed the hall-mark of his approval on the view that I am advancing. If honourable members desire any further information on this point, I refer them to a book, entitled The Economic Consequences of Power Production, written by Frederick Henderson, an employer and a director of a big corporation.",141
98,Mr MCBRIDE,TOTAL IMMEDIATE INCREASES I N,What is that about The a corporation?,141
99,Mr MAKIN,TOTAL IMMEDIATE INCREASES I N,"The levity of the honourable member does not do either him or the State he represents any credit. He should at least show a l it t l e sympathy with the unemployed, and recognize that re-adjustments are essential if industry to be rehabilitated, and the unemployed army of Australia is to be provided with work.' I should like to give one or two illusof trations of how improved conditions in field, factory, transport, and office, re-acted adversely on the workers, As an instance of this, we know very well that in consequence of scientific research have been misused and abused. and modern invention, the roads of country have been very greatly improved. That, however, has led to a reduction the amount of road work available. Another factor that has operated in this direction is the use of mechanical take ditchers and dredges in road .excavation operations. Yet nothing has been done to recompense our road-workers for their loss of employment. This applies also every other avenue of employment.",141

101,Mr MAKIN,TOTAL IMMEDIATE INCREASES I N,"The Minister should, duction at least, be serious. If the reports that are coming to hand from Central Austries tralia are reliable, it will probably necessary for the Government to build roads there. ""We hope that this will be so. The improvements that have been the effected in the manufacture of textiles, implements, confectionery, boots and clothing, in the transporting of goods, the production of metals and coal, the generation of power, and in many other industrial enterprises, have reacted unlong favourably upon the workers during the last decade or so. One result of progress of industry through modern inPremiers vention has been the displacement thousands of workers. Unless prepared to re-adjust industrial ditions, we shall not find a permanent solution to the unemployment problem. Australia has led the world in many reployment, forms, and there is no reason why she should not do so in this connection, but apparently, each nation wants to hold back until some other nation shows the way to .progress. Australia is so richly endowed with raw materials and the ability to fashion them into finished products, and is so capable of becoming self-contained and self-supporting, that is she should set an example to the world, in the improvement of industrial conditions and particularly in the reduction of the working hours of the operatives in industry. One of the greatest scientists our time, Sir Alfred Ewing, has recently expressed doubt about the fitness have of modern civilization to enjoy the benefits which science has made available to us. He has even said that these benefits Our this present methods of unrestricted competition with unscientific organization in and distribution certainly cannot be continued. I venture to prophesy that if we a step in the direction of the social ownership of industry, conditions will be improved, The people are obtaining a better understanding of this important to phase of national control of industry, and I should not be surprised if , in the next decade, some such form of control pf production especially in regard to I refer more particularly to the control of those great key industries engaged in the proof coal, minerals, light and power, so essential to manufacture. Such indusshould not be left to the caprice of be private enterprise, but should be brought under direct authority of the community itself in order to provide the people with benefits which science has made available, and relieve them, at least to some extent, of the burdens, which they are now in carrying. These suggestions may be somewhat premature, but they have been made by others, and I trust that it will not be beforo there is a determined attempt to improve the industrial and social conthe ditions of the people. At the forthcoming conference, consideration should of be given to the need for a general we are survey of the industrial conditions conof Australia in order to determine to what extent reduced hours of labour can be adopted, thereby reducing unemand offering better conditions than are available at present. In conclusion, I repeat that the budget speech delivered by the right honourable the Prime Minister (Mr Lyons) is the most dismal and uninspiring financial statement this Parliament has ever been asked to consider. That important section of the community which has not only borne an undue share of sacrifice, but is also suffering distress unprecedented in the history of Australia, is totally unprovided for. It is the responsibility of the Government to do something tangible to relieve unemployment, and to give a direct lead to other countries. ""We should remodel our industrial system, and by so doing, provide work and the necessities of life to which every member of this community is justly entitled. Progress reported.
