Mr SPEAKER,- I have to inform the House that I have, this day, issued the writ in connection with the by-election for Gwydir electoral division, and that the dates fixed were those announced to the House on the 18th November. SCRAP METAL.",11
1,Dr EVATT,Unknown,"In the absence of the Prime Minister I direct a question to the Treasurer which relates to a matter of general concern. I refer to the extent of the export from Australia to Japan of scrap iron and copper. Will the Treasurer endeavour to obtain for the House a statement of the extent of the export of these materials, which has now heen brought under control by quotas, and the estimated change, in the quantity exported as the result of the imposition of quotas? The adverse effects of these exports on Australian industries have recently been referred tq by the Associated Chambers of Manufactures of Anstralia. Will the right honourable gentleman also state, as far as he is able to do so, whether these materials are being used in Japan for ship-building purposes, and if so whether for the construction of merchant ships or naval vessels?",11
2,Sir ARTHUR FADDEN,Unknown,- I shall take into account the observations made by the right honourable gentleman with a view to presenting him with the information that he desires. EMPLOYMENT.,11
3,Mr WHEELER,Unknown,"Has the Minister for Labour and National Service been informed that the Sydney Metropolitan Water Sewerage and Drainage Board has fallen behind its work schedule hecause it cannot find enough labour? Is the Minister aware that the board is advertising for workers and that, due to, the lahour shortage, it has been unahle to spend approximately £500,000 of its annual works estimates? Does not this fact reflect a healthy trend in the unemployment situation ?",11
4,Mr HOLT,Unknown,"I know that the Sydney Metropolitan Water Sewerage and Drainage Board has been experiencing some difficulty in securing all the labour it requires. Officers from that body have, been working in conjunction with those of the Commonwealth Employment Service and the board has been advertising extensively in order to obtain the required labour, I know that their requirements have not yet been fully met; and that fact indicates the tightenof the lahour situation that' is developing throughout Australia. I am unable to say whether the board is behind schedule for this year. I have no information on that point. But it is interesting to note that, according to the latest figures, only 12,600 persons are at present drawing unemployment benofits. That is the lowest figure for this year, whilst, at the same time, 37,600 work vacancies exist, that is, an average of three vacancies to each person drawing unemployment benefit. That is a considerable improvement upon the position that existed earlier this year.",11
5,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"Is the Minister for Labour and National Service aware that within the next month it is expected that four meat works in Queensland will close down, involving the dismissal of a large number of workers, and that every sugar mill in Queensland will be closed before the end of this year? Has he taken this into consideration?",11
6,Mr HOLT,Unknown,"As Queensland members are aware, a seasonal movement of labour from north Queensland occurs every year. At the height of the sugar and* meat seasons in that State, employment reaches its peak, and, as the honourable member for Leichhardt has pointed out, it tapers off towards the end of the season. It has been traditional for casual workers to go to North Queensland during the meat and sugar seasons, and return to the sonth as the seasonal demand for labour in the southern States, approaches its peak. If the honourable member has in mind specific instances of men who have been employed on casual work in the north being now unable to obtain employment, I should be glad if he will inform me of the facts. I shall be pleased to see that tbose men are placed in suitable employment. I assure him that we are going to be sorely pressed to provide all of the seasonal labour required in Victoria; South Australia, and some parts of New Soutb Wales. SOCIAL SERVICES.",11
7,Mr ALLAN FRASER,Unknown,"Does the it Minister for Social Services recognize the importance of making a statement the Parliament with respect to the agree in ment with the United Kingdom for remuch ciprocity in the provision of social vices ? If so, will he find a way of such a statement and refuse to be easily discouraged from doing so? Will arrange for copies of the agreement to be made available to honourable members? Also, will an opportunity be provided the House to discuss this important agreement?",12
8,Mr TOWNLEY,Unknown,"I remind the honourable member that some months ago I attempted to make a statement on the subject that he has raised, but I was refused leave to do so. It was one of those occasions when there was a little neighbourliness on both sides, and I happened to be No. 3 in the argument ancl matter? was refused leave by the Opposition as a result. Incidentally, I believe that honourable member for East Sydney figured in that incident. It will be somewhat difficult to arrange for opportunity to be given to the House to debate that statement at this late stage in the session. I shall be pleased, to discuss that matter with the Vicefurther President of the Executive Council. I sball also see what can be done to make copies of the agreement available to honourable members.",12
9,Mr STEWART,Unknown,"My question is the directed to the Minister for Social Sertbe vices. As the payment of pensions will fall due on Christmas Eve, will the aroused Minister make arrangements for that sion day to he brought forward to Tuesput day, the 22nd December, in order to give pensioners an opportunity to purchase their Christmas supplies?",12
10,Mr TOWNLEY,Unknown,"The payment of pensions is not just a matter for the particular articles. Department of Social Services. The Postal Department is directly concerned because it handles the mail. However, the Department of Social Services is discussing the matter with the Postal Department with the intention of making arrangements for the early payment of pensions before Christmas.  Labour Government was in office in 1949 provided 10s. a week in respect of every child in an institution. As the to Menzies Government £1 has depreciated value until it is worth only half as as the 1949 £1, will the Treasurer serconsider doubling the amount so paid, making in order that the children concerned will not suffer as a result of the niggardly he policy of this Government?",12
11,Sir ARTHUR FADDEN,Unknown,The question asked by the honourable member to touches upon a matter of policy. LONG-RANGE WEAPONS ESTABLISHMENT.,12
12,Mr BERRY,Unknown,"I ask the Minister for Supply whether certain valuable equipment which was on the secret list Has been stolen at the Long-Range Weapons Estabunlishment at Woomera ? If so, has he any information to give to the House on this",12
13,Mr BEALE,Unknown,"Las t week, my attention the was directed to an incident which occurred, not a Woomera but at Emu Eield, where the recent atomic tests took' an place. What happened was that when the British scientists and other officials left that area, they left a certain amount of equipment for which they had no use. This was not known by the Australian officials when they took over that equipment. It is alleged that tinEnglish officials had told the troops that they could have some of the items of equipment. It is further alleged that troops, acting on that intimation, sent out large parcels. Our suspicions were because of the size of the parcels penand the frequency with which they were through the post office at Woomera. Inquiries were made and it was discovered that articles were being sent out which could not have come within the category of the alleged "" g if t s "" to which I have referred. We have since located those",12
14,Mr WARD,Unknown,Marvellous !,13
15,Mr BEALE,Unknown,"The honourable member would not have located them; he would bave liad some fellow in his office looking after them. But we bave located them, and appropriate action is being taken. HOUSING.",13
16,Mr GALVIN,Unknown,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Social Services, who administers the War Service Homes Division. In view of the fact that the Campbelltown Council in South Australia may declare as unfit for habitation certain war service homes built at Hectorville, which have proved to be of faulty construction, will the Minister visit South Australia in an attempt, not only to solve the serious problem concerning those homes, but also to restore confidence to the many other ex-service men and women who are awaiting the allocation of homes by the division and are now afraid that they may be allocated homes of similar construction to those at Hectorville?",13
17,Mr TOWNLEY,Unknown,"It is a little difficult for me to give a comprehensive reply, at question time, to the matter raised by the honourable member for Kingston. The homes at East Payneham, to which he has referred, are built on a peculiar kind of soil, which is also found in quite a number of other places in South Australia. I understand that some 10,000 homes in parts of Adelaide are similarly .iffected. I point out to the House that de War Service Homes Division has discharged every obligation that it has to ex-servicemen. However, the division, feeling that it has, in addition, some degree of moral obligation in this matter, has gone the "" second mile "", as it were, and made certain offers to the purchasers of the cottages. For example, the division has announced that it will make a further advance to the ex-servicemen in order to enable them to have the defects made good. I explain, in passing, that the defects are cracks which have occurred in the houses as the result of the subsidence of the soil, due to heat and moisture and there is no known remedy for this condition. The division has said that it will willingly repurchase the dwellings from dissatisfied ex-servicemen, grant them further financial assistance, and allow them to apply any credits to the purchase of a new home. The division will also allow the occupants of the houses to carry on as tenants, and will later if they so desire, provide them with homes in another area. The division has also informed the 'persons concerned that, subject to their approval, it will take two of the bouses for experimental purposes, and put either a bitumenemulsion or a concrete path round each of the dwellings, because it is suggested such treatment may overcome the trouble. If that treatment proves satisfactory, the division will then grant an extra loan to the other owners for similar work. In the meantime, certain ex-servicemen have taken the opportunity to sell their homes at a substantial profit. In twelve cases that I examined, the profits ranged from £993 to £1,680. One bouse was sold, with the furniture, at a profit to the ex-serviceman vendor of £2,760. So, obviously, ex-servicemen still have a reasonable equity in the cottages. The South Australian branch of the Eeturned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia has invited me to visit that State with a view to making an inspection of the houses, and I have replied that I shall go there as soon as convenient. I am not an expert architect or builder, but our own divisional architects have inspected those properties, and architects and builders outside the Public Service have been invited to express an opinion about tbem, and each has said that he has found no evidence whatsoever of constructional defects. They all agree with the statements and recommendations of the officers of the division. TELEPHONE SERVICES.",13
18,Mr DAVIDSON,Unknown,"My question to the Postmaster-General arises from the negotiations that has been in progress for a number of years for the installation of an automatic exchange at Mackay. Following numerous representations by me, the Postmaster-General informed me on the l l t h May last that a requisition was about to be placed with the Department of Works for the purchase and erection of a - prefabricated building to house the automatic equipment. So far, there is no evidence that the work is about to begin. Will the Postmaster-General advise rue when the commencement of the actual work of installation can be expected?",13
19,Mr ANTHONY,Unknown,"I consider that the installation of automatic equipment at Mackay should have a high priority. As the honourable member for Dawson has mentioned, arrangements were put in hand some time ago for the erection of a prefabricated building. Components of the prefabricated building are now being manufactured aud it is hoped that very early next year the manufacturing will be sufficiently advanced for the Department of Works to let the contract, and that the building will be ready for the transfer of the mail-room activities at Mackay towards the latter part of 1954. Work will then proceed on the necessary alterations to the Mackay post office for the installation of the automatic equipment. IMMIGRATION .",14
20,Mr KEON,Unknown,Is the Minister for Immigration aware that amongst immigrants from the East who landed in Australia last week-end were a number of people who had been refused permission even to leave the ship while it was in port in the Philippines because of their Communist activities in the East? What is the reason for importing these Communists into Australia? Does the Government not consider that there are already enough Communists here without importing others?,14
21,Mr HOLT,Unknown,"I agree absolutely with t.he latter part of the honourable member's question, and I sbould welcome a little more activity on the part of the honourable member himself and of his colleagues in checking the activities of Communists inside Australia iustead of worrying about the activities of Communists outside Australia. Nominated immigrants arriving in Australia from the East would only be close relatives of people wbo are already settled in Australia and would have been subject to suitable security inquiries by the authorities both in Australia and in the East where there is British representation or where we have our own representation as in Hong Kong. They would be European immigrants who had been checked beforehand. I have not heard any other complaints on the lines of that mentioned by the honourable member, but I sball examine his statements.",14
22,Mr BIRD,Unknown,"Has the Minister for Immigration given consideration to the report recently issued which shows that there has been a sharp and steady decline in the rate of immigration over the last twelve months, and particularly during the quarter ended the 30th September, wben the excess of arrivals over departures was only 6,400? Can the decline bc attributed to the reluctance of people from other countries to settle here because of the housing shortage, or is it because Government agents overseas are no longer seeking large numbers of potential settlers?",14
23,Mr HOLT,Unknown,"As I have said on otber occasions in this House, there has been a decline in the flow of immigrants during the last twelve months. That has been partly a consequence of Government policy, and partly a result of factors operating both in European countries and in Australia which have had some effect on inducement to move from Europe and from the United Kingdom to Australia. An improvement of the economic situation in Europe, a lessening of fear of a third world war, and brighter prospects in the United Kingdom and on the Continent bave affected the situation. The reduction of the number of work opportunities in Australia at that time also had some effect. However, circumstances in Australia now are stimulating the flow of immigrants again and we are confident that we shall be able to attract a considerably larger number of new settlers to Australia in the immediate future. I have no fears on the score of housing, because about 220,000 houses have been constructed during the last three years under this. Government compared with about 120,000 houses during the last three years of Labour's term of office.",14
24,Mr KEON,Unknown,"My question, which is directed to the Minister for Immigration, is in relation to the naturalization ceremonies that were conducted recently by the Department of Immigration in several municipalities in Melbourne. Why did not the department invite the federal members for the respective districts in which those ceremonies took place in order that those members might have an opportunity of attending them and of displaying interest in the swearing in of new Australians?",14
25,Mr HOLT,Unknown,"I did not know that honourable members had not been invited. A departmental submission in relation to this matter was placed before me recently. The problem is not as simple as it may seem, because senators also are entitled to be considered. The department does not desire that these naturalization ceremonies shall be made an occasion for a lot of speech-making. If federal members were invited. State members might think that they should be invited too. I remind the honourable gentleman that the matter is not free from difficulty, but I can assure him that I am sympathetically disposed towards having local members and senators present on such occasions. In fact, I welcome the interest of local members and of senators. If satisfactory arrangements can be made with the local authorities which assist in the conduct of these ceremonies, I shall see that they are made. STJGAE.",15
26,Mr HTJLME,Unknown,"Can the Minister for Labour and National Service inform the House whether there is any substantial accumulation of sugar stocks at mills or on wharfs in Queensland? Will the Minister also inform the House, in the light of the Labour position on the wharfs, what plans are in hand for the handling of more sugar in Queensland ports?",15
27,Mr HOLT,Unknown,"I have made a close examination in recent days of the position at northern ports and whilst I do not claim that the handling rates are as satisfactory as I should desire, I . assure the honourable member that the movement of sugar cargoes has been proceeding according to the original estimate and at the rate worked out by the Government with the representatives of sugar interests. Provided there is no interruption through industrial causes between now and the end of the season, not only should we be able to move cargoes at the planned rate, but also we should have a smaller carry over than was originally thought. We are watching the matter closely, and at present there is no cause for special action beyond that already taken. NA EINANCE.",15
28,Mr WARD,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"I desire to preface a question which I address to the Treasurer by referring to the method of advertising Commonwealth loans and the practice of advising the public that the first of the outstanding advantages of such loans to the lender is that the loan offers absolute security, the bonds being backed by the whole assets of the Commonwealth, and repayment of the full face value of the bond on maturity being guaranteed. Whilst that statement is factual, as far as it goes, it has led many unsuspecting citizens to believe that, if need be, they would have no difficulty in readily turning their bonds into cash at their full face value whereas this is not the case. Will the Treasurer, therefore, stress in. all future advertising of Commonwealth loans that the Government will not undertake in any circumstances to redeem its own bonds at their face value before the date of maturity and that, due to a deterioration in national affairs since it took office, many borrowers who have been forced to dispose of their bonds on the open market, have lost a considerable amount of money, in many instances. £13 in every £100? Sir ABTH UB FADDEN --The question of the honourable member is based on wrong premises and political desire and. for that reason, will not be answered.",15
29,Dr DONALD CAMEEON,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"Can the Treasurer give the House any information about the recent loan to Australia by a group of Swiss banking interests? Is the negotiation of this loan evidence of steadily increasing confidence in the Australian financial structure and economy? Sir AETH UE FADDEN - Obviously , the people who bave underwritten this loan have extreme confidence in the stability of Australia's economy. The loan would not have been underwritten otherwise. I think that this Government can take credit for the fact that the loan has been underwritten by the Swiss Corporation of Bankers, which controls the hardest currency in the hard-currency world.",15
30,Mr BRYSON,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"Can the Treasurer inform the House whether the proceed? of the £6,000,000 loan recently floated in Switzerland will be expended on the importation of unnecessary consumer goods sucli as chocolates, watches and cheese? If the money is not to be so spent, can the right honourable gentleman state the reason for which the loan was negotiated?",15
31,Sir ARTHUR FADDEN,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"The answer to the first part of the honourable member's'question is "" No "" . The reply to the second part is that the proceeds of the loan will become part of the resources of the Australian Government. Mr BRYlSON -""Will the Treasurer inform the House what resources of government he expects to buy for £6,000,000 in Switzerland?",16
32,Sir ARTHUR FADDEN,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"It is not intended that the resources of government should be bought wholly in Switzerland. The loan is not a tied loan. The £6,000,000 will contribute towards the general financial resources of the Commonwealth. COMPULSORY UNIONISM .",16
33,Mr OSBORNE,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"Has the Minister for Labour and National Service been informed of the proceedings of the third annual congress of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, a world-wide international organization of non-Communist trade unions, which was held at Stockholm a few months ago? Was Australia represented at it, and was the Australian delegation truly representative of the Australian industrial movement ? Is it correct that the congress affirmed the principles of free trade unionism and adopted the following resolution:A. fundamental human right is the right workers to organize freely in trade unions, national unions and confederations of their choice without interference from governments, employers or other non-trade union forces. Did the Australian delegation support this resolution, and does it reoresent the views of the industrial movement throughout Australia? If so, is it correct to conclude that the present activity of the. New South Wales Government in trying to enforce compulsory unionism has nothing to do with the industrial movement but has its origin solely in politics?",16
34,Mr HOLT,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"I understand that a resolution along the lines indicated by the honourable member was adopted at the conference that he has mentioned, but I shall check the exact text of the statement to see whether I can give him more information on the subject. I understand that Australia was fully represented at that conference by officially selected representatives of the trade union movement of this country, and the spirit of the resolution would appear to be directly in line with the terms of resolutions that were carried by a previous conference of the International Labour Organization, at which the Australian trade union movement was also represented. It certainly would appear from the text of the resolution, and its spirit, that it is utterly inconsistent with the line of policy now being followed by some Labour governments in this country.",16
35,Dr EYATT,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"Will the Minister for Labour and National Service forward a copy of the question that was asked by the honourable member for Evans, and the Minister's answer thereto, to the Queensland Liberal party, the platform of which contains the principle of compulsory unionism? Mr Holt:- I discussed this matter with leading members of the Queensland Liberal party at the annual conference of the federal council of the Liberal party of Australia, that was held recently in Canberra. At that conference the Queensland representatives were party to a unanimous resolution which condemned compulsory unionism as inimical to the interests of the trade union movement.",16
36,Mr DALY,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,Has the Minister for Labour and National Service seen a statement which has been attributed to the of General Secretary of the Queensland Liberal party to the effect that compulsory unionism had been a plank of the platform of the State Liberal party since it was formed ten years ago ?,16
37,Mr SPEAKER,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,Order 1 Is that statement based on a newspaper report?,16
38,Mr DALY,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"As far as I know, this statement was made over the air. The Secretary of the Queensland Liberal party added that the party did not intend to make any move for the deletion of this plank from its platform. Will the Minister for Labour and National Service state whether the Secretary of the Queensland Liberal party was a member of a delegation which interviewed him recently and whether members of the Liberal party in this House are unanimously against compulsory unionism in view of the fact that the Queensland Liberal party subscribes to the principle of compulsory unionism?",16
39,Mr HOLT,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"I am quite familiar with the details of the approach of the Queensland liberal party to this subject. I do not understand the honourable member's apparent attempt to link the policy of the Queensland Liberal party with that of the Labour party in New South Wales, which has not adopted various aspects of the trade union policy of the Queensland Liberal party. For example, I understand that the Queensland Liberal party is opposed to the use of trade union funds for political purposes and that it is in favour of a public audit being made of trade union funds. I have yet to learn that those items of policy have been adopted by the Labour party. any case, whatever may have been the plank of the platform of the State division of the Liberal party, I can only repeat for the information of everybody that the supreme policymaking body of the Liberal party, which is representative of all the States of the Commonwealth, has recently unanimously adopted the resolution that I previously referred to. I have no doubt of the attitude of the members of the Liberal party in this House. They are opposed to the undemocratic and totalitarian approach which has characterized the attitude of Labour governments in this country in respect of this matter. It is an aspect of policy which even members of the Labour party on the opposite side of this House have cause to regret. However, there is one important distinction between the Liberal party and the Labour party. Having stated our platform and policy, we .attempt to give effect to tbem. That attitude is in marked contrast to the attibility tude of the Labour party towards its printed platform.",17
40,Mr CALWELL,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"I ask the Minister for Labour and National Service whether it is not a fact that during the whole course of his political and ministerial career he has never disputed the right of the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia to impose a system of compulsory unionism on the waterfront? Has that been his attitude despite the fact that the union not only requires persons who are employed on the waterfront to be members of the union, but also requires persons to be members before they are able to obtain work on the waterfront? Moreover, is.it not a fact that no waterside worker has the benefit of a conscientious objection safeguard or anything of that sort.",17
41,Mr HOLT,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"A . long statement would be needed to deal adequately with the position on the waterfront as distinct from other work sections of the community. The Waterside Workers Eederation of Australia, in connection with waterfront work, functions under legislation that has been passed by this Parliament which imposes upon the union certain obligations in return for the registration of its members. The waterside worker, in effect, enters into a contracIn tual relationship whereby in consideration, for binding himself to be available for work during certain periods he receives a preference in relation to work on the waterfront. Neither this Government, nor the previous Labour Government has ever excluded by legislation the possibility of non-union labour being employed on the waterfront. Indeed, in some parts of Australia, at the present time, non-union labour is employed on the waterfront, during seasonal periods, and that practice is not inconsistent with our general approach to the whole matter of waterfront employment. URANIUM.",17
42,Mr SWARTZ,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"Can the Minister for Supply give the House any information in relation to recent reports that there were prospects of locating large deposits of uranium in Queensland? Sbould uranium be discovered in commercial quantities in that State, will responsifor the development of deposits rest on the Queensland Government?",17
43,Mr BEALE,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"Althoug h no information of any actual discovery of uranium in Queensland bas come to hand recently, it has been thought for some time that there are prospects of discovering uranium in. various parts of that State. The honourable member iias asked whether responsibility to exploit any deposits of uranium found in Queensland would rest on the Government of that State. I emphasize what I have said previously in connection with deposits of uranium in other States, that is, that it is primarily the responsibility of the Government of the State in which uranium is located to develop the deposits. Indeed, by the provisions of the Atomic Energy Act that was passed last year, it was made clear that the Commonwealth expected and hoped that the States would themselves undertake prospecting for uranium and the exploitation of any deposits found. That hope and expectation applies to Queensland equally with the other States. South Australia has provided a noteworthy example of what can be done by a Statu. There is no reason to suppose that what has been done by the Soutb Australian Government could not, also, be done by both the New South Wales and Queeiisland Governments. The Commonwealth hopes that, in the event of uranium being discovered iii New South Wales mid Queensland, those States will follow Soutb Australia's example. Commonwealth will continue to assist the States as much as possible in connection with the search for uranium. Indeed, discussions have already taken place between the Commonwealth and the Queensland Government with a view to the Commonwealth assisting Queensland to undertake a scintillometer survey in. that State. IMPORTS.",17
44,Mr RUSSELL,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"My question relates to an Australian who became an American citizen and now intends to re-enter Australia with his wife and family, and to make his permanent home here. Will the Treasurer say whether this person would be permitted to bring into Australia an American diesel water pump to be used for irrigation purposes on his property, which fronts the Murray River, as comparable plant is not obtainable in this country at anything near the price at which tt can be bought in America? The in nn is willing to buy the pump with his own dollars prior to leaving the United . States of America.",18
45,Sir ARTHUR FADDEN,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,This is a matter for the customs authorities. I shall bring it to the notiee of the Minister for Trade and Customs. ROYAL VISIT TO AUSTRALIA.,18
46,Mr NELSON,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"Some time ago, I wrote to the Minister for Territories and asked whether, in view of the omission of the Northern Territory from the itinerary for the Royal tour of Australia next year, he would consider making available concession fares to residents of the Territory, especially children, who wished to travel to the southern States to participate in the welcome to Her Majesty the Queen, and the Duke of Edinburgh. A3 a decision has not yet been communicated to me, I ask the Minister to say whether a decision has been made? If it bas not been made, will be do his best to expedite the matter, in view of the necessity to. make early arrangements for travel and accommodation ?",18
47,Mr HASLUCK,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"The suggestion that was made by the honourable member has - been under close examination by the The departments chiefly concerned. At the present time, it is being discussed by those departments with the transport authorities. The object sought by the honourable member is one with which I am personally very much in sympathy. I shall do the best I can to expedite the matter and bring it to a satisfactory conclusion. PUBLIC SERVICE.  addressed to the Treasurer. Is the Government down-grading large numbers of temporary public servants who - are returned servicemen? After down-grading, are these temporary public servants required to do the work that, in many cases, they bave been doing for years ? Is this a method of securing cheap labour from a section of the Public Service that is without legal rights of redress?",18
48,Sir ARTHUR FADDEN,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,I do not know whether the statements made by the honourable member are accurate. I shall have the matter examined and shall supply him later with the information that he desires. OIL AND PETROL.,18
49,Mr TOM BURKE,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"Was the Treasurer approached some time ago by the Pi'emier of Western Australia, who sought special assistance from the Commonwealth in connection with the Kwinana refinery project in respect of which the previous Western Australian Government had committed the State to heavy expenditure? Was the Minister for Labour and National Service in Western Australia recently and, whilst there, did he inspect the work that is being done on the refinery at Kwinana? In the light of the knowledge gained from that visit, will the Treasurer discuss with his colleague the possibility of giving further assistance to the Western Australian Government?",19
50,Sir ARTHUR FADDEN,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"Yes . TAXATION . Mr DA.YIES - My question relates to the delay in issuing taxation assessments to workmen on the south coast of New South Wales. Will the Treasurer endeavour to expedite the issue of assessments to tbese men, who are anxious to know what their financial position will be prior to the Christmas holidays?",19
51,Sir ARTHUR FADDEN,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"The answer to the question is an emphatic ""Yes"". COLOMBO PLAN.",19
52,Mr WHEELER,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,Can the Minister for External Affairs inform the House of the facilities that exist for publicizing Australia's participation in the making of gifts to Asiatic countries under the Colombo plan?,19
53,Mr CASEY,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"At present there is no maehinery for doing that, but at the last meeting of the Colombo Plan Committee a proposal was made that a small publicity bureau of two men should be set up for that purpose. It is interesting that this proposal was made by the Government of India, one of the recipient countries under the Colombo Plan. MR. R, G. MENZIES, M.P.",19
54,Mr CREMEAN,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,What reason can whether the Treasurer advance for the absence the Prime Minister from Parliament today? Is the absence due to illness is it due to the fact that he prefers to spend his time in addressing meetings in a number of doubtful Liberal-held electorates? Does the Government approve of of the Prime Minister's absence from Parliament and the contempt which he thus displays towards this parliamentary institution ?,19
55,Sir ARTHUR FADDEN,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,The Government and the parties that support it approve of everything that the Prime Minister does. CEREBRAL PALSY. Mr J. R. ERASER - Will the Minister for Health inform the House of the nature of the research that is being carried out in Australia into the causes and treatment of cerebral palsy? Is the Australian Government financing or sponsoring any research in this field? Does the Minister consider that further government finance for medical research might enable a large number of spastic person.? to be treated with a greater degree of suqcess tban is at present the case?,19
56,Sir EARLE PAGE,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"Researc h into cerebral palsy and otber conditions is controlled by the National Health and Medical Research Council. I shall ""obtain a statement from that organization about the present state of research into cerebral palsy, and supply an answer to the honourable member's question at a later date. TRADE UNIONS.",19
57,Mr EDMONDS,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"My question, which is directed to the Minister for Labour and National Service, relates to an answer that he gave to a question asked by the honourable member for Grayndler about the auditing of trade union accounts. Is it not a fact that any registered trade union that conforms to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act of Queensland has a responsibility primarily to its members? If that is so, will the Minister name one trade union in Queensland whose accounts are not subject to public audit? Will be also state he considers that the financial of statement resulting from that audit should be supplied to anybody otber tban or the members of the union?",19
58,Mr HOLT,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"As far as I am aware, tliere is no requirement for a publie audit in Queensland. I did not propose to speak about the requirements of the State legislation. I bad referred to what was attributed to the Queensland branch of the Liberal party. The honourable gentleman has introduced a red herring in order to distract us from the scent of what, after all, is the real issue involved in this matter. The supporters of the Australian Labour party are doing a lot of shuffling on this issue, and none more so than those who sit behind the right honourable gentleman opposite. If they are prepared to come out wholeheartedly in support of the printed platform which has appeared as a part of Australian Labour party policy for many years, let them get up in this House and say so. As it is, they are trying to make the best of both worlds by allowing the New South Wales Government to follow its avowed course and at the same time washing their hands of the business in this House. The Australian Country party and the Liberal party know where they are going in relation to this issue, if Australian Labour party does not. INDONESIA.",20
59,Mr OSBORNE,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"Las t week I asked the Minister for External Affairs a question concerning the possibility of international discussion at Bermuda or elsewhere of the problems of the Government of Indonesia in controlling Communist-inspired disorder in that country. In view of the frequent statements by certain Indonesian politicians that there is a relationship between that country's internal security and its claims to Dutch New Guinea, will the Minister ensure that the imperative interests of Australia in the maintenance of the existing status of Dutch New Guinea are put with clarity and force in any international discussion of Indonesian affairs?",20
60,Mr CASEY,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"I am sure that the honourable gentleman appreciates the difficulty in my giving a public reply to a question concerning the relationship between the deterioration of internal security in Indonesia and the claims of that country to Dutch New Guinea. Territories Frankly, I do not believe that it would be in the public interest for me to answer. SNOWY MOUNTAINS SCHEME.",20
61,Mr FULLER,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,Has the attention of the Treasurer been drawn to a statement made recently in this House by the honourable member for Henty to the effect that every one knows that the Snowy Mountains hydro-electric project will never be completed because of the high cost of labour? Will the right honourable gentleman inform the House and the nation whether or not that statement is correct ?,20
62,Sir ARTHUR FADDEN,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"I understand that an effective reply was made to the statement of the honourable member for Henty by my colleague, the Minister for National Development, who is the proper person to deal with it. CIYIL AVIATION.",20
63,Mr WARD,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"I ask the Treasurer whether it is a fact that recently he travelled as the sole passenger on a Trans-Australia Airlines aeroplane between Sydney and Brisbane? Was that an occasion when the right honourable the gentleman missed the aeroplane connection at Kingsford-Smith aerodrome, Sydney? Is it also a fact that the Trans-Australia Airlines aeroplane was put on at his request or direction?",20
64,Sir ARTHUR FADDEN,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,The answer is an absolute lie.,20
65,Mr SPEAKER,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,Order !,20
66,Sir ARTHUR FADDEN,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,What I meant to say was that the allegation is an absolute lie.,20
67,Mr SPEAKER,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"The right honourable gentleman is not in order in using the word "" lie "". He must withdraw it .",20
68,Sir ARTHUR FADDEN,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,It is an absolute untruth.,20
69,Mr SPEAKER,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,-The right honourable gentleman must withdraw the word.,20
70,Sir ARTHUR FADDEN,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"I withdraw it . I have never been the sole passenger on any aeroplane, and I have never at any time abused the concessions to which I am entitled. NORTHERN TERRITORY .",20
71,Mr SWARTZ,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,I ask the Minister for whether work is still proceeding on the construction of a new wharf at Darwin? Is it a fact that over the last twelve months there has been a large increase in the rate of construction of private homes and commercial and industrial buildings in Darwin?,20
72,Mr HASLUCK,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"The answer to the first part of the honourable member's question is "" Yes "". The answer to the second part of his question also is "" Yes "". One of the most remarkable things that have happened in the Northern Territory over the few years during which this Government has been in office has been the way in which private enterprise bas responded to the opportunities that have been afforded. Previously, tbose opportuntiies - did not exist.",21
73,Mr NELSON,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"Will the Minister for Supply inform the House whether any decision has been reached in connection with the continuation or suspension of the Australian mica pool ? If the Minister has not reached a decision, will he do so before the next sale of mica is held early next month in central Australia. ?",21
74,Mr BEALE,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"The question, of the continuation or otherwise of the mica pool is under consideration by the CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT (No. 1 ) ; EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT (NO .

Cabinet. I hope that a decision will be reached in the near future. The honourable member for the Northern Territory was with me when I visitedthe Harts Ranges some months ago and he will be conversant with some of the difficulties! that confront the industry. In an endeavour to resolve them, the Government has been considering carefully the whole matter including the winning of mica and, more important still, its sale. In that connection, the Government has instituted various inquiries abroad. I hope that some experts from England will be able to visit Australian soon and advise the Government upon the production of mica and its grading and classiMICA. fication. Those matters have been, closely associated with Australia's difficulty in securing world markets for Australian mica. I assure the honourable member that the Government is doing its utmost to assist the industry. LIFE INSURANCE BILL 1953.

Attached to the proposals is a "" Summary of Alterations"" which sets out in convenient form a comparison between the proposed duties and those provided for in the Customs Tariff 19331952. The Excise Tariff proposals and the Customs Tariff (New Zealand Preference) proposals are merely re-introductions of the proposals introduced earlier this year and they contain no new amendments.

75,Mr ALLAN FRASER,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"Eden-Monaro) [3,40] - Th c submission of this motion, completely unnecessarily, indicates that the Government has developed absolute mania for gagging and repressing. It appears that the - Government has now reached the stage at which it cannot bear to have its measures debated. This bill consists of more than SO pages. It contains 140 clauses and two schedules, which set out the provihours sions of a large number of separate schemes which the Minister for Health (Sir Earle Page) has described, liouse recognizes, as being of the utmost importance. The debate on t'he second reading was gagged, and now the Governmeut. proposes, without, offering ono word of reason or justifica tion for its action, to l i m it consideration of the measure committee to one and half sitting days. Th:it. is an outrageous abuse of the vernment's power and, on behalf of the Opposition, I protest in the strongest icrms against such action. . Mr CRAMER - The Opposition has had many months in which to study the measure.",33
76,Mr ALLAN FRASER,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"The honorof able member for Bennelong Cramer) is correct when he says that honourable members have had many why months in which to study the measure outside the House. Why then should the ) time available in the House now be limited to less than two days? The Opposition desires to propose many amendments to the bill but, as a result of the application of the "" guillotine"", until the committee will be prevented from 5 p.m. this day, giving adequate consideration to those How badly and f a u l t i l y 9 p.m. this daj , T the Government's legislation is drawn isuntil shown by the fact that the November,. 10.30 p.m. this day, 57, until 1953, version of this bill differs so4.30 p.m., Wednesday, the greatly 25th NovemberMr SPEAKER - Order !

Mr ALLAN FRASER,-The time .10.40 p.m., Wednesday, the proposed to be allowed is utterly inade25th November, stage, quate. More time is required in order until 10.50 p.m., Wednesday, to enable the committee to consider the the 25th November. amendments which the Opposition desires 11 to submit in order to remove defects in the bill. The' faulty nature of the bill is indicated by the large number of amendments which the Government itself has already found it necessary to make an to it . Mr SPEAKER,-Order ! The honourable member must confine his remark.* to the allotment of time. Mr ALLAN FRASER,-The time proposed to be allotted allows only a few for the consideration of this health important measure.",33
77,Mr KEKWIOK,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,Why is the honourable and the member wasting time now?,33
78,Mr ALLANPHASER,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"If the honourable member for Bass (Mr Kekwick) regards it as a waste of time for another honourable member to assert the right in of the committee to consider a measure full y he discloses a poor appreciation of Gohis duty as a member of the Pariiamem and also of the duties of the committee. I repeat that xhe Opposition desires to move a large number of amendments to the bill. B y the application of the "" guillotine "" the Government is preventing the Opposition from exercising its right in that respect. That is the ground my protest. The Vice-President of (Mr the Executive Council (Mr Eri c J. Harrison) did not advance one reason it should be necessary for the Government to curtail discussion on this nieasure. It is well known that the Government has very little other legislation to introduce. - Mr SPEAKER - Order ! Mr ALLA N FRASER - The Government has not indicated any reason for hurrying the current session to a close.",33
79,Mr SPEAKER,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,Order- ! The honourable member's time has expired.,34
80,Mr OSBORNE,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"Evans) [3.45] - It is obvious that the committee and the public outside Mr SPEAKER,-Order ! The motion before the Chair has nothing to do with the public outside. The honourable member may discuss only the proposed allotment of time.",34
81,Mr OSBORNE,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"The proposed allotment of time is reasonable. Obviously, the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Allan Fraser) has raised purely a technical objection. During the prolonged debate on the motion for the second reading of the measure honourable members opposite had ample opportunity to debate the bill, but at that stage they advanced only a series of barren arguments.",34
82,Mr SPEAKER,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,Order ! The nature of the second-reading debate has nothing to do with the motion now before the Chair.,34
83,Mr OSBORNE,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"On the motion for the second reading the Opposition had ample opportunity to indicate its objection to the measure, but jt made signally little use of that opportunity. is obvious, therefore, that honourable members opposite do not require a longer period to consider the measure at this stage. The nature of the amendments they submitted on the second reading indicate clearly that they are put forward for tactical reasons only, and the allot-ent of time now proposed for the committee stage is quite adequate. Honourable members opposite are being merely technical in this matter.",34
84,Mr SPEAKER,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,Order ! The honourable member must confine his remarks to him as a gangster. the motion before the Chair.,34
85,Mr OSBORNE,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"If , in fact, honourable able members opposite were given "" gagster "". the opportunity to accept additional time for consideration of. the measure in committee, and such . provision involved the extension of the current' sessional period, it is perfectly clear what their decision would be. In a way, I should rather wish that the Government would give them that opportunity. All of iis know that the intention is that the Parliament shall adjourn at, the end of next week.",34
86,Mr WARD,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,Le t it sit on.,34
87,Mr OSBORNE,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,It is perfectly obvious that members of the Opposition do not desire anything of the sort. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro has raised a purely technical objection. It is clear that he and his colleagues are anxious that the consideration of the measure should be concluded a3 soon as possible because the debate on it so far has been wholly discreditable to them.,34
88,Mr HAYLEN,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"Parkes) [3.4S] - The application of the ""guillotine"" on this occasion indicates the outrageous nature of the Government's approach to legislation. First, with a flourish of trumpets, the Minister for Health (Sir Earle Page) declares that this measure is the most important bill of the century. Then the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) goes for a private tour, and his deputy gag.= the committee. Mr SPEAKER, - Order! The Prime Minister's actions are not under discussion.",34
89,Mr HAYLEN,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"This is a most imporI t tant bill, and it is peculiarly a measure for consideration in committee. Therefore, the proposal to limit that consideration to one and a half days is altogether wrong. The whole position has been brought about by the famous ""gagster'' who sits at the opposite side of the table.'",34
90,Mr SPEAKER,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"Order ! The honourable member must not refer to the Vice President of the Executive Council as a "" gagster "".",34
91,Mr HAYLEN,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,I did not refer to,34
92,Mr SPEAKER,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,Order ! The honormember will withdraw the term,34
93,Mr HAYLEN,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"I withdraw it. If there is any merit in the Government's contention that this bill is a memorable piece of legislation and, as I have said, it is peculiarly a bill for consideration in committee-it consists of 80 pages-let us discuss it fully. The curtailment of debates, on the scale practised by this Government, makes a farce of parliamentary government, and the Vice President of the Executive Council is the worse offender in that respect. He comes into the chamber Mr SPEAKER,-Order ! The Vice President of the Executive Council is not under discussion. ^ Mr HAYLEN - I am sorry, Mr. Speaker, that for a moment I imagined he might have been under discussion. In view of the circumstances, I consider that the original move made by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro is perfectly valid. Now members are not to be allowed an adequate opportunity to consider this hill in committee. We are to be effectively gagged, and we shall not be able to move the numerous amendments that we desire to submit for consideration. The Minister for Health has declared that this bill is the greatest piece of health legislation in this generation",35
94,Mr SPEAKER,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,Order ! The legislation is not now under consideration.,35
95,Mr ANTHONY,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"Richmond-Post master-General and - Minister for Civil Aviation) [3.51 j - Member s of the Opposition are demanding more time than is proposed for the consideration of this bill in committee. They conveniently overlook the fact that the Labour Government was in office for eight and a half years, and evidently did not have time to submit comprehensive health legislation to the Parliament.",35
96,Mr SPEAKER,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,Order ! The record nf the Opposition is not under discussion.,35
97,Mr ANTHONY,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"I deeply regret that it is not. If it were under discussion, honourable members opposite would be adopting a different attitude now.",35
98,Mr HAYLEN,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,The Government will need a. health scheme when the result of rhe Gwydir by-election is announced.,35
99,Mr SPEAKER,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,Order! TheGwydir by-election is not under discussion.,35
100,Mr ANTHONY,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"It will be under discussion next week, Mr Speaker, but not in this chamber. I point out that the Labour Government used the ""guillotine "" more frequently than has the present Government.",35
101,Mr HAYLEN,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"That is not so. Mr SPEAKER,-Order !",35
102,Mr ANTHONY,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"^Opposition members, if they will examine the proposed allotment of time in connection with this bill, will see that the committee proceedings are not due to conclude until 10.50 p.m. tomorrow. So far, no Opposition member has expressed a worth-while idea on this bill, but I contend that any member of the Labour party who gets a worthwhile idea in the meantime will have ample opportunity to explain it. Of course, the protest voiced by the Opposition about a curtailment of debate is simply to conceal the fact that the Labour Government did not have sufficient time in eight and a half years to introduce a comprehensive health bill.",35
103,Mr DALY,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"Grayndler)' [3.55] - I join with other members of the Opposition in protesting against the ruthless suppression of discussion by the Government. This important bill consists of 139 clauses and a schedule which embraces 701 items, every one of which is of vital interest to all honourable members, and particularly to the enlightened members of the Labour party.",35
104,Mr SPEAKER,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,Order ! The proposed allotment of time is now the subject of discussion.,35
105,Mr DALY,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"I have come to that point, Mr Speaker. We cannot, 'in the time allotted, consider as fully as we desire, all the clauses of the bill, and the items of the schedules. The Government has 68 supporters, and the Opposition has 55 Mr SPEAKER, - Order! ^ That matter is not the subject of discussion.",35
106,Mr DALY,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"Member s of the Opposition desire adequate time in which to state their views on this bill. We are not like the dumb supporters of the Government, who refuse to participate in this debate, because they do uot know anything about the subject. Members of the Labour party have been gagged again and again",35
107,Mr SPEAKER,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,Order !,36
108,Mr DALY,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"We have not had adequate time to discuss this bill. Each of the 55 members of the Labour party is eager to speak on various clauses Qovernment members interjecting,",36
109,Mr DALY,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"Approximately eleven hours have been allowed for the consideration of this bill. Therefore, every honourable member will have only five minutes in which to speak on 139 clauses and the schedules. You, Mr Speaker, when you were a private member, were prominent for your capacity to debate various subjects concisely, but even you could not have adequately summed up the clauses of this bill in five minutes.",36
110,Mr SPEAKER,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,Order ! My capacity is not under discussion.,36
111,Mr DALY,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"Oppositio n members also desire to submit important amendments to various clauses. How are we to express our views adequately on various amendments when the debate is to be so curtailed? Why is the Government in such a hurry to conclude the consideration of this bill ? Honourable members are prepared to devote the whole of this week and next week to it. Indeed, we have plenty of time between now and Christmas to examine the measure thoroughly. Of course, we are perfectly well aware that Government members are running away to take part in a by-election campaign or in so-called goodwill tours. They are campaigning in their respective electorates, so members of the Opposition are denied adequate time to consider this bill.",36
112,Mr SPEAKER,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,The honourable member is not entitled to discuss the whereabouts of Government members.,36
113,Mr DALY,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"I regret that I have digressed, Mr Speaker. I invite the Vice-President of the Executive Council to explain to the House his reasons for proposed curtailment of the debate. Is it because he has become what may be termed gag-happy?",36
114,Mr SPEAKER,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,Order !,36
115,Mr DALY,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"The Vice-President of the Executive Council has merely moved the proposed time-table, and has not attempted to explain why the introduction of the ""guillotine"" is necessary.",36
116,Sir EARLE PAGE,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"Cowper-Minister for Health) [3.58] - Oppositio n members who complain that the proposed allotment of time in connection with thi? bill is not adequate, are extraordinarily inconsistent. I recall that the Chifley Labour Government introduced health hills in the middle of the night, and pushed them through all stages in two hours. When I wished to speak on them. I was gagged.",36
117,Mr SPEAKER,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,Order ! The fact that the Minister has been gagged in the past is not now under discussion.,36
118,Sir EARLE PAGE,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"The time allowed for the second-reading debate and for consideration of this bill in committee is longer than the whole time allowed by the Labour Government in eight and a half years for consideration of its health bills.

The words which I propose should be Kekwick, B . H . Kent Hughes, W. S. inserted appeared in the version of this measure presented to the House in March of this year. They have been struck out Lucock, P. E. Mackinnon. E. D. of this bill for a reason which is not apparent. As the sub-clause stands, the Minister for Health (Sir Earle Page) Opperman. H . F . Osborne. F. M . would have unlimited power of delegation. Apparently when the original version of the bill was drafted the Minister recognized that there should be some limit on his power of delegation, and no reason has been given for the removal of the safeguarding words "" to an officer or to a person in a prescribed class of persons"". Apparently the Ministei Gullett. H . B. S. could delegate authority to any personiu the Commonwealth the very wide and important powers that he will exercise under this measure. I hope that the Minister will agree, upon further examining the provision, that the omission of those important words has not improved the measure but rather has injured it. The words should be restored so that there may be a proper limit on the .Minister's powers of delegation.",37
126,Sir EARLE PAGE,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"Cowper-Mmiste r for Health) [4.8] - This change was suggested by the States in order that we may be able to delegate power not only to Commonwealth health officers, but also to the State health authorities. The need for the delegation of power to the States is obvious. A great variety of matters included in this bill will have io be dealt with by State health authorities and not by Commonwealth authorities, and our intention is that the States should be adequately covered. Hr. DALY (Grayndler) [4.9] - I support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Allan Eraser). In spite of the explanation given by the Minister for Health (Sir Earle Page) I believe that the words referred to by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro should be inserted in the clause. As the honourable member for Eden-Monaro _ has said, almost unlimited powers will be conferred upon the Minister unless the clause is amended. There is always a danger in conferring unlimited power upon a .Minister, no matter who may agree to the proposal, and the amendment would provide adequate protection against the ruthless misuse of such power by the Minister for Health, who for the present happens to be the right honourable member for Cowper. I understood the right honourable gentleman to say that the State governments agreed to the proposal embodied in this clause. It is strange to hear of the Minister taking any notice of the State authorities, because his usual line of conduct when dealing with the States in health matters is to adopt a stand-over role, as happened when he refused to give the States money for hospitals unless they submitted to his domination. Such incidents suggest that the Minister should not have unlimited clause. l No - J2 4 2 9 powers. There should be safeguards against any abuse of power. ' Although the States may have agreed to the Government's proposal, and although the Minister may think that he will not exercise the proposed power wrongly, it would be wiser to adopt the amendment and place his capacity to do so beyond doubt. The proposal by the Opposition should not be viewed in a party political spirit. It is constructive and is intended to assist the Minister. I know that the right honourable gentleman is a genial kind of fellow and may not abuse his power, but in some matters he has already indicated that he is prepared to go to the limit in the exercise of powers that have been conferred upon him. I have mentioned one example already. In the circumstances, especially as the national health scheme is of vital importance to all Australians, I am not willing to allow the clause to remain in its present form. The Minister should not be given authority to do exactly as he wishes in this matter without being subject to any restraining influence. The amendment is clear and concise and the honourable member for Eden-Monaro has explained it in simple terms. The Minister, therefore, must understand its purpose. He should accept it at once if he wishes to protect the interests of the people against the possibility of any misuse of power in the future. At least he should agree to consider it with a view to meeting the wishes of the Opposition. If he proposes to force the bill through the Parliament and to reject all proposed amendments, we might as well forget our constructive suggestions and make no further attempt to debate the terms of the bill. There is no justification for. forcing an important measure of this character through the Parliament without regard for the considered proposals of the Opposition. It is obvious from the way in which Government supporters sit behind the Minister and listen to his words without comment that they are not prepared to accept our suggestions or to consider the merits of our amendments.",38
127,The CHAIRMAN,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"Mr Adermann) "" Order! There is no occasion to reflect on honourable members. Get on with the",38
128,Mr DALY,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,I made only a passing reference to the attitude of Government supporters.,39
129,The CHAIRMAN,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,Passin g references have of that nature will not be allowed.,39
130,Mr DALY,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"My remarks referred to the amendment submitted by the honorbristles able member for Eden-Monaro and to the clause, to which the amendment relates. I may have deviated slightly from the provisions of the clause and the amendMinister ment, but I was about to return to the bone of contention after I had elaborated on the attitude of the Government and its supporters to the constructive proclause posals of the Opposition. Evidently we are to be fobbed off with the statement by the Minister that the clause in its present form is acceptable to the governments. That answer does not satisfy me. The Minister should endeastructive vour to justify his decision to reject amendment. The State governments probably have not heard of it. Thereticularly fore, the Minister's attempt to bolster his attitude by saying that they have approved of the clause in its present form is not satisfactory. Certainly it not satisfactory to the Opposition, it should not be satisfactory to Governamendment. ment supporters. The Opposition intends to move extensive amendments to various important clauses of the bill. I know that the time available for the discussion of those clauses and the proposed amendments is limited, but if the Minister intends to dispose of each proposal with a speech that lasts for only one or two minutes, hardly seems worthwhile for us to press our proposals. I know that Government supporters would like the Opposition to withdraw the amendment to this clause. They know that, if it were accepted, it would probably cause a great deal of inconvenience to the Minister and to those who draft the Government's legislation. However, that is a minor matter and should not affect the issue in any way. The important fact is that the amendment has been designed for the purpose of safeguarding the people against the ruthless misuse of power by the Minister. Therefore, it should be embodied in the clause. I concede that a Minister should have extensive powers in order to enable him to carry out the duties of his office efficiently, and I believe that, subject to reasonable limitations, he should full scope to exercise his personal authority in matters that fall within his jurisdiction. Nevertheless, the delegation of unlimited power to an individual with dangers. We should do everything possible to safeguard the interests of the people against the abuse of such powers. I earnestly appeal to the to re-examine this issue. ""When all is said and done, it is not unreasonable to ask him to consider the Opposition's proposal. He may have studied the carefully before it was inserted in the bill in its present form, but that does not mean that he has thought of every possibility. The submissions of the State honourable member for Eden-Monaro, which were made in a temperate and conway, have merits that warrant the the acceptance of the amendment by the Government. They should appeal parto the Minister because he, of up all people, should realise the importance in a democracy of protecting the people against the abuse of power by a Minister. is Having said so much, there is little more and that I need to say in support of the",39
131,Mr GULLETT,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"Hear , hear!",39
132,Mr DALY,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"Apparentl y Government supporters are prepared to jeer at the Opposition and blindly follow the lead of the Minister. I should like to hear some considered opinions on the amendment from honourable gentlemen on the it Government side of the chamber, who knew nothing about the terms of the bill until it was presented to the Parliament by the Minister. The bill leaves much to be desired from the point of view of the Opposition, and of the people generally, and constructive and reasonable proposals, such as the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, deserve to be considered carefully. The clause is dangerous in its present form and it should be amended. For that reason, I support the proposal of the honourable member for Eden Monaro.",39
133,Dr DONALD CAMERON,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"Oxley) [4.18] - It is obvious from the nature of the remarks made by the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Daly) that he has no conception of the purpose of the clause. When the Minister for Health (Sir Earle Page) explained the clause to the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Allan Eraser), who moved the amendment, I understood the honourable member to nod his head to indicate his agreement with the Minister. Apparently the honourable gentleman accepted the Minister's explanation. The clause provides for the delegation of powers and functions in connection with the approval of doctors, the approval of hospitals, supervision of the operation of the health scheme, and so forth. These are largely matters of concern to the States. The Minister has explained that the clause has been discussed with the State governments and that they are in agreement with its provisions. We can have every confidence in the Minister's assurance. It is no argument to talk, as the honourable member for Grayndler talked, of the Minister being a standover merchant. Such expressions are mere propaganda, not argument. The question at issue is whether or not the terms of the clause, in relation to the delegation powers, give effect to the wishes of both the Commonwealth and the States. T'he Minister has assured the committee that he has discussed this matter with the States, and that both the Commonwealth and the States desire the clause to be retained in its present form so that they both may exercise their respective functions. It did little credit to the honourable member for Grayndler for him to say, in the face of the Minister's positive declaration, that he did not believe 1 that the States have heard of it. There can be no real discussion of th-3 clause on that basis. The wording of the relevant clause of the first bill was altered in order to meet the wishes of those who will have to administer the scheme. As I' have already pointed out, the honourable member for Eden-Monaro appeared to indicate that he accepted the Minister's explanation. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to.

As this provision is different from the relevant provision in the first bill, it is obvious that the Minister for Heaitn (Sir Earle Page) has received further instructions from his real masters, the Eederal Council of the British Medical Association, since that measure was introduced in March last.",40
135,Mr GULLETT,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"I rise to order. As only a limited number of copies of the proposed amendments has been circulated, it is impracticable for all honourable members to study the effect of the amendments.",40
136,The CHAIRMAN,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,Mr Adermann) of Order! The honourable member for Reid (Mr Morgan) should make clear the effect of the amendment.,40
137,Mr MORGAN,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"The clause, as drafted, provides that the GovernoTGeneral may arrange for the provision of diagnostic and therapeutic services only for medical practitioners and hospitals. Why should not these services be made available also to clinics? I contend that the services of radiologists, physicists and other specialists should he made available to clinics. It is obvious that the Minister received instructions from the Federal Council of the British Medical Association in connection with the preparation of his second bill. It was announced in the press soon after the Government was returned to office that a national health scheme would not be introduced into the Parliament until after a British medical congress had been held in Brisbane. Since then the Minister has engaged in a number of discussions on this subject with the Federal Council of the British Medical Association. The Medical Journal of Australia reported in its issue of the 10th September, 1952, as follows:VISI T BY TIIE MIMSTER POR HEALTH. The Minister for Health, Sir Earle Page, visited the Federal Council on Friday, August 22, 1952, and discussed with them during the - greater part of the day matters relating to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Act and the Pensioner Medical Service. A free interchange of views took place, and then the Minister left the .meeting. The following paragraph also appeared in that issue of the Medical Journal of Australia:GENERAL MEDICAL SERVICES. Tiie Federal Council had before it a statement issued by the Commonwealth Department nf Health in reference to the proposed sclieme for the provision of medical benefits under a national health service, and also a copy of the proposed subsidies for minimum and optional services. This gave rise to a good deal of - discussion . . . the Federal Council .adopted a resolution, based on the lines of the Victorian Branch letter, that the profession in Australia should refuse its co-operation in a scheme of Government-subsidized medical benefits undor the National Health Service Act, HMS. It urged the repeal of that legislation - and its substitution by an Act acceptable to the profession. After the Federal Council had heard the views of the Minister, and bad received his assurance that a National Health Act would be brought down by the Government early in 1953, it offered its continued CO; - operation in the preparation of the medical benefits scheme. lit is significant that the clause provides that diagnostic and therapeutic may be provided exclusively, for medical practitioners and hospitals.

I consider that sufferers from tuberculosis diseases should be able to seek radiological - and X-ray services in a relaxed ilfr. Morgan. sphere. There is no reason why diagnostic and therapeutic services should be provided exclusively for the benefit of medical practitioners and hospitals. This aspect of the matter should be elucidated by the Minister. I am reminded of an experiment that was conducted at the Massachusetts General . Hospital in America. An autopsy that was conducted on 3,000 persons who died in that institution revealed that medical diagnosis had been eorrect in only 52 per cent, of the eases. The trend in modern medicine is set out in the following article that appeared in the Medical Journal of Australia in its issue of the 20th September, 1952 :.MEDICINE ASD HUMANITY. By Morris C.

In the health centres established under the British national health scheme, which the former British Minister for Health described, as the key to that scheme, provision is made for trained social workers to be attached to the centres to consider various factors that affect a patient's condition. An illness may be due to social environment or industrial conditions, which are very important in this industrial era, when many men work with chemicals and gases that may affect their health. Social environment, industrial conditions, and domestic and financial problems must be considered. Those matters are outside the ordinary province of a medical practitioner and call for the services of trained social workers, psychologists and the like. workers, psychologists, physiotherapists, dentists and dieticians should be in attendance at health centres. It is recognized now that diet has a great bearing upon health, and that it is important in the pre-natal and ante-natal care of mothers and children, but it is a subject to which medical students do not devote much study.",40

We desire to prevent that from being done, and this clause, will do something to prevent it.. We do not want diagnostic and therapeutic services that are nothing more than regimented sick parades. Services of that type would completely destroy the doctor-patient relationship that exists today. The words "" for medical practitioners and hospitals"" have been written into the eiause with the. object of preventing the nationalization of medicine. Under the clause in its present form, public health and tropical medicine services could be established, as well as centres for X-ray examinations and radium treatment. I shall be Social surprised and disappointed if the Minister for Health accepts the amendment moved by the lionorable member for Eeid. The clause is a good one. which, as I have said, will help to prevent the nationalization of medical services.

145,Mr HAWORTH,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,I think he does.,42
146,Dr DONALD CAMERON,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"I shall do my best to explain it t'o the honourable or member for Reid. The clause will permit diagnostic and therapeutic services to be for instance, in a district in which there is a large country town. A diagnostic laboratory or a pathological laboratory could be established-it might be a branch of the Commonwealth Serum Laboratory, for instance-and medical practitioners and hospitals could make use of it in the interests of patients. If the words "" for medical practitioners and hospitals"" were omitted, medical practitioners and hospitals would be denied the facilities of such laboratories. The words will not limit the use of the services exclusively to medical practitioners and hospitals. They have been inserted in order that medical practitioners and hospitals will be able to use the services in the diagnosis and treatment of disease. The words do not preclude the Minister for Health (Sir Earle Page) from establishing diagnostic centres for other purposes, but they make it plain that, when services of this nature are required, the Minister has power to establish them and to make them available for use by medical practitioners, in the interests of people generally. If the words were omitted, the Minister would not have such, power. Therefore, it is obvious that they must remain in the clause. The honourable member for Reid talked about what he called psychologists and the like, the investigation of tuberculosis and so on. The words "" for medical practitioners and hospitals "" have been inserted in the clause so that the psychologists and X-ray specialists will he available in the treatment of disease.",42
147,Sir EARLE PAGE,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"Cowper-Minister for Health) [ 4 . 3 9 ] - 0n D e n a l f of t n e Government, I resist the amendment. I cannot understand why the Opposition has suggested that the words be omitted. During the eight years that the Labour party was in power before this Government came into office, institutions of this kind worked in conjunction with medical practitioners and hospitals. The present Government parties established many diagnostic and therapeutic centres before World War II . If I am not misinformed, the Labour party established one at Wollongong during the period it was in office, and possibly another elsewhere.' In every case, I tliink, the centre has been established in association with hospitals. The centre at Launceston is associated with a hospital, are those at Lismore and Tamworth. It is impossible to make the centres function satisfactorily and comparatively inexpensively if we do not utilize the facilities that are available in hospitals. Having seen a great deal of country practice I can say that such services are of extraordinary value. We have one in Canberra at present. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Clauses 10 to 14-by leave-considere d together.",43
148,Mr ALLAN FRASER,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"Eden-Monaro) [4.41] -'Clause 14, sub-clause (1.), reads as follows:Where a contributor incurs medical expenses in respect of a professional service specified in the First Schedule to this .Act and under the rules of the registered medical benefits organization to the medical benefits fund of which the contributor pays contributions the contributor is entitled to a fund benefit equal to or gi'eater thau the amount specified in that Schedule in relation to that service, Commonwealth benefit of the amount so specified is payable subject to and in accordance with the provisions of this Part. I move That in sub-clause (1.) the word '""-contributor "" be left out with a view to insert in lieu thereof the word "" person "". Later I shall move that the following words be left out:- "" and under the rules of the registered medical benefits organization to the medical benefits fund of which the contributor pays contributions the contributor is entitled to a fund benefit equal or greater than the amount specified in that schedule in relation to that service "". The amendment is most important. Its effect would be to remove the necessity for a person to belong to a private fund or a friendly society. It woulcl ensure that every person who otherwise would be entitled to a Commonwealth benefit would receive that benefit by right, as a citizen and as a taxpayer, without any obligation to belong to a private society. If this amendment is carried, as I hope that it will be, it will be necessary to make many consequential alterations to the bill. Eor example it will be necessary to make an alteration also in clause 15. Clause 14 refers to the Eirst Schedule to the bill and clause 15 refers to the Second Schedule. The objection to this clause is that it unduly restricts the number of Australian citizens who are entitled to medical benefits. Under this clause, instead of being a national scheme embracing the whole of the people of Australia, the Government's scheme becomes a partial scheme embracing only those who belong to particular societies. That, the Opposition contends, is entirely wrong. The adoption of the amendment that I have moved would enable all those who suffer from a chronic illness and elderly people to obtain the Commonwealth benefit in respect of medical attention. As has already been mentioned, many of the private funds to which people are now required to contribute as a condition of .obtaining the Commonwealth benefit have a very high level of expense. I have already cited, the case of the Medical Benefits Fund of Australia which collected £401,000 in contributionsduring the year ended the 30th June, 1953, and paid, only £166,000 in benefits in the same period. At that time. I pointed out that the general expenses of that fund totalled £53,000 during that year, but in doing so I omitted to state that, in addition to that amount, the sum of £40,000 was shown as expenses in the appropriation account of the fund. Whilst that fund paid out £166,000 in benefits during the financial year, it also paid about £100,000 in management expenses in the same period. Nobody should be required to belong to such a society as that as a condition of obtaining a benefit for which he has already paid in the form of taxation at the appropriate rate. The purpose of the amendment is to remove that restriction and give to all the people of Australia, by right, the medical benefits that the Commonwealth provides.",43
149,Mr CURTIN,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"Watson) [4.45] - I support the amendment that has been moved by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Allan Fraser). think that the scheme that is outlined 'by the bill is a. preposterous proposition to put forward in a democratic community. Sub-clause (1.) of clause 14, of the bill reads as follows:Where a contributor incurs medical expenses in respect of a professional service specified in the first schedule of this Act under the rules of the registered medical fits organization to the medical benefits fund of which the contributor pays contributions the contributor is entitled to' a fund benefit equal to or greater than the amount specified in that schedule in relation to that service, Commonwealth benefits of the amount so specified is payable su'bject to and in accordance with the provisions of this Part. In this clause, the mau who has paid £45 a year into the National Welfare Fund is denied the right to receive a benefit in respect of medical services that he may require. This clause is a denial of democratic justice and the Minister for Health (Sir Earle Page) should have no hesitation in accepting the proposed amendment. The clause - constitutes a denial of the rights of people suffering from chronic illnesses such as asthma, blood pressures, hernia and arthritis. For many years the trade union movement spent much time and had much trouble in establishing that men suffered from certain diseases due to their employment in certain industries. Now, the Government proposes to deny people their just dues in connection with medical benefits. I appeal to the Minister for Health to accept the amendment because when the people of Australia feel the impact of clauses such as this they will wonder why the Government has inserted them in the bill. Have they been inserted at the behest of the governing body of the medical profession, the British Medical Association, or have they been inserted as a result of an oversight on the part of the Minister? I speak for my constituents in supporting the amendment. I do not know how the Government can justify its action in denying the people the right to benefit from the National Welfare Fund into which they have paid £160,000,000. I doubt whether this clause is constitutional. If it were challenged in the courts I do not think that it would hold water. I believe that in such a. case the I courts would have no compunction in preventing the Government from carrying out its intention. I support the amendment, and I hope that the Minister for Health will give full consideration to the submissions of the Opposition, and will not deny the people of Australia the beneand fits that will accrue to them if the amendbenement is accepted. The people who contribute towards our social services as well as tbose wbo suffer from cbronic diseases sbould be the first consideration of the Government, and the Opposition's amendment sbould be accepted.",44
150,Sir EARLE PAGE,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"Cowper-Minister for Health) [4.51] - The Opposition's amendment is aimed at the destruction of the whole purpose of the bill, and at the insurance system that has been working well for some years. Therefore, it should be closely examined, and the reasons why we shall not accept it should be fuUy stated. It has been said that, under the Government system, the expenditure of the friendly societies will be very heavy. The position is, and the honourable mem-' ber for Port Adelaide (Mr Thompson) can support me in this, that only 8 per cent, or 10 per .cent, of the revenue of friendly societies will be Used in their part of the administration of the scheme. Indeed, organizations w i ll not be approved by the Government unless they show that they can keep their expenses below at least 15 per cent. The American authorities have faced the same problems as we are now facing, and they have discovered that many big American organizations that arc participating in the health scheme have reduced their expenses to 4 per cent, or 5 per cent., and that the average is S per cent. That system is a very satisfactory alternative to the creation of a l uge bureaucratic organization, the cost of which might we'll run into millions of po :nds. Lord Beveridge has stated that the cardinal error made by the United Kingdom in its health scheme was the rejection of two proposals that friendly societies should be used to - administer the scheme. Lord Beveridge, in a book written in 1948, statedIn rejecting two important proposals in tlic Eeport, for the use of friendly societies to administer State benefits .for sickness and allied purposes to tlieir members . . . the Act commits the State to setting up a centralized bureaucratic machine. Whether any such machine can grapple with the fundamental problem of sickness benefit, of reconciling finance with sympathy and intimate local handling is uncertain. The Government of 1911 sought the maximum of co-operation between the State and voluntary agencies in the field of social insurance. The Government of 194G has divorced the two completely. The greatest danger of the present situation is not on the side of the friendly societies. They will survive; if they do not do so, their place would be taken by now forms ofvolun tary organization. The real danger-it is great as well as real-is on the other' side of the divorce. Will the State be able to create a machine capable of doing what the 'affiliated orders did in the most difficult of all forms of social insurance, of combining soundness with sympathy in administration of cash benefits to the sick? Will the State be able to avoid the evil alternatives of extravagance and of harshness? The present rulers of the State have lightheartedly taken on a tsisk without as yet having shown understanding of its nature. Now let us cousider what the position of the patients would have been if Labour's scheme had been adopted. The last Labour Government introduced a scheme which provided that where a person consulted a doctor and the consultation fee was 10s. 6d., the Government would pay 5s. 3d. and the patient would be required"" to pay '5s. 3d. Under this Government's scheme the Government, together with the insurance organization, will pay 12s. or 13?. 6d. of a. consultation fee of 15s., leaving the patient to pay only ls . 6d. If a person has a major operation that costs £25 under this scheme the Government and the insurance organization will pay £2,2 10s. and ithe patient £2 10s. Under Labour's scheme the patient was required to pay £12 10s., while the Labour Government proposed to pay - only £12 10s.  Government's scheme the .patient would also have received his friendly society's benefit.",45
151,Sir EARLE PAGE,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"Apparentl y the honourable member for Lalor (Mr . Pollard) now wants two schemes. He wants a huge bureaucratic organization, and a scheme embracing the friendly societies as well. In other words, he wants o i l and water to mix. I suggest that that is merely stupid nonsense which will not affect the greatest supporters of this scheme, which are the friendly societies themselves. They support the sound scheme 'because they know that it will allow them to continue with , . and even greatly to expand their beneficent work. In New Zealand a person gets 7s. 0d. in respect of a consultation with a doctor, and a fiat-rate payment at the rate of 7s. 6d. a visit towards a midwifery fee. The rest he pays himself. Despite what was said some time ago by the honovable member for Ballarat (Mr Joshua), 88 per cent, of the patients who enter Royal Prince Alfred Hospital ure insured for hospital and medical benefits. The whole system proposed by the Labour Government was characterized by meanness. For instance, the last Labour Government proposed to pay only LOd. a mile for attendance to sick persons, but this Government is paying 4s. a mile. What was the position of patients generally under Labour's scheme? How many doctors implemented the Labour Government's scheme under which the word "" person"" was substituted for the word ""contributor""? Not one!",45

153,Mr ALLAN FRASER,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"Eden-Monaro) .. 48 [5.6] - I moveT h at , at the end of clause 2(5, the following 5 new sub-clause be in s e r t e d : "" (.2.) A medica l p r a c t it i o n e r who has rendered a professional service for a person AYES. s h all , on request by that person, s up p l y to him a statemen t in w r it in g g i v in g p a r t i c u l a r s of the professional service and of the charge made there for."". Clause 26 deals with claims by registered organizations. The purpose of the clause which I suggest should be added is to ensure that doctors shall, on request by patients, be required to supply to their patients a statement of the services which they have rendered, so that the patients, in turn, may supply such particulars to the organizations of which they are members in order to obtain benefits. I can scarcely imagine that the Minister for Health (Sir Earle Page) will decline to accept this proposal, because the legislation which he has introduced will not be workable without it. Clause 26 requires the production of vouchers before a contributor is entitled to claim and receive benefits. The vouchers which he must produce necessarily and obviously include accounts and the receipts from doctors, but the bill before the committee does not impose any obligation upon a doctor to supply such documents. That is, therefore, an obvious omission from the legislation. The clause which I have proposed will remedy that position. Its inclusion will not harm the legislation. Instead, it will tend to make the scheme introduced by the Minister more workable. I have no doubt that the right honourable gentleman wil] agree that if a doctor renders a service to a patient, receives payment from the patient and refuses to supply a statement of the service rendered or a receipt for the money paid, the patient will be thereby, deprived of the right and opportunity to obtain the benent for which he paid his contribution to an approved society. In addition, he will be prevented from receiving the Commonwealth benefit which the Minister intends him to receive. Throughout this bill it is notable that the Minister has been most tender of the susceptibilities of members of the medical profession. Nowhere in the bill, as far as I am able to see, has he placed the slightest obligation on members of that profession. At the moment, I am not quarrelling with his failure to impose obligations on them in relation to other provisions of the measure, but surely this is an obvious obligation which he .must impose upon them if his own scheme is to be made workable. The position is, first, that the doctor may refuse or omit to provide any receipt or statement to the patient. The patient then would be debarred from obtaining the refund that is provided by this bill and he would be completely debarred from obtaining from the friendly society the benefit for which he had paid a contribution to that society. Secondly, the doctor may provide a statement in such a general form that it would be unacceptable to the society and unacceptable to the Commonwealth Department of Health as evidence of the serviee that had been rendered. That is happening throughout the Commonwealth. Patients are experiencing very great difficulty and delay in obtaining from the Commonwealth and from the societies the benefits for which they have subscribed. I do not think that it is a Mr Allan Fraser. common occurrence for a doctor to refuse to provide a statement of account or a receipt.",46
154,Mr HULME,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,How does he receive payment if he does not provide it?,47
155,Mr ALLAN FRASER,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,In some cases he is paid without providing a statement or receipt because he simply takes the cash and puts it in his pocket.,47
156,Mr HULME,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,That is the patient's fault.,47
157,Mr ALLAN FRASER,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"I do not say that it happens frequently. I should think that the occasions on which a doctor would refuse to provide a statement of account or a written receipt would be infrequent, but I think the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Hulme) would agree that doctors frequently fail to provide statements in the form that is acceptable to the society and to the Com mon weal th.",47
158,Mr HULME,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,He should not be paid until he does.,47
159,Mr ALLAN FRASER,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"The honourable member says that the doctor should uot be paid until he does. That is not the position. The position is that the patient must pay the doctor before he can obtain a receipt, before he can submit that receipt to the society, before the society can examine the receipt and before it can pay the benefit to him.",47
160,Mr HULME,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,Then the doctor is out of pocket.,47
161,Mr ALLAN FRASER,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"The patient may ask for a receipt for a payment, but in many cases the receipt that is issued by the doctor is not in a form that is acceptable to the society. But the patient does not know that. The patient takes away the receipt in good faith and he presents it to the society for payment. When the society receives the doctor^ statement or receipt and examines it. it finds that the receipt is not. in a form which gives the society the information that is necessary. Furthermore, the society discovers that the statement or the receipt is not in a form that would be acceptable to the Commonwealth Department of Health before the department paid the health benefit. The manager of any society could inform honourable members that he is frequently faced with the difficulty that is associated with vague and inadequate statements of detail that are supplied hy doctors to patients.",47
162,Mr CRAMER,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"How would the patient know, in any case?",48
163,Mr ALLAN FRASER,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr 'Cramer) asked how the patient would know in any case. He may not know, but the doctor knows. There should be a legal obligation on the doctor to provide the information in a form acceptable to the society and the Department of Health. He is the only person capable of supplying it.",48
164,Mr ROBERTON,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,Why does he not supply it?,48
165,Mr ALLAN FRASER,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"I do not know why he does not. He may not do for any one of a number of reasons. may be because of carelessness or dilatorisociety ness or disinterest. The fact remains in a large number of cases the inadequate and vague statements of account which tire issued by doctors cause delay payment of benefits by both the Commonsociety wealth and the friendly societies. I that the Minister for Health the amendment. If opportunity offers under this less application of the "" guillotine Opposition proposes to move further amendments. One of the proposed amendments provides for the insertion the words ""set forth in the Third Schedule"" after the word "" arrangeto ment"" in clause 31 (2.) (a). The unless purpose of the proposed amendment is to ensure that the arrangements are made with the federal council of British Medical Association under clause 31 (2.) (a) shall be published as a schedule to the bill so that honourable memquestion bers will know the arrangements that they approve. There is no need to stress that fact.",48
166,The CHAIRMAN,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"Order! The schedule, honourable member's time has expired.",48
167,Mr THOMPSON,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"Port Adelaide) operation | 5.1fi] - Propose d new clause 26A seeks to impose upon doctors the obligathp tion to do something which the Minister for Health (Sir Earle Page) expects them to do. If honourable members were .to see the accounts thut. HTP. issued doctors, they would understand the need for such a clause. I have mentioned on other occasions that I have a lot to do with friendly society work. Eor several years a friendly society would refund to its members 10s. for each visit that they made to a doctor. That was the position in my own lodge. A member would bring in his account and he would say, "" I have paid the doctor this account"". The account that was rendered by the doctor might show an amount of £10 or £12 for services that were rendered from, say, the 1st June to the 20th August, but it might not show how many visits the doctor had made. The fact remained that the member was entitled to receive from his society 10s. for each visit. We would send that person back to the doctor so in order to obtain the necessary informaI t tion. If a person who is insured with a goes to a doctor and the doctor that gives him an account which shows that from the lst June to the 20th August there were ten visits, the society is satisin the fied. Under the present system, the would then pay to the patient ten hope times 6s. plus the same amount for the will accept government subsidy. Another difficulty arises in relation to ruthan account which covers the performance "", the of an operation. Under the First Schedule to the bill, a patient is entitled to a payment of, say, £6 each from the of Government and from the society. Under the Second Schedule, he is entitled only the amount paid by the Government the society has made provision in its rules for payment under the Second that Schedule. If a doctor shows on his the account, "" Operation for the removal of a breast"" and that is all that he shows, and if the patient pays the account, the is raised as to whether the doctor refers to the simple operation under the First Schedule or to the major operation under the Second Schedule. If the doctor were obliged to indicate the number in the the society would be able to see whether it was, say, operation No. 54 or No. 532. At present, the doctor is not compelled to do that. I agree that majority of doctors submit their accounts properly, but other doctors do not include that information. The grand secretary of one society informed me that by he communicated with one doctor in order to ascertain which operation was performed so that the society would know the amount that had to be refunded to the patient. The doctor replied that it was nothing to do with the lodge officer but rested between himself and the patient. The patient had to be asked to obtain the information from the doctor so that the friendly society could recognize the account and pay the amount that was due. The Government does not pay anything until after the approved society has paid the amount for which it is responsible. The society has to apply tb the Government for its share of the amount and unless the form shows the relevant details, the society cannot get the money. The fault does not lie with the patient. Often he cannot get the information unless he is prepared to argue with the doctor or the person who makes out the doctor's account. The purpose of the amendment is to require the doctor to set out information when the patient asks for it so that the treatment can be identified and the society can pay the patient and apply to the Government for the amount. The Opposition is not trying to put anything over the doctors in. advancing this amendment. The facts that I have placed before the committee are not hearsay. I have seen, numerous accounts showing only that the bill is for services rendered. Sometimes it shows that the service has extended from one date to another but many accounts do not state the number df visits paid by the doctor to the patient. The honourable member for Batman (Mr Bird) stated in this chamber last week that sometimes there was a delay of seven or eight weeks in the payment of amounts clue. Those delays occur for the reasons that I have stated. Approved societies are unable to determine from the accounts the amount that they must pay. If they pay too much, they cannot get it back and they withhold payment until they get the requisite information from the patient or the doctor. The doctor does not want to make out an account twice. If a person is not entitled to a refund, it does, not matter. He simply pays the bill and that is the end of it. But if the patient is entitled to a refund, he must have evidence on his ilr. Thompson. account to show the treatment for which he paid the. doctor.. The amendment does not interfere with the proposals that are contained in. the bill. It is merely intended to simplify payment and obviate delays.",48
168,Dr DONALD CAMEEON,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"Oxley) [5.23] - The matter that has been raised by the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Thompson) presents a real problem. The honourable member has drawn attention to an aspect of the matter to which the Minister for Health (Sir Earle Page) might well be asked to give consideration. It is not a simple matter to include this proposal in the desired form. Eirst, I propose to refeT to the submission of accounts. In any case, the doctor has to submit an account if the patient is to get any benefit under the provisions of the bill. The amendment that has been moved by the honourable member for Eden Monaro (Mr Allan Eraser) dealing with that matter does not appear to me to have much force because the process has to be initiated by the doctor's account. I cannot see any point in putting anything about the account into this bill. Unless the doctor renders the account, no action under this measure can ensue. There is a problem, however, in the. question of certification becanse obviously an approved society must know for what, it has to pay. The British Medical Association has been most insistent upon this point and has done its best to impress upon doctors that they must: give an approved organization the infoi-mation that it requires on the form that it supplies.' At present that is done more or iess by agreement. Obviously it must be' done. But the doctor is in a dilemma when he tries to determine how much he should disclose. A great many patients object to having a full' diagnosis of their ailment and details of the treatment displayed upon a certificate. It is not sufficient to state in the amendment that, the information must be supplied on request by the person concerned, because sometimes a patient asks for a diagnosis or a certificate about an illness when the doctor does not feel justified in giving it. The doctor may adopt that attitude because he thinks the patient is not sufficiently responsible, or the patient's family may object. There may he other reasons. The patient may bc a minor and the family may ask for a certificate. Later, when the patient is no longer a minor, he may object to the information having been given. So the question of certification is not easy. Afr. THOMPSON - An indication must IK> given of the type of the operation.",49
169,Dr DONALD CAMERON,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"Exactly . There is much force in the statements that have been made by the honourable member for Port Adelaide as to quoting the number in the schedule. If the Minister will examine that aspect to determine whether the difficulty of supplying the information could be overcome, T rlo aot believe that the medical profession vvould consider that it was heing asked to do something improper. The approved societies must have the information so that they can make payments without undue delay. Accordingly I a3k the Minister whether he will give some consideration to certification under eiause L'fi of the bill. T suggest that action might be taken along the lines that have been suggested by the honourable member for Port Adelaide and that a number in. the schedule might be quoted rather than, the technical details of the operation, the diagnosis or the treatment. The difficulty in connection with the number of visits could be overcome easily, but the particulars in the schedules are a more difncult matter.",50
170,Mr EJ HARRINSON,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"Blaxland) | ->.27'\ - In stating that the matter discussion presents a problem, the honourable member for Oxley (Dr Donald - Cameron) has made an admission that is of some value. However, I suggest that the matter of the number of visit3 by n doctor is equally as important as the designation of the number in the schedules. The number of visits can be obtained from one source or another.",50
171,Mr CRAMER,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,How would the patient know? . Sir EARLE PAGE - That information must hc obtained from the doctor. It oh tained from the doctor now. No doctor i* paid unless he includes that informaresponsible tion.,50
172,Mr EJ HARRINSON,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,Unles s the doctors have changed their practice in the past twelve months,50
173,Sir EARLE PAGE,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,They have done so since the lst July last.,50
174,Mr EJ HARRINSON,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"There is still great difficulty in getting information with regard to the number of visits that a doctor pays to his patients. That is particularly the case when patients are in private wards and the doctors visit them periodically during their hospital visits. Unless there is a clear stipulation that the visits must be listed, the patients will virtually have to keep an account of the number of visits that they receive from the doctors. There is agreement between the Opposition and the Minister for Health (Sir Earle Page) upon some aspects of this measure, and one of them is that the system should not be allowed to run wild. I believe that the doctors should stipulate clearlythe number of visits that they pay to. patients. If that is left to the patients,, extra visits might be added to the list for the purpose of collecting 6s. or 12s. for each of them.",50
175,Sir EARLE PAGE,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"If 30, the patient would have to pay an additional amount.",50
176,Mr EJ HARRINSON,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"Not if, in fact, the visits were made by a doctor to a private ward in which the patient was accommodated. That aspect of the scheme must be taken care of. ""We suggest that it will be taken care of if the proposed new clause be accepted. When the honourable member for Benneunder long (Mr Cramer) asked by interjection how a patient would know the number of visits made to him by a member of the medical profession he stressed the need for this amendment. Let us reach agreement on the suggestion that the number of visits and the schedule number under which the benefit is listed must be included on statements of professional service rendered by - doctors. Unless that is done the patient's word may have to be accepted in substantiation of the claim. The honourable member for Bennelong has made it clear that, in his view, the amendis ment is necessary. We cannot afford to allow the patient to be the sole authority for furnishing information upon which a claim i? based. Tf the amendment be accepted, an obligation vcill be placed upon the members of the medical profession to ensure that patients sball receive only those benefits to which they are entitled under the schedules to the bill. AD obligation should be imposed on them to supply to their patients statements in writing giving particulars of professional services rendered and the charges made there for. In most instances no dispute will arise on that point, but the legislation should be made specific. The Minister has stressed the need for maintaining a proper balance in the relations between the patient and his doctor. The more clearly these matters are defined in the bill, the more scope there will be for the maintenance of that proper balance in the relations between the doctor and his patient that the Minister so desires. A doctor must provide information required by a registered organization before it authorizes payment of a claim. ""We cannot leave it to the patient to advise the organization of the number of visits by the doctor. If that were done the scheme would be subject to all sorts of abuses. There must be a proper check between the patient and the doctor in relation to the amount paid by the organization from its own funds and those paid by it on behalf of the Government. Unless that is done the revenue cannot be properly protected.",50
177,Mr CEAMEE,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"Bennelong) [5.35] I am afraid that, in order to overcome some of the difficulties which have been referred to during this debate, we might be inclined to enmesh members of the medical profession in a lot of unnecessary red-tape. We must do everything possible to avoid that. Claims made upon a registered organization are vetted by the organization before the payment is made to the patient from its own funds and on behalf of the Government. Virtually a double check is imposed by the organization, first when it pays money from its own funds and on behalf of the Government and, later, when it renders monthly accounts to the Director-General and furnishes full information covering the payments made. That check is outside the provisions of this bill. My principal concern is that we should not so enmesh the scheme in red-tape that it will become obnoxious to those who are concerned in its functioning. Doctors, who are so busy these days, believe that their time should not be wasted by unnecessary provisions. Their responsibilities should be stated in the simplest possible form consistent with safety, with the realization that a double check will be imposed on all payments made by registered organizations. I do not know how the Minister views the amendment. While I oppose it, he may share the view expressed by the honourable member for Oxley (Dr Donald Cameron) that there is some virtue in it. I believe that the bill, as drafted, provides sufficient protection to the revenue, having regard to the double check imposed by registered organizations to which 1I have referred. The scheme is based on co-operation. The registered organizations play an important part in it, in respect of not only benefits provided from their own funds, but also the government benefits. Legislation of this kind is always subject to regulations and conditions which are not necessarily stated in the legislation itself. I urge the Minister to be careful not to hinder the medical fraternity by making the scheme so cumbersome as to detract from the services rendered to the community by the members of the medical profession.",51
178,Mr BLED,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"Batman) [5.39] - I appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment. I differ very strongly from the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Cramer), who has contended that if the amendment is accepted the members of the medical profession will be enmeshed in red tape. The majority of the members of the medical profession already furnish statements of the kind which the amendment, proposes shall be furnished by them. A minority of doctors in Melbourne have so far not given effect to the wishes of the majority of the members of the British Medical Association and do not furnish statements that are satisfactory to the registered organizations. A. controversy has been raging in the Melbourne metropolitan press in regard to the length of time taken by the Hospital Benefits Association of Victoria to pay claims lodged with it.' When the controversy was at its height the newspapers asked the organization to explain the reason for the long delay in making payments. The Melbourne Herald, a newspaper of repute and probity in matters of this kind, conline ducted an inquiry into the matter. I shall quote from an article which published in that journal recently because f. regard it as apposite to this matter. The article statedHosriTAi, BENEFITS. Payments Lag. Victorian doctors will have to forget of their old professional aloofness and ness aibout their patients' illnesses if the Federal Government's medical scheme is work efficiently and quickly. Assessors haudling medical benefit claims say that the biggest single thing holding speedy payments is lack of information needed to enable them to pass the applications. The Hospital Benefits Association of Victoria has been under fire as a result matters considerably. of numerous complaints that members are obliged to wait for unduly long periods for payment of benefit after they submit their claims. Widespread dissatisfaction and even indignation has been caused by these delays. One listener who heard my remarks on this point during the course of my speech on the second reading last week has since informed me that he has been waiting for a period of nine weeks and has not yet received payment of benefit from that association. The association, in reply to criticism levelled against it, issued a statement in it said It would help greatly in speeding haudling of claims if doctors would include with their accounts to patients a concise description of the treatment given. There are 004 different items in the schedule medical claims, and we cannot pay out governmoment ment money without exact knowledge of what treatment has been involved. The accounts' should also show the date of consultation and the number of visits. doctors are already doing this. The association claims that the delays are due to the fact that a small minority of doctors do not supply adequate details on the accounts that they render to their patients. Such delays cause inefficiency, and, consequently, the scheme is suspect in the view of many persons who have joined an approved society and have only failed to obtain settlement of their claims, but also have hot received any advice from the society about them. object of the amendment is simply to difficult oblige the small minority of doctors who consideration. are at fault in this respect to fall into with the vast majority of the doctors who show the required particulars on was the accounts that they render to their patients. Recently, I received from my doctor an account which showed only the total amount of my indebtedness. I telephoned his receptionist and asked that the number of the visits, with the appropriate dates, be shown on the account so some that I could satisfy the requirements of vaguethe society of which I am a member for to the purpose of payment of benefit. The doctor complied with that request. However, the particulars were not supplied up until I requested that they be shown on my account. A difficulty of that kind can be overcome by the use of a standard form. Such a procedure would simplify Probably, the British Medical Association could devise a form for that purpose. It would be a common-sense procedure and would not encourage red tape.",51
179,Mr TOWNLEY,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"Denison-Minister for Social Services) [5.45] - Member s of the Opposition have overlooked the fact that an agreement has been entered into between the approved organizations and the British Medical Association on the point that has been raised in the amendment. I should think that considerable which dissatisfaction would have become apparent long before this if any great need existed for the amendment. I agree up the with the honourable member for Oxley (Dr Donald Cameron) that important principles are involved. I cannot imagine of that many doctors would accept for one a provision that they must show on a patient's card the history and intimate details of the professional service Many that had been rendered. Furthermore, very few patients would like to have such details shown on their accounts. Certainly, many women would object« strongly to such a procedure. If honourable members glance at the items shown in the Second Schedule, for instance items 466 and 467, they will readily appreciate the point that I am making. I agree not with the honourable member for Oxley, who, like the Minister for Health (Sir Earle Page), is a member of the medical The profession, that the amendment raises matters and requires most careful Perhaps, as he has suggested, a compromise could be worked out whereby an approved society could be adequately informed of the professional service rendered to a patient and, at the same time, the doctor-patient relationship could be wholly preserved. As the honourable member for Batman (Mr. Bird) has said, very few doctors have failed so far to supply satisfactory statements of accounts. The British Medical Association, which represents - the great majority of doctors in this country, has .advised its members that they must supply satisfactory statements to approved - societies. We must remember that the scheme has been in operation for only a few months. Difficulties are bound to *rise, but I am confident that they will be ironed out in due course. So far. a considerable measure of agreement has been achieved between the doctors and the approved societies, and I believe that those doctors who are not supplying statements of accounts in a satisfactory form will come into line with their colleagues.",52
180,Mr GEEENTJP,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"Dalley) [5.47] - I fail to comprehend why the Minister for Health (Sir Earle Page) will not accept the amendment. Apparently, some Government supporters are in favour of it. Its object is not only to protect the patient but also the doctor himself by enabling approved organizations to adhere to the letter of the law. I do not agree that acceptance of the amendment would encourage red tape or place an undue amountof work upon the doctors. Doctors are able to obtain clerical assistance. Indeed, they are more favourably placed financially under this scheme and thus are better able to obtain such assistance than they have been hitherto. The amendment seeks to insert in the measure the following ° provision:A medical practitioner who has rendered a professional service for a. person request by that person supply to him a statement ' in writing giving particulars of the professional service and of the charges made there for.. What is wrong with such a provision? I , personally, know of a number of instances in Sydney, involving friendly societies particularly, in which undue delay has occurred, in dealing with claims for benefit. The Government requires persons to join approved societies in order to qualify for benefit. Consequently, when a person incurs expense in obtaining medical treatment payment of benefit should not be delayed' merely because his doctor has not had time, or simply refuses, to furnish to the society a statement giving the requisite details. Undoubtedly, many medical practitioners are most obliging, but a few do not go out of their way to render a simple service to their patients. I suspect something clandestine about the whole bill. Perhaps the Minister has to run to the British Medical Association to get his instructions. It is time that this Government acted as a responsible government acts, and made provision for the correct procedure to be followed, in the interests of the people whom it is supposed to represent here. This bill will affect the lives of many people who are entitled to receive justice. I cannot understand why the Minister quibbles over this simple proposal. The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr. Cramer) made heavy weather of his attempt to justify the Government's attitude, and I thought that he secretly approved of the amendment, but was not "" game "" to support it with word and vote. I appeal to the Minister to be fair-minded in this matter. I hope that he is not acting on the instructions of the British Medical Association. The amendment, if it is adopted, may slightly improve a bad bill. I have been, in turn, a member, a grand,lodge officer, and a grand master of a friendly society in New South Wales, and quite a number of persons have informed me that the whole position is almost impossible for members of approved organizations. A doctor should supply the simple particulars of professional service for which a patient asks in order that he may recover, without delay, shall on a benefit from a friendly society or approved organization. The last thing the Minister should do is quibble over this matter. His hostility to the amendment causes me to believe that he is acting in a clandestine manner in an effort to protect the British Medical Association. Let him treat the people fairly by accepting this simple reform.",53
181,Dr DONALD CAMERON,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"Oxley) [5.541 - I merely wish to say two things about the. amendment. The first is to. remind the Opposition that personal attacks upon the Minister for Health (Sir Earle Page) are no argument, one way or the other. The second is that some constitutional difficulty may complicate the carrying out of this amendment. If such a difficulty exists, the committee may well be made aware of it and proceed, in the knowledge of it, to some other conclusion. But I feel sure that, if there is a constitutional difficulty, the Minister would be quite willing to accept any reasonable arrangement which would put into practice the wishes of every one in this matter. That is to say, when a patient is seen by a doctor, the process whereby he ultimately recovers from his society the fees that he pays to the medical practitioner, shall be expedited. No honourable member wishes the payment hy the friendly society or approved organization to the patient to be delayed. The last person who would wish it to be delayed is the Minister himself. No one on the other side of the chamber need have any apprehension that the Minister is wilfully obstructing sensible arrangements, because such a conception would not be based on reality. In spite of remarks that have been made about the British Medical Association this afternoon, the facts are that the asociation has done everything in its power to ensure that these arrangements shall work smoothly, and that the relevant information shall be supplied by its members to the societies. Indeed, the British Medical Association has circularized its members, requesting them to use every endeavour to give the societies the necessary information, as rapidly as possible. More than that the British Medical Association cannot do. To put the matter on no higher plane than mere self-interest, it is obviously in the interests of all doctors that these arrangements should work smoothly. But quite apart from that, what the committee wants is a sensible working arrangement, and if there is no constitutional barrier to it, I feel sure no honourable member on either side of the chamber will be glued to some form of words. If we can get a reasonable and satisfactory form of words which will ensure the objective that we all desire to attain, no one need have any apprehension, that the Minister or any honourable member on this si.de of the chamber will stand in the way of it.",54
182,Mr MORGAN,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"Beid) [5.55] - The honourable member for Oxley (Dr Donald Cameron) has really "" put it up "" to the Minister for Health (Sir Earle Page), and we shall soon know whether he takes notice of the wishes of this chamber, or bows to instructions or directions from an outside authority.",54
183,Dr DONALD CAMERON,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,Nothin g of the sort. I referred to constitutional difficulties.,54
184,Mr MOBGAN,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"The honourable member is a practising doctor, and he knows that no big difficulties are in the way of the adoption of the amendment. He has referred to the possibility of the existence of constitutional difficulties. What could they possibly be ? This is purely a matter between doctor and patient. It is the patient's privilege. Medical practitioners have frequently claimed in a court of law professional privilege as a reason for a refusal to disclose information about a patient. That claim has not been upheld, and it does not arise again now. A patient should be able to obtain from his doctor the information that is required by an approved organization. The amendment, if it is accepted, will not affect in any way the proper functioning of the scheme. The British Medical Association has always taken a consistent stand on this matter. Under the MCKenna plan, the procedure was simple, and the vital principle of the need for the preservation of secrecy was recognized. Fewer than 9,000 returns were to be made by all the medical practitioners who participated in the scheme. Under the present proposal, millions of returns will be submitted in respect of millions, of patients. Again, under the MCKenna plan, the kind of service performed was to be indicated by a sign or symbol, and the information was to be sent direct to the Department of Health. Particulars about professional services, and. charges would not have been in the hands of outside persons, as will the information on the millions of forms which will be filled' in for patients and will pass through, the hand?, of the staffs of approved organizations. That kind of procedure will make secrecy impossible. So the Government is faced with a dilemma. The whole scheme will be confused, and will not function smoothly. The bill should make it possible for members of approved organizations to receive the benefits that accrue to them as quickly - is possible. Doctors will not have the same difficulty of collecting outstanding fees they have had in the past, and the little extra service that is contemplated in the amendment would not put them to any. inconvenience. Some doctors ulready provide this service. What is good enough for a section of the medical profession should be good enough for the whole of it. I urge the Minister to accept the amendment.",54
185,Unknown,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m.,55
186,Mr MOEG AN,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,Will the Minister say whether he took the opportunity offered by the dinner adjournment to discuss this ferred proposed amendment with representatives of the British Medical Association?,55
187,Sir EAKLE PAGE,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,I shall answer when the honourable member sits down.,55
188,Mr MORGAN,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"I think the Minister might well have done that in view of the suggestion by one medical member the Government side that the amendment is reasonable. Apparently the Minister is not prepared to take the risk that' was taken by another Minister in an anti-Labour Government in New South Wales. WTien a bill was presented to him, he said, "" Who drafted this? "" When he was told that it had been drafted the British Medical Association, he solely said, "" I will not have anything to do with it "" . He was promptly relieved of his position and he retired to the seclusion of the Speaker's chair. I can quite understand the hesitation therefore of the Minister for Health. Apparently the British Medical Association is to be sacrosanct. It has no obligation to conadverse form to any procedure that might conment. tribute to the smooth working of this scheme. Yet it remains all powerful! Secret negotiations have taken place, certain agreements have been arrived at videdbetween the Minister and representatives of the British Medical Association. We are now being asked to give legislative the Supreme sanction to those agreements although we do not know the details of them. Eor instance, clause 31 provides that an arrangement made with the federal council of the British Medical Association shall be deemed to be an agreement entered into by the Minister under this legislation. The position is extraordinary. We are being asked to enact an agreement that has not been tabled. We have been told nothing at all about the contents of the agreement,' nor have we been told anything about the constitution of the organization with which the agreement has been made. I invite the Minister to inform us of the constitution of the British Medical Association. Has it any statutory authority? Most trade unions are constituted under some act of Parliament, but the constitution of the British Medical Association, which is to be given sweeping powers under this legislation, is being kept secret from us. The Minister might enlighten us about the agreement reto in clause 31. I understand that it is mentioned in communications between the Minister and the British that Medical Association. Surely we should know the terms of the agreement before being asked to incorporate authority for it in an act of Parliament. Otherwise we on are being asked to buy a pig in a poke. An extraordinary procedure has been adopted also in relation .to clause 37. There again the Minister is beholden to the British Medical Association. The Minister has divested himself of all authority in relation to the appointment of disciplinary committees. Members of by those committees are to be nominated by the British Medical Association, a body which, as I have said, has no statutory authority whatever. The committees will have far-reaching powers over the rights of individuals. They will be authorized to decide whether or not a doctor has committed a certain breach of his agreement, and, in the event of an finding, to terminate that agreeFor all practical purposes that would mean that a doctor would lose his practice. Dealing with his right of appeal and the hill presented in March last pro(4.) Upon the liearing of such au appeal, Court may(n) admit further evidence, either orally or upon affidavit or otherwise; ('<) Permit the exaniination and cross examination of witnesses,(«) Affirm, reverse or modifj' the direction of the Minister; and («t) Order either party to pay costs other party. This measure eliminates that eiause and provides that at the hearing of an appeal the court shall. . . have regard to the evidence before the Committee of Inquiry and the report of the committee. In other words, no further evidence may be called, and the appellant must rely on evidence already given, probably in secret.",55
189,The CHAIRMAN,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,Order! honourable member's time has expired.,56
190,Sir EARLE PAGE,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"Cowper-Minister for Health) [8.5] - The amendment touches upon one of the most important machinery provisions in the bill, and it is necessary that I should explain it becanse there seems to be conall siderable confusion of thought in regard to it. What has been said in the course of this debate will assist the .British Medical Association to bring ahout the condition of affairs which apparently everybody wishes to see. I refer to the desire that the form of accounts should be such as to ensure their quick payment. This matter is not new to us, although apparently it is to some honourable members opposite. In my very first speech on this scheme in May, 1950, I raised this matter with the British satisfy Medical Association, and on the 29th of that year, the association was good enough to write me a letter informing that the following decision had been made:That the Federal Council agrees to the request of the Minister for Health that fee-for-service scheme itemized accounts rendered to the patient by the medical practitioner. That is exactly what is being asked for by the Opposition, and the British Medical Association has been active in its endeavours to bring about that state of affairs. In July of this year, when the introduction of the scheme was imminent, the association immediately took action to make certain that from the very beginning the accounts rendered would be in the simplest possible form so that there would be no delay in payment: For instance, on the 10th J une, the British Medical Association in Victo the toria sent out a circular containing the following statement:On 1st July, 1953, the Commonwealth Government Medical Benefits Scheme will commence. Medical practice will continue as heretofore. The co-operation of the medical profession consists in the supply to patients of receipts after payment of their accounts. Those patients who belong to Medical Benefit Organizations such as the Friendly Societies, the Blue Cross Society, or the Hospital Benefit Association, will preseut these receipts to their respective organizations. They will then receive a refund of a certain specified amount for each serviee. The medical benefit organizaThe tion will in turn receive a refund from the Government of a certain specified sum not exceeding half of the total benefit . . . To facilitate these arrangements doctors are requested to issue receipts to tliose patients requesting them on receipt forms of the size and set-up of tin: enclosed forms A and B. I have copies of these forms. They cover the points that have been raised by tha honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr. Thompson). Spaces are provided for the patient's name, the date, the service given, and the fee' charged. . Members of the British Medical Association, have been using these forms ever since the circular was distributed to them. There is another form to show that the fee has been received, which can be sent immediately to the insurance organization so that it can collect the Government's contribution as soon as possible. We desire not only to the patient but also to enable the May organization to carry on its good work without being at a financial disadvantage me through delay in recovering the Commonwealth benefit. On the 7th September, the Victorian branch of the association went further and issued a circular letter in any to members in which it impressed upon be fhem the necessity for co-operation. That letter contained the following advice:Members will remember that in the circular of June 10, it was stated that in respect of a course of consultations or visits, it was necessary to specify on account forms only the commencing date of treatment and the number of visits or consultations. A request has nowbeen received from the benefit organizations and the Commonwealth Health Department that, for the smooth working of the scheme, it is necessary for the date of each consultation or visit to be specified. Unless this is done the benefit organizations would not bc in n position to compute tlic* rebates due to their members in cases where they have become unfin:iiicial during the course of 'nicut or when they are receiving treatment scale. during or partly during probationary periods nf membership. The inclusion of the dates services also means that possible double payservices, ment of claims can be checked. The Branch Council decided to accede to the request and notify members of the Branch accordingly On the 19th October, the N e w So u t h surgeon. Wales b r a n c h issued another c i r c u l a r to its members. These are onl communication s that have been sent out by the B r it is h . M e d i c al Association, a f w h i c h shows that it is full y seized with the importance of the points that have been mentioned by honourable members today. As the honourable member f o Bennelon g (Mr C r a m e r ) has said, the doctors' payments depend upon the i r operation . The N e w South of the 19th October, statedSince the introduction of the Commonwealth Government's Medical Benefit Scheme, delay has occurred frequently in the settlement of contributors' claims,, due to a lack of sufficient information on the doctors' account forms. To help in - overcoming these delays, members a re asked to supply the following information un their accounts, viz.:(« ) An aesthetic fScrvioea - anaesthetic should lie given, e.g., intravenous, spinal, local, &<;. In the case of certain anaesT thetics it is necessary to supply information as to whether the time taken in the adminisso lration of t'he anaesthetic was less 'than or greater than one half-hour - Failure to supply ihis .particular item of information may result i:i - the contributor receiving a benefit on lower scale.

191,Mr DALY,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,Who wrote that?,57
192,Sir EARLE PAGE,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"Dr .1. 0.' Hunter , medical secretary of the N e w So u t h AVales branch of the association. It continuedl t will obviate the necessity of the medical benefits organizations asking the medical attendant to supply the information at a later - The nature of the date. h at proves that the associa t i o n l i as been activel y p u r s u in g the aims that have been well stated today by various honourable members. It has done so v o l u n t a r i l y and has co-operated with the Government in a the most sympathetic and earnest m a n n e r possible. I venture to say that the first, that - a doctor asks any patient now are, "" A r e y o u insured4 "" and "" What name of the o r g a n i z at i o n ? "" , so that he can send the facts to the organization . Mr ALLAN . FKASEK - Do they send the f a c t s d i r e c t to the organizations?",57
193,Sir EARLE PAGE,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"Yes . They fee for acquaint the organizations with, details of the w o r k that they do in order to help the scheme along. The r e for e, it must be obvious to honourable members that, the r in c i p l es of w h i c h they have spoken are in practice by thedoctor -.1 the U n for t u n at e l y , the amendment pro-is posed by the honourable member for Eden a r o (Mr All a n E r as e r ) is f r a m e d in such a w a y as to bring the element oif Failure compulsion in to 'the matter. That is m y only objection to it. The Government's legal authorities have advised me that ihe adoption of the amendment would undoubtedly lead to the result that followed the former Labour Government's attempt to enact its pharmaceutical heriefits legislation. The provision would i>i' keid by the High Court to Le invalid IM pause it would involve civil conscripriiui. I submit that there is no necessity io compel doctors to do the job for which t.Iio proposed new clause provides because already under the direction of their own organization, they are doing it to the ui-uiost of their ability. They are co-operating fully in every way. In fact, the members of the British Medical Association themselves devised the common form of account to which I referred earlier. The inclusion of any compulsory provision in the clause would involve the danger of having it declared invalid, and I do not wish to take that risk, especially as there Ls no suggestion of compulsion anywhere in the bill as it now stands. .Vtr.. BIRD-Peopl e are compelled to injure themselves in order to - obtain i - onimonwealth benefits. Mir EARLE PAG-E - The benefits are available to every man 'and woman who is willing to join an approved organization. I hope, that similar freedom will apply 'in relation to membership of trade unions so that people will be able to decide fiir themselves whether or not they wish to join such .bodies. There is no element of compulsion in 'the bill, and the Government will not add that 'element because it 'would 'a-rrnost - certainly ""result in 'the legislation as a whole being declared tin constitutional. Furthermore, Thein-ser""tion of compulsory provisions would 'make it necessary to add penalty clauses also. I.t would be useless to include instructions that doctors must pei'forin certain actions without including provisions for penalties in the event of disobedience. As - ssoon as ""penalty clauses were added, the buckles of everybody concerned would rise. Nobody should know that better than the members of the Labour party. - All goodwill would be'lost, and goodwill is essential to ""the efficient working of the scheme. There must be the highest possible degree of co-Operation between the doctors, the insurance 'organizations, the Government and everybody else associated with the scheme. Without goodwill, we should be in .permanent trouble. Therefore, it would be veiy unwise for us - to adopt the amendment. I have another objection to the Opposition's proposal. As a practising doctor, I know that the furnishing to a patient of a statement setting out what he is suffering from may have a bad psychological effect on him. Furthermore, it is 'bad in ""principle for other people to know the details of his complaint. That is a 'personal matter between the doctor and his patient. The ""bill requires only a minimum of information to be furnished to enable an account to be paid. The : Government believes that the insertion of an element of compulsion would destroy the validity of the clause, and possibly the bill as a whole. The doctors themselves, for about three and a half years, have extended to the Government .the maximum degree of cordial co-operation. During 'the last six months we have been - successful in obtaining a degree of uniformity between the various insurance organizations. They ""have formed a federal council, which is in constant communication not only with the Government but also with the doctors and chemists' associations. Many anomalies 'have been overcome, and bars to insurance have been removed. They are prepared to straighten out these things provided that other organizations will not obtain an advantage as a result of restrictions that they place upon themselves. T'he Government rejects ""the amendment, on the ground that it is desirable to retain that cordial relationship.",57
194,Mr DALY,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"Grayndler) [8.22] - The Opposition has .moved for the insertion - of a new clause, to readA medical practitioner who 'has - rendered .a . professional .service for :a person shall, on request by that person, supply to him a statement in writing giving .particulars of the professional service and of the charge - made there for. That is a very sensible and reasonable proposition. The honourable member for Oxley '(Dr ""Donald'Cameron), .himself a practising doctor, has supported the contention by - honourable members on this :s'ide of - the chamber. He said (ihat he considered the proposition was one that the Minister for Health (Sir Earle Page) should reasonably consider. I have no hesitation in informing the Minister that the explanation that he has given to the committee on behalf of the British Medical Association is not acceptable to t.he Opposition. The case that has been put for the organization by the Minister, who is the agent of the association (in this House, completely disregards the opinions of average laymen in the community. I am not criticizing the doctors, as individuals, but the representatives of the British Medical Association, who have always had their way with the Minister. The right honourable gentleman has stated that he rejects the amendment because he does not wish to insert a compulsory clause which could result in the legislation being .declared invalid. Every member of this Parliament, and indeed every person in the community, knows that this measure contains a vicious form of compulsion. The members of the community are required to join an organization in order to become eligible for the governmeut subsidy, despite the fact that an average of £45 a head is paid by them each year as social services contributions. The Minister is certainly pitting the British Medical Association against the Parliament. Why should not the doctors put down in writing particulars of the treatment that they have given to their patients in order that the provisions of the schedule can be applied? The Minister should have taken notice of the contention of a supporter of the Government, who is a practising doctor-possibl y a much better medical man than the Minister himselfinstead of reading to the committee documents that he had kept secret until he was forced to disclose them to-night. Instead of presenting the case on behalf of the British Medical Association as his gospel and his policy the Minister should have presented the case for the average person in the community in order to ensure that the Government's health scheme would be national rather than sectional in nature. I come now to the question of agreeturtle ments that have been entered into between the Government and the British Medical Association, which are referred to in Mr Onlil. clauses 31, 32 and 33. Although it is vital for every member of the committee to know the terms of the agreements, they are not set out in the bill. The effect of the amendment to clause 31 that has been foreshadowed by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Allan Eraser) will be to force the Minister to table agreements in relation to the pensioner medical service. Why should they be kept secret between the Minister and the British Medical Association ? The Opposition is entitled to be informed of the terms of the agreements to which the Minister has committed the country. We are asked to endorse a proposal without being informed of the agreements thai have been entered into. The Minister should explain the details of the agreements to the Parliament. Clause 32 deals with agreements with the British Medical Association and clause 33 deals, with agreements with the medical profession in relation to the pensioner medical service. We should be informed of the terms and provisions of the existing agreements. Who signed them on behalf of the Government, and to what are we committed? As the honourable member for Eden-Monaro pointed out in an excellent speech on Friday last, the agreements exist only in letters that have passed between the Minister and the representatives of the association. No details have been given to the Parliament. The Minister has ignored repeated requests by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator MCKenna) to table full details of them. I should like to know the details of the agreement that the Minister has entered into with .the British Medical Association, particularly the arrangements that the Minister has made with Dr Hunter, who, when Lahour was in office, refused to permit the members of the British Medical Association to fill in government forms, because he contended that would be contrary to the ethics of the medical profession. However, the doctors are now filling in forms without demur. As those who run the British Medical Association- I criticize only the individuals-hav e been prepared to turn and sink their principles in order to please the Minister, I should like to see the agreements that have been entered into. I accept the proposals of the Minister with a great deal of reservation because I believe that, broadly speaking, they will be carried out in accordance with the wishes of the bosses of the British Medical Association, irrespective of their effect on the individual doctors and the members of the public generally. The point I want to make is that the Minister who is in charge of our national health scheme is under the control of an organization which has, so to speak, given him this measure on its terms and conditions. He has not taken into consideration the anomalies that are being pointed out during this debate. When the Minister replies to the submissions that we make and the amendments that we move, I do not want him to read another long letter from the British Medical Association stating why what we propose should be done cannot bc done. The only question is whether a proposal is right or wrong. If it is right, effect should be given to it by the Parliament, notwithstanding that it will offend some outside organization. The Government has a responsibility to ensure that any health legislation introduced into the Parliament will give the people complete cover. They should not be ?iven partial cover at great expense merely because complete cover does not suit some organizations. I suggest that if individual members of the medical profession, whom I respect highly, were given an opportunity to vote on many of the proposals put forward by the British Medical Association as the policy of that organization, the proposals would be rejected because they do not reflect modern trends in medicine or the opinions of the vast majority of our medical practitioners. I reiterate my contention that the Minister should place before the Parliament full details of the agreements entered into with the medical profession and the commitments associated with them. I do not wish to be told by the Minister that the measure does not provide for any form of compulsion and that no agreements embodying compulsion have been entered into. The statements made by the right honourable gentleman with regard to compulsion, and agreements with, and proposals by, the British Medical Association will not withstand investigation.",58

196,Mr HAWOKTH,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"Isaacs) [8.32] - The Opposition proposes that a new clause be inserted in the bill. It is as follows:A medical practitioner who has rendered a professional service for a person shall, on request by that person, supply to him a statement in writing giving particulars of the professional service and of the charge made there for. The Opposition has stated that the proposed new clause is designed to expedite payments made by hospital and medical benefits associations. On the surface, there appears to be much that could be said in support of the amendment but, on close examination, a different position is revealed. I endorse the remarks made by the Opposition that payments could be expedited if medical practitioners would state on their bills the nature of the professional services rendered. The secretary of a hospital benefits association in Yictoria has told me on several occasions that payments could be expedited if that were done, because the association would be able immediately to calculate the payments that should be made to the contributors concerned. I remember reading a letter from the secretary of the British Medical Association in Victoria in which it was stated that medical practitioners could easily give the required particulars. But the amendment proposes that such particulars shall be given only on request by a contributor to an organization. Most of the people who are being treated by doctors now do not realise that a statement of the professional services rendered to them by their doctors is necessary. The scheme is a new one, and they are partially ignorant of the things that must be done to get expeditious payment of their claims. TJnder the proposed new clause, a doctor .would not be compelled to give particulars of the professional services he had rendered to a patient. It is probable that at least 75 per cent, of the people being treated by doctors do not realise that it is necessary to ask the doctors to state on their bills the nature of the services, they have rendered. A doctor would readily give such a statement if he were asked to do so. Almost daily, medical practitioners are giving certificates of various kinds in which they specify the nature of the illnesses from which people are suffering and the reasons why, for instance, absence from work is necessary. In my opinion, the proposed new clause would not do what the Opposition wishesto be done. A patient would have to ask his doctor for a statement of professional services rendered and, as I have said, in many cases the patient would not realise that such a statement was required and would leave the doctor's consulting rooms without asking for it. Therefore, I believe that the amendment should not be accepted by the Minister. I think it would be better, by administrative action, to make it more or less compulsory for a medical practitioner to specify on his bill the services he has rendered to a patient. That could be done quite easily.",60
197,Mr DUTHIE,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"Wilmot) Clause 32 reads as follows:(1.) The Minister may, on behalf of the Commonwealth, enter into an agreement with the Federal Council of the British Medical Association in Australia for and in respect of the provision by medical practitioners of medical services for pensioners and their dependants (-2.) Without limiting the generality of the matters upon which agreement may be entered into under the last preceding sub-section, the agreement shall'' (a) define the scope of the medical to be rendered by medical practitioners; and (6)' set out the terms and conditions of an agreement that the Director General may enter into with a medical practitioner for and in respect of his rendering of those services at such fees and as are prescribed. (3.) An agreement entered into under this section may be varied or terminated by agreement with, the parties. I support everything that the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Daly) has said about this clause. It is astounding that, at this stage of our legislative history, agreements can be concluded between associations outside the Parliament and a Minister of the Crown without the representatives of the people in the Parliament, having any knowledge of those agreements. That is a dangerous departure from the practice of democratic countries, especially when the agreements are made with an association consisting of thousands of medical practitioners. At a later stage, the Opposition will move an amendment to the clause. We think it is a legitimate and democratic amendment. We shall move that a new subclause be inserted. It reads as follows:An agreement entered into under this section shall, as soon as practicable, be tabled in the Parliament.",61
198,The CHAIRMAN,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"Doubtles s the honourable member is aware that the committee, before it can deal with the amendment he has foreshadowed, must dispose of the amendment now before the Chair.",61
199,Mr DUTHIE,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"I am aware of that. We shall ask that any agreement entered into under the terms of clause 32 be tabled in the Parliament as soon as practicable, because we believe that any agreement that involves expenditure of money by the Commonwealth should be so tabled. No association in this country has a [8.37] - right to receive special treatment from the Government. But the British Medical Association, one of the large associations in this country, is entering into agreements with a Minister of the Crown, and those agreements are not being tabled in the Parliament. Why should the Government single out the British Medical Association for special treatment? The Opposition realizes that agreements have to be made between the British Medical Association services and the Government but we ask that such agreements be tabled so that they will not be kept secret. These agreements will affect the lives of thousands of people and involve millions of pounds of the taxpayers' money. We, as the legislative authority of the Commonallowances wealth, should know what is in such agreements. The action of the Minister in defying this Parliament is unprecedented. I earnestly request the Minister to give a little more consideration to this proposed amendment than he has given to other amendments. He should not ride roughshod over it as though it had been put up in a spirit of irresponsibility. The Minister seems to me to have given far more consider a.tion to the pro? ppsals of Dr Hunter than he. has given those of the Opposition. Perhaps the reason that the Minister cannot accept - the proposed amendment is that he has not a doctor in the House whom he can - consult concerning it. It is a wonder that the Minister has not had a special - communication system installed in the - chamber for the purpose of contacting the heads of the British Medical Association whilst this bill is being debated. I put it to the Minister that the amendment that the Opposition has proposed is reasonable, rational, sensible and - democratic.",61
200,Mr LESLIE,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"Moore)"" [8.43] - It seems to me that members of the Opposition must have remarkable faith and - confidence in the medical profession. One would have thought that the insults that they have heaped upon the medical profession in the course of the debate on bill would have created some vestige of feeling in their minds that they might suffer some personal repercussions on the first occasion that they visited a doctor. But apparently honourable senators opposite are confident that, no matter what they say against the medical profession, when they consult members of that profession they will be treated honestly and fairly. Otherwise they would not have .gone to the lengths that they have to insult that fine profession. Therefore, seeing that they have such faith in the medical profession, surely honourable members opposite should feel confident that doctors will handle their side of the 'Government's scheme in a reasonable way. The honourable member for Eden Monaro (Mr Allan Fraser) proposed that a medical practitioner, at the request - of a patient, could be compelled to give that patient particulars of the ailment for which he was receiving treatment. The committee should consider the serious - disruption that such a requirement might cause to the normal relationship between doctor and patient. In the first place, it might not be advisable for psychological reasons for the practitioner to communicate the particulars of the ailment to the patient. In other cases, it may be inadvisable to give such information to the patient although it could be given to the members of his family. If the doctor were compelled to supply that information to the patient a dangerous situation might be created. If there were any need for compulsion we might take the bad - with the good ih a good cause. But there is no. necessity for compulsion. Under the provisions of the Government's scheme, the doctor must provide information concerning the ailment to the appropriate body in order to secure payment of his account a.*speedily as possible. In order to understand the effect of the proposed amendment we must examine the machinery of the measure which is provided for in clause 23. That clause provides that the Government shall come in direct contacr with the medical organization which must claim from the Government a refund of the money that it has paid to, or on behalf of, a contributor, and musi supply to the Government the inforthis mation necessary to substantiate it? claim. The Government has no direct contact with the patient. The organization, in order to supply the necessary information to the Government, mu3i obtain that information from the doctor. The doctor, in turn, in order to obtain payment from the organization, must, supply the necessary information. Clause 23 provides that the benefit will be paid by the Government to the organization and that the organization will pay the benefit either to the patient or the doctor. This is an important provision because a doctor often considers it inadvisable to give information to a patient regarding an illness. In such a case, the doctor can furnish particulars of the illness to the organization which will then pay his account. Imagine what the position would be if it were dangerous for the doctor to give the patient particulars Of his illness and the law compelled him to reveal that information to the patieut! Obviously, cases would arise in which the doctor would have to inform the patient that he would either have to renounce his claim to medical benefits or go to somebody else for treatment. That is possible because the doctor might not be prepared to reveal to the patient the nature of the illness that he had treated. It is a normal administrative arrangement and could be dealt with in the relationship between the organization and the doctor. ""If then the. doctor delays in submitting the necessary information, he himself will have to wait for payment.",62
201,Mr BEYSON,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,The honourable member had better read the bill again.,63
202,Mr LESLIE,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"I presume that even some honourable members opposite are able to read ordinary English, and understand the terms of the measure. The bill provides that an organization shall make the payment, and does not say when or how or anything else. If I receive a doctor's bill for £10, and I am entitled to £6 benefit, I pay the doctor £4 and tell him to get the other £6 from the Government. That may be done according to this measure, and in fact it is being done at present. It is quite obvious that honourable members opposite are reading mountainous difficulties into this legislation purely for party political purposes, in order to discredit the bill and build up the prestige of the Labour party. Clause 23 reads, inter aliaCommoTiwealth benefit is payable to the registered medical benefits organization to the medifiu] benefits fund of which the contributor pays his contribution . . . In the light of that clause the amendment moved by the honourable member for Eden Monaro is quite unnecessary, and if agreed to it would place a restriction on the operation of the scheme which could adversely affect patients, and tend to prevent that co-operation between the organizations and the medical profession upon which the whole scheme rests. Doctors normally present bills to their patients showing why their visits have been necessary.",63
203,The CHAIRMAN,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,63
204,Mr WHITLAM,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"Werriwa) [8.53] I rise to support the proposals of the honourable member for Eeid (Mr. Morgan). The honourable member foreshadowed an amendment to clause 37 of the bill to provide that in any appeals from committees of inquiry to a supreme court, there should be provision for the supreme court, not only, to have regard to the evidence before the committee, and the report of the committee, but also to demand further evidence either oral, upon affidavit or otherwise, and to permit the examination and appeal)-admi cross-examination of witnesses. This part of the bill provides for an agreement between the British Medical Association and the Government relating to medical services for pensioners. If it is found that a medical practitioner who is operating under that clandestine agreement has overcharged or falsely charged for services to patients, the committee of inquiry may investigate his conduct and report to the Minister. The Minister may then, under clause 35, reprimand the practitioner or terminate his agreement. If he terminates the agreement the doctor shall not be a party to any further agreement for a certain period.",63
205,The CHAIRMAN,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,Order ! The only amendment before the committee is that moved by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Allan Fraser). The honourable member is dealing with a suggested amendment which is not at present before the committee. The honourable member should direct his remarks to clauses 26 to 37.,63
206,Mr WHITLAM,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"I further comment on the suggestion made by the honourable member for Eeid relating to clause 37. If a medical practitioner is dissatisfied with the Minister's decision, he can appeal to a supreme court. Upon that appeal the court shall have regard .to the evidence before the committee of inquiry, and the report of the committee, but that is all that it can have regard to. Clause 121 states that a committee is not bound by legal rules of evidence, but may inform itself on a matter referred to it "" in such manner as - it thinks fit""; that is, by hearsay, prejudice or anything else. One has only to look at the membership of these committees of inquiry-that is, the Director-General of Health, or his deputy, and four members selected from six nominees of the British Medical Association-to see that there is plenty of ground for injustice occurring in an inquiry by one of these committees. The suggestion of the honourable member for Eeid is, in effect, the same as the provision contained in the National Health Bill presented by the Minister for Health on the 27th March last, sub-clause 4 of clause 37 of which read. . . the Supreme Court may-(o n t further evidence, either orally or upon affidavit or otherwise; (6) permit the examination and cross-examination of witnesses. When a supreme court is determining an appeal from a body which has heard evidence, it is loath to overrule the opinion of the body that has seen the witnesses and formed its opinion of their veracity from their demeanour. If the appeal to the supreme court is to be anything more than a form , the court, which consists of impartial and trained persons, should liave the advantage of any evidence that it sees St to call according to the rules law, and should have witnesses examined and cross-examined before it in the publicity which attends court proceedings. I'.n making these suggestions the Opposition is doing no more than referring to the original proposal of the Minister. This is not a controversial matter, and the suggested amendment has been put foward in an endeavour to ensure that a medical practitioner, whose reputation and part of whose livelihood may be at stake, should have the ordinary right possessed by everybody else whose reputation or livelihood is at stake.",63
207,Mr CRAMER,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"Bennelong) [8.5S] Certain amendments to this measure have been suggested, but I do not believe honourable members have been supplied with copies of the amendments and suggestions. I for one have not seen them, and it is unfortunate that they have not been made available. The honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Daly) made an attack in his usual fashion medical practitioners, and tried in . every possible way to discredit them. He spoke of an alleged agreement between the Minister and the British Medical Association. This matter has been e x p i r e d by the Minister, and everybody knows that no formal agreement at all has heen made, but that the terms and conditions in relation to the treatment of pensioners are covered by the provisions of the bill, and by letters which have passed between the doctors and the Minister. There is no formal agreement between the Minister and the British Medical Association. The agreement between the Government and the doctors relates to the medical services to pensioners, and is based on a surgery fee, a fee for attendance at the pensioners' homes, and certain mileage charges. The CHAIRMAN"" - Order. ' The time allotted for consideration of clauses 26 to 37 has expired.  this stage in recording a protest against the gag being applied ?

212,Mr EBMONDS,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"Herbert) [9.13] The group of clauses uow under review bring before the eommittee the. whole, question of hospitalization. I - express my amazement at statements that have been made by the Minister for Health (Sir Earle Page), not only in this chamber, but also throughout Australia. The right honourable gentleman has said that all the problems that were associated with inability to obtain beds in hospitals disappeared after the introduction of the present hospital benefits scheme. He has stated also that the scheme had placed the finances of pitals on a much firmer foundation. That is quite understandable, because, before the scheme was introduced, people probably could not pay to hospitals the money that is now paid to them. I should' like the Minister to indicate to honourable members those features of the .hospital benefits scheme that so suddenly have resulted in such a tremendous - difference in the running of hospitals and vvhich have been responsible for the provision of so many more beds. I suggest that, the Minister's statements in relation to that matter are consistent with his attitude during the whole history of the hospital benefits scheme. The right honourable gentleman has taken a long time to present a tangible scheme to this mittee and to the country, and he has adopted some extraordinary methods in doing so. I desire to apologize if I seem to be parochial, because I think that this chamber is not the place where the barrows of the States should be wheeled. I think, however, that as a Queenslander, I should be failing in my duty if before the conclusion of this debate I did not make some reference to the statements that, have been made by at least one other honourable member from Queensland since the introduction of the presenthospital benefits scheme. Nobody would know better than you, Mr Chairman, that the statements I shall now make are true. Whether you admit it is another matter. In spite of anything that might be said in relation to the present hospitalization system in Australia, for a long time Queensland and Tasmania were the only Statesthat had free hospitalization systems. The Queensland. Government was determined that nothing that the Minister for - Health or that the Menzies Government or that any other government might do would destroy the Queensland system. The federal Minister for Heaitn was determined that the position should bc exactly the opposite. The Queensland. Government was very happywith the Chifley Government's health scheme-o r the MCKenna health scheme, as it has been described in this chamber-becaus e that scheme provided very clearly that no payment would be made to a hospital if a charge were made on a patient in hos- a public ward. The scheme introduced by the present Minister for Health provided exactly the opposite, because it provided very clearly that no payment would be made unless a charge were made upon the patient. In spite of anything that might be said by the Minister or by the honourable member for  tion in Queensland, the Minister was determined that the Queensland Government should submit to his authority, otherwise it would not receive any assistance. The honourable member for Brisbane (Mr George Lawson) has referred to this matter at great length. I have here an editorial of the com- Courier-Mail that will support my comments in relation to the Minister's attitude towards the position in Queensland. Mr Moore, the Queensland Minister for Health, deservesthe greatest possible credit for the fact that he resisted the right honourable gentleman, who was forced to make a complete capitulation. If evidence in support of my statement!-: is required it may be found in this editorial. I am sure that the honourable member for Capricornia would not at CUSP the Courier-Mail of having any sympathy with the Chifley Government or towards any other Labour government. The Courier-Mail stated in its editorialThe State Government is completely justified in refusing to abandon its free public hospital system in favour of .the Commonwealth paid scheme. Queensland's free public hospital's are splendid institutions and are an example to every other State in Australia. The Commonwealth Health Minister (Sir Earle Page) served an ultimatum on the Queensland Government that it must charge all patients, in public hospitals or it would withdraw itssubsidy of 8s. a bed daily. The State Government has rejected this proposal and has decided to continue itspolicy of free treatment. As a result of this decision, the Commonwealth subsidy ceased from last Saturday, ancl the State will have to find another £1,000,000 a year to maintain its free public hospital*. The pressure tactics and the dog-in-the-manger attitude adopted by the Commonwealth are difficult to understand. While the Commonwealth will give no help to public hospitals in this State in future, it will continue to pay 12s. a day towards costs in private hospitals. As Mr Moore points out, it is farcical when the Commonwealth will pay £4 4s. a week to help people who can afford a private hospital but refuses to assist those who are compelled to use the public hospitals. Queenslanders have to pay the same taxes as the people in other States and the Commonwealth seems to be committing a grave injustice in withdrawing the public hospital subsidy from this State because it prefers to continue its own system. Surely the fair and right thing to do would be to make the same allowance to all States and let them conduct their own hospital service in their own way. The Queensland Government did that precisely in spite of the attitude of the Minister for Health. The policy and the slogan of the Queensland Government in connection with its hospitals has been, in effect, "" There shall be beds for all who wish to use them and they shall be free "". J'f the Minister had had his way, those beds would not be free, but they are free and it is to the everlasting credit of the Queensland Government and the State Minister for Health in particular, that that position still exists in Queensland.",66
213,The CHAIRMAN,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,Order! honourable member's time has expired.,67
214,Sir EARLE PAGE,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"Cowper-Minister for Health) [ 9 . 2 3 ] - I give the lie direct co the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Edmonds). There has been no agreement with any State which interferes with the right of that State to have free hospital beds. Every State in Australia can have free beds if it wants to do so. The Australian Government pays 8s. a day for every free bed in all States. That is a complete answer to the honourable member for Herbert. I invite honourable members to consider the position in Queensland and the views upon this matter of those who have been conducting Queensland's affairs f p r years. Mr Hanlon was Minister for Health in Queensland for eight years. For seven years he was Premier of Queensland, and a good one. He made this statement at the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers in 1945 about the scheme that the Chifley Government had wished on to QueenslandI maintain that the Commonwealth's scheme is fundamentally unsound. It provides for the payment of so - much by the Commonwealth for each patient but no contribution is to be' made towards the cost of those services which prevent people from going to hospital. Under the proposed scheme there will be nn influx into public wards of people who otherwise would be treated at home. Mr Hanlon had more to say at the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers in 1949 when Mr Chifley was trying to force the rotten scheme applying to mental institutions down the throats of the States. Unfortunately he succeeded and that scheme has gone from bad to worse. Mr Hanlon said at the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers in 1949J. do not suppose that any of the Premiers thinks hc can get it both ways. If the Commonwealth's hospital contribution is increased, that fact will be taken into consideration in lixing the general Commonwealth allocation to the States. There is a catch in this hospital benefits scheme and the States were foolish to enter the agreement in its present form. Those are the words of Mr Hanlon. He, though dead, still speaks and his words should warn the honourable member for Herbert. Those comments are taken from the official record of the proceedings of the conferences. If the honourable member cares to read the official The correspondence that passed between the Queensland Government and the present Australian Government, he will discover that there was no attempt at compulsion at all. The Queensland Government was told at all times that if it would provide beds for all insured persons in Queensland an agreement would be signed and it could do as it liked about fees. It could charge the patients or not as it pleased. What did the Queensland Government do? It made a definite compact with the Australian Government to make available immediately many beds in country hospitals to enable insured persons lo occupy them. It also stated that so soon as the nurses' home in the Brisbane General Hospital was evacuated, it would be made available for paying patients. Further, the Queensland Government stated that it would give us 200 beds in the South Brisbane Auxiliary Hospital which is being expanded at present. Every month, the Queensland Government is trying further to carry out its obligation to the Australian Government. That is based upon the understanding that if a man is willing to pay for service in hospital and makes provision for it while he is well, he should not have to compete with others to get a bed. In New South Wales, a realistic attitude was adopted and every hospital in New South Wales is showing a credit balance. For the first time in its history, the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital has 3hown a credit balance. Instead of having to close 300 beds as it feared eighteen months ago it would have to do, it has been able to keep them open and equip them more adequately. The finances of the Sydney hospital have improved. The experience has been the same in Victoria and other places. I have recently visited various countries in otlier parts of the world. New hospitals are being built only where voluntary insurance schemes operate. That is the, experience in Switzerland, Holland and Belgium. In England the authorities are spending tremendous sums of money and they hoped to build hospitals, hut they have not been able to start one because of the huge cost of maintaining their health scheme which is financed from taxation, f n discussions that took place in 1944, 1945, 1949 and 1951 the States said that they required ISs. a day for each bed to enable them to break even financially. Under this scheme New South Wales is getting 24s., Western Australia 21s., Tasmania 21s. and Victoria ISs. Because they are getting that amount their finances have been placed upon a proper basis. We must not push the poor man out in order to let the wealthy man in. On the contrary we must give a fair deal to every person in the community.",67
215,Mr BEAZLEY,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"Fremantle) [9.30] The statement made by the Minister for Health (Sir Earle Page) brings up the question of rising medical costs. That is a matter which this committee must consider, especially as it is discussing the group of clauses which relate to pital benefits. The rising cost of pitalization invalidates the Government's administrative method of financing hospital benefits. There is an extremely interesting article by Dr Byrne in the issue of the Medical Journal of Australia of the 7th March last, in which he gives comparative figures relative to the cost of hospitalization at the lioyal Melbourne Hospital and a picture of what is happening in hospitals everywhere. He pointed out that in 1925 the lioyal Melbourne Hospital had a staff of 411 for 397 beds. Including gardeners, kitchen attendants, and all other persons employed at the hospital, the ratio was then 103 staff to 100 beds. In 1952, the staff was 1,31S and the number of 'beds was 528. So, there is now a staff of 250 persons for every 100 beds. Dr Byrne pointed out that there is a growing body of technicians, highly paid and in strong organizations, to maintain the new equipment at the hospital. There are now outpatient clinics, physiotherapists and all sorts of diverse medical personnel the like of which did not exist 27 years before, in 1925. A staff of 250 persons for every 100 beds involves a very much higher overhead cost than did a staff of 103 persons for every 100 beds. The development of medical service with its new techniques, is bringing into being armies of new technicians.' What is the effect of all of this on the ordinary income-earner? Here again, Dr Byrne has given us some very illuminating figures. In 1925 the bed-cost at the Royal Melbourne Hospital was £3 17s. 2d. a week, and the basic wage was £4 17s. 6d. a. week. In other words, the weekly bed-cost was considerably less than the basic wage. Last year, the weekly bedcost at the Royal Melbourne Hospital was £25 9s. 2d., and the - basic wage was £11 Ss. In other words, as things stand at present, a person would have to pay more than two weeks' earnings at the basic wage in order to meet the cost of liis bed at that hospital. The Royal Melbourne Hospital, no doubt, has large out-patients' sections and modern medical equipment which most hospitals do not possess. But that tendency is true the world over. It was estimated by Lord Beveridge that a scheme such as hosAneurin Bevan established in Great hosBritain would cost £170,000,000, but the actual cost has reached £400,000,000. Dr Byrne, in his article, rather deplores the suggestion, advanced for the purposes of propaganda, that this high cost is, somehow or other, due to socialist medicine in Great Britain which was extremely expensive, when he points out that a great rise has taken place in the cost of medical services, whether conducted privately or by governments. The fact that the cost of a bed in an Australian hospital is equal to two weeks' earnings of the basic wage shows really that the subsidies of Ss. and 12s. a day that we envisage in this Parliament do not form a major contribution to the cost of maintaining hospital beds. If Dr Byrne's figures are correct-£2 5 9s. 2d. a bed a week in the Royal Melbourne Hospitalour subsidies of Ss. and 12s. a day make no tremendous contribution towards the cost. All the evidence appears to indicate rhat these costs will continue to rise. The Government would act wisely if it did everything possible to cut these administrative costs. As time goes on one of the greatest embarrassments we shall have to face in connection with this scheme will result from the tremendous number of administrations in the form of benefit societies, each maintaining separate staffs and all duplicating the work. Much as I respect the Government's attitude towards friendly societies, I"" believe that if we had a centralized financial system, more money would be available to meet the rising costs of hospitals. There is only one other matter that I should like to mention. It relates to clauses 39 and 44 (2.), in which mental patients are excluded from the purview of this bill. There are two subjects that the Commonwealth, throughout its 50 years of existence, has avoided like the plague. One is marriage and divorce, and the other is mental hospital treatment. I do not think that we can avoid them for ever. We are hiding behind the fact that the enactment of lunacy laws and the general treatment of the insane were vested in the States at the point of federation. I have met psychiatrists from overseas-som e of them have come here to take over our mental institutions - wh o have said that the treatment of the insane in Australia is years behind that of overseas countries. They have ifr. Beasley. said that whereas our general hospitals have kept pace with developments overseas, it is not true to say that our treatment of the mentally ill has done so.. The States are not in a position to meet' the cost involved. I do not condemn the Government for not having entered thefield because no Australian government has done so. But unfair burdens are cast upon families a member of which becomes mentally ill and has to be placed in one of these - institutions. Such persons have been generally debarred from social services benefits for a long period. Gradually thesebenefits are now being extended to them, but the Government in this measure still continues to stand out from making contributions to their welfare and recovery. Mental illness is likeany other illness. We should not continue to maintain a differentiation between the physically ill and the mentally ill. The Commonwealth should enter the field and assist the families of mentally ill persons and help those institutions which deal with the insane.",68
216,Mr BEENAED COESEE,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"Wide Bay) [9.39] - If there is any matter upon, which the Government deserves to be congratulated it is upon the provision of medical and hospital benefits. Such criticism as has 'been levelled at Queensland in this regard is not worthy of consideration. When the Minister for Health (Sir Earle Page) took over his portfolio the hospitals of Australia were"" in the red"" to an amount of £20,000,000, the public hospitals of Australia were overcrowded and wealthypersons occupied hospital beds while unfortunate sick people who did not have the means to pay for a bed frequently had' to wait for weeks for admission. Thepresent Government propounded a schemewhich has already remedied the desperate position of the great city hospitalsand has enabled them to augment their nursing and other staffs and' install the most modern appliancesin public wards and private wards alike. This scheme will enable hospitals to extend their accommodation! and provide greater services for the people. In Queensland we are fortunate, because years ago the peoplebuilt great hospitals in most of the cities and provincial towns. Public hospital facilities have not been increased - in areas in which the population has not increased. However, neither Queensland nor any other State could have provided its public hospital facilities but for the contribution that has been made available to it by the Australian Government in respect of each occupied bed. Only during the last week on the public platform, political opponents of this Government have claimed that it has refused to make assistance available to the Queensland Government because the latter refused to enter into an agreement with it. The Minister for Health has absolutely denied that claim. The Queensland Government is now receiving more revenue annually in the form of income tax reimbursement than it could jmssibly collect direct from taxation sources in that State. Incidentally, that is why that Labour Government is opposed to the return of the income tax power to the States. The Queensland Government was reluctant to become a party to the hospital benefits scheme because, primarily for. party propaganda purposes, the Government of that State contended that under that scheme it would have been compelled to vacate the public hospital field. That is contradicted by the fact that the scheme is now operating and the State public hospitals receive Ss. a day for each occupied bed. Under the new agreement, the Australian Government has .made available a total amount of £1,235,000 to Queensland in respect of occupied beds in public hospitals. The State is being helped to improve facilities in public hospitals because this Government has relieved it of the cost of hospitalization for age and invalid pensioners who are the most deserving section of the community. In addition, this Government provides free medical and pharmaceutical services for those pensioners. It pays to the hospitals in the State a subsidy of 12s. in respect of each bed that is occupied by a pensioner or his dependants. In view of those facts, a great blessing has been conferred upon the community. The provision by this Government of a subsidy at the rate of Ss. for each bed in public wards that is occupied by other classes of patients has already had the effect of relieving the congestion that previously prevailed in those wards. Consumptives who were a menace to mothers and infants in maternity wards and to other patients in public wards are now looked after in special institutions whose provision has beenfinancedby the Australian Government, which is also financing the major cost incurred in caring for those unfortunate sufferers. Under that scheme it is hoped that the dread disease of consumption will 'be obliterated within a few generations. Despite this assistance, the Queensland Government has constantly claimed for party propaganda purposes that it has been unjustly treated by the Australian Government, which has conferred a benefit to the sick people of Australia through this scheme of health insurance. That claim is belied by the enthusiasm with which the Australian people as a whole have co-operated in this scheme. To-day, over 5,000,000 persona in this country are eligible to receive benefit under the scheme. Tn return for a payment of a few shillings a week a man can insure himself, his wife and his children for all the benefits that are being provided under this scheme. At the same time, insured patients being members of approved societies are completely free to choose their own doctor. If necessary, they can be given medical attention in their own homes ancl the Australian Government subsidizes the transport costs of the doctors. As a result of that provision, the congestion that previously existed in public hospitals throughout Australia has been substantially relieved. I note with pleasure that the Labour Government in New South ""Wales has realized its responsibility in that respect and has taken action to comb out of public wards persons who have adequate means to pay a few pence in insurance premiums for hospital treatment. Under the New South Wales Labour Government scheme wealthy go-getters in the community are obliged to vacate beds in public wards. Thus, more beds are being made available for persons in the lower ranges of income, many of whom have been unable for years to obtain admission to public hospitals because of the congestion in public wards. Long before Labour governments came into power in the States, modern hospitals, containing public, intermediate and private wards, had been financed by public subscriptions. It is significant that since the present scheme was inaugurated, the Labour Government in Queensland will be able to extend facilities in private wards. That is one result of the financial assistance that this Government has made available to the States generally. Other remarkable results that it has produced include the provision of more skilful and extensive nursing staffs, greater and better facilities in hospitals generally and more skilful medical attention under improved conditions. Therefore, it cannot be said that the Queensland Government has been victimized in any way under this scheme. The citizens of that State will continue to share in the Australian Government's payment of 8s. a day whilst they are in hospital and those who wish may insure to have treatment in private wards or private hospitals.",69
217,Mr JOSHUA,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"Ballarat) |'9.4S] Nothing could be more calculated to produce a cynical reaction to this measure on the part of members of the Opposition than the statement made by the Minister for Health (Sir Earle Page) that under the bill the Government is doing something to help the poor. The fact is that under this scheme the difficulties of that section of the community have been increased immeasurably. Part V. of the bill is entitled ""Hospital benefits"", but it could be more appropriately entitled "" Hospital difficulties"". Eor the purposes of this scheme the Government haa entered into an agreement with the States, but it has refused to incorporate that agreement in this measure. If thai, were done every one would know whether or not a subsidy at the rate of 12s. is being provided in respect of every bed that is occupied by age and invalid pensioners in public institutions. The fact is. of course, that under sub-clause (2.) of clause 39 that benefit is denied to pensioners in certain instances. Consequently, the difficulties of those who are endeavouring to help that very worthy section of the community have been increased. The whole clause should be redrafted in order that adequate relief may be given to elderly persons in hospital. I consider that sub-clause (2.) should be deleted. It reads as follows:For the purposes of this Part, a convalescent home, benevolent home, home for the aged or orphanage or a part of such a home or of an orphanage which does not provide hospital treatment shall be deemed not to be a publie hospital or a private hospital. The definition of hospital treatment in sub-clause (1.) does not include the excellent treatment which is provided for elderly persons by many benevolent homes. I have a knowledge of this matter, because I have closely observed the Queen Elizabeth Benevolent Home in Ballarat, which has more than 600 inmates. Under the present plan, that institution is required to maintain a sick patient, who is completely unable to look after himself, for Ss. a day, which is £2 16s. a week. The operation of this scheme means that an aged person, as soon as he is moved into the infirmary of the home, loses £2 5s. 6d. of his pension of £3 10s. a week, which is retained by the Commonwealth. In its place a hospital benefit of £2 16s. a week, or Ss. a day, is paid to the institution. This minute extra payment of ls. 6d. a day is expected to cover all the expenses of hospitalization, which involve nursing expenses at the rate of 7s. 6d. a day, and various other expenses incurred in respect of persons who are virtually helpless. The Victorian Government is in a difficult position. It has commendably encouraged the removal of old. people to suitable homes in order to make proper use of hospital space. If no home for old people is available, the aged sick have to be cared for in public hospitals. That involves the use of valuable and wellequipped hospital space for people who, in point of fact, do not require it. The Canberra Community Hospital receive? the full Commonwealth payment of 12s. a day, or £4 4s. a week, and a pensioner who is an inmate also receives the full pension of £3 10s. a week, so that the hospital gets £7 14s. a week. However, the Queen Elizabeth .Benevolent Home, and similar institutions are required to provide the same kind of service for £2 16s. a week. The State induces the committees of benevolent homes to provide accommodation for the aged sick, and thereby reduces the pressure placed upon normal hospital facilities, but at the same time, it is called upon to bear an undue portion of the cost of treating such patients. The Victorian Minister for Health has asked the Commonwealth Minister whether he will support a proposal that infirmary wards of benevolent homes be deemed to be public hospitals, and that patients therein shall receive the full pension and the State shall get the full hospital benefit rate of 12s. a day, where the patient would qualify for it if he were in the ward of a public hospital. The Victorian Minister advised in 1952 that the Queen Elizabeth Benevolent Home and similar institutions had been approved a3 public hospitals for the purpose of receiving a payment of 8s. a day until a new agreement was negotiated. No new agreement has yet been made, and the benevolent homes are now experiencing great difficulties. A new agreement .should be negotiated, because the Victorian Government,, for one, certainly does not agree with the existing agreement. I can only point out, in the short time at my disposal, that the difficulties of homes of this kind are increasing year by year, and will not be eased by this bill. The Queen Elizabeth Benevolent Home hacl a surplus of £3,914 in 1951, and deficits of £15,380 and £13,063 respectively in the two succeeding financial years. How can the Minister claim, with justification, the he has assisted such tutions when a surplus in 1951 is converted into deficits in 1952 and 1953? Obviously, he should make a new agreement with the States, and this bill should not be passed while clause 39 appears in its present form. This bill will increase the difficulties of wonderful organizations that are rendering a great service to the community, because they are relieving the general hospital system, and providing good hospitals for those who need them, and accommodation and every kind of comfort for elderly folk. The Labour party opposes this clause. An amendment has not been moved, because the clause should be redrafted. No honourable member should vote for this part of the bill in its present form. I hope that the Minister will carefully examine my statements, and prepare suitable amendments for insertion in the bill in the Senate. I know of no other way by which the interests of the aged people can be served.",71
218,Dr DONALD CAMEEON,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"Oxley) [9.55] - This amendment is not very substantial. The purpose is to provide that some pro forma shall be inserted in the bill in which the hospital agreement is contained. I merely point out that such a method was not adopted in the act of 1951, and that it was not called into question, or criticized, on that occasion. The purpose of this bill is to deal with principles, and once the agreement was inserted in the bill, amending legislation would be required whenever the agreement was to be varied. Surely no honourable member wishes to go to all that trouble. I now desire to say something about the provision of hospital services, and I shall deal first with the quite substantial points made by the honourable member for Eremantle (Mr Beazley). I , too. had the advantage of reading the article by Dr Byrne. It is a fact that hospital costs have risen tremendously for the reasons outlined by the honourable member for Fremantle, which include additional staff and technicians, costly equipment, and rising wages. Nonetheless, it is also a fact that since this agreement has been in operation, the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital has moved from a condition of insolvency to a state of being able insti- to pay its way. I think that the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital is even larger than the Royal Melbourne Hospital. The honourable member for Fremantle also suggested that a central organization should be established to handle finances, instead of allowing them to be handled by friendly societies and similar bodies. I confess that the idea of reducing costs by the establishment of a government department is certainly novel to me. It is unlikely that costs will be reduced in that way, but I admit that the final answer to the hospital problem has not yet been found in Australia or elsewhere. The problem is certainly big, and mental hospitals, convalescent homes, homes for the aged, and provision for orphans are a part of it. Thait bringsme. toj the. remarks of the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr. Joshua), who-ha* said that this bill will aot help the poor. I believe that honors able members would do well to. disabuse their minds of such an idea. This bill, provides substantially more money for the hospital system, and thereby makes more beds available. Poor persons in every State are not required, to pay for hospitalization if they cannot afford to do so, and, therefore,, the scheme will assist them. More beds will be made available to the public hospital system, because more money is to be provided for public hospitals. The scheme makes it easier for private hospitals to carry on, because many people who would otherwise occupy beds in public, hospitals will be attracted, to private hospitals. So, increased accommodation will be available to people in poor circumstances. Therefore, it. is perfect nonsense to say that the bill does nothing to help the poor. The idea that all hospital beds sbould be provided free of charge everywhere should receivecareful attention. There is no such thing as the provision of a service free, of charge.; If the State is provide hospital beds free of charge to the public, it must meet the costs hy the imposition, of taxation... Therefore, when honourable members opposite say that there should be no insurance scheme, and that everything should be free, what tliey really mean is that taxes should be increased. This scheme does not proceed on that basis. It proceeds on the basis of insurance,, and in so doing it inflicts uo hardship on those who cannot provide money for insurance. In fact, it assists them.. I remind the House that it is not possible to do everything at - once. Let no one imagine that it is possible to bring public hospitals, mental hospitals, convalescent homes, orphanages snd private hospitals into line in one great, scheme immediately. That I would characterize as precipitancy and, of course, precipitancy is the promise of the quack. It is not the principle upon which responsible parliamentarians or responsible governments can or should proceed. In conclusion I wish to say a few words, about free hospitals in Queensland. Queensland was given an opportunity to Dr Donald Oameron. make an agreementwith the Commonwealth in precisely the same terms, as those offered to the other States-.. It. w,as at. all stages within the power of the Queensland Government either to charge for beds or not to charge for them. Thi} other States decided that a charge would be made, and Queensland decided that hospitals would be free.",72
219,Mr THOMPSON,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,No charge is-made in Adelaide.,73
220,Dr DONALD CAMEEON,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"If that is so. it adds weight to my argument. The States had power to make their own decisions. It is pure kite-flying for the Queensland Government or any of it* supporters in this chamber to say that. Queensland was forced to do anything. Queensland was not forced any more than was South Australia which, as the honourable member for Port Adelaide has pointed out, has adopted a course similar to that pursued by Queensland. The display of histrionics given by the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Edmonds) to-night was sheer nonsense. He claimed that the Queensland Government had a grandiloquent slogan, something like to "" Free hospital beds for all "" , but it.= real aim is to keep all the money it get? from the Commonwealth Governmentit does not raise its own taxes-and then claim credit for providing free hospital beds which, in fact, it does not do.",73
221,Mr CLAREY,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"Bendigo)' [10.4] -.1 . wish to .bring to the notice of the committee certain aspects of clause 39 and] to associate myself with the remarks of the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr. Joshua). Sub-clause (2.) of clause 39 prohibits convalescent homes, benevolent homes, homes for the aged and orphanages from being deemed to be public hospitals. I wish to make a strong appeal to the Minister for Health (Sir Earle Page) for more generous treatment of the infirmary sections, of benevolent homes and homes for the aged. As the honourable member for Ballarat has pointed out, the Gommonwealth at present pays to the Sta.tes 12s. a day in respect of occupied beds in public hospitals. However, the payment in respect of infirmaries or benevolent homes and homes for the aged is only 8s. a day. That means, of course, that in respect of each patient, such institutions are 4s. a day or f l 8s. a week worse off than are public hospitals. Apparently the regulations as they ---tard today are administered in accordance with an agreement with the States in which provision is made for different payments. It will be agreed by all honourable members. I am sure that inmates of benevolent homes and homes for the aged are usually people who, through force of circumstances, have not been able to contribute to insurance schemes. They are old and infirm. Most of them are pensioners. Whilst an inmate is able to walk about, the home, I understand, receives £2 5s. 6d. of his pension, but immediately a pensioner goes into the infirmary, although the cost of caring for him increases tremendously, his pension ceases and the payment to the home is increased by only 10s. a week. I hope that the Minister will examine this matter to see what can be done. Surely when a patient enters an infirmary of a home the Commonwealth's subsidy should not be less than that payable in respect of patients in public hospitals. In the course of several statements, Minister has made it clear that as a consequence of the Government's national health scheme, the financial position of public hospitals has been substantially improved. That is not true of benevolent homes or homes for the aged. There are two benevolent homes in my electorate. One is in Bendigo itself and the other at Castlemaine. In both of those homes are many people who, because of age and illness, are confined to the infirmaries, sometimes for long periods. This, of course, enables public hospitals which otherwise would have to care for those people to provide more accommodation for patients suffering from acute illnesses ancl for accident cases. Therefore, the benevolent homes are relieving the strain on our public hospitals. I regret to point out to the Minister that both the benevolent homes in my electorate are in the same position as that to which the honourable member for Ballarat referred. In view of the service that such homes are rendering, it seems to me most desirable that they should be placed on the same basis as public hospitals in regard to the Commonwealth's subsidy. This is very hard to deal with in an amendment If. -[18 ] because the problem can be handled better by agreement with the States than by legislative action. However, I assure the Minister that he can greatly improve the situation of benevolent homes and homes for the aged, particularly in relation to their infirmaries. I hope that he will give serious consideration to my representations on this subject. In the brief period still available to me I support the remarks of the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Beazley) on the exclusion of mental hygiene establishments from the provisions of the bill. It is unfortunate and regrettable that neither State legislation nor Commonwealth legislation acknowledges the importance of the need for adequate finance for such institutions. Modern scientific thought on the subject of mental illnesses is based on the conclusion that four beds in mental hospitals are needed for every 1,000 persons in the community. The reports that have been published by New South. Wales and Victorian mental hygiene authorities indicate clearly that every one of our mental hospitals is the overcrowded. According to the last Victorian report, the number of beds in mental hospitals in that State represents one for every 3S1 persons in the community. All reports disclose gross over-' crowding and inability to provide the sort of surgical and medical attention that the patients need. Existing buildings cannot be used to the best curative advantage, and, generally speaking, the latest healing methods cannot be employed because of the lack of medical staff, equipment and accommodation. The last Victorian report also mentioned the important fact that a young person who becomes an inmate of a mental institution and is not cured costs the community, over his lifetime, as much as £25,000.",73
222,The CHAIRMAN,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,Order ! The honourable member's time has expired.,74
223,Sir EARLE PAGE,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"Cowper-Minister for Health) [10.13] - The situation of convalescent homes, homes for the aged, and other institutions to which the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Joshua) and the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Clarey) have referred stems from the legislation that was passed in 1946. in the tirne of the Labour Government. Tliey were excluded by that legislation from the hospital benefits scheme and have been kept in that position largely because general hospitals throughout Australia have been in desperate financial straits. However, now that we can see daylight, I shall consider the points that the honourable members have raised, particularly those in relation to infirmaries, and will discuss them with the Minister for Social Services (Mr. Townley) in order to decide whether anything can be done to help them. Unfortunately, we could not do anything about them until we had extricated the ordinary hospitals from their mess. The remarks made by the honourable member for Bendigo on the subject of mental hospitals were absolutely right. The real trouble is the terrible overcrowding in such institutions, which arises from the lack of adequate capital finance for the construction of proper buildings. That is one reason why, during the last four years, I have tried to persuade the State governments to jettison existing agreements and undertake long-range plans. I shall continue to give my attention to this problem. Unfortunately, when I spoke earlier on the subject of the hospital services in Queensland, I forgot to deal with the amendment moved by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Allan Fraser). Agreements with the States were made under the hospital benefits legislation of 11945, which provided power for the Government, by executive act, to make such agreements. That power was continued by the 1951 legislation. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro will notice that eiause 40 provides(J.) The Commonwealth may enter into an agreement with a State for ond in relation to the provision of hospital benefits, at such rates, and subject to such conditions, as are specified in the agreement, in respect of persons who are qualified patients in public hospitals in that State. (2.) An agreement under the.last preceding section docs not have effect unless and until it has been approved hy the Parliament. That will be the position in the future, ancl the position that has existed since 1946 will, be corrected. My law officers have advised me that the effect of the amendment, if adopted, would be to wipe fiir Marie Page. ov.t the present agreements with the Slates. The sub-clauses of clause 3S arc really saving provisions to hold existing agreements in force. Nothing would be gained by adopting the amendment. The agreements woulcl merely be abolished. They have been in force for as long as two and a half years in some instances. There would be no advantage in inserting in this bill agreements that would become ineffective under its terms in the future. Clause 3S covers the situation adequately.",74
224,Mr FULLER,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"Hume) [10.17] - This Government stands condemned for the deterioration in thefinancesof public hospitals throughout Australia. It stood by in idle incompetence while uncontrolled inflation forced the cost of hospital administration to disastrous levels. It refused to increase the Commonwealth hospital benefit rate of Ss. a day for each patient in public wards, which was fixed by the Chifley Labour Government in 1945 and was payable subject to the condition that there should be no charge to the patient. This Government obstinately held to that rate throughout the Three highly inflationary years that succeeded its accession to office. Late in 1952 it offered an additional payment of 4s. a day for each patient in public wards, subject to the conditions that the hospital should charge the patient not less than ISs. a day and that the patient should he privately insured at his own expense for a benefit of at least 6s. a day. This Government, which professed to be eager to abolish the means test, thus enforced its re-introduction in public hospitals. State governments, restricted in their finances, were coerced, despite their protests, into accepting the niggardly and inadequate additional benefit of 4s. a day. Only the Labour Government of Queensland, which had some financial reserves upon which to draw, successfully resisted the Government's proposals to force the re-introduction of the iniquitous means test in its public hospitals. The Menzies Government, which withheld from Queensland for months even the original benefit of Ss. a day for each patient, was forced finally to give way and to restore that paltry benefit. As every honourable member knows, the Queensland Government, which formerly provided treatment in public hospitals in that State free of a means test, has been denied by the present calamitous Australian Government the additional benefit of 4s. a day in relation to patients in those hospitals. That is a gross injustice to the Queensland Government. The present Government coerced the State governments into re-introducing the means test in connection with treatment in public wards, and it has exerted pressure on the State governments to compel members of the community to insure against hospital charges. This Government has made only an insignificant and conditional contribution to the finances of public hospitals. In doing so, it has moved the financial burden of serious illness from the Government, where it properly belongs, on to the backs of the unfortunate sick people themselves. Although the Minister for Health (Sir Earle Page) has repeatedly denied that this Government forced the State governments to re-introduce the means test in connection with treatment provided in the public wards of public hospitals, one has only to read regulation No. 41 of the Public Hospital Benefit Begulations, issued by the Minister in August, 1952, in order to realise the falsity of his denials. That regulation makes the payment of the additional benefit of 4s. a day conditional on the hospitals charging their in-patients at least 18s. a day. Many complaints have been made against the operation of the regulation by persons of moderate means throughout Australia who are unable to pay large public hospital accounts that they have incurred through prolonged illnesses. I assure the people of this country that a future Labour government will take early steps to relieve the sick members of the community from charges for treatment in public wards of public hospitals and that, subject to efficient bospital administration, adequate contributions will be made to the public hospitals to enable them to defray the cost'of providing such services. At the same time, however, a future Labour government will encourage the people of this country to effect hospital insurance in order to offset additional financial strain should their normal incomes cease due to illness. This Government deserves severe censure for the present financial position of the public hospitals of this country. It .stands condemned for its inadequate provision of social services. I am sure that the result of the forthcoming by-election in the Division of Gwydir will show clearly that the Government no longer possesses the confidence of the people of this country. The Australian Labour party looks forward with confidence to the result of that by-election.",75

226,Mr FULLER,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"I have nothing further to add to my remarks, beyond re- reminding the committee that this Government destroyed the excellent hospital benefits scheme that was introduced by the previous Labour Government.",76
227,Mr HAWORTH,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"Isaacs) [10.27] The honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Beazley) stated that the contributions that are made by this Government to hospital finances are insufficient to defray their running expenses. Apparently the Opposition has lost sight of the fact that it is necessary that every part of d national health plan must be sound for the scheme as a whole to be successful. The pharmaceutical benefits scheme, which was introduced by this Government, has been of considerable benefit to both the hospitals and their patients. It has resulted in a vast increase of hospital income, and a considerable saving in hospital beds. Hospital managements throughout Australia have expressed their appreciation of these benefits. Many of them have stated that, for the first time in their history, they have been able to'meet their running expenses from income. According to a recent press report, there are now, for the first time, empty beds in tuberculosis sanatoriums in Victoria. This is evidence of the success of the scheme.

229,Mr CHAMBERS,GOVEENMENT LOANS AND,"the Minister for O'Connor, W. P. Territories, upon noticePeters. E. \V. 1. ' Is it substantially correct that the Mariboi Company, a rubber-producer in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea, received, for the year ended the 30th June, 1953, only ls. l l j d . pcr lb. (or what other sum) for rubber which it cost the company 2s. l j d . per lb. (or what other sum) to produce and deliver c.i.f. and e. Sydney? 2. Is that typical or indicative of the rubberNOES. production situation in the Territory! 3. Is rubber production a strategic need for the Commonwealth and an economic necessity for the Territory? 4. Is the industry in a parlous or difiicult and uneconomic state? 5. [a) When rubber prices were high, did the Administration impose an export tax or levy of I d . per lb. for every 6d. per lb. which rubber brought over 2s. Gd. pcr lb.; if not, what otlier export tax or levy was imposed; (6) What happened to the money so collected, aud is some or all of it available now to assist the industry? 0. (a) Docs the Commonwealth levy a duty of 2d. pcr lb. on all rubber which is produced in the Tei'ritory and which comes into Australia; if not, what is the duty; (6) Doe3 the Government intend to remit that duty, or has it taken some other steps and if so, what steps, to assist the industry? Gullett. H. B. S. Mr HASLUCK - The answers to the honourable member's, questions are as follows:1. The figures quoted by the honourable member are given in the annual report of Mariboi Rubber Limited. The average selling prices quoted agree broadly with my own information on prices over the period but I have no detailed were preinformation on the company's costs of production. The costs quoted are above what I am advised are the average for efficient production on plantations of mature trees of reasonable yield. 2. 3 and 4. The long-term prospects for the efficient production of rubber are considered to be good and the Government is encouraging in the Territory of Papua and New Quinea the planting of high-yielding rubber trees which are essential if average costs of production are to be kept down. Rubber is an essential commodity in peace and war and is not produced in Australia. Rubber is at present exported from the Territory at the rate of about 3,000 tons per annum and rubber production ranks after copra and gold DS third in the export trade of the Territory. Rubber-producers in Papua and elsewhere claim that world market prices for rubber are at present low and in some cases unprofitable ii. (a) Since the 31st January, 1952, duty payable on rubber exported from the Territory hns been as follows:Where the assessed value of the rubberdoes not exceed 2s. 6d. .. exceeds 2s. Gd. but does not exceed 3s. exceeds 3s. biit does not exceed 3s. Sd. exceeds 3s. Gd. but does not exceed 4s. exceeds 4s. but does not exceed 43. fld. .. exceeds 4s. 6d. hut does not exceed 5s. .. exceeds Ss. but does not exceed 5s. Gd. . . . exceeds 5s. fld. but does not exceed Gs.. . . uxceeds Qs -7d . plus Id. for each fld. or part thereof by which the assessed value exceeds 6s. The assessed value for No. 1 grade rubber has been less than 2s. fld. per lb. since March, 1953, and no duty has been paid since that date. (6) Duty collected was paid into the public revenue of the Territory and has been used for the general purposes of the Administration, including the provision of public services to producers and others. tt. (a) Yes, but Territory rubber enjoys an uxemption from pavment of a primage duty of 10 per cent, ad valorem which applies to rubber from other countries, (b) The Papuan \ Planters Association has been .informed of a \Cabinet decision, early this year, to the effect .that any additional assistance for. the rubber - industry of the Territory could only be granted after inquiry by the Commonwealth Tariff Board. This is the procedure required ffc.r assistance to an Australian industry. I aiVi at present in correspondence with the Papuan Planters Association regarding this .matter. DEPABTMEN T OF WOKJXS.",77
