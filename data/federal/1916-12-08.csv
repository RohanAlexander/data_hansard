INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENT-MINIS TERIAL POLICY. In Committee of Supply: Debate resumed from 7th December (vide page  That there be granted to His Majesty for the service of the year ending the 30th day of June, One thousand nine hundred and seventeen, a sum not exceeding £3,293,290, Upon which Mr HIGGS had movedThat the sum be reduced by £1,000.000. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang) [10.41] - I take this opportunity to congratulate the new Ministers on their accession to office. Among them are one or two men whose services to the party to which they have belonged for many years, and to which, I presume, they still belong, notwithstanding the recent expulsions, entitle them to the recognition that they have now received. I am glad that they have at last been given the reward that they have earned. I particularly desire to congratulate the Minister for Home Affairs, who is one of the oldest members associated with the Labour party, and whose services I thought would have been recognised long ere this by the gift of a Ministerial portfolio. I congratulate the Treasurer on having made some attempt during the short time that he has been in office to recast the finances of the country on a basis of greater economy. But his financial statement, as a whole, is by no means satisfactory to me. There is room for a much greater revision of the finances, with a view to lessening the load of taxation, and to decreasing expenditure. Much of the present expenditure is, in my opinion, unnecessary and without justification in this time of war. I think that the sources of revenue are being overburdened' to meet ordinary expenditure at a time when money is urgently needed for the prosecution of the war to a successful issue. A great deal of money, which in normal times might justifiably be spent on railways and other extrapublic services of the country, should now be diverted wholly to war purposes. We. are constructing a large number of costly public works which, in their very nature, are unprofitable. This involves the expenditure of'millions of pounds. No attempt seems to have been made to curtail this expenditure, which is not needed at the present time. It should have been curSUPPLY. tailed at the beginning of the war, and if it had been suspended, the community would have avoided enormous unnecessary taxation.",5
14,Mr BURNS,MILITARY SERVICE,"What about the expenditure on the Federal Capital? Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON,-There has been a. lot of wasteful expenditure there. According to a report which wa3 made by the ex-Minister for Home Affairs, the honourable member for Darwin, considerably more than £500,000 has been expended there uselessly, and in a perfectly unjustifiable way. But I do not wish to trespass upon matters which are at present the subject of an investigation, and I shall wait until the report of the Commissioner who is inquiring into the expenditure upon the Federal Capital is tabled.",6
15,Mr BURNS,MILITARY SERVICE,"Has not the honourable member heen agitating for a long time that the work of the Federal Capital should be pushed on? Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Yes , hut in a legitimate way, so that the permanent expenditure will be justified by results which will serve the purpose for which the Federal Capital is intended. But I do not think that it would be proper for me to go into details with regard to the expenditure on the Federal Capital, for the reason that I have already stated. There is expenditure in other directions-on the transcontinental railways, for instance-whic h certainly should be deferred until a more convenient period, and until we once more get back to normal times. Millions of pounds are being spent on these railways; yet, as every one knows, they will be unproductive, if not for all time, at any rate'for many years, and the burden of providing revenue for the purpose of carrying on these works is very severe on the whole community. I am glad to see that the Government propose to revise the previous proposals ini Tegard to the entertainments tax. The primary purpose of such a tax is to raise revenue, and on that ground its imposition is justifiable; but under the proposal previously submitted there was a danger that the source of the anticipated revenue would be dried up altogether by the tax operating-in addition to the various State taxes already in operation-in the - direction of entirely dislocating that branch of industry and closing up many places of amusement. The result would probably have heen that the actual revenue would fall very far short of what the Treasurer anticipated receiving, from that source. The proposed wealth tax and the income tax are imposts which are very popular with a certain section of the oommunity, and when extra revenue is required for the purpose of carrying on a war special levies of taxation are justified, and no one can take exception to - extra taxation for war purposes; but, at the same time, we should endeavour to see that such taxation is levied equitably. We have to remember that we have already the State income tax and Federal income tax, while in New South Wales, in addition to.the ordinary income tax, there is a supertax amounting to a very considerable sum, and the Commonwealth Treasurer proposes another supertax to the Federal income tax to the - extent of an additional 25 per cent. This additional impost will fall very heavily .and unfairly upon those of the community who are already paying income tax. Instead of levying a tax of 1-J per cent, on the wealth of the community, as the previous Treasurer proposed- a proposal which the present Treasurer does not at present purpose disturbing, except in regard to the mode - and time of payment- I suggest that we - should tap another source of revenue, and put a tax on the capital unimproved value of land for the special purpose of the Repatriation Fund. I am not speaking in .any way for any other honourable member. These are my own views. Probably what I suggest will'not be too popular among some honourable members sitting on both sides of the House. It is a very unwise thing to put a tax upon capital. A tax of l £ per cent, on capital will mean the curtailment, to some extent, of the sources of revenue. The taxation of the capital from which profits and incomes are derived is an entirely different thing from the taxation of incomes and profits derived from the investment of capital; the one reduces capital, the other only reduces profits on income from capital - The taxation of capital to any appreciable degree must eventually defeat its own object by curtailing the source of revenue, thus placing the Estimates of the - Treasurer on a wrong basis by depriving him of the benefits which he expects to derive from the tax. The previous Treasurer anticipated that a. tax of 1^ per cent, on wealth, spread over a period of three years, would yield £3,333,000 per annum, or a total of £10,000,000 in three years.  mate was excessive. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Pro bably it may have been excessive; but I am not dealing with that point. The present Treasurer proposes to retain the tax of 1\ per cent, on wealth, but to spread it over a period of five years, collecting one-fifth of the total amount each year.  ber will see by the footnote, it may be possible to reduce the amount payable in the' earlier years. There is no doubt that there will be a reduction in the earlier years. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Ac - cording to the Treasurer's figures, it is anticipated that, by spreading the payments over five years £1,835,000 will be derived each year. Instead of levying such a tax in this v^ay, if the Treasurer were to levy a tax of l i per cent, on land values, what would be the result? According to the tabulated war census card returns, the capital value of unimproved freehold estates in Australia amounted at the time the cards were filled into £421,000,000. As to the cards remaining to be tabulated it was estimated that they represented the value of £25,000,000, bringing the total capital unimproved value of freehold estates in Australia to £446,000,000. A tax of 3d. in the £1, which is l i per cent., on that total capital unimproved value would yield a very considerable amount.  Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Yes .  a land tax of 9d. in the £1 on the top grades. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - But we are also taxing incomes very heavily, aaid this is to be a special levy for repatriation purposes. I am not . - suggesting that there should be a tax of 3d. in the £ 1 on these land values, although, if it were imposed, we could considerably modify the income tax and other sources of taxation, and do - away with a large portion of the Customs taxation, which is at present very burdensome on .the great masses of the community . Instead of being an additional levy, it could be a levy substituted for much of the taxation already imposed, and would relieve the burden of a very large number of people, who are now feeling very acutely the oppressiveness of the existing systems of taxation. Instead of levying 1 \ per cent, on wealth, if we were to levy 3d. in the £ 1 , or 1 \ per cent., on the total unimproved capital value of freehold lands in Australia it would bring in a revenue of £5,575,000 per annum, whereas, by his tax of 1 \ per cent, on wealth, the Treasurer anticipates receiving £1,835,000 per annum. From a tax of I d . in the £ 1 on capital unimproved land values the Treasurer would get £1,858,000 per annum, or an excess of £23,000 per annum over the revenue expected to be derived by imposing a tax of l i per cent, on wealth, spread over five years. I commend this scheme to the serious consideration of the Treasurer as - an alternative to that which he set out in his financial statement.  holders bear the whole burden of repatriation 1",6
16,Mr W ELLIOTJOHNSON,MILITARY SERVICE,"Be cause the scheme of repatriation - should be based upon the values which the whole community creates. By a tax on unimproved land values, imposed for that purpose, the whole .community would be required to bear its proper burden. Unim proved values are not the creation of any individual. They are not the result of in dustry or the expenditure of capital, but are rather the result of the presence, needs, and activities of the people as a whole, and the expenditure of public funds upon public utilities, such as railways, roads, bridges, and other public undertakings, differentiate between unimproved values and improved values. I do not - suggest that improved values should be taxed. I am speaking now entirely of unimproved values.",8
17,Mr GREGORY,MILITARY SERVICE,How would the honourable member tax the man who will not go on the land ?,8
18,Mr W ELLIOTJOHNSON,MILITARY SERVICE,"He owns his share of land values as well as any one else. I know of no man who does not go on the land. I know of no man who lives in the air. Man is essentially a land animal. Some people speak of land as if it were something in the country. They forget that the most valuable lands are city areas, such as those on which this building is erected. Some of my 'honourable friends are afraid that under this scheme the poor farmer would suffer. As a matter of fact, under it the farmer could be relieved of many of his already burdensome taxes. We could, for instance, afford, if such a scheme were in operation, to remove many of the i m posts on agricultural implements that he has to pay.",8
19,Mr RODGERS,MILITARY SERVICE,What would the hon. orable member give him while he was - clearing his land and earning nothing?,8
20,Mr W ELLIOTJOHNSON,MILITARY SERVICE,"He is called upon 'to pay various taxes at the present time, regardless of whether he is earning or not. It is only when we propose to tax the primary source of all wealth that we hear this plea for the poor farmer and the poor widow. Under this scheme we should be able to remit burdensome taxation which the farmer already has to pay, whether he likes it or not, and concerning which there is noland- protest from either side. There is no consideration for the poor farmer when he has to pay heavy imposts on all the implements an'd machinery that he needs for productive purposes. It is only when we propose to remit those taxes, and to substitute another tax which would fall upon him more lightly, that we hear this outcry. Let us see how this tax would f all . There are 669,474 holdings of freehold land in Australia, and of that number 534,000 are .holdings of less than £600 in value. The great bulk of these holdings, therefore, are under £600 in value. A tax of I d . in the £ 1 on estates valued at £600 would amount to only £ 2 10s. per annum. Surely that would not be a very - heavv burden for these people to pay for repatriation purposes, f t is far less t h a i they are asked to pay under the wealth levy.  anything like that amount under the wealth tax. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - The wealth tax is \ \ per cent., while this would not amount to J per cent. estates valued at £500 this tax would be only £2 Is. 8d. per annum. On estates valued at £400 it would he £1 13s. 4d. a year; on estates valued at £300, £1 5s. per year; on estates valued at £200, 16s. 8d.; and on estates valued at £100, only 8s. 4d. a year. Estates of a higher value would, of course, have to pay proportionately higher rates.",8
21,Mr RILEY,MILITARY SERVICE,"Does the honourable member believe in taking the exemptions off all land? Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Yes ; I would place all on the same footing. I submit this proposal to the Treasurer as being far more equitable than his per cent, wealth tax- a tax which was really proposed by his predecessor in office. I pass on now to the question of the referendum. I believe that the referendum was a very grave mistake, and I have held that view from the time that it was first announced. I felt from the first that the question of reinforcements for our troops - should not be made the subject of a referendum-that the Government of the - day-whateve r party might be in power--should take upon their own shoulders the full responsibility for the conduct of the war. I regarded the refusal of the present Prime Minister to accept that responsibility, and his action in shifting it on to the hacks of the people, as a lamentable confession of weakness. There was no one in. Australia in so good a position as the Prime Minister to know the real requirements of the war. He had come fresh from the inner councils of the Allies, with all the information necessary to enable him to form an opinion as to what was required. He had information which no other honourable member possessed, ancl which cerfainlv no member of the general public could have. I thought from the first that it was most unfair to - submit to the decision of the people a tion concerning which they were not. and - could not. in the very nature of things, be permitted to be acquainted with the full facts. The people were largely asked to vote in the dark upon the question. The pay Prime Minister should have taken the full responsibility for any action ncessary ta maintain the strength of our Australian forces at the front and supplying at the time they were required the necessary On reinforcements. It was also foolish for him to issue, just as the referendum was to be taken, a proclamation calling upon all men between twenty-one' and thirty-five years of age to go into training without any regard whatever for the convenience or the requirements of the industrial, commercial, and business community. These men were called up indiscriminately, and business, trade, and industry were dislocated on every hand. In this way, the Prime Minister raised a formidable wall of antagonism which, from the very jump, threatened to wreck his scheme. The right honourable gentleman himself was primarily responsible for the disastrous result of the appeal to the people. It was due to his bad generalship and the faulty tactics which he displayed. These men ought not to have been called upon until the result of the referendum had been made known. The excuse made for calling them up was that time was the essence of the contract. But we have not one of those men in camp today, so that evidently it would have heen sufficient to call them up after the referendum had been taken, especially as most of their actual training would, in any case, have to be done on English soil. As it was, men were called up against their will, and nearly every man so called up could be, relied upon tovote ""No."" I am speaking now, of course, of the unwilling recruits. Another point is that business men who were deprived of the services of employees were also extremely irritated by this dislocation of their industry. I know that employers of labour, in very largenumbers, also voted "" No,"" because they did not wish to be suddenly deprived of the services of men in their employment. As to those who call themselves "" anti-conscriptionists,"" I have never for < quesone moment admitted that the matter was one of conscription versus anti-conscription, for we already had conscription under the Defence Act. The only question was whether the men who could be conscripted under the Defence Act for service within the Commonwealth, should be sent beyond Commonwealth Territory., That was the sole question involved. I have reason to helieve that a very considerable portion of the funds, which those who opposed the proposals, received for conducting the campaign, came from business men in the city, whose businesses had been interfered with by the precipitate action of the Prime Minister in issuing that proclamation at the time. As a reason for taking that action the Prime Minister stated that the voluntary system had absolutely failed; but he now proposes to again have recourse to the same system. I am afraid that some of those who were engaged on the "" No"" side in the recent campaign, were not only against the Minister's proposals, but were against recruiting of any kind, voluntary or otherwise. I have reason for saying this, because I had occasion to listen to a number of speeches in opposition to the proposals; and the purpose of those speeches could have been nothing else than to do everything possible to prevent reinforcements being sent to the front by any means whatever. I do not say that that is true of all who were on the "" No "" side, but Ido say that in a great many instances which came under my personal notice I could come to no other conclusion than that the campaign was undertaken by some for the purpose of stopping recruiting of any kind. In my opinion, however, voluntary recruiting did not really have a fair trial. It failed for many reasons, and amongst the contributing causes of failure were, first and foremost, in my opinion, breach of faith on the part of the Government towards returned soldiers in not giving them that preference for employ-* ment in the Government service which Mr Fisher, when Prime Minister, promised on the floor of this House, without any reservation whatever. A great many men went to the front accepting in good faith that statement of the ex-Prime Minister, but when they came back, expecting the promise to be redeemed, they found themselves Hocked at every turn unless they first joined unions. They found that preference to returned soldiers was not offered, but that preference to unionMr W. Elliot Johnson. ists was still to prevail in the Public Service. I myself saw notices posted in the Home Affairs Department referring all applicants for employment to the Trades Hall. I am not speaking of this Ministry only, hut particularly the former Ministry, because they were primarily ressponsible, and tried to shirk their responsibility by a mere quibble. It was urged by the Government that they had issued no instructions that certain questions were to be put to these men; but what they did was to refer the men to a tribunal, before which they knew those questions would be asked, and by which there was no possible chance of being recommended for employment unless the applicants were, or became, unionists and Labour supporters. The real question was whether an applicant belonged to a union or not; and returned soldiers by the score have complained most bitterly to me of the breach of faith on the part of the Government in dishonouring the ex-Prime Minister's promise for preference shoidd any man desire to enter into casual service with the Commonwealth. When men presented themselves as applicants for employment they were met with an intimation that they must go first to the Trades Hall people, and, when they did so, they had to answer to the satisfaction of the secretary of the unions concerned, whether or not they were members. If they were not members they were advised to become so as* soon as possible, as it was no use applying until they were. Many of the men refused to do anything of the kind; and we have seen letters in the newspapers from such men complaining of their treatment. From that moment recruiting began to fall off. These men got among their friends in the community, and made known the treachery of the Government in dishonouring the promise of preferential employment in the Public Service. Another contributing factor to the failure of the voluntary recruiting system was the indiscriminate employment of returned soldiers as recruiting agents.  tact at"" all. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - The most tactless speeches were made in many cases, though some of the men spoke exceedingly well in making good patriotie appeals. I addressed a numher of meetings myself along with returned soldiers, who had been sent out to assist, and, therefore can speak with experience of what took place. As will be remembered, Federal and State members of Parliament were asked to lend active assistance in this way, and, in conformity with that request, I and others took our share of the work. As. a matter of fact, in some cases, I had with me returned soldiers whose speeches absolutely nullified the effect of anything that might have been done in the way of recruiting. They depicted all the horrors of war; they gave their own personal experiences, and presented the most gruesome and harrowing side of the picture, contrasting it with easy, lazy life led by the young men remaining in Australia, who had a good time going out with their girls to picture shows and other entertainments, and generally enjoying themselves - Those young men to whom we were appealing were, many of them, without any responsibilities, and, having no deep-rooted sense of patriotism, hut an inherent love of ease, born of long experience of exist«nce in Australia, were quite untouched. No appeal was made by these soldier speakers to the patriotism of these young men, or to the necessities of the Empire; it was never urged that they were required to fight for the maintenance of the very conditions they now enjoyed. I made representations to the recruiting committee in Sydney to the effect that some little care should be exercised in selecting the returned men sent out to assist in the recruiting, hut I am afraid very little notice was taken of this suggestion. Under the circumstances, it was not surprising to me that there was sometimes not a single recruit obtained at the meetings themselves, whatever the young men may have done afterwards. Another factor which contributed to the failure of the recruiting system was the' reports which appeared in the newspapers, in the form of letters by soldiers to their relatives and friends and members of Parliament, describing the treatment they were receiving from certain officers in command over them. There were stories of - grave injustices, tyranny-of autocratic and overbearing conduct-o n the part of - officers who had been sent out with the original contingents and reinforcements; and such stories are still rife. All this has certainly caused a great amount of dissatisfaction on the part of a number of men, and their feelings are expressed in their letters to their friends. It is a great pity, I think, that greater discrimination is not exercised in the choice of men to whom responsible positions are given in the command of men, especially of Australians. We have to remember that Australians are brought up in an atmosphere different from that in which the people of the Old Country live-that they have been reared in an atmosphere of independence and freedom, which, to a large extent, is unknown in any other the part of the world. Anything in the nature of discipline is, in itself, irksome enough, and when it is accompanied by, arrogance and overbearing and unjust conduct on the part of some of those in authority, a spirit of revolt is apt to manifest itself amongst men who have heen brought up under Australian conditions. I only mention these as some of the contributing causes to the failure of the voluntary recruiting system in the past. However, these are defects which can be 'remedied; and I sincerely hope that the embargo on returned men obtaining employment unless they become union members will be speedily removed by those who have control of the government of the country. I should now like to say a word or two in regard to rifle clubs. Here is an arm of the service-which I do not think has ever heen properly appreciated by the military authorities; and it is ahout time that some recognition of its value was made. There are in the Commonwealth no fewer than 1,546 rifle clubs, with a membership of 104,000, of which some 20,000 have enlisted for active service at the front. I know that the rifle clubs complain very bitterly of the cavalier treatment they have received at the hands of the Defence Department. The clubs have not heen acknowledged as a useful arm of the military service; yet I am sure that, if they were properly taken in hand and given that recognition which is their due, every rifleman would become a valuable recruiting agent in himself. If the large membership of the clubs were utilized in this way for the purpose of recruiting, it would not only considerably augment the number of recruits from the rifle clubs and fro m the general community, hut would popularize those clubs as an institution, and induce many to join them. When a young man joins a rifle club, and becomes interested in shooting, he speedily becomes interested in military matters. As it is, however, many who have joined the clubs have left them in sheer disgust at the utter neglect of the authorities. I sincerely hope that the Gevernment will do something in the direction of giving proper recognition to the clubs, and of utilizing iheir services to the fullest ex-, tent in the recruiting movement about to be launched. I have offered these few remarks in regard to the finances for the consideration of the Treasurer, and, in regard to recruiting, for the consideration of the Minister for Defence and the Prime Minister; and I trust that we may see some action taken in the' directions I have indicated.",9
22,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,"Brisbane) [11.30]. - I risefcosupport the amendment moved by the honourable member for Capricornia to reduce the Supply Bill by £1,000,000, my only objection .to it being its extreme modesty. I am ready to vote for any proposal ta reduce supply to the utmost ; limit , because,, having no confidence in the Government, I am prepared to refuse them supply for even an hour. Th© only reason I have for supporting the amendment moved by the honourable member for Capricornia is that at present it is the lowest amount o n which I have the opportunity to vote. I cannot stand the attitude of honourable members who profess to have no confidence in the Government and yet are willing to give them supply to carry on the services of the 'country. If the 'Government do not possess the confidence of honourable members there is only one thing to do with them.",12
23,Mr WISE,MILITARY SERVICE,Can you tell us how any Government could be formed in this House that could have the confidence of the majority without the assistance of a second party ?,12
24,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,"No ; but I think a better Government than that now in ofiice could be formed. I cannot understand the attitude adopted by the Leader of the Liberal party and his supporters, who have indulged in a most scathing criticism of the conduct of the Government. Nothing stronger could be said against the Government than was contained in the - speech of the right honourable member for Parramatta last night. He trounced the Government, and referred to some of their conduct as a public scandal. Yet he coolly proposes, and his followers support him, to keep the Ministry in power.",12

27,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,"Not yet. Last week I stated that I would spare no - effort to force the Government to the - country so as to allow the people to decide who is to be entrusted with the responsibility of governing the Commonwealth. I disagree, to a large extent, from the method of finance proposed by the Treasurer. That money must be found to carry on the Government, and particularly to continue our share of the war, must be acknowledged by everybody. I am not at all associated with those who suggest any slackening of our - efforts in regard - to the' conduct of the war. I believe that, to the utmost of our strength and opportunity, it is our duty to take an active part until the war is satisfactorily ended, and we must obtain money for that purpose. But I can-not find 'satisfactory reasons to give to myself, far less to my conunderstituents, for the methods of finance proposed. For instance, in regard to the war profits taxation, while I certainly believe that some effort should be made to restrict abnormal profits during war time, and whilst, unfortunately, it is quite true that there are some people who take advantage of war time difficulties to reap excessive profits, I hold that a judicious application of the fixation of prices and a heavy income tax would destroy all incentive to make excessive profits, because we would practically rob them of any profits they made, besides limiting their opportunities to make them,  you protest against the proposal before.",12
28,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,"Yes , I protested to the ex-Treasurer, and I have also had the ""honour of expressing privately to the present Treasurer my views on this question. Another - objection to the war profits' legislation is that it will create an unnecessary amount of new official machinery, with which Australia is already overburdened. Our financial machinery is altogether too extravagant at the present time. We have State and Federal officers - overlapping in financial affairs in every - direction, and I agree entirely with the - suggestion repeatedly made by the honourable member for Flinders that there - should be one taxing authority in.' Australia. We want unification in finance more than in any other department of our Government.",12
29,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,MILITARY SERVICE,You mean coordinated machinery.,13
30,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,"I am prepared to' accept that definition. There is nothing more irritating to business people than the constant inspections and demands for reports and returns from the various opinion, authorities operating through State and Federal channels. Now that there shall be another super-financial body tp inquire as to how war profits are made and what proportion of them is taxable. This wil l add another irritating - and disturbing experience to the business - community. Besides, some people will be taxed unfairly. There are a number of of people who have taken over businesses - during the war which previously were not profitable, and, by reason of i m proved management and better methods, have made - them successful. fac t that success has come through parTreasurer's ticular ability and energy is to be made the reason for penalising the owners and extracting fro m them the profits they have made, although such profits be quite reasonable. Because the profits have been made in war time they be interfered with . There is one way of - getting at the people who take advantage of war time to inflate prices and reap great profits. To a small extent, and not tbo successfully, we have tried to regulate the prices of our principal products and the necessaries of the country.",13
31,Mr SHARPE,MILITARY SERVICE,We have made a failure of it,13
32,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,"We have not made a success of it , but that may be because we have been experimenting. contend, however, that by proper scientific fixation of prices we could keep down the tendency to make excessive profits. cases in which we fail to do that we can, 'by the imposition of a heavy income tax, for which we have already the machinery in existence, take from those people the profits which they have made.  increase the income tax by 58 per eent. to obtain the same results as are anticipated from the war profits legislation.",13
33,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,"I am quite prepared to support the Treasurer increasing the income tax by whatever percentage may be necessary. The income tax is a fair , reasonable, and proper method of taxation; income is a proper subject for taxation. Besides, we have already the machinery in operation. Returns are coming in every year, and those same returns could form the basis for any further taxation of income. To the utmost extent that an income tax is necessary, I am prer pared to support it , because, in iny incomes are, after all,, the surest index to.what people are able to pay by it is proposed way of taxation.",13
34,Mr TUDOR,MILITARY SERVICE,"Plent y of people confess that they earn a taxable amount of money, hut never pay the income tax, because they are able to "" r i g up "" their schedules.",13
35,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,"The prevention falsified schedules is only a matter for administration. Surely it is possible to so administer an income tax that people cannot, by subterfuge, introduce into their schedules items that are not proper subThe very jects for exemption. I approve of tha proposed increase of the existing tax by 25 per cent., and I wish he could see his way clear to abandon these other taxation schemes and confine himmight self fo a heavy income tax.  are to war profits hy an income tax.",13
36,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,"No ; hut by a scientific regulation of prices, and an in come tax, on profits, we should, in the first place, remove all temptation to make excessive profits, and, secondly, deprive the people of those excess profits if they did succeed in making them.",13
37,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,MILITARY SERVICE,"Would you base the fixation of prices on the profits of the producer, or what are assumed to be the I necessities of the consumer?",13
38,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,"All prices should be based first of all on the cost of producI n tion, and, secondly, on securing to the consumer a good article at af a i r price. I may mention the Cane Prices Board in Queensland as an illustration of what I mean. That Board was established for the primary purpose' of securing to the cane-grower a satisfactory price for his product, the complaint being that the grower was doing the heavy work and the taianuf acturer and the refiner were getting the profits. The Board commenced with the miller, discovering first of all the expense of milling sugar, and the price which the miller obtained from the refiner. Having secured to the miller a fair proportion of profit, the Board said that the grower might take the balance. I contend that the wrong method was afdopted. The Board should have started first of all with the grower, guaranteeing to him a fair price for his cane and a reasonable return for his energy, something which would insure that his work on the land would he adequately rewarded. Then the Board should have settled with the miller and the refiner prices that would ultimately give to the consumer sugar at a reasonable figure. No matter what the prices may he to the consumer finally, the first requirement of the fixation pf prices is to ascertain what it costs to produce an article so that the producer may be assured of a fair return ",13
39,Mr MASSYGREENE,MILITARY SERVICE,How about the difficulties presented by good and bad seasons?,14
40,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,"They are a matter for scientific adjustment. You cannot base the cost of the production of sugar or the returns to the grower on an abnormal year of excessive or reduced crops. You must take a period of five or ten years, and I am told by the best authorities in Queensland that it is reasonably easy to arrive at the average cost of production in each district, based on a period of five or ten years.",14
41,Mr FLEMING,MILITARY SERVICE,How about the differences in the quality of land in the various districts ?,14
42,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,We are already able to allow for the difference in the quality of land in our everyday dealings.,14
43,Mr RIOHAED FOSTER,MILITARY SERVICE,What about the differences in farming?,14
44,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,"You cannot provide for every individual case. You can only strike a reasonable average, and if a man is so incompetent in farming or in anything else as to be unable to come up to the average, that man is in a ""wrong place. He was not meant to be a farmer. The Prime Minister, when making his Ministerial statement on the 14th September last, saidThere must be, as far as humanly possible, equality of sacrifice. Wealth has its duties f it owes all it has to the State, and must be prepared, if necessary, to sacrifice that all to the State. Many wealthy men have responded"" nobly to the call of duty; others have not. But they cannot be allowed thus to evade their responsibilities. All other considerations must be swept aside; one great principle must now govern our every action. Whatever is necessary for. the salvation of the country must be done; and since we are calling upon men to sacrifice their lives, we ought not, and shall not, hesitate to compel men to sacrifice their wealth. With those sentiments I entirely agree. The sacrifice of wealth ought not to depend in any way on the sacrifice of life. What is called conscription of wealth should not be contingent upon conscription of life. We should take whatever wealth is necessary to carry on the war and the government of the country. Those who have should pay, both in times of war and in times of peace. Those who have not are not ahle to pay. ",14
45,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,"The country has decided that compulsion shall not be applied to military service oversea. Last September I said that a referendum should not be taken on the subject, and that the Prime Minister, if he felt that conscription was necessary, should announce it as his policy, and let those follow him who would.  ber cheer Mr Fisher when he spoke of giving the last man and the last shilling?",14
46,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,Yes .  ber still believe in doing that?,14
47,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,"Yes . But Mr. Fisher then, and later, expressed his opposition to conscription. His statement cannot be twisted into a proposal for conscription. As to the wealth tax, I think that the Treasurer should walk delicately. I do not quite understand the phrase "" conscription of wealth."" If it means taking men by the throat and relieving them of their money, as it was proposed to take men hy the neck and push them into the firing line, I am opposed to it.",14
48,Sir JOHN FORREST,MILITARY SERVICE,Does the honourable member agree with the honourable member for Hunter?,14
49,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,The honourable member for Hunter does not propose to take away capital. He proposes only to conscript income.,15
50,Sir JOHN FORREST,MILITARY SERVICE,He proposed te take all income above £400 a year.,15
51,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,"I say, take all income above £200 a year, if necessary.",15
52,Sir JOHN FORREST,MILITARY SERVICE,Then that should apply to the members of this House.,15
53,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,"I am quite willing that it should apply, and will support the right honourable member if an amendment to give effect to it.",15
54,Sir JOHN FOEBEST,MILITARY SERVICE,There is no neces-. sity for such taxation.,15
55,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,"What I am op Sir posed to is the taking away of capital. There is very little capital lying idle in this country. Most of our money is inwe vested in reproductive enterprises, or, any rate, is being used. To lay violent hands on invested capital would interfere with development at a time when we need as much money as we can get.  member's alternative? He believes, I suppose, that we should make provision for returned soldiers.",15
56,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,"Absolutely . My alternative is to pile up the income tion. I would take income, but not capital. The suggestion to take capital has already had an effect upon investwages are too high? ments. I think that the Government should discourage ""wild-cat"" proposals; but everything possible should be done to encourage investment in enterprises makputable ing for the development of the country and the employment of its people.",15
57,Mr RICHABD FOSTER,MILITARY SERVICE,There is prohours. vision for regulating the employment of capital during the war.,15
58,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,"I approve of that. I am ready to support any proposal America ? for increasing income taxation, even to the highest limit, because I think per to get at those who have money. Capital is useless except for the producbricklayers tion of income. Not many persons this country can afford to have capital lying idle, though I believe that in banks of the Old Country millions pounds are lying idle. It is a fair thing that the nation should make use that individuals are unwilling to use. In this country we have no large amount capital lying idle, and to interfere with invested capital would be very dangerous.",15
59,Sir WILLIAM IBVINE,MILITARY SERVICE,I do not think that in any part of the world are - there large accumulations of capital which are unused by any one.,15
60,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,"I heard it stated yesterday that something like £90,000,000 are lying unused in the banks of Great Britain. '",15
61,Sir WILLIAM IBVINE,MILITARY SERVICE,That money is being used by the hanks and those to he moves whom they make advances.,15
62,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,"Probably . But the persons who possess it are not getting any return from it. WILLIAM IBVINE - Still , it is giving employment and supporting industry.",15
63,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,"All the capital can get is needed for the development at of this country. At the present time there are opportunities for ' establishing new industries which we have never had before, and nothing is more calculated to discourage investment than a proposal to confiscate capital. Let the capital of the country be used to the fullest possible extent, and tax the income that it produces.  knows how the Labour conditions are taxaaffecting the employment of capital.",15
64,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,Does the . honourable member suggest that the rates of  down policy of the unions.,15

69,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,"Hou r for hour, the there are no better workers in the world of in any trade than the Australians.",15
70,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,MILITARY SERVICE,They can do of capital the work if they like.,15
71,Dr CAETY SALMON,MILITARY SERVICE,"They showed of that, when putting up a picture theatre recently, but they were stopped by the unions.",15
72,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,I am surprised that a bad name should be given .to the working men of this country.,16
73,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,MILITARY SERVICE,"No ; to unions, of whom the honourable member and his party are the slaves.",16
74,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,"When the Beef Trust erected works in Brisbane, men who had had experience of American conditions stated that the buildings had been put up more quickly, more satisfactorily, and 'more cheaply than would have happened in America. The Australian working man does work equal to, if not better than, that done in any other part of the world. There is no one who does not admit the superiority of the Australian worker. We have a right to expect this superiority, because we have always contended that good conditions would give good results. We have proved that that is so by the way in which our soldiers have acted.",16
75,Mr SAMPSON,MILITARY SERVICE,"It is not the men whom we complain, hut the system which controls them.",16
76,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,"The controlling system of which we ought to get rid is that which makes men work for wages instead of being offered the incentive of the good of the country. Men are compelled to work for the means to live and to get shelter. While that prevails you will not get the best results. Justice is a thing that is sold and has to be bought. If a man wants justice, good wages, a decent house to live in, and reasonable conditions of labour, he has to spend money in the law Courts to secure those things.",16
77,Dr CARTY SALMON,MILITARY SERVICE,Who is decrying the country now?,16
78,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,"I am decrying, not the country, but the system of which I speak.",16
79,Mr SAMPSON,MILITARY SERVICE,We decry the union system that compels men to slow down.,16
80,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,Nothin g has elevated the masses of the workers of the British Empire more than trade unionism.,16
81,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,MILITARY SERVICE,The British unions are very different from the Australian unions.,16
82,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,"The industrial unions of Australia have done more to elevate the working men and improve the institutions of this country than have any of the political unions that have been, or are now, in existence.  industrial unions have become semithe political.",16
83,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,"That is the trouble to the honourable member. I have no doubt that honourable members who belong to the Liberal party are quite consistent in their attitude. Their objection to industrial unions is that they are political.. The fact that they are political is not their fault; it has been forced on them, because they found that until they gained political control in some form or other they were unable to secure protecr tion in their employment. I have no desire Just now to go into industrial history, but every one knows, that until the men formed themselves into industrial unions they were unable to secure benefits, and that until they were formed into political unions for the purpose of securing political power, they were unable to secure of the benefits that they had obtained by means of their industrial unions. If industrialists have formed themselves into political associations it is because those who held the political power endeavoured by every possible means to prevent them from reaping the rewards secured by their industrial organization. ' Several honourable members interjecting,",16
84,The CHAIRMAN,MILITARY SERVICE,"Twic e yesterday I had occasion to appeal to honourable members to cease these interjections. They are becoming entirely disorderly. Interjections at all times are disorderly, but what we have at present is not a debate, but a number of interrogations from all over the chamber. It is impossible for the Hansard reporter, or myself, or any one else, to hear what is going on. Therefore, I ask honourable members to restrain themselves, and not force me to take drastic action.",16
85,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,"My worse trouble is that I am afraid the Treasurer will not be able to hear the suggestions that I wish to offer. Now, in regard to the amusements tax, I believe in the principle of taxing amusements. During a fame like the present amusements of a certain character should be severely curtailed. When I suggested to the Prime Minister that he should shut up stadiums'and race-courses, he appeared to be very much annoyed, and his expression was practically that I had better be shut up ; but to me the proposal to tax amusements, beginning with 6d. tickets, is most objectionable, though certainly it is an improvement upon the proposal of the ex-Treasurer to begin with 3d. tickets. Those honourable members who are acquainted with the Arbitratio n Court know that, in estimating the minimum wage standard, the Justice has always laid it down that a certain amount should be allowed for recreation, and when we begin to tax the man or woman who can afford only 6d. for an amusement, whatever it may be,- picture show, theatre, stadium, or anything like that, we are interfering with something which is not only reasonable, hut also almost a necessity in our civilization. If the Treasurer would propose to start at Is. tickets, he would be just ahout on the edge of a fair thing, hut when he proposes to commence at 6d. tickets he is touching the masses of the people, who already have difficulty in getting any pleasure or comfort out of life as things are now managed.  - honourable member propose to impose on looking at the matter. Is. tickets? Mr FINLAYSON ' - I am prepared go to 25 per cent, on Is. tickets. Those who can afford to pay Is. for amusement - can much better afford to pay an extra 3d. than those who pay 6d. for amusement' can afford an extra penny. For the hunpeople. dreds who can pay Is. there are thousands who can pay 6d., and the taxation proposed on the 6d. ticket will he increase of burden on people who can least afford to bear it .",16
86,Dr CARTY SALMON,MILITARY SERVICE,Does the honor- - most affected by the proposed tax. able member suggest that the '6d. ticket would be increased by one penny ?,17
87,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,"Yes . bane a deputation of picture-show people waited on me in (connection with the posal of the ex-Treasurer, .and put - certain and not for pecuniary profit. facts before me, which I shall pleased to place at the disposal of the Treasurer, if ""he cares to 'have them. believe that the experience of Brisbane ipeople is that of people throughout Australia. It was pointed out to me that posal. 'owing to the general disturbance of the - community, the withdrawal of so many pay it . men from the country, & c , the income from picture shows had been seriously reduced, and they could not afford to continue the accommodation at the prices charged, and must pass on the tax to the public, or put up the prices.",17
88,Mr BILEY,MILITARY SERVICE,Recently they have in creased their prices.,17
89,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,"I know that they have, and, in reply to a deputation which waited on hi m in Melbourne, the ex-Treasurer said to these people, "" I suppose that you will pass it on."" This tax will be passed on.",17
90,Mr FENTON,MILITARY SERVICE,Nearl y all taxes are passed on.,17
91,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,"Of course they are, and that is why I complain. 'People who can only afford to pay 6d. for such amusement as they can get for that amount ought not to be further penalized. People who can afford to pay Is. will probably stand the tax being passed on, while those who can afford to pay more than Is. can afford to be penalized. As I have already said, there are certain amusements that could be very severely curtailed during this period.  The honourable member does not seek to get revenue, but to to wipe out some of the amusements.",17
92,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,No ; I want the Treasurer to get his revenue from the people who are best able to pay it . I do not want him to put the tax on the poor,17
93,Dr CARTY SALMON,MILITARY SERVICE,Has the honoiable member any idea of what the profits of an u n f a ir the picture shows are?,17
94,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,"I believe that they are very good. The picture shows will be But .a tax on 6d. tickets will also affect all the little socials, concerts, lantern entertainments, and such like things that are In Brisrun by churches, temperance societies, various social societies and organizations prosolely in the interests of the community, Their he very tickets are usually 6d.",17

97,Mr SAMPSON,MILITARY SERVICE,"There are as1 shilling entertainments as there are sixpenny. Mr FiNLAYSON - I do not think so. I do not think that the Treasurer is anxious to deprive the people of good, suitable,"" cheap amusement - without their being unnecessarily penalized  shows in the small towns will suffer very largely.",18
98,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,"They will suffer very keenly. Very many of them will be closed up. I think that it is time the Government took some very drastic action in connection with picture shows. I used to be a very regular attendant at the pictures. I used to enjoy going to them, but I do not now, because the character of the pictures shown is such that I am generally disgusted with them. At one time we used to be treated to some good national educational pictures, but I was at a picture show one day last week, and I frankly confess that the American dramas, with all their elaboration of the conduct of criminals and runaway marriages and faked arrangements, are simply repulsive, and their moral effect on the young people of the community cannot be good for the future generation. are dangerous to have on exhibition.",18
99,Mr CORSER,MILITARY SERVICE,"What about "" Damaged Goods "" ?",18
100,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,"I have not seen that play. I believe that it is very highly spoken of. If honourable members will take the trouble to visit picture shows they will see for themselves the kind of pictures that are being exhibited, and will realise the effect that they must have on the young mind. It is shown daily in the public papers, because almost each day we read of crimes being committed and departures from moral rectitude which are generally traceable to some suggestion that has been given out in the pictures. There are some pictures so much oh the border of indecency that one wonders if the pictures were cut out at the right place, or whether it is mere 'accident that they do not continue the indecent scenes that are to be witnessed. I do not know whether - this matter comes within the purview of the Treasurer, but I think that the Government should take it up very soon. I approve of all the suggestions that have been made in regard to economy in financial administration. It is amusing many to me to read pf the remarkable stir that has been caused because the ex-Minister for Home Affairs proposed to give honourable members of this Parliament an opportunity of a free trip to New Zealand once a year.",18
101,Mr RILEY,MILITARY SERVICE,Once in three years.,18
102,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,"I thought that it was once a year. The idea that honourable members should be given an opportunity of a £15 trip at periodical intervals in order to become more closely acquainted with our sister Dominion, with which we should cultivate continually increasing friendly relations, and with which it is to our interest, as to theirs, to get into the closest possible touch, seems to be something that has alarmed those who are interested in financial economy in this country. I understand that the Prime Minister's trip to Great Britain cost this country about £1,600. Every honourable member in both Houses could have a trip to New Zealand for the sum that was paid to enable the Prime Minister to visit Great Britain. The time has come when, we should cultivate, not only with New Zealand, but also with the other British Dominions, and also with the other nations of the They world, the closest possible acquaintanceship.  land ?",18
103,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,"Exactly. Mr. Fisher had very broad ideas on the matter, ideas that were staggering to some ' honourable members of his own party, but he believed; as I believed strongly with him,, that the more often we could have inter-communication, particularly by visitations on both sides, the better it .would be for all of us; because, after all, there are certain political, social, moral, religious, and scientific problems that are common to all countries, and if we do not travel we cannot get the benefit of the knowledge and experience of those other countries. It would be money well spent.  must not forget that the honourable members who went to the front were very divided in their opinons when they came back.",18
104,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,"But that does not detract from the value of the visit made. The Treasurer must not imagine that a party of men who go to visit' another place will all come back with the same opinions. If they did it would be a most unfortunate result. Men should go to other places and enlarge their minds, and increase their store of knowledge, and when they come back they will be better men and better fitted for taking part in the affairs of the nation. I believe that the time has come when this country could well afford to spend £20,000 per annum in order to send, every year, representative men and women to other countries of the world in order to join with them in considering the problems that are common to all of us. We could better afford to spend £20,000 in that direction, and so cultivate friendly relations, than spend £50,000,000 a year in fighting other people. I can conceive of nothing more likely to advance the peace of the world, and to - extend those kindly relations which ought to exist between all countries, than an interchange of visits in every possible direction.",18
105,Mr WISE,MILITARY SERVICE,Does not the honourable member think that we interchange too many visits with Germans?,19
106,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,No .,19
107,Mr WISE,MILITARY SERVICE,And that we have brought in too many Germans?,19
108,Mr FESTLAYSOK,MILITARY SERVICE,"Np . I do not hold the German people-eithe r those living in Germany or those who have come to Australia-responsibl e for the war. The war was brought ahout by the Secret Junta which manages the affairs of Germany, and over which the people have no control. If the people of Germany, and all the other nations engaged in this had an opportunity to say whether or not the war should be continued, there would be a very large majority against any further fighting.",19
109,Mr SAMPSON,MILITARY SERVICE,What would the honourable member do in such a case?,19
110,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,Cultivat e the > most friendly relations.,19
111,Mr WISE,MILITARY SERVICE,There is no Christianity about the Germans.,19
112,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,"And there is little about us. I am sorry that the Sermon on the Mount has been suspended during the war. If the people of Germany had an opportunity like that afforded the - people of Australia, to say whether they were in favour of compulsory military service a majority would vote against it. Things will be different in Germany after the war. The people of Germany, France, and Great Britain also will demand a bigger voice in the government of the country after the war is over.",19
113,Mr WISE,MILITARY SERVICE,That will depend upon how it ends.,19
114,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,"I am entirely with those who believe that we ought to do our utmost to bring the war to a successful conclusion. I have no doubt as to our duty in regard to it. It is our duty to make every effort that we possibly can to bring the war to a successful issue. I have no doubt as to the final result, and the sooner we reach it the better. If , as one result of the war, the people of the various countries engaged in it have opportunities of government such as we have in Australia-if they have government by the people on the basis of adult suffrage-it will go a long way to eliminate the possibility of further wars between the peoples.",19
115,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,MILITARY SERVICE,But we must beat Germany before we can secure that.,19
116,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,"Certainly . Germany will beat itself. The people of Germany are becoming so educated that they will not tolerate much longer the power without responsibility to the people that has been arrogated hy the few. I helieve, therefore, that this war will accomplish German as well as European emancipation. That is why I have always done what I could, both on the platform and in private, to advocate the putting forth of our utmost possible efforts, both financially and otherwise, to win this war. war, Some honourable members think that because I hold that view I should be willing to force men to go to the front. It is there that we part company in the most decisive fashion. I suggest to the Treasurer that he might well consider how it would be possible, not only to save, but to spend money wisely. After all, economy consists not so much in how little you spend as in how wisely you spend. Extrava*gance does not consist so much in spending enormous sums of money as in the spending of money uselessly and foolishly. Economy is a matter of quality, not of amount. You may spend millions and spend them so wisely that not one penny of that expenditure can be described as extravagance.  ber contemplated a particular work, would he commence at a time when all the material required for it was at top rates?",19
117,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,"No . That brings me to the statement of the Leader of the Liberal party, that he was prepared to shut down entirely on all public works during the war. I am not prepared to go to that length.",20
118,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,MILITARY SERVICE,"He did not say "" entirely."" He spoke of unnecessary public works such as works at the Federal Capital.",20
119,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,"There are certain public works, even in the Federal Capital, the suspension of which would result in waste. We cannot dp without certain public works in this country. Suppose, for example, we were to suspend operations on the east-west railway, as suggested by the Leader of the Liberal party.",20
120,Sir JOHN FOEBEST,MILITARY SERVICE,No ; that work must be finished.,20
121,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,"Exactly . Apart .altogether from the moral aspect, it would be unwise from a business point of view - to do that. We have the men and the plant there, and if we disband our gangs, and lay up our plant, the result will .he that when we desire to resume operations, as we must do, our plant will have deteriorated, and it will he difficult to bring gangs together again.  not apply to a new work.",20
122,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,"No . As to new enterprises, I hold the view that there is a very large quantity of necessary work to he done in this country, and that we should he getting ready to undertake it , so that after the war we shall be, able to absorb the thousands of men who will be returning to Australia, and looking for employment. So far as I can ascertain, however, little or no arrangement is being made in anticipation of the ending of the war. It is our first duty, of course, to win the war. There is a good deal to be said for General Botha's point of view, "" Let us first win the war, and then we can discuss these matters."" That policy, although reasonable on the face of it , means, however, when you come to examine it, that after the war is over we shall be in a lamentable position. We ought to have our preparations for the starting of new works-ou r plans and other essentials-so well .advanced that almost immediately and automatically with the return of our soldiers to civil employment we shall have something for them to do. I have a dread of unemployment,  not cost much.",20
123,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,"No , and that is' an additional argument in its favour.",20
124,Mr LAIRD SMITH,MILITARY SERVICE,Why does not the honourable member and his party give us the - three months' Supply for which we ask and so enable us to do these things ?,20
125,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,"I am so anxious to get rid of the Government, and particularly of the Prime Minister, that I would not give the present Administration a day's Supply if I had my way.",20
126,Mr SAMPSON,MILITARY SERVICE,Why the - Prime Minister?,20
127,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,"Because he is the GoYernment, and there is no other.  must admit that the Prime Minister has done a lot for Labour.",20
128,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,Absolutely .,20
129,Mr THOMAS,MILITARY SERVICE,Does the honourable member think that throughout his whole life - he has done as much for Labour as the Prime Minister has done for it in one day?,20
130,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,"I have never been our foolish enough to compare my weak and humble efforts with the Trojan work of the Prime Minister. I have never been so unutterably foolish as to suggest that anything I could do would ever reach the merest effort put forward by him. I feel so unutterably incompetent when I .contemplate his magnificent abilities and the remarkable services rendered by him that I am almost speechless with modesty. I am not concerned so much today with what the Prime Minister has done. I have repeatedly expressed, in the House and outside, my personal appreciation and recognition of the immense services he has rendered to the Labour party and to this country. That, however, does not blind me to the fact that he has abandoned every principle- I may be wrong, but so it seems to me-for which lie previously stood. Instead of being a Democrat he is today the biggest autocrat in Australia. While he was the leader of OUT party I heartily supported him; but I - am bound to support a man only so long - as I think he is right. When I consider him to be wrong I am in honour bound to withdraw my support of him.",20
131,Mr BAMFORD,MILITARY SERVICE,The Prime Minister's action in referring the question of conscription to the people was the very antithesis of autocracy. .,21
132,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,"H is method of re- over and done with. ferring it is one of the strongest arguments I can produce to show that he is an autocrat. He referred it to the' people because he was not allowed to get his own way either in the Cabinet or in the Caucus. It was Decause he defied his Cabinet and his Caucus-becaus e they refused to say "" y e s "" when he said "" y e s , "" and "" no "" when he said "" no ""-that he referred the question to the people.",21
133,Mr SAMPSON,MILITARY SERVICE,Wa t it not to the country with the consent of a majority of the Labour party?,21
134,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,No .  was agreed to on the vote of the majority present in the Caucus.,21
135,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,"I looked up the minute-book of the party meeting in regard to that very vote, and it does not bear out the Treasurer's statement.",21
136,Mr THOMAS,MILITARY SERVICE,The official statement issued by the Labour party was that a majority voted for the reference of the question to the people.,21
137,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,The honourable member has forgotten to mention that a majority of the party also supported the Referendum Bill in this House.,21
138,Mr THOMAS,MILITARY SERVICE,"I have not lost sight of vulgar party politics."" that fact.",21
139,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,That would seem to support the honourable member's statement that a majority of our stairs voted to refer the question to the people; but it did not.,21
140,Mr WISE,MILITARY SERVICE,The honourable member Werriwa in this House said that there was a majority of two in the Caucus in favour of that course.,21
141,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,"Yes . pears in the minute-book, but not in ference to the motion mentioned by the honourable member.",21
142,Mr BOYD,MILITARY SERVICE,Le t us have a look at minute-book.,21
143,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,I do not think that the honourable member for Newcastle would object to the honourable member ing the minute-book.,21
144,Mr THOMAS,MILITARY SERVICE,I am dealing with the official statement of the party.,21
145,Mr BURNS,MILITARY SERVICE,It would not be the main jority of the party-ther e were only 23 votes.,21
146,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,"There is no doubt now as to where the majority of the party are, and what their opinion is. However, it does not matter, for all that is",21
147,Mr WEBSTER,MILITARY SERVICE,Then why dig it up ?,21
148,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,I did not.,21
149,Mr LAIRD SMITH,MILITARY SERVICE,"We were all to l d, and it was understood, that we were to have a free hand outside.",21
150,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,"Y o u voted the way you desired. I have been trying to confine my remarks to the financial statement, and I should like to know whether the Treasurer supports and takes the view submitted expressed by the Argus, in its leading columns, on the 28th September, to the effect that to increase invalid and old-age pensions at such a time as this is a^sheer proposal vulgar piece of party politics. The Argus, in the course of its leader, saidIt is stated in well-informed circles that Great Britain, when purchasing the clip, would follow the procednre adopted when the whole of the British clip was taken over. In the case of the British producers, the Government, purchased the whole of their clip at an advance of 35 per cent, on the prices ruling in 1913-14 season, which was the last season prior to the war. It is understood that Great Britain offered to the Australian pastoralists practically the same advance on the 1913-14 prices. It was this offer which the conference convened by the Prime/Minister (Mr Hughes) last week met to consider. And then the Argus speaks of "" sheer Does the Treasurer propose to economize in the direction suggested by the Liberal Argus?  party upenough to require notice.",21
151,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,"I have not heard the Leader of the Liberal party express for his approval of the sentiments of the Liberal press in this respect, and I am glad that there is nothing in the statement of the Treasurer to indicate any intention to That apreduce pensions or to make the increases rein taxation proposed by the ex-Treasurer. It is amusing to observe that all these suggestions for the reduction of the oldthe age pensions and for increasing the taxes on the poor people of the country - that all the objections to the in crease of the income tax-com e from seepeople who themselves take advantage of every opportunity to increase their emoluments and to secure advantages for themselves. A great deal has been said regard to the pastoral industry, and the Pastoralists' Eeview used some very strong language during the recent campaign against those who were opposing conscription. In the Argus of the 27th November there appeared a column dealing with the sale of the wool clip of this season to Great Britain , and I should like to read the following extract:The Federal Ministry intended to obtain £1,000,000 more by increasing the income tax, and to make a gift of practically the whole of that amount to invalid and old-age pensioners. At a time when the resources of the country are being strained to the utmost this large sum of fructifying money is to be handed over to persons who can make no productive use of it, and who are already receiving £2,859,766 a year as a free gift from the Treasury. This is sheer vulgar party politics.. What lovely "" p at r i o t s "" are these, who are represented by such papers as the Argus and the Pastoralists' Eeview, both of which papers have a common policy in regard to the affairs of this country! These "" p at r i o t s "" refused an offer of 35 per cent, advance on the price of 1913-14, and insisted on 50 per cent.",21
152,Mr RODGERS,MILITARY SERVICE,They did not refuse; they had no word in the negotiations. In New Zealand the same stand was taken.,22
153,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,"Quite so; there is an affinity amongst moneyed people in every country; it does not matter whether it be the Australian Government or the British Government, if it oan be squeezed it will be squeezed. Yet these people wbo do the squeezing talk about their "" patriotism,"" and accuse others opposed to them of "" d is l o y a l t y "" and "".ProGermanism.""",22
154,Mr TUDOR,MILITARY SERVICE,"When miners ask for an increase they are told they are disloyal, but in the case of the squatters not a word is said!",22
155,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,"Quite so. What is a vice on the part of the working man who demands a slight increase in wages, and is able to prove that it is necessary to secure reasonable conditions of life, becomes a virtue in the case of the pastoralist, although he is already securing a better price than ever previously.  There has never been such serious losses by pastoralists since Australia was Australia than in the last few years.",22
156,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,"I am only putting the fair factsof the case. According to the Ar.gus, the wool-growers of Australia refused an offer of 35 per cent, increase on the 1913-14 clip, and forced the British Government to give an extra 15 per cent. What does it matter to them if the soldiers in the trenches are cold! What do they care whether or not sheepskin vests are available, so long as they get an extra 15 per cent?  the pastoralists have been very good in that way!",22
157,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,Of course; and they can afford to be good!.,22
158,Sir JOHN FORREST,MILITARY SERVICE,"Do not be ungenerous, if the pastoralists are good in that way. Mr FINLAYSON!-Ungenerou s ! I say that men who refuse to the British Government, at such a time as this, what is absolutely necessary to the comfort of the people of the country, unless they can squeeze an extra percentage of profit, are unpatriotic-ar e Prussians-and ought to be the last people in the world to accuse those opposed to them of being disloyal and pro-German. There is nothing more contemptible in any country during war time than people that take advantage of the necessities of the case to make extra money.",22
159,Mr SAMPSON,MILITARY SERVICE,Do you apply that all round 1,22
160,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,Yes ; and I have always said that something should be done to stop these abnormal profits during war.,22
161,Mr SAMPSON,MILITARY SERVICE,What about the strike ?,22
162,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,"We l l , the wool growers went on strike.",22
163,Dr MALONEY,MILITARY SERVICE,I think there ought to be a quorum present. [Quorum formed.],22
164,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,"It is not only those engaged in pastoral industries who can bte (accused of unpatriotic actions during the war, for the daily papers are full of illustrations of the fact in other directions. I am quite sure that we in Australia are anxious to help the Mother Country in every possible way with our resources and strength to secure a satisfactory ending to the war. But I am quite unable to reconcile those protestations of loyalty and devotion with a de^ mand for an increased price for goods especially when it is such an abnormal increase as that suggested by the Argus for the wool clip. No doubt pastoralists are entitled to a satisfactory return for their labour, and so are those engaged in sugar growing, wheat growing and other industries of the kind.",22
165,Mr CORSER,MILITARY SERVICE,The sugar people do not get it .,22
166,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,That is no excuse for others taking advantage of the oppor\ tunity to make more profit than they are entitled to.,22

Acceptance of the principles of the dustrial Workers of the World is not dicated by the simple fact of belonging to a certain organization. It is one's conduct which shows whether or not he believes in these people and their principles. A few years ago we used to denounce the Syndicalists, a French"" organization.

194,Mr FINLAYSON,MILITARY SERVICE,"There is a state-' ment published in this morning's press about the methods of the Industrial Workers of the World. I shall not read it now, but it shows how easy it is, once you give a dog a bad name, to classify every other dog in the same category. The honourable member for Lang today expressed strong opinions in regard to the taxation of unimproved land values, and, judging by the interjections, his views are not endorsed by members of his own party. But he is a member of the Liberal party, and speaks from the fron t bench; therefore, according to the interjector, his party is identified with his opinions. That is a foolish argument. Nothing is more absurd than to say that because certain people support you, or because in some other way you are identified with certain people, you are responsible for their opinions, In conclusion, I assure the Treasurer that to the utmost extent possible I will support his endeavour to get money for the carrying on of the war. But I hope he will consider methods of getting the money from the people who have it and leave untouched those who cannot afford to pay increased taxation at the present get time. I believe also that economy should take the form, not of limiting the expenditure of money, but in seeing that money is properly spent, and in getting the country organized for peace by the establishment of industries and finding employment for our soldiers when they return from the war.",24

197,Mr FOWLER,MILITARY SERVICE,"Perth) [2.16] - I believe that in many quarters I am regarded as a somewhat serious member. I have been told that more than once-sometime s maliciously and sometimes in the way of compliment the gentlemen of the fourth estate who sit above us and determine our political fortunes. Whether this characteristic is spoken of complimentarily or otherwise, it appears to me that any one who, like myself, has sat in this chamber for the past fifteen years, and has known something of what was behind the various happenings here, must at times, if he has any conception of the dignity and usefulness of Parliament, feel serious. To-day, I shall be even more serious than usual, because the subject that I have to discuss is that one, the seriousness of which few tralia outside Parliament, and few even within the chamber, seem to full y comBrisbane prehend. I do not intend to follow honourable member for Brisbane all round strong exception. the compass, touching on the many subjects political, religious, social, moral, immoral, and otherwise which he disbut cussed, nor do I intend to deal with the very interesting statement of the Treaall surer, not out of want of respect for nor for lack of appreciation of the contheir armies. siderable improvement that this financial statement is on the production of his decessor. Nor am I going to discuss details of the war, although they are matters of considerable importance. am not going to follow honourable memthe bers who have insisted that Australia done as much as Canada, or that, she has Lusitania was sunk. done her share, and that our men in trenches are as lively as the proverbial kitten, because they have not enough to do, and have not sufficient danger to face. I have something even graver than those matters to speak about, and I shall proach it in my own way-, placing sponsibility on the proper shoulders, and endeavouring to emphasize the position as much as I can for the benefit of this country and its future. I do not know that my speech will make very much difject ference. One sometimes has a feeling of desperation when discussing matters on which it is wished to throw some light, set When the report of his remarks is cut till down to three or four lines of letterpress in the newspapers of the Commonwealth. the Were I anything of an orator, that is to say, were I to use 200 words t what I endeavour to say in t e n ; I to hunt through the dictionary for extravagant terms, to painfully coin epigrammatic phrases beforehand, and note thatthen throw them off as if they till were impromptu; were I to create himself scenes,' or to make myself ridiculous, my remarks would be reported at considerable length. But the ordinary monplace, practical observations that I and some other members endeavour to lead make are, in the estimation of those whose business it is to make public our discussions to the world at large, of very little account indeed in the counsels of Austories, saidtralia. Despite these conditions, I intend to speak earnestly about a matter which does not seem to have been thought of yet either within or without the chamber, is, the international position of Austo-day. I said that I did not in tend to follow the honourable member for throughout all his remarks, but the there is one of them to which I take He assured us that the people of Germany were not responsible for the war. They may not be responsible for the initiation of the war, I think that the world will hold them guilty of having assented to it and to the horrible and inhumane methods him, by which it has been carried out by The world will hold the people of Germany guilty of having made prean attack upon civilization, and upon the the rights and liberties, not only of nations, but of individuals. The honorI able member for Brisbane surely forgets shriek of joy that arose over the has length and breadth of Germany when the He surely forgets the the insistence by - every newspaper published in Germany upon the Zeppelin warfare against wpmen, - children, and unarmed persons. Por his benefit, I shall quote an - extract from an article written by Professor Bang, of Denmark, which apappears in the October number of the the reHibbert - Journal. The writer ^saysIt is very significant that nowhere was the war welcomed with such jubilation as in Germany. Of course, it went without saying that Germany was absolutely innocent, and the obof the most infamous assault, but, nevertheless, when war was proclaimed, the people were enchanted. Thousands of pens at once to work to extol the blessed effects of war. one at last began to wonder why peace was ever permitted, since - she was the mother of all vices, as war of all the virtues. Thousands of pens were busy in insisting upon a Chriso , express tian authority for warwere I wish my honourable friends who have been suggesting that our attitude towards the people of Germany is unchristian to at last one began to wonder why Christ did - not go about preaching it. And last, but not least, they looked forward to "" ein frischer, frolicher., Krieg ""coma newer, pleasanter warbecause it would extend .greatly the power and splendour* of the German realm, and probably to -'German domination - of the world. Professor Bang also quotes the remarks of a promiuent - Germain publicist, who. speaking - of '-the 'resu'it of German vicThe German creation will assume .an elevated and decisive importance .upon the earth. German thought and research, German songs .and sayings, German piety and morality, German, justice and unselfishness, German magnanimity and heroism, German sincerity and cordiality, German profundity and purity, German manliness and anger, German staunchness and tenacity, German simplicity and straightforwardness, German reliability and loyalty, German spirit of enterprise and organizing capacity, German industry and German thoroughness-this marvellous iGod-given German creation in its entirety shall be born again in pure beauty out of the travail of war, and shall celebrate its proud resurrection. This is the vocation to which the hour of our fate calls us Germans in the world. If , as is sometimes suggested, lunacy is exaggerated. egotism, one must conclude that a naELon"" which seriously puts forward such views should, if it were possible, be confined as a whole in a lunatic asylum. We have to contend with a powerful nation, obsessed with a mission that it regards as divine, to obtain control of the civilized world by any means, foul or fair. An y one who, in the face of that declaration, suggests the possibilit y of peace, as it has been suggested here today, places himself on a level with the lunatics that we are compelled to fight. Let us consider what peace would mean at the present moment. Germany is master of the situation, and dominates the whole of Europe. Is it to be thought that peace on terms that would be acceptable to her would mean anything more than a position intolerable for the British Empire? Does any one fai l to realise that peace on any terms, except the crushing of this monster, would mean the renewal of the war within a few years in a more ruthless fashion than ever, and with the single object of destroying the Empire to which we belong 8 I am with those who agree that the only course for us and the civilized world is to wage war until we can dictate terms of peace, instead of asking for them, as we should have to do today. As regards the war, the position day is serious and critical. I think that we are quite so cock-sure we were about our winning, nor so firmly convinced that it is not necessary for tralia to do more than she has done. trouble about it . But Australia is in a graver as a result of the conscription dum than even the course of the war' indicates. I wish to show, as briefly as I can, how this has come and where the blame for it We are satisfied now that the refertaken up if they had dared. endum was a very big mistake. Mr Fowler. is easy, I may be reminded, to be wise after the event, but I wish to remind honourable members, as I would remind the Prime Minister if he were here, that there were not a few whose opinions should have had some weight, who pointed out as forcibly as they could, that the holding of the referendum was wrong, at any rate at that particular juncture, and that it was likely to have a very unfortunate result.",24
198,Mr HANNAN,MILITARY SERVICE,Is that not where the question of wise leadership should come in?.,26
199,Mr FOWLER,MILITARY SERVICE,"Undoubtedly , it is a question of wise leadership. F r o m many quarters the Prime Minister was appealed to in regard to the dangerous nature of the proposal that he had made up his mind to suhmit to the country. He had another course to follow, and it was urged in this House by myself, among others. In fact, I was so certain that the referendum would fail that I did a thing which I had never done before in the whole course of my public l if e : I wrote a letter to the Prime Minister imploring him to take the other course, because I felt that the referendum was sure to fail ; and I gave him one reason which, if he had been a man of judgment and a man who understood human nature, he would have recognised as absolutely conclusive regarding the result of the course which he had made up his mind to pursue.",26
200,Mr LYNCH,MILITARY SERVICE,What does the honourable member call the other course to which he refers?,26
201,Mr FOWLER,MILITARY SERVICE,"I have already indicated in the House what I thought the course should have been. If the Prinie Minister had declared at once when he came back from the Old! toCountry that there was nothingelse do not for Australia but conscription, and as if he had introduced it under the War Precautions Act, I am satisfied Austhat there would have been little or no For one thing, he situation would have got to work, and carried it refereninto effect before the above organizations had got at the coat tails of their representatives in this Chamber, and ahout, pulled them back from a position which lies. I have no doubt they would have gladly Such a It course might or might not have meant the disintegration of the Prime Minister's party; but, at any rate, it would have saved the country from the shame and degradation of turning conscription down.",26
202,Mr HAMPSON,MILITARY SERVICE,It would'have meant civil war.  create civil war? The skulkers who will not do their share now? There is not much civil war about them.,27
203,Mr HAMPSON,MILITARY SERVICE,"You take the step, and see what will happen.",27
204,Mr FOWLER,MILITARY SERVICE,"I would be prepared to do it if I had the power. When the Prime Minister returned to this country the people, as a whole, were looking for conscription, and ready to accept it at his hand, and it was a .responsibility which he, as the head of the Government, ought to have shouldered. If he had done so, he would not have dragged the name and reputation of Australia in the mire, as, unfortunately, he has done. But his visit to the Old Country had effects from which Australia is now suffering. He went away a rather unscrupulous and truculent partisan. He came back a great Empire statesman. had this been achieved, many of us wondered. We read his speeches, ,and we found in them only two notes, '' Down with the Germans, that accursed race,"" and "" Dp with the British, the salt of the earth."" He harped on these two notes in his own peculiar way, and with that wealth of language to which we are accustomed in this House, but which we all ' discount to a considerable extent, even those of us who sit behind him and cheer him on. However, the right honourable gentleman went Home, and, on the strength of a number of speeches made there, he came back to us a statesman, and I suppose he felt that to introduce conscription by means of a proclamation under the War Precautions Act was far too commonplace a course to follow. He had swept through Great Britain and electrified the community with his eloquence. He would do the same thing in Australia. He would, carry the country by means of such speeches as had worked such astounding results in Great Britain. was a disaster to Australia that the Prime Minister went to Great Britain, and came back with such a halo round his head as the people at Home had given him. I have no desire to speak in a personal way, and I make my remarks without the slightest scrap of malice, but I wish to observe that the Prime Minister, in conducting the T&ferendum, committed almost every mistake it was possible to make, and but for those mistakes I believe that we would have had a chance of a "" Yes "" majority.",27
205,Mr WISE,MILITARY SERVICE,It is very easy to be wise after the event.,27
206,Mr FOWLER,MILITARY SERVICE,"It is our duty to try to profit by the mistakes of the past, to see how they could have been avoided, and how they can best be repaired. I do not believe in going back into the past. The honourable member for Gippsland is very good at that sort of thing. He very seldom rises in the Chamber without ^having a dig into the pages of Hansard of years and years ago in order to discover some inconsistency on' the part of some unfortunate honourable member. Therefore the suggestion that he has just made comes rather unfortunately from him. If the referendum had been conducted in a sensible way, we might have had a majority; but, to my How mind, an ordinary majority would not have been sufficient. A narrow majority would have been equal to a moral defeat, and the only chance, in . a matter of this kind, to act on a vote taken by way of a referendum would have been to have secured an overwhelming majority in favour of the proposal, such a majority as was recorded in my ' own State of Western Australia alone. The first mistake was the calling. up of the men for home service. I do not know for what reason that step was? taken. It brought men into military camps who would never have been called up under a straight-out form of conscription, and in that way the disadvantages the country would suffer under conscription were quite unnecessarily emphasized. Then we had ever so many exemptions, many of them with no justification whatever. In Western Australia there was* not much opposition to the conscription proposals, and almost the only taunt I got in the course ""of my campaign was, "" Why do you people exempt members of It Parliament?"" I was obliged to admit that I did not know, and that there was no reason why members of Parliament who were of military age and fitness should be exempted from serving their country. Then, in regard to. the inquisition at the polling booths, I am surprised that, any Democrat who regards the secrecy of the ballot as sacred would have made a suggestion of that kind.",27
207,Mr TUDOR,MILITARY SERVICE,How did the honourable member vote on that point last week t,28
208,Mr FOWLER,MILITARY SERVICE,"I did not give my vote on that point. I gave my vote on a greater matter, and I am not going to have the greater matter overshadowed by the trifle that was suggested by the honourable member fbr Yarra. So far as the statesmanship of the Prime Minister in Australia is concerned, we have seen none of it, but rather the opposite, and I am bound to say that, to those who know him intimately, it is almost commonplace to suggest that,, while he has any amount of picturesque abilities, he. is not preeminent so far as useful horse-sense is concerned.. I do not know, that any honourable member in this chamber, if he owned a fried fish shop, would give the Prime Minister the. running of it , The right honourable gentleman could make a magnificent speech on the subject of fried fish shops, he could dilate splendidly on the iridescent beauty of his stock-intrade, he could assure us of the succulent qualities of the goods, he could give us brilliant flashes of wit regarding fishiness, flabbiness, and so on, he could wind up with a magnificent peroration proving the absolute necessity to the country of fried fish shops. But if any one were soimpertinent as to ask him how a fried fish shop could be run at a profit, he would have as blank a look as when he is favoured with"" other awkward questions from this corner of the chamber. While the Prime Minister has brilliant qualities, he bas not, in the matter of judgment, anything to recommend him as the controller of the affairs of Australia at the present critical juncture. Holding such an opinion of him-a n opinion which is shared, I believe, by every honourable member who knows him - I may be asked why I tolerate this gentleman' as Prime Minister of the Commonwealth. I give the right honourable gentleman only a qualified support. remember that the members of his present Ministry were not members of the Administration which was guilty 'of all the blunders I baree just enumerated-. I yield to no one inmy admiration of those gentlemen. I yield to no one in my admiration of the magnificent stand those honourable members have taken in the country against the Labour organization, on the question of conscription, which they regarded as vital to the interests of Australia and of the whole Empire. They have made sacrifices of no ordinary character. They have shown a strength of mind that every one must honour, and have, therefore, a perfect right to be in the position that-they, with the Prime - iiunister,. now occupy together, for one reason, and one reason alone,, and that is to make good in regard to the prosecution of the war. The Prime Minister, especially,, is in that position. He chose to appeal to the Governor General when he disbanded his previous Administration, andasked leave to form a second Government. I am as yet entirely in the dark as to why the Governor General gave him a commission to do that. The right honourable gentleman could not assure the Governor General that he had a majority behind him. Be that as it may, I say, in all seriousness, that when the conscription proposals were turned down by the people it was the duty of William Morris Hughes to have resigned, from the Prime Ministership. Failing that, he, should have got into communication with the Leader of the Opposition.",28
209,Mr TUDOR,MILITARY SERVICE,So he did.,28
210,Mr FOWLER,MILITARY SERVICE,"He did not. Unfortunately for Australia, and unfortunately for the Prime Minister's personal position in this matter, throughout the referendum campaign, and until a dav or two before he met this House, he ignored the Opposition and its Leader as if there were no such party in existence. Mr HAMESON. - He cannot ignore it now.",28
211,Mr FOWLER,MILITARY SERVICE,"No ; and I give him no credit for any gracious attitude that he may now adopt towards us. Having formed a new Ministry entirely from his own immediate following, the Prime Minister and his' party remain on the Treasury bench only to make *good in connection with the war. If he and his colleagues fail to do that-if they do not I vindicate themselves in the prosecution of the war-the n after a short experience and a fair test they should no longer occupy the Treasury bench.",28
212,Mr BURNS,MILITARY SERVICE,What would the honourable member consider to be a fair time?,28
213,Mr FOWLER,MILITARY SERVICE,"Sufficien t time to give the new recruiting movement a trial. I have no illusions, nor has any honorread ahle member, as to that movement. While a little may be done with it at the outset, it is going to give us substantially the country. no better results than were obtained fore. I do not wish to discuss the matter at present; but the Government has put forward this recruiting movement as a means of reinforcing our men at the front, and of carrying out Australia's sponsibilities in respect to the war. they fail in that respect, then there is other reason why they should remain i office, and it will be the duty of this House to get back as soon as possible to something like responsible parliamentary government. The referendum has failed. Conscription has been turned down, and we are back again to the old method of obtaining recruits. Certain members of this House, and many people outside of i have been congratulating themselves and the country on what they choose to scribe as this great victory for the cause of Democracy and freedom. It is they speak of the turning down of conthe scription-the turning down of the gestion that Australia ought to do share in its war; the turning down of the We first duty of the individual of any mocratic community to defend his counthe try and his k it h and kin from foreign aggression. I have listened to several speeches, and they seem to have rung hollow. I am afraid that it is a case of making a good deal of noise to smother the little voice of conscience. Having gard to the situation today, I do not think that any of those honourable bers who declared only a few weeks ago that Australia had done her share, and that the war was practically over, w feel so confident on the subject. We not by any means out of our trouble. We have to face a more serious situation than we have ever done. It behoves us, therefore, to walk warily, and not to i dulge in congratulations of that kind. The people outside take their cue from parliamentary and other leaders. They are quite prepared, unfortunately, to go on now as if everything were satisfactory. The picture shows, theatres, race-courses, and stadiums are crowded with those who are obsessed with pleasure. Business goes on as usual. A writer in the Argus a few days ago commented bitterly on the fact that he had seen a huge crowd struggling round a city hotel window to a notice, not in connection with the war, as he at first thought, but merely very giving the result of a horse race in It is obvious to any beone who moves about Melbourne or Sydney that the war is a mere remote, far-away circumstance to the bulk of the people. While they read of it , much as they would read of events at the Nort h rePole or the South Pole, they have no imI f mediate appreciation of the situation as no it affects Australia, or of the obligations n it throws upon us. I cannot help remarking that this is due to the fact that Australia too long has been the spoilt child of the Empire.",29
214,Dr MALONEV,MILITARY SERVICE,A very good child.,29
215,Mr FOWLER,MILITARY SERVICE,"Sometimes. We have had a magnificent country thrown at ns without any sacrifice or effort on our t , part. We have enjoyed all the advantages and forgotten our responsibilities. deWe have been allowed to exercise our own free will within our boundaries, and thus we have done that in a way that affects international relations of, not only sugAustralia, but the Empire as a whole. its What is our White Australia policy? could never maintain it , but dethat we are an integral portion of British Empire. Behind the British Navy we are ahle to maintain that such policy. But it is not many years since very there were in Australia many who boasted that the White Australia policy, or any other that Australia chose to readopt, was secure even without the British Navy. It is not very long since memwe heard a good deal of talk to that effect. To-day that attitude is a thing of the past. We all thank God for the ill British Navy. .We thank God.that we are are a portion of the British Empire. We are prepared also to skulk behind the British Navy, and to let the rest of the Empire do the fighting for us. n - We are prepared, not only to do that, but fco allow the conscripts of Russia and .France to fight for us, and to secure our country against foreign aggression. By our action in turning down conscription we have neutralized for OUTselves the benefit of our association with the Empire. We have written our deathwarrant as a free white community. I . knew such a statement would be greeted with a laugh of contempt. Many honourable members regard it as absurd and impossible. I want tb show them the reality of it. Remember for a minute the position of Australia. Here is a country occupied by a handful of white people, who are intruders upon an area which, geographically, belongs naturally to the yellow and black races. There are around our northern shores countless millions of those races who regard with ill-concealed hatred the attitude we have taken up towards them. It is an arrogant attitude, as they regard it and naturally so, to clude them from a part of the world belonging hy right to those races, and not to us.",29
216,Dr MALONEV,MILITARY SERVICE,The honourable member must know that Japan has saved us.,30
217,Mr FOWLER,MILITARY SERVICE,"Our White Australia policy is a standing insult to those coloured races. It is a standing insult to our great ally, Japan. I do not wish to discuss our position in regard to Japan. Too much has been said already about it . I desire to enter my protest, however, against the alarmist suggestions that have emanated from various quarters during the last few months. suggestions are dastardly and uncalled for. I am not in the least afraid of any warlike aggression on Australia by Japan, / which has always been an honourable and / chivalrous nation. Japan has stood loyally by the Allies in this war, and will continue to do so until the bitter end. But there are other dangers besides war, and one danger now threatens Australia by reason of the fact that we have turned down conscription. We all admit that we do not hold Australia by our own strength. Do we hold it entirely by reason of our association with the British Empire-by the strength of the British Navy ? No, we do not. Great Britain has been able to maintain our attitude because we had the moral support and sympathy of the white races of the rest of the world. Have we got that support and sympathy today ? Look to America. Not very long ago an American newspaper headed, in scorn and contempt, an article in regard to Australia, "" Australia quits."" We all know . that there is a slang word in use in America, a ""quitter""- a word of the strongest contempt that can possibly be applied .to a craven, worthless individual. - That term is hurled at us from America today, and we can look for no sympathy, in this attitude of ours towards the war, from that country.",30
218,Mr RILEY,MILITARY SERVICE,What has America done in the war ?,30
219,Mr FOWLER,MILITARY SERVICE,"That has nothing to do with what I am arguing. As I have already said, we are not in danger of war-, like aggression; but, after the war is over, there are going to be very many adjust1 ments of the world's affairs. Supposing it is suggested, on behalf of those yellow races, that this craven handful of white people in Australia have no longer a ex- right to monopolize this great continentwhat then ? Suppose it is suggested that effective occupation in international law is something that we in Australia ought to be no longer allowed to ignore-that those yellow races have a right to come into Australia, and to take up at least those parts we are not using for ourselves? Supposing the spokesmen of Asia make that suggestion on behalf of those millions of Asiatics, who, as I say, regard our attitude towards them as one continual insult? Supposing the suggestion is made to Great Britain, how will Great Britain be able to regard it ? And that the suggestion will be made is as sure as the sun These will rise tomorrow; and when it is made, and Great Britain is confronted with the situation, what can she do ? The matter will not rest there. Supposing Japan asks Russia what she thinks of this handful of degenerate white people monopolizing this country any longer, what will Russia say - Jtussia , whose millions, it has been suggested, should go to the front in order to save Australians, and because the Russians are cheaper, as if the son of a Russion mother was of less account to her than is the son of a mother in Australia ? These things have been noted in . Russia, make no mistake. And when Russia is asked what about the White Australia policy, can we doubt what Russia's answer will be? If France is asked her opinion about this handful of degenerate white men, who keep out the Japanese and other yellow races, and yet refuse to do their own share in the war, what will France say ? France is going to say, "" We have no time for such people; let them go; let them suffer the fate they deserve.""",30
220,Dr MALONEY,MILITARY SERVICE,The French Consul does not say so.,30
221,Mr FOWLER,MILITARY SERVICE,"The French Consul will not be asked what he thinks about it ; it is the French people who will have the say in the matter; and, while their sons are dying by the million, we can understand their attitude towards a country that refuses to send its young men away from the race-course and the picture show - to fight its own battles. Let me ask this - House, and, if possible, the country, what position we will be in after the war if we have forfeited the good opinion and the moral sympathy and support of the white races of the world? The principle of a White Australia will be challenged, and we shall be no longer able to maintain it , because we have lost that support and sympathy without which .even Great Britain could not have helped us to maintain our position in the past. I have now only to suggest that there is a chance yet of our rehabilitating ourselves-^-and only one chance. When this second attempt at voluntary recruiting failed, .and when we are face to face with the resultant situation, if all sections of this Parliament, recognising the gravity of the situation as. I have tried to point it out, can come together and say to the country, "" Well, we turned down conscription once, but we put the question to you again as the only chance of our salvation,"" there will still be some hope. If we can wipe out the - stain and degradation vote which will throw Australia once more into the ranks of those, who are fighting for the cause of civilization and humanity, we may regain the good opinion of the white races, without which we cannot exist here in Australia for a single year. If we fail to do that, the "" writing is on the wall "" for us, and we shall go down dishonoured and disgraced beneath the yellow race, more virile than we.",30
222,Mr WATKINS,MILITARY SERVICE,"Newcastle) [3.10] After the speech we have just heard, I think the Prime Minister might well pray - to be saved from his friends.",31
223,Mr KING OMALLEY,MILITARY SERVICE,It was a good speech.,31
224,Mr WATKINS,MILITARY SERVICE,"I am not saying it was a bad speech; the honourable member for Darwin misses the point. The honourable member for Perth has, in my judgment, delivered a speech which contains the gravest criticism of the actions of the Prime Minister throughout the recent campaign. I deplore the fact that so many attempts are made to fasten on honourable members on one side or the other responsibility for the attitude of extremists who opposed the proposition placed before the people. Personally, and for the party to which I belong, I disown any connection with that section of the community to which reference has been made. Further, it is beside the issue, and unfair, to be told that it was the vote of the Industrial Workers of the World in this country that brought about the rejection of the referendum. Are we to believe that the majorities in all the farming electorates of New South Wales and South Australia are associated with that organization? The fact is that the Prime Minister, when he returned to Australia, did not, as he ought to have done, appeal to the people to continue their recruiting efforts, which they had not failed to make before. The figures showed. that for the previous fourteen months the has total enlistments had been 114,000; and if the Prime Minister desired to keep up the strength to the extent he had promised, he ought to have taken the people into his confidence, and asked whether they were prepared to supply the numbers. Instead of that, however, he placed the referendum proposal before us, although Australia had, up to that time, done as much as the rest of the Dominions put together. We were asked to take the exby another treme step, although the people had up to then acted most willingly. Long before I lef t for the Old Country, at the beginning of the year, I regarded the conscription proposal as a political attempt to divide the Labour votes and Labour forces of the country. ' Sir JOHN FOBREST - Why ?",31
225,Mr WATKINS,MILITARY SERVICE,"I felt that to be so, and the position today seems to prove the accuracy of my idea.",31
226,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,MILITARY SERVICE,Who wished to divide them ?,31
227,Mr WATKINS,MILITARY SERVICE,Thos e who originated the idea of conscription when this country was doing so well in recruiting.,31
228,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,MILITARY SERVICE,Not the Prime Minister ?,31
229,Mr WATKINS,MILITARY SERVICE,"Not the Prime M in ister; but that honourable gentleman, when he came back from England, fell into the trap, with the result that we see the division of a party that has held together for twenty-five years. The Prime M in ister swallowed the bait, but those who introduced the idea, and who, like "" K a is e r Bill , "" thought their organization to be absolutely complete, forgot many things, and the result is that, not only the Labour party, but the Liberals are divided, and the people embittered fro m one end of the country to the other.  expel their members because they acted in good faith.",31
230,Mr WATKINS,MILITARY SERVICE,"The Liberals did not, I admit.",32
231,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,MILITARY SERVICE,"The are not divided, as is proved by the result of the municipal elections in South Australia last Saturday, when they swept the polls.",32
232,Mr WATKINS,MILITARY SERVICE,That observation is quite wide of the mark.,32
233,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,MILITARY SERVICE,"It is right on the ""bull's-eye.""",32
234,Mr WATKINS,MILITARY SERVICE,"I am afraid that the farmers in the honourable member's electorate got him on the ."" bull'seye "" when, by their votes, they turned him down. An angry people wil l do many things; and, although the organization of the Government was behind the proposal submitted, it was rejected. In opposition to this proposal were many hundreds of women who had given two and three boys to the war. It was argued that more nien would he obtained under that shallow conscription scheme than by voluntary ' effort. But what happened in connection with the Forces sent into camp under the proclamation ? People on that occasion had a dose of what they are likely to get under a system of conscription. who had willingly yielded their sons were further bled, and - those who had escaped in the first place escaped again. In this State, as in every other State, the people with influence had their sons exempted on all sorts of flimsy pretexts. Only sons were not required to go into camp at all, even for home service. The conscription law was not a measure to recruit those who attended race-courses and picture shows, as had been said, but to make further demands on those who Had already given all they could afford of their manhood. Why were only sons exempted? Was it fair to widows who had previously surrendered their only sons . that others who had made no such sacrifices should be screened by the proposed compulsory law ? In the main those people who have only one son belong to the wealthy and idle classes, and the son, as a general rule, is a waster to whom military training would do much good. If conscription was to produce the recruits which were necessary because of the Empire's dire straits, why should anybody be allowed to have a conscience in regard to compulsory service? Why was that conscience clause inserted ? It was done so that a certain class of people might escape, as they have done in connection with all matters in regard to Liberals which conscience may be pleaded.",32
235,Mr BOYD,MILITARY SERVICE,There should be no conscience against doing one's duty.,32
236,Mr WATKINS,MILITARY SERVICE,I agree with that sentiment.,32
237,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,MILITARY SERVICE,"It was for the benefit of members of your party, I should think.",32
238,Mr WATKINS,MILITARY SERVICE,"The enlistments amongst the working classes and Labour - members will compare more than favourably with the response made by the section from whom these disparaging statements come. A good deal has been said about the coal miners who went on strike recently, and their association with the Industrial Workers of the World. Would it surprise honourable members to know that of the 10,000 members on the official roll of the Coal Miners Union, apart from the other workmen surrounding the mines, one out of every five is at the war. Yet we hear cheap taunts hurled at the workers.",32
239,Sir JOHN FOBREST,MILITARY SERVICE,"You are not supporting the Industrial Workers of the World 1 Parents - Mr WATKINS - The men engaged in that strike were not Industrial Workers of the World. In the Defence Department today there are a number of men who have been wearing khaki ever since the war began. They hold various ranks, from lieutenant down to private, and are receiving as much as 26s. a day from the' taxpayers. But they show no desire to go to the war. Why does not the Defence Department organize internally, and ask these men why, if they intend to remain in the Military Forces of the Commonwealth, they do not go to the front.",32
240,Sir JOHN FORREST,MILITARY SERVICE,Senato r Pearce is a Labour Minister.,32
241,Mr WATKINS,MILITARY SERVICE,"He is the Liberal party's Minister at the present time. Is it fair that we should have in the Defence Department young men fit to go to the war, and drawing from £ 1 Is. to 26s. a day for rolling up other men and putting them into military camps?  on this side of the House why did you not object to these things ?",32
242,Mr WATKINS,MILITARY SERVICE,"We did. Let me admit, in fairness to some of the men in the Defence Department, that they have been endeavouring to get to the f r o n have been denied permission, because they were told that their services are required in Australia. I am of opinion that by this time there are sufficient returned soldiers, with experience of modern warfare, to carry out all the work of the Defence Department. Whilst I conscientiously believe that the responsibility for the unsatisfactory recruiting day lies at the doors of those who divided the people on the conscription issue, I do not agree with those who say they will not engage in the recruiting campaign. From the beginning I have held that this was a just war, as much the fight of Australia as of Great Britain and her Allies, and although I differed from the methods proposed by other honourable members who advocated conscription, that will not prevent me, and should not prevent other honourable members, from endeavouring to fulfil the promises we have made, and meet our obligations until the war is over. I firmly believe that if Australia is appealed to in the proper way we shall get the recruits required from time to time.",33
243,Mr CORSER,MILITARY SERVICE,Whic h is the proper way?,33
244,Mr WATKINS,MILITARY SERVICE,"The people have not been appealed to, but insulted. I have no wish to make comparisons for the sake of making it appear that Australia has done better than any other country, but I remember the Leader of the Liberal party stating some time ago that Canada should be our example, and that the Dominion at that time had 300,000 men at the front. When in Canada recently I made inquiries of Sir George Foster, a member of the Dominion Cabinet, and he stated that 300,000 men had been recruited, but that only 150,000 were at the fron t and i Great Britain. At that time Australia had 200,000 men at the front and in Great Britain. Remembering that it costs Canada only £ 4 per head to send troops to Europe, as against £ 1 4 per head from Australia, it will be seen that if Canada had three times as many men at the fron t as Australia had, Canada would not be doing more than the Commonwealth.",33
245,Mr CORSER,MILITARY SERVICE,What is Canada doing in the manufacture of munitions ?,33
246,Mr WATKINS,MILITARY SERVICE,"I saw many of the munition factories there, and I say, to t and the credit of the Canadian people, that they have made hundreds of thousands of pounds out of this war, whereas Australia's participation in it has been a dead loss.",33
247,Mr SINCLAIR,MILITARY SERVICE,"We should have been making money out of it , too.",33
248,Mr WATKINS,MILITARY SERVICE,We should.,33

252,Mr WATKINS,MILITARY SERVICE,"I do not admit that if some other country is not doing its duty, Australia should not do hers. I have-only referred to Canada's contribution because of the fact that the Dominion's example was held up to Australia as one to be followed. If we had taken Canada as an example, as the Leader of the Liberal party suggested, instead of increasing our contributions we should have decreased them. The cost of this war to Australia is so much greater than to any otlier Dominion, that the people had a right to be taken into the confidence of the politicians when they were asked to take such a drastic step as was proposed a couple of months ago. In regard to the financial aspect, there has been waste taking place in the Defence Department ever since the commencement of the war. Some drastic step should be taken to remove the incapables who are responsible for this waste, and are unfit for the big job they have in hand, in order to make room for somebody who will be honest with the people.",33
253,Mr CORSER,MILITARY SERVICE,Why did you not bring about these reforms earlier?,33
254,Mr WATKINS,MILITARY SERVICE,"The honourable member may be old in years, but he is a child so' far as this House is concerned. Some months ago we essayed to make munitions in Australia. There were many engineering people ready to lend assistance. I know one man who offered to put in machinery at a cost of £3,000 for this work, but the Government hesitated about telling him to start, and when he was asked to start the machinery cost £7,000. Furthermore, no sooner had munition making started than the order came to stop everything. Over £500,000was thus wasted. The Government were in possession of knowledge regarding the making of shells, and yet the military people engineered a Commission to visit India to report on the subject, and I challenge Ministers to say that that report gave any more information than we had already. It was unfair to those connected with engineering to get them to spend money as they did. They were going to give the shells to the Government at their bare cost. Persons who wished ' to help their country in this great struggle were thus penalized. In conclusion, I deprecate the bickering that has occurred during the debate, and throughout the whole of the present unfortunate business. We are still in the war, and we must fulfil our promise to see it brought to a successful conclusion. I sometimes feel that we are fiddling while Rome is burning. I , at least, am prepared to take my place with others in trying to secure the recruits necessary for the further prosecution of the war.",33

262,Dr MALONEY,MILITARY SERVICE,I mean what I say.,34
263,Dr CARTY SALMON,MILITARY SERVICE,"In that case, I shall exercise my ri?ht to speak now. I re-echo the concluding words of the honourable member for Newcastle, and express deep regret that at a time like this honourable members consider it either necessary or expedient to continue personal hostilities, which might well be suspended during the present great national crisis. As I am one of the oldest members of the House, I trust that honourable members generally will not consider that I am unduly lecturing them. It is because I earnestly desire that the people of Australia, and its Parliament especially, shall give the best and immediate attention to the part that we ought to play in this great contest that I advocate the cessation of personal interchanges which, although they may sometimes relieve the monotony of public life, might well be relegated to obscurity at the present time. I give all honourable members credit for desiring the successful termination of the' war, but I put it to the Committee in the strongest terms that we are not all doing all that lies in our power to insure that. Honourable members are not exercising that mutual forbearance and self-sacrifice which they ask others to exercise if they will not abate one jot or tittle of what they consider to be their personal rights. I regard the financial statement of the Treasurer as one of the most important that we have ever had. It marks an epoch in our financial history which I venture to say will often be referred to by those who come after us. During the past three years there has been what the Treasurer Ihas called a financial revel, but what I call a financial debauch, such as the country has never previously experienced. Extravagance has not been limited to Parliaments, it has been indulged in by the people themtheir selves. There must be an utter and complete failure to realise the source whence our money is derived, and the inevitable results of dissipating it in the manner which is being followed. The statement of the Treasurer discloses in lurid fashion the absolute necessity for, not only national, but also personal economy. The State Governments as well as the Comis the monwealth Government, are blameworthy for unwarrantable extravagance. But the people themselves are materially hastening the advent of the evil day. At this period of the year it has been the custom of people to spend money extravangantly to outvie their neighbours during the great racing carnival, and when the weather has been inclement the newspapers have been filled with complaints about the loss of business experienced by drapers and clothiers generally. The least ill-weather has always heen regarded as a menace to the profits of these shopkeepers. But although this year the weather has been exceptionally had, we have had no complaints from business people. They have _ faced with equanimity conditions which in previous times they would have regarded as pestilential. Why is this? Simply because, as their balance-sheets disclose, their profits during the past two years have exceeded all previous records. I know of a shop in a leading thoroughfare of this city of which the profits last year were £12,000 and £20,000, an increase of £8,000.",34

I feel that I should be wanting in my"" as a' member <Sf the Federal Parliament if I did not draw attention to these immediatelv I became convinced of them. The statement that I make is only too well borne out by the records of the Customs and Excise Department. Every quarter, the ^Government Statist publishes figures which indicate how trade is travelling, and how the commodities which reach this part of the world are being treated by the people who purchase them. Durstand on that point. ing the last twelve months the imports of what may be described as luxuries and non-essentials have increased to an enorone mous extent. D u r in g the first three months of the year 1915-16 the total ports were £20,544,000; for the same months of the year 1916-17 the total imthat he has taken. ports were £22.168.000. The most significant fact of all is the tremendous advance which our imports have made over our [346] exports. An y tyro in political economy, the veriest apprentice in public finances, realizes that a country which allows its imports to exceed its exports is doing it at the expense of its gold and at the expense of its credit. In 1910-11 we were in a position to send away from Australia more than £11,000,000 in excess of our imports. The figures that I give are exclusive of gold. In 1911-12 the excess of exports over imports was £2,437,000. In 1912-13 there was a terrible slump to the this year other side of the ledger, the imports exceeding the exports by £9,848,000. In 1913-14 the imports exceeded the exports £3,423,000. In 1914-15, including the year of the war, the excess of imports oyer exports rose to £5,878,000. Last year it rose still further, to £12,701,000, in and for the first three months of the preprosent year, 1916-17, the excess has already reached the enormous total of £6,358,000. is only one possible deduction from these figures.

No wonder that they are getting tired of parliamentary action. If trains must go, let them go, and let honourable members go with them. I have been endeavouring for two days to say something on this motion, and I intend to have my say. The honourable member for F'arramatta has gone. What were the points of his insults and the attacks on the Labour party? Erom all round the chamber we hear the letters "" I.W.W."" I am getting very tired of hearing them.. If the public only knew how Parliament was fooling, they would say, perhaps, that parliamentary action was foolish. I hurl back in the face of every one who has uttered them the insults and the untruths that they have spoken. I know nothing of the In dustrial Workers of the World, but I claim that if the scales of justice are to aggregate £50. be held fairly, the men of that body should be treated fairly, and judged fairly. I accuse the Prime Minister of prejudging them on every platform, in order to inflict the curse of conscription on the people. The honourable member for Perth has said that he would not trust the Prime Minister to run a fish shop. The honourable member should have said a "" f r u it shop."" I wish to tell the honourable member for Perth that the Prime Minister may probably be a resident of Perth in the future, if we are to judge by finding his name amongst the money-lenders registered in Perth. He has been registered there for a paltry loan of £29 ISs. 9d., dragging the sacred name of the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth into the dirty columns of the bills-of-sale list among money-lenders. Who would dare to say that ever a Prime Minister has done the same thing, or the Premier of a State? Yet here it is in this list of money-lending .transactions. Mr Krira O'MALLEY - That is not our ""Bill""?",36
281,Dr MALONEY,MILITARY SERVICE,"Yes , the present Prime Minister of Australia, by the grace of the right honourable members for Parramatta and Swan, without whose assistance he could not possibly be in office. Thrice has the crown heen offered to the Leader of the Opposition. It reminds us of the ponderous words of Shakespeare, where Mark Antony was made to sayYou all did see that on the Lupercal I thrice presented him a kingly crown, Which he did thrice refuse. We have offered the right honourable member for Parramatta the kingly crown of being Prime Minister of Australia, yet on more than three occasions he has passed it by.

I hope that they are proud of him. In a book written by Weigall, great Australian who has gone to Egypt, and given the answer to the cry that Aushas tralians are decadents and quitters, there is a picture of a mummy of a famous certain Pharaoh, Sety of the 19th Dynasty, who lived 6,000 years ago, which compares mefavorably with Mr Low's wonderful caricature of our Prime Minister. We all know how the artist depicts our Prime Minister smashing up the furniture in the cotting British Cabinet room, and spilling the ceipt ink, and Mr Asquith appealing to Mr . Lloyd George to "" speak to him and pacify him . "" An y one can see this mummy the facsimile of our be "" glorious Will i a m . tor Millen, in the other chamber. I have heen tryin g to get a little sympathy as to the swindling that has been done i connection with the many collections of merited war funds i h Australia. The Crown but Solicitor of New South Wales, Mr with Tillett, when a charge was made of stealwho ing £260 from the Eed Cross Society, money. gave this as his opinionIn my opinion, a strong primd facie case be established against both Shiels and Anning, and I feel constrained to add that this type case is one of the many frauds that are perpetrated on charitable organizations which have arisen during the present war. Why was not the Bed Cross scandal in Egypt dealt with? Why were the men not brought here and punished for their misdeeds 1 If two of them had not longed to the Government House push, they would have been. One has never yet shown his face in Australia. He dare not come here. Why has action not been taken against these men ? Even cigarettes which the kind women of Australia have sent our troops in the front have been sold in shops, and the buyers of them in some cases have found in the packets the names of the senders, and have written to them. I know of two such cases. Even the socks which we see the dear women knitting i the trams and trains, in theatres and con[346]- 2 cert halls, do not always reach those to they are sent. Early in the war I urged that these various patriotic funds be brought under proper super- vision and control. I thank the Minister comfor the Navy for the splendid work he is doing in guarding the country against improper dealings. It would be cowardly for me to follow the example of the Prime Minister by alluding to a case that is still sub judice. B ut no gaol is too bad for any a man who is found guilty of having robbed his country during this time of war. What been done by dishonest contractors in England ? Take the case, for instance, of clothing contractors to the British A r m y , who, according to a report before Were lately censured by Mr Justice Low, and who have been expelled from all public offices held by them. In some instances boyhas taken place, and ruin faces them. The scoundrel Asselling, who fainted on re-of a sentence of five years' imprisonment, is in the gaol hospital, suffering from shock, in Welsh and has become deranged. in The following remarks of the Judge should taken to heart by fellows of like kidney "" I compliment Sena in AustraliaT I can only say, with regard to the contractors, that I very much regret that it is not in n my power to send them to share the wellpunishment of their associate and accomplice. They leave this Court free men, they .will leave the Court disgraced men, the disgrace that should attach to men have not hesitated .to sacrifice the interests of their country to the desire to accumulate The Minister for the Navy will never be can afraid to deal with any case of dishonesty of on the part of contractors that is brought being under his notice. Work that was carried out for his Department is now being done by trade unionists, and ,I am perfectly certain that they will never rob the country. I shall not. accuse any of the Navy contractors of having done so. But the action betaken by the Navy Department will be a lesson that robbers will take to heart. I am sorry that the Leader of the Liberal party is not present, as I desire to refer to his insulting references to the Labour party and the Industrial Workers of the to World. I shall hurl such insults back at him, as well as at all members of the Liberal party from whose lips they come so trippingly. I challenge any one to say that the Industrial Workers of the World control any union. There are burglars in our midst, but we do riot accuse the people n of any sympathy with them.. Then, again, we have German spies in our midst; but we do not say that the people are in sympathy with them. When we discover a German spy, we intern him. I accuse the head of this Government, however, of having allowed rich Germans to go free, although they have not been naturalized, while he has caused the arrest of poor Germans who have married Australian women and have boys and girls born in Australia. To say that the Labour party is in association with the Industrial Workers of the World is to display a want of common sense. It would he just as reasonable for me to accuse all members of the Liberal party of believing in reducing the pay of old-age pensioners because the honourable member for Flinders, when Premier of Victoria, robbed the old men and women.",36
282,The CHAIRMAN,MILITARY SERVICE,The honourable member must withdraw that remark.,38
283,Dr MALONEY,MILITARY SERVICE,"Ver y well. honourable member is certainly not a robber, and I will withdraw the expression. When he was Premier of Victoria, he reduced the old-age pensioners' allowance. They were receiving only 5s., 6s., or 7s. a week, and their children were required to go into the witness-box in order that it might be ascertained whether they could not contribute Is. or Is. 6d. a week towards their support. As I have said before, I would die like a dog in the gutter rather than see my boy or girl placed in the witness-box for such a purpose. The Victorian old-age pension system was costing £238,000 a year, and the honourable member for Flinders, who was then Premier of this State, thought that was too much to spend on feeding the aged-poor. He, therefore, reduced the amount to £150,000 a year, thus taking the bread out of the mouths of the old-age pensioners. But because he did that, would it be fair for me to accuse every member of the Liberal party of being in sympathy with such action ? By the way, where are the members of the Liberal party ? The honourable member for Lang, with whose speech this morning I was more in sympathy than was any other honourable member on this side of the House, is the only representative of that party now present. It would be just as fair to accuse every member of the Liberal party of being prepared to grind down the old-age pensioners because of the action of the honourable member for Flinders as it is to accuse us of adopting the tactics of the Industrial Workers of the World. I might just as well accuse the Liberal party of believing in perjury and conspiracy to defeat the ends of justice because of what happened in connection with the Ronald-Harper case. Practically every witness against the Rev. J. B. Ronald was gaoled for conspiracy or perjury. Yet Mr Robert Harper, against whom he proceeded, still goes upon the platform in support of conscription. Three Judges of this State - to their honour be it said-urge d that the law ought to be amended so as .to enable justice to be done to Mr Ronald. I do not accuse the Liberal party of having any sympathy with the injustice that was done to Mr Ronald, but I do condemn the Liberals in the State Parliament for failing to amend the law which three Justices of the Supreme Court said should be altered so that an unfortunate minister of rehgion might obtain justice The from Mr Harper. Mr Harper supports conscription. But would it not be unfair for me to accuse those who supported the ""Yes"" campaign, and who are never tired of hurling at us insinuations with regard to the Industrial Workers of the World, of being fit companions of those who commit perjury and engage in conspiracies ? Some people say that we should speak only good of the dead. I believe the Almighty would say, "" Speak of the dead, if you will, but speak the truth."" I challenged a Victorian Ministry which sat in this very House with having allowed the late Silas Harding to escape imprisonment. The Attorney-General of that day had to own that he had been found guilty of perjury right up to the Supreme Court, but he did not die in gaol. He was not sent to gaol. He was a rich man. Would it be fair fco sayfchafcfcheLiberals, who kept that man out of gaol, all approved of perjury ? No. It would be just as unfair as it is for the Liberals to accuse the official Labour party of being the allies of the Industrial Workers of the World. I do not wish to hurt the feelings of the honourable member for Balaclava, since the honourable member for Capricornia has already been severe, and justly severe, in his criticism of him. The honourable member, who was for many years Premier of Victoria, deprived 100,000 men and women in this State of their right to vote. The Minister for the Navy did good work in Tasmania when he held ofiice for a few days in a State Administration. Aged men and women, and poor, unfortunate children there, have cause fco thank him, and I helieve remember him in their prayers, for the benefits he then  when holding the office of Chief Secretary for a few brief days in this State, wrote minute to the effect that the name of every man and woman who was entitled to be on the rolls should be at once enrolled. That minute resulted in Victoria having 100,000 additional voters. It increased by 1,000 the number of electors in the Flemington and Essendon electorate who had been deprived of their vote. The honourable member for Capricornia will be glad to learn that that, possibly, was sponsible for Mr Watt leaving that electorate and going to Balaclava. The honourable member who preceded me could have told us, had he chosen, of a very interesting episode that is well known in Masonic circles. I shall leave it for him to put before the Committee on some other occasion. Then, again, the right honourable member for Swan was responsible for the most iniquitous law ever passed in Australia- a law under which the age of consent was reduced from fourteen years to twelve years. It would be just as reasonable for members of the Labour party to accuse the Liberal party of approving of that amendment of the law because it was brought in by the right honourable member for Swan as it is for them to accuse us of being in alliance with the Industrial Workers of the World. A child of twelve would not know how to' give consent, yet the right honourable member, when Premier of Western Australia, brought in that infamous amendment of the law. If there is going to be any mud-slinging, I shall refer to Hansard for records of those gentlemen who are always yelping about the Industrial Workers' of the World. I am sorry that the honourable members to whom I refer are absent, but I would say the same thing in their presence. I was very glad to hear from the Government that the wheels of industry will soon be in motion again. ""If they are not, I shall appeal to the citizens of Australia as to whether it is not time we took over the industry from the "" coal barons."" In the past the barons, with their armed retainers, could rob every passer-by, and the coal barons are quite as bad. It is preposterous that we should have to wait until 1916 before these miners should have the right of an eighthours day. Anybody who knows about mining would rather accept half the pay on the surface than go below, and the danger commences directly the cage begins to go down. If the Government had gone a little further than they did, and a seized the mines, It would have been far better for the country. At one time in Victoria, when the Ballarat and Bendigo miners desired to have an eight-hours day, and the mine-owners refused, Mr. Francis Longmore, who was a State Minister at the time, was asked to grant an exemption of the working conditions of the leases. The reply of Mr Longmore to the owners was that, though he could re- not compel them to open their mines, or to give the men an eight-hour day, he could, and would, compel them to keep the labour conditions, or forfeit the leases. This, of course, finished the strike, and the men got what they desired. In Germany, when there was a strike for a ten-hours day and 18s. a week, the Emperor, after there had been some little disturbances, owing to the masters' refusal to meet the men, told the latter that if they kept the peace he would see justice done, while if they created riots he would shoot them down like dogs. On the other hand, he told the owners that if they did not appoint representatives to meet the men within twenty-four hours, he would do it for them. The result was that the representatives were appointed, and in forty-eight hours the strike was decided in favour of the men. Further, these German mines were nationalized, and there has never been any industrial trouble there since. Another instance was afforded when Mr. Roosevelt, as President, told the mine owners that if they did not keep the mines going, he himself would work them at their risk; and there is a still further example in the more recent action of President Wilson, which undoubtedly caused his re-election. Before concluding, I should like to say a word about the case of Gunner Perry, that poor wretched soldier who volunteered and suffered so much subsequently. Honourable members will be glad to know that that man has received an honourable discharge, and not only a pension for himself, but one for his wife. If the then Government had acceded to the request of the Leader of the Opposition, and sent one of the three Ministers to see this man, the country would have been saved £2,000, the cost of the inquiry. I accuse Senator Pearce of having involved the country in that amount in trying to rob this man of his pension, although that man was ,one of five brothers who had all volunteered. I may say that two of the brothers have been killed, one severely wounded, and. another missing, leaving only Gunner Perry with his honourable discharge and pension. I do not know what the sensations of the doctors must be who gave evidence that this man was a malingerer. I do know, however, that Dr Cuscaden is the least qualified of any medical man who is under him in the Army, and I dare him to say that, at the Melbourne Hospital or the Alfred Hospital, he would be allowed to practise either a3 an in-patient or an out-patient surgeon. The fact is that Dr Cuscaden is a woman's doctor, and it is ""an a'bsurdity to have him in his present position. We all remember how it was sworn by Senator Pearoe, at the Perry inquiry, that the fence was over 7 feet high, and how that statement was afterwards disproved, the fence, as a matter of fact, being only 4 ft. 6 in. I asked Senator Pearce to nominate any two men of the Labour party, in order that there might be a proper investigation of the facts connected with this case, but he refused; and we know how he dragged the  If there is any more of this Industrial Workers of the World business, unless it is given by the Book, I shall quote more of these cases, not only here, but outside. If the members of the Industrial Workers of the World have committed arson, that is a crime sufficiently serious to judge them on without the Prime Minister and his satellites yelling out about them while they were on their trial. The 1 men have been tried by a Judge. If he gave a wrong decision, it is a question between him, his conscience, and his Creator, and his conscience will never let him rest. If he gave a just decision, and the men were guilty of trying to burn down buildings with danger to human life, there is not one man in our party who would deny that the sentence"" was deserved. I am about full up of this Industrial Workers of the World business. The Prime Minister is the leader of what will be known as the ""Devil's Ministry,"" because there are only thirteen in the party, and no Whip ever had as easy a time as the present Whip has in looking after three men. If the Prime Minister wants to earn the respect he has Dr Moloney. lost among those who knew him best, he can do good now by seizing and nationalizing the coal mines, instead of letting the coal lords run them. Also, is he man enough to let us know how the soldiers voted at the front? Is he man enough to lay the papers pertaining to the purchase of the Commonwealth steamers on the table? Will he state if any commission was given, and, if so, to whom? I do not accuse the Prime Minister himself of being concerned, but he is in such a terribly suspicious position Uiat it is time 'the public knew the facts. 1 would urge him for his own sake to give up that superlative cunning which he has been showing. Every body of men, from his Cabinet and his Caucus down, tu whom he told all these secrets, turned him down, and if the public outside had. Only known the truth, and been given fair play, they would have turned him down even more severely than they did. If the soldiers had given a thumping majority for the slavery of conscription the fact would have been heralded throughout the land. The Prime Minister refused to let us have scrutineers to check the vote. When I asked him if he would cable to the Labour party in England to appoint scrutineers to act for our Labour party in England, and where possible, at the front, he was not ""taking any."" I am informed < that the executive of the Labour party here tried to cable the request at their own expense, but that the cable was not allowed to go. That is fishy and suspicious. If the Prime Minister wants to save the remnants of his political honour he must let us know how the troops voted. Are they degraded beings fit only to be put in gaol that he will not. allow the people to know how they voted ? I accuse the Prime Minister of suppressing the truth in that case. With all his tricks, he is after all in the position of the iox in the fable, which, lacking the one trick of the cat that could climb a tree, fell a victim to the dogs. Amendment negatived.
