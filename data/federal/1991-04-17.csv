5,Mr SPEAKER,SEX DISCRIMINATION,"Order! The member for Kooyong might get back to the matter before the chair.  of this legislation is the removal of certain discriminatory provisions found in the different Acts that the Bill seeks to amend. In this regard, the Bill will amend the provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984, the Marriage Act 1961 and the War Gratuity Act 1945. The coalition will be supporting the Bill, although at this point I should foreshadow that during the committee stage we will be moving some amendments. Before proceeding further I will give a brief overview of the Bill, which is divided into four parts. Part 1 contains some provisions of a procedural nature relating to the commencement of the various oth(:r parts of the Bill. Most importantly, subclause 2(2) provides that part 2 of the Bill will not commence until two years from the date the Bill receives royal assent. The remaining parts of the Bill will commence on 1 August 1991. Part 2 contains amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act 1984, and it is these provisions upon which I shall focus in a moment. . Part 3 contains amendments to the Marriage Act 1961, the most important of which will alter the existing provisions of that Act relating to the lawful age of marriage. As things stand at the moment, the marriageable age for females is 16 and the marriageable age for males is 18. A court can always authorise the marriage of persons below these ages in cases where the female 'is 14 years of age and the male is 16 years of age. By reason of the changes brought about by part 3, there will now be a common marriageable age of 18, with provision for reduction to 16 by way of court order. Part 4 of the Bill contains amendments to the War Gratuity Act of 1945 relating to the payment of gratuities to members of the armed forces who served in Wodd War II and their dependants. At the moment, the Act is discriminatory on the. grounds of sex and marital status in that it does not recognise de facto spouses and provides differing benefits to widows and widowers. Part 4 and the schedule to the Bill remove such instances of discrimination and extend the ambit of the Act to cover de facto relationships. A number of miscellaneous amendments are also made to remove gender language presently found in that Act. By way of passing I should note that at some time in the near future it is expected that similar changes will be 'made to the provisions of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 so as to extend repatriation and other benefits to the spouses of servicewomen and ex-servicewomen on an equal basis with the spouses of servicemen and ex-servicemen. I expect that my colleague in the Senate, Senator Newman, who has responsibility on behalf of the coalition, will address this issue in more detail when the Bill reaches the other place. I turn now to consider the provisions found in part 2 of the Bill, which amend the provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act. The essential purpose of part 2 is to modify section 41 of the Sex Discrimination Act, which at the moment exempts from the operation of the Act discrimination on the grounds of sex or marital status in the provision of superannuation benefits. I will deal with some of the history behind the changes that will be brought about by the provisions of part 2 of the Bill. This is in fact the third time the Parliament has had before it a Bill seeking to remove the exemption conferred upon superannuation arrangements. In May 1989 the House debated the Sex Discrimination Amendment Bill 1989, as it then was. That Bill was passed by the House, but for some reason or another was not transmitted to the Senate and, with the dissolution of the Parliament for the 1990 election, that Bill lapsed. When the 1989 Bill was debated, my predecessor as shadow Attorney-General, the former member for Menzies, raised two particular issues. In the first place, the 1989 Bill contained a provision whereby the more limited exemptions to be introduced could have been repealed at a future date simply by way of regl.Jlation. As a matter of general principle, the coalition has always strongly opposed the use of such a device for it undermines the important function of the Parliament, composed as it is by elected representatives, of legislating for the people. Forturelevant nately, however, the Government has decided now to abandon that provision. The second concern my predecessor raised in relation to the 1989 Bill related to the possible existence of certain discriminatory provisions in existing trust deeds. At the time of the 1989 Bill, the former Attorney-General, the Hon. Lionel Bowen, acknowledged the strength of the concern raised by my predecessor, the former member for Menzies. The Government agreed to amend the Bill to prohibit the exercise of discretionary trust powers in a discriminatory way, thus avoiding the need to amend some 120,000 trust deeds, which would certainly have placed a very heavy burden on the superannuation industry; in turn, undoubtedly such costs would have been passed on to beneficiaries. It is pleasing that most of the concerns we had with that Bill in 1989 have been addressed by the Government. In September of last year the Government introduced the Sex Discrimination Bill 1990. However, after receiving representations from the superannuation industry and having re-examined the drafting of the 1990 Bill, the Government subsequently withdrew the Bill and replaced it with the 1991 Bill that is now the subject of consideration. As I have mentioned, section 41 of the Act exempts arrangements relating to superannuation from the provisions of that Act that prohibit acts or practices that are discriminatory on the basis of sex or marital status. Subsection (1) is in the following terms: Nothing in division I or 2 renders it unlawful for a person to discriminate against another person, on the ground of the other person's sex or marital status, in the terms or conditions appertaining to a superannuation or provident fund or scheme. A similar exemption can be found in subsection (4) relating to the provision of insurance. The relevant provisions in division 1 and 2 are sections 14 and 22. By reason of section 14, it is unlawful to discriminate on the grounds of sex, marital status or pregnancy in, inter alia, the terms and conditions of employment that the employer affords the employee. The provision of superannuation is a condition of employment for the purposes of section 14. Under section 22 of the Act it is unlawful to discriminate on the grounds of sex, marital status or pregnancy in the provision of goods, services or facilities for payment or not in any of the following ways: by refusing to provide such goods or services; in the terms or conditions by which such goods or services are provided; or in the manner in which such goods or services are provided. The test for deciding whether certain Acts are discriminatory is set out in sections 5 and 6 of the Act. When Parliament passed the Sex Discrimination Act in late 1983 it was originally intended that the superannuation and insurance exemptions under section 41 would operate only for a two-year period. However, it became clear that there were many complex issues involved and that it was necessary for these specific exemptions to be extended indefinitely. At that time because of the complexity of the issues-and they are certainly complex; hardly compelling, but complex-it was agreed that before any action was taken to remove the exemptions there should be a comprehensive inquiry into the problems raised by the life insurance and superannuation industries in the various submissions they made on the proposed legislation. Accordingly, in September 1984 the then Attorney-General asked the then Human Rights Commission to report upon the appropriateness of these exemptions, whether they should be amended and, if so, the form such amendments should take. In November 1986 the newly constituted Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission produced a report on the superannuation exemption and more recently, in September last year, produced a second report dealing with the insurance exemption. As the Commission pointed out in its November 1986 report: The need for an interim exemption of this nature is clear. Although many superannuation schemes, both public and private, are now non-discriminatory, a number of schemes particularly in the private sector, contain discriminatory conditions. I should perhaps illustrate this point with a couple of examples of superannuation arrangements which could, prima facie, be said to be discriminatory. One example would be if a superannuation deed provided that the pay-out would apply to different retirement ages for men and women. Another example-one which is not too common these days but nonetheless, I gather, still exists-is a dowry provision whereby a woman retiring to marry would receive a smaller payout than she would receive were she retiring for some other reason. I now turn to the provisions in part 2 of the Bill. Part 2 of the Bill deals with the exemption given to superannuation. Although part 2 also redrafts the insurance exemption, the substance of that exemption remains the same. For reasons that I shall explain in a moment, the provisions of part 2, when they come into operation, will prohibit henceforth most, although not all, forms of direct discrimination in relation to the provision of superannuation benefits. In essence, the provisions will remove the broad exemption conferred by subsection 41(4) as it is presently drawn and replace it with a number of more limited exemptions. It is pretty much common ground that, in this respect, the Bill represents a sensible yet modest proposal. Clause 8 of the Bill will introduce new proposed sections 41A and 41B. Under proposed new section 41A, which introduces the new limited exemptions, discrimination on the grounds of sex or marital status in the provision of superannuation benefits will not be unlawfulI repeat: not be unlawful-in four types of situations. Those situations are: first, where the discrimination arises in regard to the use of actuarial or statistical data in superannuation fund conditions and the discrimination is reasonable having regard to that data and any other unspecified relevant factors; secondly,where discrimination arises because superannuation fund conditions in relation to a superannuation benefit do not provide benefits, or provide less generous benefits, for persons who do not have a legal or de facto spouse or do not have a child; thirdly, where the discrimination arises in relation to vesting, preservation or portability of benefits; and, finally, where the discrimination arises in respect of more favourable conditions available to a member of a superannuation scheme to which proposed new section 41 B applies than are available to a new member of a nondiscriminatory scheme to which proposed new section 41A applies. One would need to be listening carefully to this to follow! The provisions of proposed new section 41A apply in relation to any new superannuation schemes which come into place after the commencement of the Bill, which, as I have mentioned, will be two years after royal assent. Under proposed new section 41B a broader exemption will apply in cases where three requirements have been met, namely; the person or beneficiary was a member of a superannuation fund in existence before the commencement of part 2; the person had been given an option to obtain non-discriminatory benefits and had not exercised the option; and the Commission had not issued a specific exemption under section 44 in relation to that superannuation scheme. Accordingly, whilst existing funds which do not comply with the reforms set out in the Bill will be able to continue to operate and their trustees or administrators will not be liable to complaints about discrimination, their members are to be given an option to obtain non-discriminatory superannuation benefits. Even in that situation, however, by reason of clause 9, the Commission will be able to grant blanket exemptions to existing superannuation schemes on a case by case basis under section 44 of the Act. The Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia Ltd, in a submission on the Bill, has raised a number of concerns with its drafting. Some of these cerns will be picked up in the committee stage in the form of some amendments that I will be moving. My amendments will not be addressing all of the concerns that the Association has raised. It may well be that my colleagues in the Senate can look into the matter in further detail with a view to deciding whether the Bill should be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. That will be for them to determine. The purpose of such a referral would be to allow the Association, and other interested parties, to make submissions on the desirability or otherwise of there being even further amendments to the Bill. For the moment I wish to focus on two issues of policy that have been raised by the Association. First, clause 6, which amends section 14 of the Act, provides that it is unlawful for trustees to discriminate on the grounds of sex or marital status when exercising a discretion in relation to the payment of a superannuation benefit. Under this clause, it may be possible for an aggrieved person or beneficiary to make a complaint to the Commission and, in addition, pursue legal proceedings against the trustee in State courts under the general law of trusts. Subsection 10(4) of the Act provides that, where a person initiates proceedings under State anti-discrimination law, he or she is not entitled to make a complaint to the Commission. However, there is nothing in the Act preventing a member or beneficiary from first making a complaint to the Commission, which possibly could be used as a fishing expedition to gain evidential material, and then pursuing legal proceedings' in the State court under the general law of trusts. Under the law of trusts, trustees are obliged to act reasonably, impartially and fairly. However, as would be expected, there is no specific prohibition against the exercise of a discretion in a discriminatory manner on the grounds of sex or marital status. The double jeopardy problem posed by clause 6-that a person can make a complaint to the Commission and then later pursue court proceedings-is con- an ongoing one in the area of human rights and administrative law remedies. There are obvious benefits in allowing a person to Pllrsue a claim before the Commission, particularly when such a person lacks the financial resources needed in order to pursue traditional court proceedings, and for these reasons it would, in our view, be inappropriate to deprive persons of the right to pursue a complaint to the Commission. However, I should emphasise that the broader issue of appropriate remedies in the administrative law area is one which should be subject to careful examination. I note, for example, that the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Consti- . tutional Affairs, in its reference on the cost of justice, has decided to examine this sort of issue. It is my understanding that the Committee is looking at some of the problems which relate to the enforceability of determinations made by the Commission, which at the moment can only be done by way of a hearing de novo or, in other words, a hearing in full. It is also an issue which I will be looking at in further detail as part of the coalition's law and justice policy. The second policy issue that the Superannuation Association has raised relates to the option to transfer to non-discriminatory benefits. Under the provisions of the proposed section 41 B such an option must be exercisable in a two month period and before the commencement of that section, which will be two years after receiving royal assent. The Association has claimed that having to provide such an option to transfer will cause some financial and administrative hardship. However, in the light of the objects of this Bill and the more general objects which can be found in section 3 of the Act, we are of the view that it is appropriate that such options be made available. If we look at section 3 of the Act we see that paragraph (b) provides that one of the objects of the Act is the elimination of: . . . so far as it is possible, discrimination against persons on the ground of sex, marital status or pregnancy in the areas of work, accommodation, work education, the provision of goods, facilities and services . . . and so forth. However, in order to alleviate some of the concerns that the superannuation industry has with this measure, I foreshadow that during the committee stage I will be moving an amendment whereby the two month period referred to will be amended so that-",12
6,Mr DUFFY,SEX DISCRIMINATION,"You will be moving an amendment?  amendment, as the Minister has justifiably said, and I take it with some pleasure and honour. Had I been around at the time, I may well have sought to amend the Commandments.",16
7,Mr DUFFY,SEX DISCRIMINATION,"I do not think there is any question about that.  it in stone! I will be moving those amendments whereby the two month period referred to will be amended so that the relevant period shall be 12 months. This will allow sufficient time for all those in the industry to adjust their practices. I should also foreshadow that my colleague the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) will be moving an ameJ1.dment to clause 7 dealing with the relationship between section 40 of the Sex Discrimination Act and certain provisions of the Immigration Act. While my mind is on amendments-it must be by way either of my power of reasoning or some form of osmosis-some effect occurring-because, as I recall, the Attorney is going to move an amendment himself; is that not right?",16
8,Mr DUFFY,SEX DISCRIMINATION,"Yes, a couple; technical ones.  sloppy drafting that had been approved earlier. I will wind up my comments on the Bill by making some general remarks on the state of law reform in the area of sexual discrimination. The history behind this measure shows that the pace of law reform, for want of a better expression, is somewhat glacial. We start off with a report by the Commission in October 1986 making certain recommendations for the removal of the broad exemption for superannuation arrangements and its substitution with more limited exemptions. These recommendations are then translated into a Bill presented to the Parliament in May 1989. With the interruption of the 1990 election, we see the introduction of a further Bill in September 1990, the withdrawal of that Bill, and the reintroduction of a similar Bill in March of this year. I should make it clear that there is certainly reason to say we should not rush into making changes of this type, but it is equally clear that progress in this particular area has been rather slow. The Government now has before it the second report of the Commission dealing with the insurance exemption, and I sincerely hope that the Government can respond to it in a prompt and timely manner. In January of last year the Commission made a submission to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in relation to its Inquiry into Equal Opportunity and Equal Status for Australian Women. In that submission the Commission pointed out that there were three areas which require closer examination with a view to change, they being the promotion of educational programs, the handling of com- . plaints, and further legislative changes. At pages 32 to 38 of the submission a number of recommendations were made for particular legislative change, including such issues as the enforcement of determinations, vicarious liability and parental. responsibilities. I urge the Government to have a close look at that submission, and I hope that as with the Commission's more recent report dealing with the insurance exemption, the Government can give these matters early consideration and early attention. There is another matter that I will leave to my colleague the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) to elaborate upon. He has worked tirelessly in a variety of areas in this Parliament, and is regarded by us on this side of the Houseand would be so regarded if there were more open-mindedness on the other side-as the pre-eminent authority on superannuation in this Parliament. I would wish him to address the present situation in respect of the provision of superannuation relating to women and part time employees, and the positive policies that the coalition has to address in this particular area. I conclude by emphasising that the coalition is supportive of the overall thrust of the Bill as representing a moderate and a sensible reform in this area, a reform which attempts to strike a balance between the practical concerns of the superannuation industry and the need to pursue the equal opportunity objectives underlying the Sex Discrimination Act. Therefore, as I say, we will be supporting the Bill.",16
9,Mrs CROSIO,SEX DISCRIMINATION,"1 too rise to support this Sex Discrimination Amendment Bill 1991. I was very pleased, though it finally took nearly 30 minutes, to hear the honourable member for  believe is one of. the most important parts of this legislation, and that is guaranteeing financial security for women and providing them with the same opportunities as those given to men during their retirement years. As the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) has outlined in the second reading speech, the major effect of the Sex Discrimination Amendment Bill 1991 is to remove most forms of direct discrimination on the grounds of sex and marital status from superannuation practices for new schemes. The National Agenda for Women which was launched by our Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in 1988 stated that a number of objectives with regard to superannuation were: to assist in significantly increasing coverage and adequacy of coverage for women; to encourage and facilitate superannuation arrangements which are more· responsive to women's work force patterns; and to remove discrimination in superannuation on the grounds of sex, marital status or pregnancy. This Bill that is now finally before the House is a realisation of that last objective. The objectives outlined in the national agenda with regard to superannuation, together with a large part of this Bill, address what, as I said at the beginning of my remarks, is a very important issue, namely, women having the same opportunities as men to provide for a financial, secure retirement. The fact is that at present women make up 70 per cent of all of those persons dependent on the age pension but only 60 per cent of all people of pensionable age, which illustrates the extent of inequality in the opportunities available to men and women to provide for their retirement. Unless positive steps are taken, this situation will perpetuate. The Hawke Labor Government's retirement income policy released in 1989 was . evidence of the Government's continuing concern about the financial security of all Australians in retirement, and certainly our Government's commitment to ensuring that financial security in retirement is a reality for everyone. The retirement income policy sees superannuation as the key to better incomes in retirement, arid will ensure that people already on pensions have opportunities to supplement their incomes and those still in the work force will be able to save more for their retirement years. While the Government has a firm commitment to providing support for people who have not been able to save during their working lives, the new retirement policy will enhance the opportunities of greater savings during that time. Until recently superannuation was pretty much a benefit for the well-off and we as a nation had become accustomed to thinking that the aged pension system-which has, I might add, been around for some 80 years-was the only means of providing income in retirement for the average worker. Just as most people now enjoy a higher standard of living than the generation before, they also expect that when they retire they will have a higher standard of living than their parents experienced in retirement. However, the ageing of the Australian population will put such a burden on our pension system in the future that it is unlikely that this expectation will be fulfilled. In the year 2021 it is expected that 18 per cent of the population will be 65 and over compared with 11 per cent today. This is a grim thought for any government trying to balance a budget, especially now since the age pension exceeds some 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. This is why the Government has encouraged the spread of superannuation in the work force through award-based super. The Government is trying to change superannuation reasonable benefit limits, or RBLs, as they are called, to encourage annuities-that is, equal annual payments-and to remove the disadvantage of purchasing annuities in pension and benefit income tests. To increase total retirement income adequacy the Government is extending superannuation coverage across the labour force, is increasing the levels of contribution, ensuring that superannuation benefits are not lost when an employee changes jobs and is making superannuation more responsive to women's patterns of working, which this Bill, I am pleased to say, deals with. The Government· is ensuring that superannuation is not wasted before or at retirement. In September 1985 the Government agreed with the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) to three per cent of wages being paid as new or improved superannuation as part of a productivity agreement. Subsequently, this agreement was broadly endorsed by the then Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. The major advantage of three per cent award superannuation is that it involves a full and immediate vesting which is preserved to retirement on or after the age of 55 years. It thus overcomes a major problem associated with traditional employer-provided superannuation;· that is, employees did nor-have a vested employer benefit unless they remained with an employer for a long time. If employees changed jobs, they often received no benefit from the contributions made by their former employers. This discouraged many from joining superannuation schemes even when they were available. Employees, particularly women, who change their jobs a number of times throughout their working lives were disadvantaged. The overall result of the Federal Government's commitment to improving superannuation has been to extend the benefits of superannuation to a much larger proportion of the labor force than ever before, and to introduce arrangements which will ensure that employees receive an adequate benefit at retirement. The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) figures released on 13 August 1990 indicated that superannuation coverage for Australian workers dramatically improved in the years 1988-89, when the proportion of employees covered by superannuation rose to 54.6 per cent in that period compared with 44 per cent in 198788 and 41.6 per cent in 1986-87. Of public sector employees, 90.4 per cent had superannuation coverage in 1988-89 compared with only 68 per cent in 1987-88. In the private sector, the total proportion of coverage increased to 40.6 per cent in 1988-89, up from 34.1 per cent in the previous financial year. While the figures are pleasing, it is still a matter of concern that only 75 per cent of those who have an entitlement to superannuation under an award actually have superannuation coverage. I am pleased to note from comments made by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) in August last year that the Government has developed a national strategy to deal with non-compliance with the Federal award based occupational superannuation provisions. I understand that the strategy, which is being developed in consultation with the ACTU and the Confederation of Australian Industry, will include education and information elements designed to ensure that employers and employees are aware of their rights and obligations. It will also include a program of inspections, targeted at industry where the compliance levels are considered unacceptable. While our achievements in extending superannuation across the work force are to be applauded, it must be acknowledged that a lot of women will not benefit from it and thus will not be any closer to financial security in retirement because superannuation as we know it is not responsive to women's patterns of work. The following statistics illustrate my meaning: The labour force participation rate of women at 57 per cent is well below the male rate of 75 per cent. Women are highly segregated into the lower paid occupations; nearly 55 per cent of all women are employed as clerks, sales persons or personal service workers. In 1989, of all full time managers and administrators, only 19 per cent were women. A high proportion of their employment is in part time work, and women occupy almost 80 per cent of all part time jobs. While women's employment patterns certainly are changing, the majority of women today still have broken working careers and tend to have left the paid work force well before the age of 60. While I accept that there is an argument that award-based superannuation is an effective means of providing superannuatiori to the majority of women who currently receive no superannuation, especially as it provides superannuation benefits to part time employees and those who change jobs frequently, I think the fact that in 1988-89 only 36 per cent of women had superannuation coverage underscores my point that superannuation is currently not responsive to women's work patterns. It was therefore pleasing to see in the retirement income policy a recognition that women's different working patterns need to be reflected in superannuation arrangements and a commitment to do something about it. In this regard a major step forward was accomplished with changes to personal superannuation which from 1 July 1990 saw people working as little as 10 hours a week now able to contribute to personal superannuation and receive a tax deduction. Also, people will be able to continue to contribute to superannuation for up to two years while outside the paid work force. This is of obvious benefit to women and the amendments proposed in the Bill before the House represent further positive steps towards making superannuation more responsive to women's patterns of work. The amendments are likely to increase the opportunity for part time employees to gain access to superannuation. This will significantly improve opportunities for women to build up a worthwhile superannuation entitlement over their working lives. The Bill also proposes to insert a number of limited exemptions into the Act. The first area of exemption is where the discrimination arises in regard to the use of actuarial or statistical data in superannuation fund conditions. The provision enables funds to include in their fund conditions discriminatory provisions which are based on actuarial or statistical data from a source on which it is reasonable to rely. The second area of exemption is where discrimination arises because the superannuation fund conditions in relation to a dependant superannuation benefit do not provide benefits, or provide lesser benefits, for persons who do not have a legal or de facto spouse or do not have a child. In the absence of this exemption a single person may have been able to claim that he or she had been discriminated against on the grounds of marital status because the conditions of the fund did not provide such benefits in his or her circumstances while providing such benefits to persons of a different marital status in similar circumstances. The third area of exemption is where the discrimination arises in relation to vesting, preservation and portability of benefits. This exemption deals only with indirect discrimination. So should a fund directly discriminate in that it differentiates by reference to a person's sex in regard to vesting, preservation or portability of benefits, a person aggrieved would be able to bring a complaint of discrimination under the Act. Where funds are unable to comply with the new obligations under the Bill, the reasonable expectations of the members will be maintained and the discriminatory fund will be allowed to continue. However, if these funds do not comply, they will not be entitled to admit new members. Members of such discriminatory schemes will have to be given the option to obtain nondiscriminatory superannuation benefits unless an exemption is provided by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission under section 44 of the Act. Section 40 of the principal Act contains exemptions from the Act for actions taken under certain statutes and provides a power for Acts to be included in the exempt list by regulation. This will .be amended by clause 7 to give a list of Acts which action taken under will be exempt. We are already aware til at these will include the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act 1935 and the Social Security Act 1947. I am pleased to see that the Bill is drafted so that the amendments dealing with superannuation will not come into operation until two years after the date of royal assent, whereas other prQvisions will commence on 1 August 1991. I note that Commonwealth schemes will be amended in separate legislation to comply with the Act. I agree with the Attorney-General that the amendments outlined above represent a significant reform. We have progressed another step in the facilitation of superannuation arrangements that are more responsive to women's work force patterns. The Government has pursued a comprehensive strategy to improve the participation and status of women in the labour market based on the premise that women are fully entitled to the same opportunities as male workers and that it is a nonsense for a country to ignore half of its human resources. On this basis alone, it makes good sense to update the Sex Discrimination Act in regard to superannuation especially and to cater for any further increases in the female labour force participation rate. I remind the House of the remaining aspects of the National Agenda for Women action plan with regard to superannuation; that is, to monitor the implicatioil.s of the national wage case decision on superannuation for women, having regard to their broken work force patterns and occupational segregation; to consider superannuation safety net alternatives in the light of women's dual role of homemakers and members of the paid work force; to introduce standards for vesting, preservation and portability of superannuation benefits within five years which do not indirectly discriminate against women; to review the report of the Australian Law Reform Commission on matrimonial property and, if necessary, to take initiatives to compensate for loss of superannuation on divorce; and to promote the awareness of the benefits of superannuation coverage for women in their own right. Obviously there is still more to be done towards ensuring that women have the same opportunities as men to provide for a financially secure retirement. However, this Bill is certainly a significant step in the right direction. I commend the Attorney-General for the way the Bill has been amended prior to being brought before the House and will be amended during the committee stage following a number of minor recommendations. Most particularly, I commend the Government for finally bringing to fruition agenda items that cover women in the work force-and in the part time work forcethat were not covered in the past. I commend the Bill to the House.",17
10,Mr CONNOLLY,SEX DISCRIMINATION,"Bradfield) (10.45)I totally agree with the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) that the Sex Discrimination Amendment Bill is a significant piece of legislation; but I think would not be inappropriate to draw to the attention of the House the fact that on 24 January 1989-some time ago-the Government gave a commitment to introduce into this House amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act that would effectively remove exemptions regarding superannuation for women, particularly part time employees, to give them full access to superannuation. Subsequently, on 30 May of that year, we debated virtually the same piece of legislation in this House. I spoke on that occasion, and I could perhaps be forgiven for repeating on this occasion precisely the same speech as I made then. In deference to my colleagues I shall not, but many of the points made then are still appropriate today. I make it quite clear that there are fundamental weaknesses in this legislation. While the Opposition supports the Billbecause, clearly, any improvement has to be supported-the fact remains that although this legislation will help women in full time employment and in part time employment it will do nothing to help women in casual or seasonal employment. The honourable member for Prospect would be the first to agree with me that that is one of the major employment sources for women in the Australian work force. The honourable member for Prospect also made the observation, quite correctly, that the present Government's retirement income policy, in its more recent manifestation, made three important commitments. It said, firstly, that it was going to do something about this problem; secondly, that it was going to introduce the 10-hour work rule, by which any woman who was able to demonstrate 10 hours of work would qualify for superannuation-provided, of course, that the employer was prepared to fund her, and certain arrangements have since been made to establish at least the legal requirements for that; and thirdly, and the most important reform of all, that women who left the work force for two years would be able to continue to obtain suit perannuation coverage, claim a tax deduction, and fund it themselves. Having read those observations, one has to conclude that the Government was driven to make those changes not by any outstanding motivation on its own part but in response to the Opposition's retirement income policy, which was released in 1988, well before the Government's policy release in 1989. The Liberal Party was the first party in Australia's history to identify the fundamental problem that under Australian labour arrangements discrimination against women has beenand in many respects still is-an historical fact. Despite discrimination now being removed from the field of superannuation to some extent-a decision the Opposition supports-the Commonwealth is still responsible for major discrimination against women in the field of retirement. I.draw specific attention to the fact that the social security arrangements still require women to leave the work force at age 60. While this gives the opportunity to some employers not necessarily to follow that requirement, the fact is that availability of the pension for women at that age has gone down in history as a de facto retirement age. So. 'to this day it remains a fundamental problem that even if women are contributing to superannuation-assuming that they have the same level of contribution rates and the same level of theoretical benefits over the same period of labour-they are being deprived of benefits they would otherwise be entitled to from the additional five years. The Government has, therefore, failed to address this fundamental issue, despite the fact that it was raised by the Cass Social Security Review paper Towards a National Retirement Incomes Policy, which was .released some time ago - males. In our retirement income policy we have stated our desire to remove this discrimination against women by the year 2002; it will be phased in over a 10-year period. The Government remains silent on this subject. Retirement at age 60 for women appears to be founded upon the old British public service requirement for single female typists. It might interest members of the House to know that women in those days were actually referred to as 'type writers', because that was the major area of women's employment outside factories and domestic service in the British public service, a tradition that was carried through into the Australian Public Service. Why were those women required to retire early? It was for two basic reasons: firstly, because they may have wanted to look after their aged parents. How they were supposed to do this without access to a decent retirement income was something that completely escaped the males of the day, who quite obviously had something to do with those policies. For generations, working women-especially those who were unmarried-were grossly discriminated against in both the public and private sector.· Secondly, apart from the age discrimination to which I have referred, the other major area of discrimination in superannuation was in relation to access and to the level of benefits. Until relatively recently, the provision of superannuation for women in the work force has been limited. In many cases, women entering into superannuation after it was provided were delayed for as long as 10 years to 15 years, whereas a male employee-doing identical work-would have access to superannuation, sometimes in as short a period as six months. In some cases in more historic times, which fortunately are past, there would oe a delay of up to five years. Nevertheless, on joining a fund a female contributor would then find herself in the interesting situation where the level of benefits which would accrue to her were significantly less than those available to Women were required to pay a level of contribution comparable to th-t of males, but in return were prevented from receiving any benefits relating to a married person with or without dependants. It seemed to have been assumed that if one were a female and in the work force that, ergo, one would not be married and would have no dependants. Is it any wonder that the need for reform in this area is so fundamentally obvious? One could question why the Labor Government, which started its reform program for superannuation in June 1983, has taken so long to address this fundamental issue which goes to the heart of the fact that some 50 per cent of the Australian work force are women and are entitled to the same basic support, equality of opportunity and access to incomes and retirement benefits as men. Until quite recently, unmarried women were precluded from death cover even though, in many cases, they may have been responsible for the maintenance of their aged parents, the children of their brothers and sisters or other relations. To assume that they are not married is an absurdity because most women are married at some stage of their lives. At no time did a male-whether married or unmarried-face a similar level of discrimination in regard to superannuation. The different levels of benefits were also seen in the context of the level of thecontributions required. Whereas a male usually received five or six times final salary, a female doing similar work was often restricted to three or four times final salary; One can only assume that a woman in retirement spends less than a male! When this lower level of benefit was combined with a restriction on entry into superannuation and with limited access to life assurance coverage, it will be appreciated that women in the work force have suffered very significant discrimination compared with men. The old marriage bar in the Commonwealth Public Service, which remained in place until 1966, is another outstanding example of overt discrimination against women. Upon marriage, a female public servant was obliged by law to resign from her position. Years later-assuming that she had no children and that her marriage had failed-she was able to once again get back into the work force or the Public Service and take a career position. In this situation those lost years would mean that the level of benefit at the end would be significantly less than it would have been if these women had the right to remain in employment regardless of their domestic situations. . In every case their period out of the work force has significantly affected their level of end benefits through superannuation. It is time to say that those bars of the 1960s have gone. They have now faded into the historical past, but they should not be forgotten. They are still influencing the retirement income arrangements of many thousands of women who were in the work force, either prior to that or soon afterwards, and whose entry into the work force was delayed because of the continuation of those outrageous arrangements for too long. There are other problems, however, which have not been addressed in this legislation. I draw attention specifically to the problem of women who directly or indirectly have contributed to the overall superannuation coverage of their husbands, but who are not covered by the superannuation arrangements which may have then been made, especially in the event of the dissolution of their marriage. Access to the share of the funds, irrespective of whether the marriage is still in place, is still a fundamental problem. On 30 May 1989, in this House, I said: I regret that in this legislation the opportunity was not taken by members of the Government, . .. especially at the second reading stage, at least to draw attention to this fact and perhaps suggest to the House that the time has come when the relevant Family Law Act should be amended to ensure that we take out of the flexibility, . . . of the judicial process what is indisputably a fundamental right which should to all married women-,---that is, a share of the superannuation benefits to which they have contributed directly or indirectly, irrespective of the circumstances pertaining to their final marriage circumstances. That still remains an outstanding problem which must be addressed. The honourable member for Prospect, who spoke before me, naturally and rightly put on the record the basic statistics concerning some of the problems relating to women in the work force. I would like to repeat some of these statistics: some 63 per cent of males in full time employment are now covered by superannuation, whereas only 47 per cent of full time female employees are covered-I might add that most of those are in the State or Commonwealth Public Service; in the private sector, the level of female coverage of superannuation still remains totally unsatisfactory and is something which must be given considerable attention in the future; in the part time area, which is the fundamental problem relating to this legislation, the figure is even lower-20 per cent of males and only 19 per cent of females are covered, and 37 per cent of women work part time. In other words, women constitute a very significant proportion of the total part time element. The Government and the honourable member for Prospect have emphasised the fact that, at least in theory, the Government is doing something about this. Let us examine that in detail. The Government said, as I said earlier, that it has introduced a two-year rule, which is a good thing. It has also allowed a $3,000 tax deduction which, again, was completely stolen from the Opposition's retirement income policy. The reality is this: when one is talking about millions of people who are covered, either directly or indirectly, whether they be in contributory schemes or noncontributory schemes, superannuation is extraordinarily complex. When the average Australian worker changes his or her job about once every six years, we can appreciate the difficulty of maintaining records over a 30-year or 40-year occupational life span. Those problems have rell\te not yet been adequately addressed by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. That is one fundamental difficulty we face. If honourable members look through the annual reports of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, they will find that over $10.8m of unclaimed funds have gone into Consolidated Revenue because people forget that they actually had assurance cover through industrial endowment insurance. We are facing exactly the same problem now with the 3 per cent industry fund arrangements. The truth of the matter is that many thousands of Australian workers, especially those with temporary and part time occupations, are not aware of the fact that they are entitled to the 3 per cent. They move on to job after job, do not make the necessary inquiries and, therefore, some employers do not make the necessary arrangements. We have already reached the situation where literally hundreds of millions of dollars to which Australian workers are entitled under law are not being paid. The long term problem with this is something that we all have to share. With an ageing population the reality simply is that the size of the welfare bill in the future is going to go in one directionthat is, upwards-unless we can put in plac- an effective superannuation scheme which will have the effect of ensuring that those people whose level of income is adequate throughout their lives to take them above the threshold of access to the current pension arrangements will be expected to be independent and be given taxation support to achieve that independence; whereas for the bulk of people who expect in the future to be beneficiaries of Commonwealth funded pension arrangements, it is to the advantage of all Australian citizens that we reduce the percentage who are dependent upon full pensions by increasing the capacity of those people to contribute to superannuation throughout their lives. The realities are that, in the future, lions of those people will still qualify for part pensions, but to transfer many hundreds of thousands of people from the full pension to part pensions, using superannuation coverage as a bridge, will undoubtedly be to the long term advantage of the Australian people. Above all, it will give those people in retirement a level of financial independence which previous generations have been denied. The significance of this legislation therefore rests on the extent to which we are now able to say to women in the Australian work force, 'You are better off. You now have access to superannuatiori and you can make the necessary decisions'. There is one fundamental problem, however, which the Government has not addressed; that is, as I said earlier, the mechanism to make this transference really a viable opportunity for all women, especially women who are not in full time employment. The Opposition gave considerable thought to this over the last few years. In our retirement income policy we have introduced a very flexible instrument called a' retirement savings account. That account will work precisely like a bank book. It would not draw to it the significant superannuation costs and charges, rollover costs, and approved deposit funds costs and so forth which are now part and parcel of the extraordinarily complex system put in place by the current Government. Because it works like a bank book and a bank balance, it gives to individual women in the work force in particular-or to any person in part time employment or to any person in full time employment who does not have access to superannuation-the capacity to make contributions throughout their working life. For the period when women have to drop out of the work force because of their domestic situation, their husbands would be able to contribute to the fund on their behalf and obtain tax deductibility for so doing. In other words, the retirement savings account has the benefit of acting as a bridge between those periods of a woman's life-which for many are certainly more often two or three years, depending on the number of chilmildren they have-when she can fund her superannuation and when she cannot. The sad fact of the matter is that, despite this third effort to introduce legislation into this House on this most important subject, the Government continues to miss the point that we are past the stage of making pious promises. It has been at this, as I said, since June 1983. same. The time has come when it must face the fact that the Opposition is on the right track and that retirement savings accounts are needed by the Australian work force, especially by women. The Government should now, in the two years available it, take this policy option and introduce it, because there are many millions of Australian women and many thousands of Australian men in the work force who do not have adequate superannuation coverage at this stage and who probably, under all expectations, will not. They would have the capacity. to use a retirement ment savings account for the periods they are out of the work force. They could use it when they are in the work force they have occupations which are not adnot equately covered for superannuation. Above all, they would have the fundaOpposition mental advantage that the costs involved are minimal. They would get a pension bonus built into the system because of growth of those funds over a period years in the work force and the tax free natur,e of contributions up to $3,000 annum. Finally, at age 60, they would be able to take out those funds and apply them to maintain a level of financial dependence in retirement. Retirement income policy for women today is extremely important. We are talking about over 50 per cent of the tralian work force. Their contribution therefore, of fundamental importance the economic well-being of all AustraSince lians. In addition to that, many playa vital role in the domestic affairs this country. Frankly, without them, males would have a pretty miserable life. The realities are that women who are in the work force and who are doing domestic activities, in between periods the work force, which are essentially of family nature, are not considered by policy of the current Government. The Opposition has identified this fundamenopportunity tal problem. We have identified .the need to establish a continuity throughout life of a woman to give her financial dependence in retirement. We have fered these policies to the Australian people. It is time the Government did the",21
11,Mr SNOWDON,SEX DISCRIMINATION,1 acknowledge the contribution that the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) has made. He certainly put a very enthusiastic case for his concerns to about superannuation- knowledgeable.,25
12,Mr SNOWDON,SEX DISCRIMINATION,"He may be very knowledgeable, but I wonder whether he is not distorting history somewhat. Whilst it is valid to be critical of the Governat times and, indeed, to make prowhen posals which might seek to amend legislation, it is a bit rich to come here if and to suggest that this Government has made the sort of progress that it has made and to suggest that perhaps the would have done better. I remind the honourable member, as he leaves the House, that those opposite were in the government for a long time before 1983 of and did absolutely naught. So whilst I welcome his conversion on the road to per exercising some thought about sexual discrimination in Australia, particularly as it relates to the work force and superinannuation, I would suggest that it is somewhat late. The Sex Discrimination Amendment Bill has the purpose of removing inequalAusities in three pieces of legislation-the is, Marriage Act 1961, the War Gratuity Act to 1945 and the Sex Discrimination Act. it was introduced in 1984-1984, I women stress, not 1982 or 1978-the Sex of Discrimination Act, introduced by this we Government, the Hawke Government, has made great progress in eliminating inenot qualities resulting from sex discrimination. The Act has particularly improved in women's access to employment and traina ing opportunities-a matter which I will any come to in a moment. The affirmative action legislation and equal employment programs complement the sex discrimination legislation. Of course, the the Government, Mr Deputy Speaker, as you inwould no doubt be aware, is committed ofto a fair go for women and measures promoting a greater degree of financial security and independence for women are being developed and initiated. Australian women have placed a clear priority on employment issues in their quest for equality. In 1983, only 44 per cent of girls completed secondary education. In terms of that equality, the figure is now 69.9 per cent. There is little doubt that, if the challenge of improving women's status in the labour force hinges on improved educational standards, then this Government is producing results. There is also no doubt-and I again take into account the concerns expressed by the· honourable member for Bradfieldthat, if that performance is to improve, then what the honourable member for Bradfield ought to be exhorting his colleagues to do is to support the Government's initiatives. I note that the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) announced only last Thursday that enrolments in higher education arts degrees have grown by 40 per cent in the last year and that the bulk of this growth has been provided by increased numbers of women students. Women also account for the majority of students enrolled in higher degree arts courses. These developments can only augur well for the capacity for further improvements to the economic employment position of women in A-stralian society. In terms of employment and of participation of women in the work lorce, we are already seeing results. The labour force participation rate of women has grown steadily during the period of office of the Hawke Government. In 1983, the labour force participation rate for women was 44.7 per cent; it is now over 50 per cent. Moreover, it is likely that that growth will be sustained. The traditional trend of women being first to leave the labour market during a downturn is being addressed through the Government's active employment strategy. Unemployed women will have access to training packages which will encourage them to remain in the labour force. The Government has recognised the needs of women workers,. particularly those with families-those that the honourable member for Bradfield expressed concern about. These needs have been addressed in a number of ways. They have been reflected in the recent ratification of the International Labour Organisation Convention No. 156 on workers with family responsibilities. This Convention makes it an aim of national policy to enable people with families to work significantly without conflict between their employment and family responsibilities. As a result, the Government has established the Working Family Unit as part of implementing the strategy of the convention. The Unit is examining a range of measures to assist workers to balance their work and family responsibilities. An information package for employers and unions is being developed, looking at areas such as part time and casual work, job sharing, home based work, flexible working hours, career break schemes and leave arrangements. It is obvious that these measures will be of special benefit to women workers. Of course, a corollary of the matter of women in the work force is the issue of child-care. Access to child-care is of particular importance if we are to·· assist women to enter and stay in the work force. As you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, because of your interest in the area the Government is rapidly increasing the number of affordable quality childcare places. We are aiming at having more than 250,000 places by 1995. I suggest to the honourable member for Bradfield that when he is looking at issues in relation to women in the work force and sex discrimination and equality, he might ask himself the question: why, as with so many other policy changes that the Hawke Government has introduced since 1983, did we have to wait until 1983 instead of seeing them introduced by the previous Government? Perhaps the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable  is .at the table, would also like to comment at some stage. While it is easy to be critical of the role that this Government has played-it is easy to be an observerit is sometimes worth examining one's own record in that area. The total number of Commonwealth funded community child-care places employed stands at 130,000 approved places, or nearly three times the Commonwealth provision in 1983. The provision come tested fee relief, aimed at providing child-care to low income families and parents, is improving the financial tion of many women obviously by enadiscrimination bling them to work. The Government is also providing financial incentives to courage employers to set up work based child-care schemes. A study undertaken by the Office of the Status of Women 1989 showed that employers could reduce Bradfield. labour turnover and absenteeism by providing child-care to employees. It is important, as I have stressed viously, that these sorts of proposals, policy initiatives, these programs which have been put in place by this Governand ment, are fully and totally supported. would do well if the Opposition used its influence amongst those people in the community who support it to stress the importance of these initiatives. The amendments to the Sex Discrimithey nation Act will have a telling impact opening up a key area of employment benefits to more women, that is, superwomen annuation-a matter dear to the heart of the previous speaker. The national agenda for women noted that only one in four female employees had superannuation coverage. That number has risen slightly since 1988, but there are still significantly fewer women than men with superannuaon tion. The Government sees making superanmen. nuation more attractive and accessible to women as a priority. We have introduced measures to give women incentives to contribute to a superannuation scheme, couraging particularly by addressing the areas of part time and casual employment. In the mato jority of Federal superannuation awards implemented through national wage case action, the extension of superannuation pregnancy. covered part time and casual employees. The Government has extended tax posals, concessions from July 1990 to personal superannuation contributions for the selfemployed and those with low levels of employer provided superannuation. People for as little as 10 hours a week are now able to contribute to personal superannuation schemes and receive a tax of indeduction for contributions. The new superannuation scheme for sole Commonwealth employees brought in last posiyear overcomes previous indirect against women, which operated largely because of interrupted part entime or short term employment. People have been educated on the benefits of saving for retirement-a point which was in stressed by the honourable member for All these initiatives have been taken since the Hawke Government came into prepower in 1983. They are all initiatives these which have the wide general support of people in the community. The security independence of older women can be It enhanced by improving access to superannuation. Superannuation is a particularly important issue for women, primarily because traditional family relationships are changing. Women can no longer assume will be supported by a partner in by retirement. The dependants of married couples on dual incomes increases as more enter the work force. Superannuation benefits accumulated on only one of these incomes may not be adequate income replacement for both partners. The- are more women than men in the retired population-a point which was made previously. Their life expectancy is average seven years more than that of men and they tend to retire earlier than The national agenda for women stated 'targets aimed at significantly increasing coverage and the adequacy of superannuation for women, including enand facilitating superannuation arrangements which are more responsive women's work force patterns, and removing discrimination in superannuation on the grounds of sex, marital status or I think these are very important profor two reasons. I am sure this would be of interest to members opposite. There are clearly a lot more people who are going into the work force, having famarea ilies, spending time with their families and then re-entering the work force. It important that we provide facilities that those people can gain some benefits which people in long term full time employment can gain. These sorts proposals are aimed at addressing their particular needs. However, superannuation is not ury; it is a necessity towards ensuring secure old age, and should be available all workers, not a select number, but workers. Everyone has the right to access schemes designed to provide income to security in old age. Women should not hindered in this by being penalised beappropriateness cause of the way schemes are designed and by women's different employment patterns. The Government has recognised this and put in place schemes to give women better access to superannuation. These amendments should go a long way towards giving more women better access than elsewhere. to superannuation, by replacing the current blanket exemption concerning superdisadvantage annuation under the Sex Discrimination Act. This reduction of legislative exempAlice tion contained in the amendments was part of a five-year action plan under national agenda for women. The Bill particularly addresses the of part time and casual employment. The great majority of part time employees women. About 40 per cent of women part time, compared with 6 per cent of men. Any failure to provide superannuaures tion for part time and casual employees may disproportionately disadvantage also women. The Bill does not exempt emdiscrimination ployers from an obligation to provide perannuation to part time and casual employees. Women live longer, earn less and are often out of the paid work force for subif stantial parts of their adult lives. They substantially disadvantaged by their sex. Women are also more likely than men to work part time. If women are to be enwho couraged to participate in superannuation schemes, these variables must be taken into account. That is what this legislation does. This Government's performance in the of sex discrimination and in the area of providing equality in terms of services, is the labour market, education, welfare and so health for women is unsurpassed in the of the history of this nation. Perhaps it is worth making a final comof ment on one other area, that is, health. This Government's contributions to improving women's health have been signifa luxicant. In 1990-91 the Commonwealth a allocated $16.86m over four years for a to national women's health program. This all program will aim to overcome the disadvantage suffered by women to gain access health services, due again primarily to be economic disadvantage, the cultural inin some instances, or the geographic or linguistic disadvantage. As someone who comes from what people in this place would call a remote area, the Northern Territory, I have to say that these 'sorts of disadvantages are suffered more by women in that part of Australia One has to look only at the locational that women suffer, say, in Tennant Creek, or in Katherine, or in Springs to a lesser extent, but significantly in remote Aboriginal communithe ties. They also suffer because of the cultural appropriateness or otherwise of area mechanisms and schemes that have been put in place. There is absolutely no doubt are that in those instances they suffer the work worse economic disadvantage. I believe that, with the sorts of measwhich this Government has addressed, not only in this legislation but in other legislation involved with sex and the particular needs of suwomen, it is important that we acknowledge that in those areas there are particular needs which require special attention, because there is absolutely no doubt that we are to further our objectives of social are justice and equality in this country we have to take special care and we have to give special recognition to those people live in remote and rural areas. I applaud the Government's initiatives in the area of women's health which have been announced previously by this Government. I stress again: this legislation is extremely important, in my view, and is something which I support totally and which I am sure all honourable members of this House support.",25
13,Mr ANDERSON,SEX DISCRIMINATION,"Gwydir) 01.21)The Sex Discrimination Amendment Bill amends provisions of three Acts: the Sex Discrimination Act 1984, the Marriage Act 1961 and the War Gratuity Act 1945. Much of the coalition's position, which is essentially one of having resolved to support the Bill as a whole, notwithstanding reservations about some aspects of it, has already been more than adequately covered by the honourable member for  able member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly). Since I am not a great believer in speaking for the sake of speaking, I will restrict my remarks this morning to some general concerns that I have, although I would acknowledge at the outset that this is significant legislation, albeit legislation has been delayed for some considerable time, given that it was first introduced in 1989. In our view there are, as has been pointed out, some problems with this Bill. For example, women in casual, part time or seasonal work will not find their situation adequately addressed by the provisions of this amendment; nor does the question of the earlier retirement age for women in the Australian Public ServiCe60 years as opposed to 65 years for menlook like being properly addressed by this Government. For that matter, women affected by this problem face the prospect of losing considerable benefits which should accrue to them as a result of being able to work, as we say they should be able to work, until a retirement age of 65. As elaborated on at some length by the honourable member for Bradfield this morning, the coalition is committed to the correction of this particular problem. In considering this matter, I found myself looking back over some of the contributions made to the original Sex Discrimination Act 1983. I was interested to note that at that time the honourable member for Berowra (Dr Harry Edwards) stated that he believed such was the significance of that legislation that it should from time to time be reviewed. I think he had a good point. Given the changing nature of our society and the fundamentally important nature of the sorts of issues covered by this legislation, it would be a good idea to check progress against the original intent of the 1983 legislation. There can be no doubt that many of the changes in attitudes and relationships between the sexes in Australia over the last three or four decades have been positive; they have been good. Male chauvinism is not as ugly nor as prevalent in Australia as it once was, and no-one would deny the importance of fair and, wherever applicable, equal opportunities and general equality in the areas of work, education, pay and the like. In many ways these increased opportunities have produced quite surprising and, I think, quite positive results. One that example that springs to mind which interests me is the great surge in the percentage of female students undertaking study in previously male dominated areas, such as the law, veterinary science and even engineering. I note that in 1983 there were only six female members in this place and, to the great shame of some members on our side, that they were all on the other side of the House at that time! That situation has been considerably improved upon, I am sure to the great pleasure of all observers. In general terms, many of the sorts of changes have no doubt been valuable and will continue to be so. However, I have to say that I am far from convinced that the 1983 legislation has of itself necessarily been responsible for all of those positive changes, and I confess to deep - eservations about the role of that original Act. I would like to pose a few questions. For example, I would like to ask: is it really legitimate to equate equality with the numbers of like jobs shared between men and women? Is it really legitimate for our society to equate equality with the degree of like payor remuneration between men and women? Is it really legitimate to define status and standing in terms of the nature of a job, or the levels reached within a profession, or the income earned at all-or do we run the risk of distorting our community's value systems in unwise ways? Is my wife to be accorded some lower status in society because I have what might be regarded as a relatively significant-I sometimes wonder about thatand highly paid job, whilst for the time being she has given up her work in order to parent and nurture olir two children? Perhaps, in fact, she has the more critical role in raising and nurturing future generations of young Australians. Is it legitito mate for us to insist on affirmative action of the sort which must leave some women wondering whether or not they got their jobs because they earned them .on merit and performance, or whether perhaps they hold their position on account of their sex? Is it right to risk implying that if we work hard to keep the family together in the recession struck farm sector but receive no official recognition nor financial remuneration, let alone have access to superannuation, we are somehow not to be as valued by society? Is it not unwise tq allow or even encourage the development of the view that an unpaid volunteer worker, who puts in countless hours of charitable works or whatever, is somehow not worthy of the same status as a highly paid social worker with a clearly defined career path? These questions are prompted in my mind by the issue of superannuation and the fact that it is yet another mark of one's status in our community as we seek to ensure, I guess, quite correctly, that it is extended to women in the same way that it is extended to men in broad terms as part of their conditions of employment. The fact is that many women across Australia in fact do not receive either wages or superannuation in return for the work that they do. In other words, many women who should enjoy enormous standing and status in our community will be left untouched by this legislation. I would suggest that, though they be left untouchedmany of them might choose voluntarily to continue doing exactly what they are doing-they should not be left unnoticed or unrecorded on that basis. For example, many farm women are experiencing immense difficulties at present as a result of the economic crisis in the bush, abnormally exacerbated by. the recession that we are told we had to have. Last week, the honourable member for MCEwen (Mrs Bailey) in this place referred to the Queensland University survey entitled Lives of Rural WomenProblems and Prospects for Employment. The survey found '.that many women in rural Australia have\workloads equivalent two or three full time jobs, but they are very often not described as having a full time job at all. Many farm families would simply not survive without the contribution of their womenfolk, who work hard, especially hard during downturns like the one we are witnessing at the present, without claiming pay, let alone having access to superannuation. Often, apart from caring for the home and the family and fulfilling those sorts of, if you like, very traditional roles that mothers and wives play, these womeri will help out with the mustering on the farm, the tractor driving, the farm maintenance and the farm books and still find time to involve themselves in community activities and charitable works. In fact, only some 17 per cent of them work off-farm as well. I guess many of them do not have access to off-farm work, but 17 per cent of them do work off-farm in an attempt to help raise family finances and to continue the viability of the farm through this very difficult downturn. As has been noted here this morning, there is a need to ensure that such percentage of those women who do work off the farm, particularly given that many of them will be working on a part time basis only and/or do not intend working for many years, in whatever capacity it might be, have access to superannuation on a fair and reasonable basis. Moving to part 3 of the Bill, there is a provision for a common marriageable age of 18, with provision for reduction to 16 by way of a court order. I want to touch on this because it raises another area of concern that I have. It goes to the very heart of our national life in that it relates to the traditional basis, under some attack from certain quarters of our society-that is, the family unit. There is little doubt that the family unit is under enormous stress in Australia today. I was rather prised, although I should not have been, to learn the other day that no less than one in three marriages in Australia fail and that for second marriages. the figure rises to one in two. The effects on children-that is to say, the next generation of Australians-are acknowledged to be horrendous. Yet it seems to me that few want to talk about it. Everyone wants to talk about child neglect, child abuse and the problems that young people face. They also want. to talk about conventions covering the rights of the child, international or otherwise, and about more and more legislative and police protection for our kids. No-one seems to want to tackle the uncomfortable questions of why our families fail and the enormous impact that that unquestionably has on young children in our community. A little over 12 months ago, during the Federal election campaign, I was moving around the lower end of my electorate and I caught a Newcastle radio station. A schoolteacher was being interviewed and he was saying some very interesting things. He made the observation that when he began teaching at the school at which he still teaches in 1980, which was about 10 years prior to the interview, he estimated he was able to spend 90 per cent of his classroom time in effective teaching and communication with his children. Furthermore, and alarmingly, he estimated that by 1990 it had slipped to no more than 50 per cent effective teaching time in the classroom. The interviewer, reacting with some horror, asked him why that was; what had gone wrong. The teacher said, 'I spend most of my time in the classroom now helping young kids put their lives back together. I'm acting as a social worker and a disciplinarian rather than an administrator and a teacher'. The interviewer asked him what he put those factors down to and the teacher replied that, in his view, the two major impacts had been the collapse of the family and the fact that many children went home to a grossly unsatisfactory home environment, and the advent of videos. The combination of sur- those two saw many children going to school numb both physically and mentally from an exhausting night either coping with the stresses and strains of a broken family situation or the idiocy of secondrate videos and the impact that they have on young minds. If those claims are correct, we have some horrendous problems to grapple with. How indeed are we to be the clever country if we cannot even ensure that our children will leave school as balanced, reasonable thinking and intelligent young people, let alone as educated, articulate and 'clever', as we are all urged to be at the moment? I recall the wise words of someone-I cannot put my mind to his name at the moment-who said that the fortunes of a nation rise and fall with the quality of its child rearing practices. In essence, I acknowledge that the move to increase the marriageable age for females is probably a good one-not simply on the basis of fairness and equality but also on the basis that perhaps 18-yearold females are, like 18-year-old males, a little more mature than they might have been at 16 and a little less inclined to rush into hasty marriage decisions or choices about families and so on. I wonder about some of the implications-for example, what is the situation in relation to de facto marriages or de facto relationships? Can a 16or 17-yearold girl live with a male who is 18 or, for that matter, under 18? Should she be allowed to do so? Would it not constitute an anomaly to allow them a different status from those who choose traditional regular marriage but cannot marry until they are 18? Nonetheless, at age 18, as I have just said, most young people are likely to be a little more mature and a little more likely to make sensible life choices. Therefore, I am sure that is a worthwhile step. I conclude-I indicated that I did not want to talk for long today-by stating that the reforms may well be useful and timely in so far as they address the issues that have been put before us, but in my view it is surely time that we acknowledged that these measures by and large relate to the patching and stitching of the national fabric. They do not address in any substantive way in my view the underlying deterioration and breaking down of the national fabric.",29
14,Dr CATLEY,SEX DISCRIMINATION,"1 would like to speak in favour of the Sex Discrimination Amendment Bill 1991. The Bill will redress a number of barriers facing women who want to get the most from superannuation in their retirement. It will increase the opportunities for women working part time to build up a worthwhile superannuation entitlement over their working lives by removing discrimination in superannuation on the grounds of sex, marital status and pregnancy. It will do this by making a number of amendments to existing fund regulations. Superannuation funds will now be viewed as discriminatory if they refuse a person entry to the fund on the grounds that the person works only part time. It will become unlawful for a company to reject an applicant on sex or marital grounds. There will be exemptions introduced to say that the benefits of superannuation will be received only by a spouse, a de facto spouse or a dependant. This exemption recognises the fact that many women do not have the benefits of their own superannuation and. should not be disadvantaged once the superannuant dies or becomes disabled. The Bill includes amendments which will rectify discrimination in vesting, portability and preservation rules, recognising the current disadvantages faced by women who do not stay in continuous employment. The amendment will require that, from 1 July 1995, benefits such as award superannuation and personal superannuation must be preserved until 55 or retiring age. There are also provisions in the legislation for schemes which have not complied with these regulations. They can continue to operate but they must give customers the option to change to a compliant scheme, and they cannot take on any new customers. Against the background of this legislation"" I think it. is schematically useful to think of the life of an average. man or woman as divided into three principal phases. The first phase is from birth to about 20 years of age, or adulthood, and covers rearing and education. It is a period of heavy dependence on one's family or on society's provisions as a whole. The second phase, from about 20 to 60, is the phase of one's working life and/or family rearing. The third phase is the period of retirement and senior citizenship. What this Government has tried to do is improve equality for women in each of those three phases. In the. first phase the emphasis has been on non-discriminatory education policies and better opportunities for girls. Speakers in this debate have already pointed out that there has been an improvement in access of female students to areas where they had previously been in he;tvy minorities. In the second phase we have tried to improve access to employment through various affirmative action strategies, including legislation, and anti-discrimination legislation. What' the Government is trying to do in the legislation before us and in other pieces of legislation is to improve conditions available to women in the third phase of their lives-that is, retirementby providing equal opportunities for them to superannuation during their. working lives to contribute to their retirement years. It is still the case that, despite these reforms, in a wide range of industries, from. higher education to engineering, women are represented very poorly in senior decision making roles. These trends, when analysed, make it obvious that the structures needed to make a career possible for women still tend to discriminate against them. . Superannuation is one of the benefits that accrues from employment that has been designed in the past essentially for a male breadwinning work force in the sort of system envisaged by the Harvester judgment of a man with two dependent children. This discrimination has further implications today for an ageing population, the elderly being made up predominantly of women. If not rectified, this situation would see a larger number of women than men spend their retirement in poverty. I would like to look now at the ways in which women are discriminated against by current and past superannuation policies. Although more women have entered the work force of late, and many more now are taking out superannuation policie&, their rate of coverage is substantially lower than that of men. A recent study of 1,000 people by Dr Wincour and Professor Rosenman, whose report was entitled Women and Superannuation, found that superannuation coverage was higher among women in their twenties and women between 40 and 49 than among women in their thirties, which indicates that many women give up superannuation in their middle years, when they are most likely to be at home raising families. The study also found that many women have no superannuation at all in their own right but regard themselves as being covered by their spouse's superannuation. An ancillary related development is that, with the increase in divorce rates that was mentioned by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), many women are left without any superannuation coverage when they separate from their spouses. Although superannuation is considered these days in the marriage settlement-and properly sosome women who otherwise would have had the benefits of superannuation face retirement solely on the age pension. While it is true that this Government has increased the age pension in real terms by 10 per cent-and we are very proud of that achievement-it is still the case that if women had taken out private superannuation in their working years they would have been better off than they are solely on the age pension. I would like here to compliment one of the leading women trade union officials in South Australia on a motion put to the Australian Labor Party State convention last year. The motion outlined the fact that superannuation schemes tend to discriminate against women. Fiona Campbell is an official of the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association, which is predominantly comprised of women workers. Mr Sciacca-Good union. Dr CATLEy-It is a tremendously good union, one of the fastest growing in the country, with coverage in Queensland of the rapidly growing tourist industry. She pointed out that in the past these schemes have tended to exclude casual and part time employees, many of whom are women. Many women, when they come back into the work force after child rearing, do so on a casual and part time basis. The schemes have been designed for a male breadwinner with dependants and many have discriminatory entitlements with respect to female workers. Superannuation schemes have never catered for the needs of women workers, who move in and out of the work force because of their family responsibilities. In other words, many of our superannuation schemes have been designed for a male work force where there is a male pattern of employment, a pattern that assumes that the employee works for a continuous period from the time of finishing education and then leaves the work force for good and all once he or she retires. The employment pattern for women is rather different from this. It involves women working full time early on in their careers after they have left school, getting married, spending periods of time out of the paid work force altogether, and then often returning for some part time work. My wife has experienced this kind of employment structure and I am very familiar with it, as will be many men and women in this chamber. She left school, was trained in a bank, had a prospective career as a professional person in the finance industry, got married, had two children, dropped out of the work force for a period, and went back into the work force in a rather different working occupation. I am happy to report that she is now in much the same situation as she would have been had she stayed with the bank-that is,. operating finances-but that is often not the case for women who go out of the work force: when they get back in, they find themselves discriminated against, not by any particular employer but by the structure of many of our work practices. I would like now to make a few observations about the proposed' changes to superannuation against the framework of the Government's policies on women's retirement and industrial relations. The Federal Government's retirement incomes policy recognises that women are continuing to make up the majority of the aged population. As has been pointed out, they tend to live longer than men, a trend which I think may not continue into the indefinite future. As women start to take up some of the good and also some of the bad habits of men, life will tend to be more stressful, but perhaps also more rewarding, for them. Because of their ,lack of superannuation, in retirement women are tending to face greater poverty and at a higher rate than do men. In addition, when women are in the work force, even when they get access to superannuation, because of their lower structure of pay their entitlements on retirement tend to be lower. The Government is proud of its achievements for working women and we regard ourselves as having been at the forefront of reform in gender equality over the past couple of decades. Despite the statistics, which I will turn to in a moment, it is quite clear that many successful women enter public life. In my own State, Dame Roma Mitchell is a woman who has had a very distinguished career in the law and as Chancellor of the University of Adelaide, where I used to be employed. She is now Governor of the State. The Deputy Vice-Chancellor of the new and largest of the South Australian universities, the University of South Australia, Denise Bradley, is a woman. In the private sector these policies are also having their effect: Helen Lynch, a leading woman in the corporate sector, was recently appointed manager of Westpac in South Australia. As a result of its policies, the Government has increased statistically the number of women in employment and improved conditions so that more women are staying in employment. Over 40 per cent of the work force are now women, and female participation rates have increased from 29 per cent in 1966 to over 50 per cent last year as against the male participation rate of 76 per cent. It is still lower-and, for all I know, may stay lower as a result of women maintaining the option not to participate in the work force but to rear children. A study by Marc Lombard reported in yesterday's Australian confirms, among other things, that women's participation in the work force is increasing and, that women make up 43 per cent of the work force, compared with 39 per cent in 198283. It also confirms that a larger number of women are getting access to the higher income areas, although not at a rate which would suggest their equality with men. Award restructuring will provide for greater job flexibility and this will improve the possibilities of women getting part time employment, but with career paths entailed. Women who want to work must be given the opportunity to do so. We have pursued that objective and the success of that policy is reflected in a higher participation rate. That higher participation rate brings a bit of pain in that present unemployment figures are much higher than re- they would otherwise have been without the improved participation rate. The Affirmative Action Agency was formed in 1986. This year, 2,500 companies were required to report to the agency that they had implemented anti-discrimination policies with respect to their workplace. To their great credit, over 96 per cent of those required to do so have done so. Yesterday Mrs Hawke presented affirmative action awards to Australian companies which have initiated improvements to conditions for working women. Also speaking at the awards, the Director of the Australian Institute for Industrial Relations and Teaching, Professor Russell Lansbury, said: I strongly believe that affirmative action broadest sense should be one of the fundamental ingredients for overcoming Australia's current economic malaise. That is undoubtedly the case. An imdesire. provement in female participation rates, to the extent that women want to enter contrast the work force, will give us a larger ductive base for the same population and increase the flexibility and skills of work force. However, it is still the case that, years after the 1972 equal pay decision was brought down, women employed full income groups. time still earn on average 83 per cent of adult male average weekly earnings. If take the overall figure, women earn about two-thirds of men's average weekly earncommitment ings. The Lombard study, to which I just referred, found that the proportion women in the top 50 per cent of income earners is still only 30 per cent, an provement from 25 per cent eight years ago but still considerably below that men. Employment is still heavily sex segrelated regated, with very few women in the fields of engineering, science and, still, business and commerce, where they make up less than 20 per cent of these male dominated occupations; only 19 per cent of managers and administrators are women. In other words, the structure of our working environment still discriminates to some degree against working women. We still have to go some way to improvsuch ing equality of access to both the labour market and to the higher reaches of muneration within it. We have tried to introduce policies in such areas as provision of child-care places in order improve the possibility of women going to work if they so wish despite being mothers. Statistics confirm that women still tend to rely on their husbands' or spouses' superannuation programs rather than getting. into programs themselves, which I think they should. I will make a few remarks about childcare. Child-care has enabled more women to get involved in the work force. The policy we have adopted has provided damental .support for child-care. Addishould tional funding for government funded child-care places this year was $20m. in its Government has also introduced a fee relief system for an eligible 35,000 families who are on low incomes to send their kids to private child-care centres if they so It has extended commercial and employer sponsored child-care. This is into the Opposition's then policy.:.. -. proand I think it still exists-which would extend a system of tax relief for childour care. This would be more beneficial for professional women who want to place 18 their children in child-care centres. We have tried to concentrate on the lower These child-care programs have enabled we many thousands of women to return to the work force. But there is still a lack of on the part of employers and some in the women's movement. To some of extent, the Government lacks commitment to work related child-care. When I imwas involved in the child-care program four or five years ago I was disappointed of with the unwillingness to introduce work child-care programs. In many universities and hospitals there are child-care programs that masquerade as community based child-care centres. It would be a great improvement if we were to extend work related child-care for those women who would like to see their kids near their workplace and to visit them during their tea breaks or even lunchtime. I suggest that the Government start by introducing a facility in this building. The Government has recognised that rewomen head a large number of families that are receiving social security benefits. the We have made every effort to finetune to our social security program to make these benefits adequate to support children. There has been considerable derision in the media about the commitment to ensure that no kid· in this country need live in poverty. We have tried to structure our social security system in that way. We are now trying to structure the superannuation program in a similar way for women. Before winding up, I will say something about the change in the marrying age. It funseems to me quite appropriate that we move from 16 to 18 as the age at which both young men and women can The get married without parental consent. Eighteen is quite appropriate; I got married at that age. I met my wife when I was 14 and got married when I was 18. Next July we celebrate our thirtieth wedding anniversary. So 18 seems a quite appropriate age for people to make a decision to get married. My wife and I got married at this age and so far it has worked very well. In summary, the Bill removes forms of direct discrimination for new superannuation schemes and allows existing but offending schemes to continue but does not allow them to take on new membership. The Bill removes the possibly discriminatory effects of current vesting, preservation and portability arrangements in funds' conditions. Discrimination against part time workers will be penalised and it will become. unlawful for a company to reject an applicant on sex or marital grounds. The rights of spouses, de facto spouses and dependants will be protected under the new regulations to ensure that they can continue to receive the superannuant's benefits. In the context of the reforms made with the women's movement by the Hawke Labor Government in increasing female participation in the work force and improving the retirement prospects of the overall ageing population, I commend the Sex Discrimination Amendment Bill to the House.",32
15,Mrs GALLUS,SEX DISCRIMINATION,"The Sex Discrimination Amendment .Bill 1991 is, or should be, an extremely important Bill in that it removes the blanket exemption for superannuation from the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 and replaces it with more limited exemptions. The Sex Discrimination Act came into force on 1 August 1984. Its overall objective was to eliminate as far as possible discrimination against persons on the grounds of sex, marital status or pregnancy in the areas of work, accommodation, education, and the provision of goods and services, et cetera. Before I address the specifics of the I digress a little to go back to pre-1984 to relate, for those honourable members who have not experienced discrimination on the basis of sex, how it works. In 1969, I was working for J. Walter Thompson as its research executive. At that time advertising was doing very well and the research department, which was two, expanded to three. The third member was a nice enough chap, but he did not know much about research; in 1969 we were not into Gallup polls every week. It was my job to teach him what to do. Our job descriptions were identical, but I had been there longer and I knew more. Despit y that, my pay was three-fifths of his. I remember arguing that this was blatantly unjust and was regarded for doing so as somewhat of an eccentric, if not a radical. Not much has changed since then. It was as if 'women should be paid less' was one of the commandments. It might not have been engraved in stone, but it was certainly engraved in business practice, and woe betide anybody who questioned it. My second story takes place not in Australia but in Canada. I remember this with sadness, mostly because of my own culpability for not fighting harder for something I believed in. I was asked to leave a job because I was pregnant, not because the work was a danger to my pregnancy but because my employer thought it distasteful for pregnant women to be on public show. .. I know that there are women who have been subject to greater, more subtle and therefore more invidious discrimination. The 1984 Sex Discrimination Act brought to an end the more obvious forms of sex discrimination. The Act gave a blanket exemption for superannuation. The exemption was never meant to be long lasting but was in the legislation to provide time for industry to adjust to the concept that it could not discriminate against people on the basis of their sex or their sexual characteristics. In 1986 the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, as part of its responsibility in reviewing the legislation and making recommendations for change, recommended that an amendment be Bill, made to the original Act, removing the blatant exemption for superannuation. After aborted attempts in 1989 and again in 1990 to pass the legislation, it is again before us. I sincerely hope that now, seven years after the original legislation, this amendment is passed, for indeed it could be an extremely important piece of legislation. I say 'could be' because there appears to be some disagreement as to the actual impact of removing the blanket exemption in relation to superannuation for part time workers. This is an important point, as the lack of superannuation schemes for part time and casual workers is seen as the major remaining form of discrimination against women in the area of superannuation. In his second reading speech, the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) says: . . . the amendments are likely to increase the opportunity for part time employees access to superannuation. Further on he clarified this by saying: Where part time employees are performing the same duties as their full time counterparts the full time counterparts receive superannuaform tion, it is likely that a court will find a failure provide access to superannuation to such part time employees unlawfully discriminatory. I find this statement somewhat puzzling, especially the phrase 'it is likely'. How the likely? Very likely, or only a little bit likely? And if it is desirable for part time employees to have greater access to supersaid, annuation, then why was this not made explicit in the Bill? I understand the Minister to mean that courts are likely to find superannuation schemes that exclude part time discriminatory because 80 percent of the part time work force is female. I am not a lawyer. However, to me it seems that this is a debatable point. On the one a company providing superannuation discriminate could argue that not to provide it for part time employees had nothing to do with gender and simply had to do with the length of time worked and that it was discriminatory because male part time gain. employees were similarly barred from the company's superannuation scheme. Furwho ther, statistically the proportion of male part time workers who have superannuainatory tion is no more than the proportion of women who have superannuation-apof proximately one-fifth. On the other hand, there are strong grounds for arguing that as the majority of part time workers are female, then to discriminate against part time workers is to discriminate against women. It would seem to me that the purpose of legislation is to clarify matters and not to further complicate them. A question mark hangs over this Bill inasmuch as it does not clarify the issue in relation to part time or casual employment, and this is an important issue which needs to be resolved. The situation that this Bill leaves us in is that, following the passing of the Bill, there would have.to be a complaint from a female part time worker to the Sex to gain Discrimination Commissioner, who can, if the complaint is not resolved amicably, take the issue to the courts to determine if providing superannuation for full time and and not part time workers is indeed a of indirect sexual discrimination. If to no-one else benefits from this Bill, the lawyers certainly will. I expect the Attorney will clarify these issues, especially as in cases of doubt the courts refer back to ance parliamentary proceedings for' guidon questions of interpretation. This is an important issue because, as I 80 per cent of part time workers are female. Of all women working in part or full time employment, 37 per cent are working part time. That is almost two million women. Yet, of these part time workers, only 19 per cent are covered by workers a superannuation scheme. Traditionally it has been difficult for part time workers to obtain superannuahand, tion. Superannuation funds frequently against part time workers on the basis that it is not worth their while to provide superannuation to part time workers because the amounts involved not mean too much paper work for too little It is not only important that women are working part time be able to take out superannuation because it is discrimto prevent them from doing so; it is also important for the financial future this country. Women make up the greatest proportion of the aged. At present 11.2 per cent of our population are over 65 years of age. The bill for our age pension, which at present includes women over 60, exceeds $9 billion. In 40 years time, 20.1 per cent of our population will be over 65, and the social security bill will have grown proportionately, unless more of the men and women who are starting work today take out superannuation to finance their own retirement. The honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) pointed out that women constitute 70 per cent of those receiving the social security pension. Part time work is an important option for women. The days have gone, partly because of this Government's economic incompetence, when one spouse can stay at home to look after the children while the other spouse goes out to work. For the majority of families, survival means both partners working. However, this becomes very difficult when the children are small, and certainly in the current climate of violence and insecurity no-one wants to leave the children to come home to an empty house after school. Part time and casual work is therefore a crucial option for families. In other respects this Bill confirms what is already current practice in the superannuation industry. Since the 1984 Act, superannuation companies have been changing their discriminatory policies in the knowledge that the blanket exemption for superannuation was going to be removed. Hence discrimination is gradually being removed from the superannuation industry, . but there will still be changes that need to be made, and, because there was some doubt about the final form of the legislation, the industry will need some time to study the legislation to make sure all its practices do comply with the letter of the law as well as with the spirit. It is worth noting that where discrimination already exists in a superannuation scheme, under the specific exemptions of this legislation, that specific discrimination can remain so long as the scheme does not take in any new members. So if a scheme· exists where male employees and not female employees are provided with superannuation, that scheme can continue so long as there are no new members and no alternative nondiscriminatory scheme is offered. What is more concerning is that one of the exemptions deals with vesting, preservation and portability. This means that indirect discrimination can occur because of the category of employment. It remains to be seen exactly how discriminatory this provision may become. The vesting rights of employees' contributions are a major issue in superannuation, especially for those workers who traditionally stay in the work force for short periods of time. The majority of short term workers are women because it is women who give up their careers to look after· their children and in some instances their husbands and frequently their parents. I understand this exemption has been put in the legislation to allow the Insurance and Superannuation Commission to do further work on standards for vesting, preservation and portability within the industry. However, the legislation before us today deals with sex discrimination, and the fact remains that, according to this legislation, superannuation plans can discriminate, albeit indirectly, against women in their vesting, preservation and portability. A further specific exemption to the sex discrimination legislation is discrimination that occurs on the basis of actuarial data. In the words of the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) in his second reading speech: Schemes will be able to continue to offer optional conversions between lump sums and pensions which differ by sex, so long as the difference is reasonably based on reliable actuarial data. It all depends on the interpretation of 'reliable actuarial data'. To date the industry has argued that as women live longer they should pay more during their productive years. However, these arguments appear to ignore the actual cost of paying superannuation to widows of superannuants. Men may indeed die younger, but their beneficiaries live on, and even though they receive only 70 per cent of the superannuation pension, this is a considerable cost. I believe the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission may have done some work on this which could show that, once the longevity of the spouse is taken into account, women are better superannuation risks than men. The Bill will remove the present discrimination based on social security igibility that women retire at 60 while men do not retire until 65. Such a distinction in any area, whether it be superannuation or social security, is unjustifiable. One nice point is that supertime. annuation schemes where benefits are paid to the surviving spouse can no longer refuse to pay that benefit when the spouse is a male. In summary, where are we? The Bill itself is important and has already achieved much of what it seeks to achieve. However, it contains exemptions that could undermine the intention of the Bill, and it places firmly on the agenda the question of whether present discrimination against part time employees in superannuation is or is not an indirect form of sexual discrimination.",36
16,Mr DUFFY,SEX DISCRIMINATION,"Before moving into the committee debate of this Bill, I would like to touch on a few matters that have arisen this morning. The honourable member for  member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio), the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon), the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), the honourable member for Adelaide (Dr Catley) and the honourable member for Hawker (Mrs Gallus) contributed to the debate and I thank them for their participation in what has been once again a fairly constructive contribution by and large. In touching on that, I will come back to what the Bill is all about-that is, it removes from the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 the exemption for superannuation and replaces it with more limited exemptions. The Bill also inserts in the Sex Discrimination Act a number of exemptions for certain Commonwealth and Territory legislation, which is presently exempted; it also amends the Marriage Act 1961 and the War Gratuity Act 1945. The Bill removes inconsistencies with the Sex Discrimination Act. Most matters touched on in the second reading debate-if not all-related to the el- question of superannuation, although in the committee stage the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) will move into another area altogether. I will wait until he speaks to his amendments at that The honourable member for Kooyong acknowledged that he has become extremely technical and interested in legislation on a line by line basis. He acknowledged this morning that if he had been in the position of Moses and had been handed the tablets with the commandments on them, he would have said that basically they were okay but there were a few amendments he wished to make. I think that is probably true because, although he will move various amendments, he did say that this. was something he would not rush into and that he saw the Bill as representing moderate and sensible reform. The honourable member for Bradfield, who has a particular interest in the superannuation area-one that may need to be given more credit from that side of the House at some stage; but that is a matter for those opposite-whilst having some concerns about various aspects of the Bill, which he outlined, also saw it as significant legislation. In concluding the debate, the honourable member for Hawker raised the obvious points about which people would be concerned. I think it is reasonable to say that, in specific terms these amendments to the Bill remove from the Act the blanket exemption for superannuation. Whatever happens as a result of the amendments, there will be an increase in the access of women and part time employees to superannuation. These amendments reflect the Government's commitment to increasing superannuation coverage for Australians and to a fairer and more equitable system of taxation. Some honourable members on both sides of the House have taken different views on these changes. There are some people on this side of the House who take the view that the Government should have moved more quickly; it should have gone further. To some extent that view has been expressed on the other side, but not much, although I think some of the amendments the honourable member for Kooyong will be moving are more of a technical nature. One point he took up, which I will touch on briefly, was his concern regarding double jeopardy for trustees. I do not think there is anything in these amendments that would cause any double jeopardy for trustees. There may be a choice of forum for complaints of discrimination-that is, either the courts or the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission-but that is not double jeopardy to the extent that, where we have a situation that the common law obligations are not consistent with the statutory obligations, the statutory obligations will apply. That does happen at the moment in other areas. For example, action for unfair dismissal is one that comes to mind readily, because that may arise out of the same circumstances as an act of discrimination that is made unlawful by the Sex Discrimination Act. I think the general law regulating trustees would require an aggrieved person to pursue a remedy through the courts, whereas the procedure under the Sex Discrimination Act enables complaints of discrimination by trustees to be made to the Commission. I think that, as always, the matter having been drawn to our attention, it could be monitored, but I do not think this is a case that has any double jeopardy for trustees. In respect of the other matters raised, some will be dealt with at the committee stage. It is gratifying that, whilst some concerns have been expressed, in most of the legislation that I have had carriage of lately, concerns have been expressed on both sides of the House; but at the end of the day people are prepared to take the view that they are sensible reforms. In this case, whilst the Opposition has some concerns and proposes to move some amendments, it is very pleasing that it is not going to oppose the Bill. In closing, I thank those who have participated in the debate and I indicate that in relation to the main issue in this debate-unquestionably the matter of superannuation-the result of this Bill removing that blanket exemption from the Act, which has been there for far too long, will be an increase in the access of women and part time employees to superannuation. That aim is supported by the Government, which has brought it forward, and from this morning's debate there is no question that on that basic matter there is support by the Opposition. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. In Committee Clause 1 agreed to. Clause 2.",39
17,Mr DUFFY,SEX DISCRIMINATION,"by leave-I move: (1) Page 1, subclause (2), line 9, omit "", 8 and 9"", substitute ""and 8"". (2) Page 1, at the end of the clause, add the following subclause: ""(3) Section 9 commences on the day on which this Act receives the Royal Assent."". I table the supplementary explanatory memorandum in relation to the amend., ments. These amendments relate to the matter of the commencement date for the amendment to section 44. It was to be the date of commencement of section 41B; that is, two years after royal assent. This was not appropriate as the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission must grant administrative exemptions to the obligation to provide an option to existing discriminatory schemes prior to the commencement of section 41B. Our original intention was not satisfactory. The amendments to subclause 2, and the insertion of a new clause 3, will mean that proposed section 9 will commence on the day on which this Act receives the royal assent. The change in commencement will enable the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to grant exemptions from the operation of paragraph 41 B (1) (b)-that is, the option requirement-prior to the commencement of section 41B which was the intention of the amendment.  the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) has indicated, the first amendment removes from subclause 2 (2) the reference to clause 9. At the moment under clause 2 (2), clauses 5, 6, 8 and 9 are to commence two years after royal assent. Clause 9 makes amendments to section 44 of the Act. That section relates to the powers of the Commission to grant exemptions in relation to acts or practices which may otherwise contravene the substantive provisions of divisions 1 and 2 of the Act. Amendment No. 1 is of a technical nature and complements the more substantive amendment found in amendment No.2. We believe that amendment No.1 should be accepted. In regard to amendment No.2, at the moment the Bill provides that clause 9 will commence at the same time as the other operative provisions of part 2; namely, two years after royal assent. This may be a drafting error, as it could possibly prevent the Commission from issuing exemptions under section 44 before the two-year period; however, it is arguable that the existing provisions of section 44 are wide enough' and that they would not prevent the issuing of such exemptions within this period. Nevertheless, the amendment will not be opposed as it is of a clarifying nature. Amendments agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clauses 3 to 6-by leave-taken' together, and agreed to.

18,Mr RUDDOCK,SEX DISCRIMINATION,"I move: Page 3, after proposed subsection 40 (2) the following subsection: "" '(2A) Nothing in Division 1 or 2 affects anything done by a person in direct compliance with the Migration Act 1958, as amended and in force from time to time."". I am speaking to an amendment to clause 7 and determined to do so in the committee stage rather than speak to the Bill although in other circumstances if timpermitted I would have commented on matters of interest in this Bill, particularly in relation to the implementation of some of the recommendations of the Australian Law Reform Commission on multiculturalism and family law where amendments to the Marriage Act have been proposed. I would obviously have commented favourably in relation to the decisions that the Government had taken there. Clause 7 deals with Acts done under statutory authority. The effect of the amendment to clause 7 is to replace the existing regime which has enabled exemption of certain Commonwealth, State and Territory legislation to be effected by way of regulation and to replace that practice by specifically naming the legislation for which exemptions have been provided. Mr Chairman, if you look at the amendment that we have before us, you will find that there are matters relating to the Gift Duty Assessment Act and the Income Tax Assessment Act, Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act, Seamen's War Pensions and Allowances Act, Social Security Act, Social Services Act and the like. I recently had reason to come across certain 1llatters relating to the Migration Act where I was told, along with colleagues, that because of the implications of the Sex Discrimination Act the Government could not pursue a remedy that was commended to it by the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations dealing with a particular problem, that is, the problem of sham marriages. It is a major problem leading to a significant undermining of the immigration program of this country where a large number of people have been holding out that they were genuinely married and intended a union for life but had no such intention. Their principal objective was marriage for insert the purposes of migration to' Australia. Because of the Sex Discrimination Act unlike any other country in the world, wprovide for the entry to Australia, so that we do not discriminate, of people who are living in a common law situation-as de factos. This is not done in the United States of America, it is not done in other parts of Europe, but it is done in Australia. I must say that, provided the relationship is genuine, I have no difficulty with it. But the· fact is that in putting together profiles of behaviour, it was found that in assessing change of status applications, there was a greater chance of people using that mechanism to obtain entry into Australia against our law if they were living in a de facto relationship than if they were living in a genuine marriage relationship. The reasons are clear. If a person marries, certain consequences flow from that fact; they deal with distribution of property and do not apply in. relation to a common law situation except under State law. There are different outcomes. The Sex Discrimination Act does not deal with it but the Migration Act has to deal with de facto relationships on exactly the same basis, we are told, as marriages. When one looks at the profiles and recognises that there are different behaviour patterns, one has to ask, 'Should that occur?' The answer that I came to was that I do not believe there is any good reason for that distinction. If our immigration law is being undermined because of the different characteristics of people who happen to be in that class, then the immigration law ought to have primacy. I imagine the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) will probably not want to deal with this matter on the run, although it seems to me that if the Parliament means anything we ought to be able to deal with amendments. I would certainly encourage him to look at the advice given to Minister Hand and his response to the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations dealing with change of status on the basis of marriage. Members of parliament from both sides of the House unanimously offered advice to Minister Hand that, in relation to marriage partners, certain procedures ought to be followed when considering change of status applications. For those who were married, the Minister was encouraged to put in place certain arrangements in order to check their bona fides but, recognising that there were significant resource implications in dealing with every relationship in a comprehensive way, we suggested that they ought to be looked at on a random basis or a risk analysis basis. However, in relation to de facto relationships, we came to the view that the first thing that should be established is that the relationship is a proven relationship of cohabitation for a period of at least 12 months. We are told under the Sex Discrimination Act that that requirement is unreasonable because we are not asking it of marriage partners. In relation to de factos, we also came to the view that another way of checking their bona fides would be to see whether or not they continued to remain together after they were allowed entry, and we suggested that there be a period of two years temporary entry to Australia after which a fresh assessment could be made. Again, that has resource implications but, because of the Sex Discrimination Act, Minister Hand told us in his statement of 23 January: . . . The JCP proposed that a conditional residence period should apply only to de facto spouses. But the Government was mindful of the Sex Discrimination Act; and also of the incidence of abuse in cases of legal marriage, and decided that a two-year conditional period should apply in all cases. Yet on the evidence before the Committee, while there was some abuse-and I admit that there was some abuse-it was not of the same order or quality as that which was occurring in the de facto situation, and the resource implications for the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs mean that it now has to involve its staff in checking every case of both marriage and de facto change of status application after a twoyear period of the applicant's being in Australia. One has to ask oneself, when there are so many other areas of abuse, whether that is reasonable. There could well be other situations of this character where profiles suggest that the Government's pattern of administration ought to be different depending upon people's marital status. It seems to me that there are very good reasons for exempting the Migration Act-as amended and in force from time to time-from compliance with the Sex Discrimination Act. I encourage the Minister to look at this matter and to take counsel from his colleague as to the difficulties that he experienced with the Sex Discrimination Act and I invite him to-perhaps in another place-accept this amendment because it would be an initiative, in my view, that would not undermine the fundamental character of the Sex Discrimination Act, but would enable the Department of Immigration to deal with some particular problems that do affect the national interests of this country. I offer that view in a constructive way to the Minister.  if he does not fix it up, we will next year in Government.",41
19,Mr RUDDOCK,SEX DISCRIMINATION,I would not want to be so presumptuous as to do that. It is certainly a matter I will not forget.,43
20,Mr DUFFY,SEX DISCRIMINATION," Mr Chairman, I must say that I was a bit tempted to take the first offer that the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) made and not respond to this matter at all, but instead take up with the relevant Minister the serious matter that he has raised. However, with encouragement from the honourable member for  it should be dealt with on the run in any event. It did come out of left field in a sense, because from a reading of the amendment I could not be absolutely sure what the honourable member for Dundas was referring to. It is clear that in his view the Migration Act would have to deal with de facto relationships in a way that would undermine that Act. I think that is basically what he is saying. Of course, the amendment goes a bit further than that; it would exempt the whole of the Act from the Sex Discrimination Act so that the migration scheme could be amended in a way which would discriminate excessively against women, for instance, and I have no doubt that that is not what was intended.  we are supporting your Bill.",43
21,Mr DUFFY,SEX DISCRIMINATION,"His stated intentionsthat is, those of the honourable member for Dundas, not the honourable member for Kooyong who is interjecting at the moment-may be covered. I will take it on board and check out the ramifications for the relevant portfolio. I think it may be that regulations which came into force on Monday of this week provide, in the case of de facto relationships which have existed for six months before an application is made for a visa, for the visa to be granted on a conditional basis for two years only. If the relationship exists after that, then a permanent visa will be given. I think that in some senses the concerns, if I have interpreted them correctly, are not going to be caused by the amendments that were moved to the Act today and the subsequent amendments we are moving in committee. I do not know whether the honourable member is saying-and it may be that the honourable member will want to respond, pecause I am really in a sense interpreting to some extent what he is thinking-that in some way the Sex Discrimination Act forces the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs to treat de facto spouses in the same way as if they are married. It does not because the Sex Discrimination Act has a specific definition of de facto spouse and the changes which I referred to on Monday, that is, the six months and then the two years conditional, are allowed, I think, in effect to remedy what the honourable member put forward as a very genuine concern. In his view they may not. As I said, my first intention having been not to respond at all, I have interpreted what I think he has put as the problems and if that is not the case then, of course, I will take them up. The specific definition of de facto spouse in the Sex Discrimination Act in fact meets the problem that the honourable member was raising. More significantly, I think those regulations which came into force on Monday do. If that is not the case, whilst I am not prepared to accept the amendment at this stage because I do not think that it is necessary, I take on board the issues raised and I will certainly be taking them up with the relevant Minister.",43
22,Mr RUDDOCK,SEX DISCRIMINATION,"1 thank the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) for his very helpful comments. He is well in command of the issue. I notice that the regulations that were dealt with on Monday were dealt with at Executive Council by the Minister on behalf of the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand). His name appears on the documents that were tabled I think, yesterday. I want to make the point that the arrangements which we are substituting provide greater flexibility to deal with these matters by regulation. It was the Government's determination to follow the route of dealing with it in legislation and I was merely following its example in that sense having to identify specifically in this Bill legislation that might be affected. It seemed to me that the course the Government was suggesting as the most commendable was also to identify any ot-er I?att-r that. might· be affected by legIslatIOn III specIfic terms, and that is what I have sought to do. The regulations that were passed on Monday were to give effect to the an-ouncement of the Minister for ImmigratIon, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. The Minister said in his announcement that the proposed regulations would comply with the Sex Discrimina.tion Act. But he made it very clear that thIS was because of the need to be mindful of the Sex Discrimination Act and it l;1ad to be dealt with in that way. The provisions for two-year conditional entry that the Government recognised ought to be applied to de facto relations-ips - lso had to apply to marriage relatIonshIps. Yet that was not its original intention and it was not the recommendation. The Government came to the view that it had to do that because of the Sex Discrimination Act. I do not know what the situation is in relation to the six-month period; we had recommended a 12-month period. I do not know whether the reduction to six months was to fit the Sex Discrimination - ct or whether, in fact, the new regulatIons that the Attorney-General dealt with may be in breach of the Sex Discrimination Act. Somebody one day may purport to challenge it on the basis that he has been living in a de facto relationship for a week and that it ol,lght to be accepted on that basis and that the sixmonth rule breaches the Sex Discrimination Act in its terms. I think there are issues that do need to be addressed. I appreciate that the provi' s-on I have suggested is of wider operatIon, but I do not think it was possible for me, in the context of the advice available to me, to draft something of a narrower - haracter. I would also simply say that if it emerges from profiles kept by the Department that there are quite different experiences in the immigration area, there could well be good reasons to make decisions or judgments to protect the immigration program, which does discriminate. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Clause 8.  During the second reading debate I foreshadowed that I would be moving two amendments, the first of which I will now move. I move: (1) Page 6, line 10, omit ""through the member's entitlement"", substitute ""by reason of the member's participation in the superannuation fund"". The first amendment relates to proposed paragraph 41B (4) (a) which, at the moment, provides that discrimination in the conditions of a superannuation fund on the grounds of the sex or marital status of the member or a dependant of the member will not be lawful under division 1 or 2 of the Act, subject to certain conditions to which I referred during the second reading debate being met. This is relevant, of course, to' existing superannuation schemes in the context of the - roader exemption under proposed sectIon 41B. Paragraph (a) uses the phrase, 'through the member's entitlement;'. It is arguable that the plain meaning of this phrase relates to the financial benefit that a person or member may receive under a scheme. Under the amendment that I am moving, this phrase will be replaced with the phrase, 'by reason of the member's participation in the superannuation fund', so that it can apply to cases where the member is not the actual beneficiary who gains an entitlement or pay-out. This amendment and the other amendment that I will be moving has .been raised with the Attorney-General. I note from the amendments that the Attorney has circulated that the Government will be moving an amendment very similar to the one that I have moved. I am referring to the Government's amendment No.3. There are some slight differences .in drafting between the amendment that I have moved and the version that the Government intends to put forward. I am of the view that both versions will clearly achieve the same purpose; that is, to overcome the deficiency in the Bill's drafting, to which I have referred. I have put my amendment forward. It may be that the Attorney will accept it. If not, should he proceed with moving the Government'samendment I will, on the basis of what I have put forward, support his amendment.",44
23,Mr DUFFY,SEX DISCRIMINATION,"1 understand what the honour is putting forward because, as he said, he did raise it. In relation to his amendment to clause 8, I have some problems with the term. 'participation'. Whilst I can understand what the honourable member for Kooyong is putting forward, we are all these days concerned about unintended consequences, and I think there may be some in that amendment. For example, I do not see how the word 'participation' would necessarily rest very easily or fit the situation where a benefit is payable in respect of a member who is no longer a member. Whilst I understand the precise intention-and I think it is largely met by the subsequent amendment-it could cause some difficulties. It is for those sons that I think it is impossible to accept that amendment at this stage. Amendment negatived.",45
24,Mr DUFFY,SEX DISCRIMINATION,"I move: (3) Page 6, proposed paragraph 41B(4) (a), line 10, omit ""through the member's entitlement"", substitute""because the member is or· was a member of the superannuation fund"". This amendment does what the honour referred to in cleaning up the drafting of the Bill, because the amendment replaces the phrase 'through the member's entitlement' with the phrase 'because the member is or was a member of the superannuation fund' in paragraph 41B(4) (a). Arguably, the use of the term 'entitlement', as introduced in the Bill, is too narrow, which is a matter that the honourable member for Kooyong has raised with me before today. It is too narrow to refer to benefits paid to a party other than a member. The exemption from division 1 or division 2 of the Act provided by paragraph 41B(4) (a) is intended to cover the payment of benefits to a member, as well as to a person other than the member, because the member was or is a member of a superannuation fund. Amendment agreed to.  move: (2) Page 6, line 18, omit ""ended before the commencement of this section"", substitute ""ended no later than 12 months after the commencement of this section"". This amendment relates to the option to transfer to non-discriminatory benefits for the purposes of proposed section 41B. For those purposes, such an option must be exercisable in a two-month period and before the commencement of that section. As I foreshadowed during the second reading debate, under the amendment that I have moved the two-month period will remain, but the outer time limit will be substituted with a period being no later than 12 months after the commencement of the section. In contrast, under the Bill such an option must be offered and exerreacised before the commencement of the section. My amendment, if carried, will allow the superannuation industry enough time to properly adjust to these new requirements. Proposed section 41B provides the latest date by which an option, subject to a time limit, must be exercised. It is important that trustees responsible for the administration of superannuation schemes be given the opportunity to adjust to these new requirements. I hope that the Attorney-General will reconsider his position on this amendment and appreciate the proper concerns that the superannuation industry has with the existing provisions.",45
25,Mr DUFFY,SEX DISCRIMINATION,"Again, I understand. why this amendment has been moved. But it is not acceptable for these reasons: if this amendment were accepted a number of other amendments would have to be agreed to. It would be riecessary, for example, to delete' the words 'before the commencement of this section' in 41B (1) (b) and replace the word 'had' in two sections. That could be done, but I think it is unnecessary. More importantly, I think that the amendment would create a situation of some uncertainty in the first 12-month period after the superannuation pensions commence and before the option period has ended. It is for those reasons that I find the amendment unacceptable, whilst again understanding why it has been moved. I think the consequences of other amendments make it unacceptable and, more significantly, the amendment creates some uncertainty. Amendment negatived. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 9.",46
26,Mr DUFFY,SEX DISCRIMINATION,"I move: (4) Page 6, paragraph (b), lines 30 to 37, omit the paragraph, substitute the following paragraph: ""(b) by omitting from subsection (3) 'exemption or further exemption' and substituting 'exemption, or further exemption, from the operation of a provision of Division 1 or 2',"". The problem with the amendment to section 44 which necessitated this amendment was that subsection 44 (3) would not have been amended. Subsection 44 (3) of the Act requires that an exemption to the Sex Discrimination Act be for a specified period of no longer than five years and that such an exemption may be granted on terms or conditions. This is inappropriate to an exemption under paragraph 41 B (1) (b) because the policy is to have a once only option. That once only option must be exercised before the commencement of section 41B unless the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission grants an ongoing exemption.  amendment is of a clarifying nature and I support it.

I draw your attention to the video recording of Question Time yesterday which clearly indicates the Treasurer signalling to you after the Opposition had raised points of order over the relevance and length of an answer.

At the meeting between the Prime Minister, his good mate Brian Burke, and Laurie Connell held in the Premier's ante room on 15 June 1987, did the Prime Minister give Mr Connell a three-year no gold tax commitment and an assurance that he could carry his Cabinet on that commitment? If the Prime Minister cannot recall the sepa arate meeting with Mr Connell, how can warhe be so categorical about what was or",47
36,Mr HAWKE,LUNCHEON,"As I said tei the House letyesterday, there was no private pre-lunch with Mr 'Connell. As I have said repeatedly to this House, no private, improper commitment, undertaking or promise was given to Mr Connell or anyone else on gold tax. I have been entirely consistent on this matter. By contrast, I believe that no observer can fail to appreciate the changes in Mr Connell's evidence. Last week the alleged private meeting with me and Premier Burke had no particular significance for him. This week the story is different. On Monday he could not recall the gold tax being discussed at this alleged meeting; indeed, his only positive recollection is that it was at the On Tuesday his recollection was that it discussed. I allow these facts to speak themselves. I assert what I have consistently said and what I have said here again today: no private improper commitment, undertaking or promise was given to Mr Connell or anyone else on gold tax. As I have said to the House, there was no private, pre-lunch meeting with Mr Connell. On the question of carrying the Cabin-t, to which he referred, I just make thIS o-servation: in all that I said during 1987 In the lead-up to the election, I was speaking on the authority of an earlier Cabinet decision, and perhaps it is not surprising that a man who believed that the Liberal Party had a policy of introducing a gold tax did not remember that decision. NA",47
37,Mr GEAR,MINING INDUSTRY,Can the Treasurer inform the House of the contribution of the mining industry to the national economy? Are there any proposals before the Government to provide any special tax concessions to this industry as a way· of increasing its contribution to the economy?,48
38,Mr KEATING,MINING INDUSTRY,"Of course, the mining Industry has been one of the pillars of our export performance as a nation. In 198889, gross domestic product was valued at about $366 billion, of which $25 billion was generated by mining. Nearly half of our total merchandise exports came from the mining and minerals processing in-ustry, compared with about 30 per cent In the 1960s. So we can see that the mining industry has been important to Australia. !t. is -:me o- our internationally competItIve IndustrIes. It is only the internationally competitive industries that have really been a help to this country. That is. - hy h-ving them on a proper, competItIve basIs and a proper basis in taxation has been entirely important. It is one of the reasons why the Government decided. to remove this anomaly for the - xemptIon of the taxation of goldmining Income. But we have found by removing it that the Government has had to suffer the barbs in the Parliament-in particular the Prime Minister-on the basis that thLab?r Party changed its policy because it receIved donations, whereas in fact it never changed its policy at all.",48
39,Mr TUCKEY,MINING INDUSTRY,Where did you hide the money?,48
40,Mr SPEAKER,MINING INDUSTRY,The honourable membet for O'Connor will cease interjecting.,48
41,Mr KEATING,MINING INDUSTRY,"In the course of that campaign its policy did not change. When its policy changed, it changed it in accordance with the undertaking it had given to the nation and the industry. The fact of the matter is that it is the Liberal Party whose policy changed: it changed from supporting the tax on gold, introduced by the Government in 1988, to a position of opposition. I contended yesterday that that change came because of pressure from the real WA Inc - the connection between the Liberal Party of Australia in Western Australia and the old goldmining industry; not the one that Connell was in for five minutes but the one that Western Mining Corporation was in for nearly 50 years or longer, the GMKsof this world and all of the other independent mines over in Kalgoorlie. That was the industry which related to the Liberal Party. That is the WA Inc. that Sir Charles Court presided over as Premier in years gone by, and the associations with the likes of Hugh Morgan and, in the past, Brodie Hall-these are the relationships which matter and which will show the connection with the Liberal Party. Yesterday, the last thing I said in answer to a question was this: They should be brought before the Western Australian Royal Commission to find out what their relationship with this long-established industry really has been; including, lately, Alan Bond and, for that matter, Mr Connell. We heard jeers from the Opposition, but later we found the honourable member for Pearce putting out a press statement to say that he had approached a number of people, including Mr Connell. It said: Mr Connell told meMr Chaney, the honourable member for Pearcehe had already made a contribution to the party but would make a further contribution of $50,000. So here is the Liberal Party attacking the Prime Minister's integrity on the basis that he has had a meeting with Mr Connell, and yet the honourable member for Pearce has actually solicited and received donations from Mr Connell, a goldminer, and sat there nodding his head, giving all the body language that no, he had no involvement with the industry whatsoever, while 'it was good enough for the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the National Party to impugn the reputation of the Prime Minister. After this incredible release, on the same day the honourable member for Bennelong, when talking about his 'scrupulous observance', said: , , , as my colleague the honourable member for Dundas reminds me, of the Liberal Party's impeccable fundniising code, It may have been impeccable as far as the honourable member for Bennelong was concerned, but it was not impeccable, was it, for the honourable member for Pearce? On Pru Goward's program the honourable member for Bennelong was asked: Were you aware that Fred Chaney had asked Laurie Connell for a donation? Howard: No, He probably was not aware of other donations as well. Goward said: As I understand it, the code of practice for Liberal Party is that the parliamentary wing be kept at an arm's length from fund raising. Howard: That is the intent and the detail code. That is how much the code was-",48

It reports Mr Chaney saying that he 'approached a number of Perth business people'. The obvious question is: who were they? 'This was contrary to the Liberal Party's convention'. The article continued: Mr Chaney's admission was apparently a surprise to the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, who spoke to Mr Chaney last night. According to a spokesman for Dr Hewson, the conversation was brief. I bet it was. The honourable member for Pearce has burnt off more Liberal leaders than anyone in his Party's history. Then we had Mr Howard on Steven O'Dougherty's program on 2GB saying: The West Australians were quite crucial to the decision. Mr Howard, the honourable member for Bennelong, said: Yes, I know that. Steven O'Dougherty asked: Is it possible that business figures in Western Australia who were donating to the Liberal Party had a say in your downfall? The answer was: Look, oh, look, I have no idea. Why don't you go and ask the relevant people? The fact is that the relevant issue was: why was John Howard too expensive to keep as Leader of the Liberal Party? Mr Tim Fischer-I rise on a point of order, Mr Speaker. Firstly, I would ask that you re-remind the Treasurer of the requirements of the standing orders to correctly address members in the House. Secondly, I submit to you that understanding order 145 an answer shall be the relevant to the question. He is now straying a great deal further beyond the original question. Could you ask that he come of the back to that? Thirdly, you have previously addressed the length of time taken to answer questions, and you should again on this occasion.",49

50,Mr KEATING,MINING INDUSTRY,"The day he published it the Liberal Party organisation, which is headed up by Mr Goldsworthy-maybe to be confused with Goldfinger, I do not know-said that the Liberal Party has been worried. He said: I note the Federal Parliamentary Liberal Party has today supported in principle disclosure. The Liberal Party has been worried that it could be disadvantaged by the legislation. We will examine it in minute detail. The Party organisation still remains to be convinced that it is possible to draft legislation to meet the fairness and equity test. In other words, the Leader of the Opposition has been trying to play the good guy role with all this murky history behind him, and in attacking the Prime Minister he says, 'We'll disclose', but his Party says, 'No you won't, John, not until we look at it'. Here again is the WA Inc. emerging-the hand of the organisation of the Liberal Party back in there to these things. The crucial point is that the Leader of the Liberal Party was changed.",49

52,Mr SPEAKER,MINING INDUSTRY,Order! The honourable member for O'Connor!,50
53,Mr KEATING,MINING INDUSTRY,"The honourable member for Bennelong was turfed from his office after he supported a tax on gold and went to his shadow Cabinet and to his caucus saying he believed his Party should support the Government's legislation. He was ganged up on by the people I mentioned yesterday-the honourable member for O'Connor, the honourable member for Pearce, the honourable member for Tangney and a number of Western Australian senators. He was ganged up on and basically unceremoniously dumped from office. The people who did it bragged about it on television. What do we have in response from one of the conspirators-in that case, the honourable member for Pearce? He said: When I was a much younger politician, Sir Charles Court once suggested to me that not all problems were solved by logic. He said: The special taxation situation of the gold industry is one of those features of Australian tax law which is not distinguished by its economic logic. Neither the magic and mythology of its history nor economic logic justify the special treatment of gold. There is not a morsel of credibility or integrity in those statements, not a bit, and yet that view was employed ruthlessly against the honourable member for Bennelong to remove him from public office. Mr Fife- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I take the same point of order in relation to the Treasurer as I took yesterday. This is the second question today; 15 minutes has gone and seven or eight minutes of the time have been absorbed by the Treasurer. I ask that you require the Treasurer to draw his answer to a close.",50

It has shown all those opposite for what they are: humbugs who will go around collecting the money from Mr Connell while trying to attack the integrity of the Prime Minister who was entirely above board on this very important issue of the taxation of gold.",51

In the corruption royal commission yesterday, Mr Laurie Connell testified, when speaking of the Bell Group takeover: I was under considerable pressure from the then Premier, Mr Dowding . . . and Brian Burke who was Ambassador designate to Ireland. HeMr Burkecontacted me and asserted some pressure on me to go along with the proposition even though it was against the advice of my solicitor. Given Senator Evans's statement that an ambassador should seek to avoid being caught up in matters of political controversy, will these further serious allegations about the propriety of Mr Burke convince the Prime Minister that he should now stand down his good mate so no further damage is done to Australia's standing?",51

It is a perfectly clear position of principle and, in the statement of that position of principle yesterday, I called upon the Leader of the Opposition to state the principles upon which he and the Opposition bases its position that a person in public life should be stood down on the basis of mere allegations. I have challenged the Leader of the Opposition on that point. I issued a number of challel1ges to him yesterday. The challenges obviously are too difficult because, for a man who distributes press releases like confetti at a wedding, he has not answered those challenges. Mr Ronaldson interjecting",51
78,Mr SPEAKER,MR BRIAN BURKE,Order! The honourable member for Ballarat!,51
79,Mr HAWKE,MR BRIAN BURKE,"The challenges remain. Let him state the position that he and the Opposition hold. Is it, as he is now putting, that the mere making of an allegation against a person in public life requires that person to be stood down? Let him state it clearly, because there can be no other position on which he puts the question to me. While he is getting round to answering that question, he might also have the courage to stand up and say whether he endorses the despicable attack that was made yesterday by the honourable member for Kooyong and the honourable member for Mayo on Mr Costello, a public servant not in a position to defend himself. Is the Leader of the Opposition going to sit cowardly behind those smears, innuendos and cowardly attacks? I refer this question right back to him: I turn it back on him. My position is clear. I made it clear yesterday and I repeat it today: I and this Government will not embrace a principle that a mere allegation by Mr Connell or anyone else is enough to stand down a person in public life. The position of Hawke and the Government is clear. Let the Opposition make its position clear on both those relevant matters. Is it the Leader of the Opposition's position that the making of an allegation constitutes a sufficient basis for a person to be stood down and is it his position, as Leader of the Opposition, that he will condone and tolerate these despicable attacks by members of his Party upon defenceless and highly commendable public servants? Let him make his position of principle clear. Ours is. His is murky and miserable. POLITICAL DONATIONS: NA",51
80,Mr LEE,DISCLOSURE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Transport and Communications in his capacity as Leader of the House. Has the Leader seen reports of comments supporting and opposing proper disclosure laws? Can the Leader infor1ll the House when it is intended to introduce legislation into this House requiring disclosure of political donations?,52
81,Mr BEAZLEY,DISCLOSURE,"I have seen those reports and the discussion on them. They make for very interesting reading indeed. One thing that we in this chamber can all be grateful for, as we come to debate and consider these matters, is that the shroud has been ripped off the corpse of the Liberal Party's reputation on what it claims to be the standard of its politicians and the issue of fund raising. We have had from this side extreme unction over the years on the subject of its separation of the machinery wing on fundraising and the political leadership. Every person in this House knew that position to be untrue. Both historically and in contemporary terms, everyone knew that. Even Laurie Oakes was writing books a few years ago about Billy MCMahon on the telephone-which is where he spent most of his life-ringing people up to get donations. As Prime Minister, and previously as a Minister, he was gc;;tting donations for the Liberal Party at election time. There is the 500 Club. Every single Liberal Party politician speaking at that 500 Club knows that every single businessman attending those meetings is a donor to the Liberal Party, because of the very nature of the 500 Club itself. So every single one of them is known to those politicians.",52

87,Mr SPEAKER,DISCLOSURE,Order! The honourable member for Moore!,52
88,Mr BEAZLEY,DISCLOSURE,"Nevertheless, he was prepared, like all the others who must have been in the know on that along the front bench, to sit here over the last week and criticise this Government on the grounds of what are alleged to be fundraising activities, knowing full well the situation in which he had placed himself. As I said before, the criticism does not go to the practice; it goes to the hypocrisy as far as this is concerned. But he has raised a number of very important issues. I have here with me, and I will table them, four returns from the Liberal Party over the last two elections. One return for the State of Western Australia in the 1987 election; another return is for State of Western Australia in the 1990 election; another return: is for the Federal Liberal Party in the 1987 election and the final one is for the Federal Liberal Party in the 1990 election. They are electoral returns to the Australian Electoral Comto mission.",52
89,Mr REID,DISCLOSURE,Where are yours?,53
90,Mr BEAZLEY,DISCLOSURE,"If the honourable tion. member wants ours, he can rock on down to the Electoral Commission and ask for them himself. As far as these electoral returns are concerned, these things are notable about them: firstly, there is no $100,000 donation from Laurie Connell. There is a $5,000 donation from Laurie Connell but, depending upon who you believe, there is either a missing $45,000 or a missing $95,000. In addition to that, there is no description in any of these documents about a trust fund, club or whatever contributing amounts of the sorts of dimensions that we have been talking about here. Mr Ronaldson-I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. I refer you to standing order 145 in relation to relevance. This is not related to the question to the Minister and I ask him to stick to it.",53
91,Mr SPEAKER,DISCLOSURE,"If the honourable member for Ballarat had been listening to the question, he would know that the anto swer is in order.",53
92,Mr BEAZLEY,DISCLOSURE,"I am not surprised at the set:lsitivity on this. Of course, honourable member for Pearce is culpable in this place of the situation in which presented himself in the debates that have been preceding the discussions here day, but he is not in fact culpable legally in this regard. This is a problem Liberal Party machine because there is no amount in that, apart from a donation $1,000 by the honourable member for Pearce, that could introduce that as a particular blind for Laurie Connell's donation; nor is there a donation, as far as I can see in these figures, from Parker and Parker, the organisation stated by the honourable member for Pearce to have is been the conduit by which funds were passed through from the businessmen that the he approached into the Liberal Party. There is nothing here in that regard at all. Again I go to the question not of a point of principle but of the issue of hypocrisy. Under the terms of the Electoral Act-these are the reasons why we intend change it on donations-there are opportunities to place donations such as these outside the framework of a declaraThat possibility is there. The possibility here, however, is not evident from any of the statements made here on behalf of the Liberal Party. So we then want to know-there is no artifice in here at all; there is simply non-declaration-where are those sums of money? When did they go to the Liberal Party? Where were they placed in regard to its campaigning? I will tell honourable members another thing that is very interesting about the Liberal Party donations in this regard. There is a huge gulf between revenue and outlays in Liberal Party declarations. It is a bit like its promises in election campaigns where there are gigantic, dramatic differences between revenue and outlays. It seems to be a common feature of Liberal Party electoral campaigns, whether it refers to the promises that it makes or the amounts that are to be found in its declarations. There are several questions that need be answered. The first, for the honourable member for Pearce, is: who were the other businessmen that he approached, the and were appropriate declarations made in that regard? The second, by the Liberal he Party of Western Australia and the national Liberal Party, is: where are those todonations? Why were they not properly declared if the intentions were clearly for the there behind those donations? It is a complex law; there is no question of about that. The intention of the Government shortly to introduce legislation to amend it will render it a very simple one. It is a complex law; but it appears in this case that none of the opportunities to utilise that complex law have been utiljecting. ised. A decision was simply taken not to make any declaration of those matters at all. Of course, these are matters that the Liberal Party organisation, and no doubt members along its front bench, will want to ponder. I table those returns to give them ,an opportunity to do so.",53

132,Mr NEWELL,WHEAT EXPORTS TO IRAQ,My question is directed to the Prime Minister. What has the Government done to compensate our farmers disadvantaged by the sanctions on Iraq? Opposition members-Nothing.,55
133,Mr HAWKE,WHEAT EXPORTS TO IRAQ,"We get the interjection from Opposition members'Nothing'. We will see what 'nothing' means to them. Our farmers have been disadvantaged in three ways since sanctions were applied by the international community against Iraq. First, Iraq ceased him to meet its outstanding debts on wheat already purchased. Second, shipments for which there were signed contracts could me not be made and alternative buyers had to be found. Third, alternative markets this had to be found for that proportion of the harvest that would have gone to Iraq in the absence of the sanctions. I had a meeting with the Grains cil of Australia in August last year, when I said that no industry could be expected to carry the financial burden of the tions single handed, and that commitment has been met in a number of ways. First, under the Government's national interest insurance cover we will have paid out up to $181m by the end of June and $47 Sm by the end of 1992, if Iraq does not honour its commitments to the Austhe tralian Wheat Board. Of course, at this stage one cannot be certain that that not happen. Mr Tim Fischer-Yes.",55

Second, the Government has itself purable chased one of the outstanding shipments of wheat contracted by Iraq. The wheat on the ship Ever Advantage has been for humanitarian aid purposes in Egypt. Third, in November last year the Governdays. ment decided to increase the number of countries that would be subject to national insurance cover for wheat sales, to enable the Australian Wheat Board to broaden its market base and thereby sell the wheat that would otherwise have been sold Iraq.

Given the delicate state of Uruguay Round, particularly on agriculture, could the Minister please inform will the House about the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) review of the European Community's (EC) trade policies and their impact on the inter",56
139,Dr BLEWETT,POLICIES,"I thank the honourmember for Kennedy for his question. Honourable members interested in these issues will know that the GAIT used review of the European Community has taken place in Geneva in the past two The object of these GATT reviews is to examine the full range of a country's trade policies and practices and to try to assess publicly and openly their impact on international trade. Australia was the first country to subject itself to these reto views. That occurred in December 1989, by and the result of the Australian review Govwas that on the whole there were quite favourable comments on the direction of Australia's trade and industry policies. I think the same cannot be said of the review of the European Community. It was being reviewed for the first time by GAIT, and the report prepared by the GATT Secretariat is very critical of the European Community on a number of its trading fronts. There is a major focus in that report on the range of restrictive to measures the European Community and its member states use on imports in a number of sectors-for instance, cars, electronic goods and agriculture-and it lists a whole range of non-tariff restrictions, variable levies, so-called voluntary restraint agreements, quantitative restrictions, predatory use of anti-dumping and so on. Indeed, the report concludes in one comprehensive study that of the main tariff categories for industrial and consumer goods, analysis shows that in only two of these categories-furniture and works of art-are tariffs the sole instrument affecting imports. In all the other categories tariffs combine with at least one other form of non-tariff barrier, restriction or state aid or subsidy-that is, they have a highly non-transparent system of protection in these areas. When the report turns to agriculture, it is equally damning. It documents clearly the use and the effect of the nearly prohibitive import restrictions, and documents the export subsidies which dispose of surplus production on world markets. Indeed, the report points out how EC policies have distorted and corrupted world agricultural trade, and in doing so the European Community has damaged smaller countries and the GATT system, from which it has itself been one of the great beneficiaries. We have been emphasising this point in the Uruguay Round negotiations. When the report looks at the export subsidies for agriculture, it points out that the Europeans since 1982 have doubled the size of those export subsidies-an increase of $5.2 billion by 1989-even though in all the negotiations in which they were involved they were supposed to be reducing those exports. In the period of those negotiations there has been a considerable increase of those export subsidies for agriculture. In addition, as a result of that, the EC stocks of beef and butter are both mounting and now overhang world markets. We have had some hopeful comments from the European Community Commissioner, Mr MACSharry, indicating some recognition that this situation cannot continue but thus far we have to say that there has been very little evidence that the European Community states have recognised the need to take a more responsible attitude to agricultural reform. The chief reason the GATT negotiations and the Uruguay Round continue to be stalled is the failure of that recognition. Finally, the report focuses on the European Community's 1992 single market program and concludes that, while it will be an unparalleled exercise in regional integration-and it praises it for that-and will contribute to the expansion of trade, there is still a lack of transparency in the new provisions and still a strong element of discrimination in the system. I think the lesson is clear for the European Community: it needs to do a lot more to lower barriers to the rest of the world, to adopt much more transparent policies, and to adhere more fully to the GATT rules in order to make itself a proper and creditable member of the international trading community.

This is when I said in 1987, from the text just handed to me: I told the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that I read about that in a newspaper, which I did. I did know about the so-called run on Rothwells the previous week. That was in some respectsperhaps not widely-common knowledge. I think that is true: within banking circles it was common knowledge.  me that two days before. .",57

145,Mr KEATING,ROTHWELLS LTD,"I continue: I refer the Treasurer to the Western Australian Government's decision to back a deal to save Rothwells . . . Why did the Treasurer, in his answer to my question on this matter on Monday, not advise the House, as he advised a journalist yesterdayI was hardly covering anything up. . . that he knew of the deal last week? I answered: The answer to the first part of the question is that that was not what I was asked. I was asked about the details of the so-called rescue I told the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that I read about that in a newspaper-which I did. And I did. Shame on him; marks for trying, but shame on him. Mr Reith-Your arrogance!",58

153,Mr SNOW,RURAL INDUSTRY,Will the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy inform the House of the Government's strategy to assist the rural sector in its recovery from the current rural downturn?,58
154,Mr KERIN,RURAL INDUSTRY,"The honourable member's question opens up many areas of Government economic policy as well as specific farm policy. Quite frankly, always the best thing that any Government can do for the whole farm sector is in the macro-economic policy area: getting interest rates down and inflation rates down, as we are, and getting the exchange rate into a better balance. Many things that are off-farm, and the agenda this Government has set in the area of micropackage. economic reform that no other Government has ever tackled, are also terribly important. In terms of specific policies, we could . go quite a few ways. We could have industry specific policies, we could have across the board policies, or we could target individuals. As I announced today at the Grains Council meeting in Tamworth an hour or so ago, all moves taken by a government have to be not only in the interests of all farmers, but in the interests of all Australians. The latest moves announced by the Government do relate to the rural adjustment scheme, which adopts an across the board approach in targeting the plight of various individuals. We have developed that scheme and it was recently revamped. The decision taken by the Cabinet last night was to· increase the funding to $160m in the year ahead. With the States matching on a dollar for dollar basis the funds could total $187m. That is approximately three times the 1990-91 funding. It exceeds the funding when we were last in this predicament with the farm sector and we had the terms of trade collapse in 1986-87. It is targeted to individuals in need as opposed to absolutely blanket measures. There is to be a new subprogram within the rural adjustment scheme-debt reconstruction with an interest subsidy, or DRIS, as it will become known. This provides for reorganisation of debts and reduction in the interest rate paid by those farmers deemed viable, but who put themselves at risk by borrowing additional sums to get through the next year or two. Funding allocations for 1991-92 are: part A, up to $61.5m; part Band DRIS, up to $27.2m; and part C, up to $57.5m. I use the words 'up to' because we cannot predict in any shape or form the way State rural adjustment authorities will handle the various parts of the scheme. The Prime Minister has already ana nounced additional payments to the grains industry. These are industry specific measures associated particularly with Iraq compensation and I will not repeat that. We are to announce some details soon of aware. a new rural access program. We also took a decision last night to increase the number of people in the rural counselling program. Again, the funds that we have allocated allow for a doubling of the bers to 60 rural counsellors. These are the most recent decisions. As we grapple with the farm crisis, the GovWhat ernment's backing-not that much notice is taken of it-for our very big rural dustries is very tangible and funds to be transferred to the industries. For example, the national interest backing the wheat industry and the loan backing amount to over $2.1 billion. The $3.5 billion borrowing provides stability that will enable us to trade our way out of wool industry's problems. The Governhas ment will be announcing further decisions with respect to the wool industry at some time in the future. I conclude by pointing out that the dustry statement again addressed measvolve ures such as tariffs and depreciation. is all an advantage to Australia's primary industries. This Government has more on the agenda in more areas that will assist Australia's primary industries than the people opposite could ever even think about. NA",58

156,Mr KEATING,MR WARREN ANDERSON,"Here is a really thoughtful and novel question. I am treated with integrity by my friends because the people I choose to be friends have integrity also. That is why my associations-they are friendly ones-with Mr Anderson are a cause of no embarrassthe ment to me in any of the matters the honourable member has mentioned whatsoever.

157,Dr CHARLESWORTH,AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL,"I direct my question to the Minister for Transport numand Communications. Is the Minister aware of the proposal of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to establish two major air traffic control centres in Australia? are the implications of this concept for air safety in Australia, and what iminpact is it likely to have on aviation in allows real Western Australia?",59
158,Mr BEAZLEY,AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL,"I am aware of the CAA's announcement of an estimated $ 300m integrated air traffic system designed to improve safety and the provithe sion of services to industry. The system been proposed following an intensive review of the CAA's re-equipment program. The new system, to be in place by the end of 1995, will include state of the art communications technology already inproven overseas and is proposed to intwo major air traffic centres, This Melbourne and Brisbane. The CAA is expected to announce shortly details of its site selections. I understand that a proposed centre at Melbourne, in preference to Perth, has been because of the obvious benefit of Melbourne being on CAA's major traffic corridor-Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane. I am also aware of the concerns that have been expressed about the ·impact of the proposal on Western Australia, and particularly in Perth. I think it should be clearly understood, because I think some people do have unnecessary fears, that the air traffic control towers will not disappear from Perth or Jandakot airports. Existing control towers will continue to control aircraft takeoffs, landings and ground movements around airports. Under the current proposal, the handling of approach control services will be located i,n Melbourne. I understand that the CAA is examining submissions from staff and the Air Traffic Controllers Association which argue for approach control services to be retained at major capital city airports. There will be an impact upon the number of people employed in air traffic control and flight service functions in centres such as Perth when the new system becomes operational in 1995, and some people may well be invited to transfer to the proposed Melbourne and Brisbane control centres. It is clearly too early to speculate on the final impact on staffing levels while the CAA carries out a major resource review, scheduled to be completed by the end of May, and while the CAA is considering the proposal put forward by the Air Traffic Controllers Association NA",59
159,Mr FILING,MR BRIAN BURKE,"Did the Prime Minister at any time discuss the position of former Western Australian Premier Peter Dowding with Ambassador Burke, which, as a consequence of the participation of Mr Burke while still a serving ambassador, along with the then State Secretary and now a senior Keating adviser, Stephen Smith, led to the. dumping of Mr Dowding, saving five Federal Australian Labor Party seats in Western Australia-a move which helped save his Party at the 1990 Federal election? .",60
160,Mr HAWKE,MR BRIAN BURKE,"It is quite possible I discussed the question of the state of the Labor Party in Western Australia with Mr Burke. It was a matter in which he had an interest and in which I had a very real interest. As the honourable member says, the position in Western Australia turned out to be very different from what he was talking about. I go back to the previous question in terms of expectations: the honourable member wants to be very careful about the way in which he jumps to conclusions about an event two years away from us yet. I think one of the recollections that sticks in my mind most clearly in my decade in this House goes back to the period of 1989, when the previous Leader of the National Partydo those opposite recall him; his name was Blunt?-used to swagger up to this dispatch box and point over and say, 'You're gone. You're gone. You're gone'. The question is: who has gone? One part of that presumption of the previous Leader of the National Party and of a whole lot of the rest of the Opposition was that the Opposition was going to wipe us out in Western Australia. There is his very distinguished successor, of coursea very fine addition to this House; an enormous improvement on his predecessor-",60
161,Mr HAWKE,MR BRIAN BURKE,"Neville Newell. Got it in one! I admit that it is harder for me because I have more to remember than the honourable member has, and I will have more to remember after 1993 than he will have. It is true, as I said, that part of that swagger, part of that assumption about what was going to happen in 1990, was based upon a proposition that we were going to be wiped out in Western Australia. We did not get wiped out in Western Australia-for a number of reasons, the most important of which was the outstanding quality 'of our members in that State. We should look at. them. They should stand up and be counted. That was the basic reason why we retained our seats. It may well be the case that the change of leadership over there may have been of some assistance in getting that result. As I had an interest in what was happening in that State, as did Mr Burke and everyone else, it is quite possible that I talked to him about the issue. NA NA",60
162,Mr OKEEFE,CORPORATION,My question is directed to the Minister for Land Transport. It concerns proposals about the establishment of a National Rail Freight Corporation. I ask: is it true that the Industry Commission has now released its draft report on rail transport? Does the draft report recommend and support the formatiori of a National Rail Freight Corporation? How will the Corporation operate? I ask the Minister to outline the benefits to Australia of its formation.,60
163,Mr ROBERT BROWN,CORPORATION,"The report from the Industry Commission, to which the honourable member refers, was made public yesterday. That report now vindicates in a very positive way, and provides support for, the position which we have adopted in connection with the developm'ent of rail transport and in pursuing the initiative that we have been pursuing in connection with the proposed National Rail Freight Corporation. The honourable member asked what type of value an initiative of that kind would have. It is interesting that the Industry Commission has drawn attention to the fact that, if we were able to achieve world best standards in the operation of the national rail system, it would bring about an advantage to the national community in two particular ways. The first one would be in eliminating an operating deficit on that total national rail system each year of a sum up to $4,000m. That would be a very substantial benefit to national taxpayers in the first place. The second benefit would be that, if we were able to achieve-as I believe we could-an improvement in productivity within that industry of about 30 per cent, that would represent an addition of another $4,000m to gross domestic product. In addition, it was indicated as well by the task force in its inquiry into the p.(oposal for a National Rail Freight Corporation' that the achievement of that objective would contribute $1. 5 billion of that total of $4 billion. In the process of doing that it would make it possible for the States to eliminate the aggregate operating deficit of $377m on that interstate system that came about in 1989-90. That is a significant benefit to all of those dividual State taxpayers. I am particularly pleased that the report came out. It haS created a culture shock in Australia, as was needed, to bring home to people-:-national taxpayers, in particular-the inadequacy of a rail system in Australia which started off with nonstan<;lardised rail networks in the first place and which has been on the ground for over 100 years. Those objectives that we have set have not been achieved in that century of operation of rail network in Australia. The report endorsed the decision which, I am pleased to say, was come to very forcefully and very positively by the State transport Ministers when we met about a fortnight ago. In a very positive way they came out strongly in support of that National Rail Freight Corporation. That followed the meeting which they had on 7 September last year, together with myself. We set up a· task force. That was endorsed by the Prime Minister when, he met with the State Premiers and the Chief Ministers on 30 to 31 October at the end of last year. They went to the extent of signing a heads of agreement that we would have a corporation established on 1 July this year. Of course, there have been some difficulties associated with it. Most of the decisions that needed to be made have been made by the Premiers, the Prime Minister and the State transport Ministers. There are some problems which have still to be resolved, particularly in relation to the question of assets and funding within that Corporation. But if the State transport Ministers, their constituents and national constituents understand the enormous national importance of our' getting that initiative together and showing that rail does have a future in Australia and needs to be developed in order to establish a proper balance between the various modes of land transport in Australia, then those State transport Ministers and the State governments will feel more committed towards the proposal. Their State constituents know that over the whole of Australia, as I say, they are kicking the can each in- year to the extent of $4,000m to operate that rail network and, just on inter-system freight movement alone, almost $400mand that has been going on for over 100 years and we are going to do something about it with their commitment.

172,Mr SPEAKER,WAGE FIXING SYSTEM,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The overwhelming need to dismantle Australia's outmoded centralised wage fixation system. ' call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen",62
173,Mr HOWARD,WAGE FIXING SYSTEM,"Bennelong) (3.09)a Yesterday, the Australian Industrial ReCommission brought down arguor ably one of the more important national case decisions that body or its predecessor, the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, has brought down during the last 20 years. The importance of that decision is not to be found so much in the amount of the wage increase that it awarded; it is not to be found so much in the decision that it took on award superannuation; and it is not to be found so much in the immediate impact of the decision: rather, it is to be found in what the decision represents in terms of the Commission's attitude towards, and the attitude of the community towards, the type of wage fixation system that this country ought to have. It has frequently been said that one of the pillars of the immediate post-Federation consensus in Australia was the maintenance of a centralised wage fixation system, built very much upon the decision of Mr Justice Higgins of the Commission in the famous Harvester case. That philosophy and that attitude had the proposition that became enshrined in the principle of comparative wage justice which said in effect that a metal worker in Cairns was entitled to the same income as a metalworker on the other side of the country. From those early years of Federation until 1986, there was essentially a bipartisan consensus in this country around centralised wage fixation. In 1986 the coalition parties boldly, in the face of an enormous amount of criticism from not only the Australian Labor Party but also large sections of the media and substantial sections of the business community, although with a number of noble exceptions, a number of whom now sit on the Opposition front bench-I refer in particular to the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan), who was then the President of the National Farmers Federation, and the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), who has played a very prominent role as a barrister in a number of landmark decisions on the notion of freedom of contract-asserted the simple proposition that if we were ever to have a productivity break-out in this country, if we were ever to unleash the talents at an enterprise level of the combined efforts of employers and their employees working together for the common good of their enterprise and the collective good of the nation, it would be necessary to dismantle Australia's rigid, outmoded, centralised wage fixation system. That is why we adopted that policy. That is why we said from 1986 onwards that what this nation needed was a policy whereby every firm and every enterprise could become the master of its own economic destiny. We said that every firm and every enterprise should be able to decide how to run its affairs, that it should not have to go off, cap in hand, to the Industrial Relations Commission, which ultimately is answerable to the corporate state; it should not have to go off, cap in hand, to the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), the Confederation of Australian Industry or the Business Council of Australia. We said that if a firm or enterprise decides that the best way to run that firm or enterprise to the maximum advantage of the owner and the employees is in a particular direction, subject to the payment of a minimum wage and the observance of health and safety and like requirements, it should be able to do so. That has been the centrepiece of our industrial relations policy ever since. A companion to that proposition has and been the assertion that if one believes in a free society one believes in freedom of association. Freedom of association means in Australia in 1991 that one should have the freedom to join a union or to not join a union, according to one's choice, and there should be absolutely no dispute or argument among free men and women that if they do not want to join a union they should have a total right to reject it. But that is not a notion that finds acceptance in the rariks of the Labor Party. But then that is hardly surprising. A party that would ban free speech on radio and television would hardly baulk at banning free association of men and women in the trade union movement. It is typical of the contemptuous attitude that the Labor Party takes towards such fundamental notions. It is first in the queue when it comes to extolling the virtues of international human rights conventions; it is last in the queue when it comes to imposing the spirit of those in the domestic affairs of this country. Yesterday's decision was not only important in the experience of industrial relations in the last 20 years; it was also illustrative of the muddled thinking on occasions of the industrial relations establishment in this country. In that decision is found that extraordinary mix of almost insufferable paternalism which afflicts the Industrial Relations Commission and yet on the other hand a recognition of something we have asserted now for somethirig like seven or eight years, that is, if we want a true enterprise bargaining system in Australia we have to dismantle the centralised wage fixation system. The Industrial Relations Commission, in rejecting the Government's Chiytpn's proposition of enterprise bargainingsupported, I regret to say, by a number of the employer organisations, by too many of the Australian States and, of course, by the ACTU-put forward the remarkable proposition that the system in Australia is riot mature enough to handle an enterprise bargaining system. I say on behalf of this side of the House: what an infernal nerve the Industrial Relations Commission has to say to the ordinary workers and businessmen of this country that they are not mature enough to decide how best to run the enterprises they own and work for. It is typical-and barely surprisingof a group of people who have been held up as the high priests and lord protectors of our centralised wage fixation system for almost 90 years that they should reach that particular conclusion. I simply say to the Industrial Relations Commission, and I say to the defenders of the centralised wage fixation system, that there are hundreds of thousands of small enterprises in Australia and there are millions of Australian men and women employed by those enterprises who are mature enough to make decisions about their own future if only they are given the opportunity to do so; if only they are allowed to do what the 300 workers at SPC wanted to do, without the paternal interference of the Trades Hall Council under John Halfpenny and the Industrial Relations Commission; if only they are allowed to do what the workers in the Prospect County Council were allowed to do-and·for their pains they were called asinine and stupid by Senator Cook; if only they are allowed to do what theerriployees and the owner of Power Brewing in Queensland were able to do in that brief sunlit period when voluntary agreements were allowed under the forrrier Government in Queensland. In going from zero to 20 per cent of the Queensland beer market in 31f2 years, Power Brewing was able to lift productivity by 85 per cent, grab 20 per cent of the Queensland beer market and, most importantly, pay its workers $8,000 to $10,000 a year' more than workers employed in other parts of the brewing industry. The employees and the owner were able to do that because they were given the freedom for a brief period under State law in Queensland to go outside the Industrial Relations Commission, to do their own enterprise thing. They were able to tell the tribunal, the union and the employer organisation to go away, and they were allowed to sort out their own destiny. And look at what happened. If that could be allowed to happen 100,000-fold or 1,000,000-fold around Australia over the remaining years of this century ,we cOllld perhaps hope at the turn of the next century to contemplate, as our forebears did at the turn of this century, living in the nation with the highest living standard in the world. We must reform Australia's centralised industrial relations system and dismantle this manifestation of the Government's corporatist approach to running this country. Is it not ironic and strange that the supreme political embarrassment that the Government finds itself in this week over the revelations in Western Australia is really a product of the corporate state mentality of the Australian Labor Party throughout the entire country? I have often said that the real difference between our philosophy of running Australia and the philosophy of those opposite is not that we do not both want the same outcome-we all want a prosperous nation and we all want Ii. decent future for our children-but that our view is that we get it by unleashing the talents, the aspirations and the vision of individual men and women by creating a climate of individual enterprise and incentive and hope and enthusiasm. On the other hand, the Australian Labor Party believes that a great future is created by doing deals with powerful interest groups in the Australian community. It was the passion of the Labor Party in Western Australia to do a deal with the big end of town in Perth that has landed it in this colossal mess. That will happen to any government of any political persuasion that puts its faith and the future of this country in the hands of institutions and says that institutions are more important than outcomes. Whenever I have debated Senator Cook and my friend opposite the Minister for Finance, the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis), who was Minister for Industrial Relations, they have always talked as though the system was the end in itself. They would always say, 'You can't do that because it is not allowed by the system'. They never asked themselves the question: how do we get the best outcome? I want an enterprise bargaining setup in this country not because I want to destroy the trade union movement-I do not want to do that; nobody on this side of the House wants to destroy the trade union movement-but because I want an industrial relations climate that produces rising real incomes and a productive outcome. The only way we will get that is by creating a climate in which individuals at an enterprise level are given the opportunity to do it. Yesterday's decision overwhelmingly told us-and, I know, to the complete surprise of the Government and the ACTU-that the Industrial Relations Commission decided something that has been blindingly obvious to us for a very long time; that is, like oil and water a centralised wage fixation system and true enterprise bargaining simply will not mix. We cannot have both of them at the same time. This nation has to make an historic choice: either we stick to the failed corporate state model of the centralised wage fixation system or we embrace the radical change that is needed and is inherent in embracing enterprise bargaining. The long history of the centralised wage fixation system has delivered to this country in 1991 an atmosphere of diminishing hope and declining economic optimism. As I go around the nation I see a spirit of despair which I certainly have not experienced at any other time in my life. We have gone through recessions and downturns before; we have never gone through one as bad as this in the post-war experience. If those opposite are honest they know that the depth of despair, the loss of hope and the failure of optimism about the economic future of this country are deeper and more entrenched now than at any time since the end of World War II. One crucial way of breaking out of that straitjacket is to reject a failed, outmoded, old fashioned and irrelevant industrial relations structure, dismantle the de centralised system and embrace true enterprise bargaining.",62
174,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WAGE FIXING SYSTEM,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,65
175,Mr WILLIS,WAGE FIXING SYSTEM,"The basic proposition of the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) seemed to be, as he said in his press release issued yesterday, that the Industrial Relations Commission, in its national wage decision yesterday, decided that enterprise bargaining and the centralised wage fixation system did not mix. That is a total misinterpretation of the decision. Nothing in the Commission's decision says anything of the kind. In fact, the Commission said that it had not made up its mind about enterprise bargaining. It said that it wanted to hear more from the parties about that matter and that it would decide upon it at a later time. It set out various concerns it had about the move to enterprise bargaining. Let me say on behalf of the Government, as has been said already by other spokesmen, that we regret that the Commission took that view, particularly in the light of the fact that there was strong agreement amongst the parties that there should be a move to enterprise wage bargaining. We have already had, of course, in the last several years, a considerable move to enterprise bargaining, not in respect of wages, but in respect of conditions of employment and working arrangements, and this has been almost revolutionary by the historical standards of industrial relations in this country. It has meant that there has been, through the award restructuring process, a process unleashed in which we have had changes in awards to facilitate changes at the workplace, and those changes at the workplace are beginning to happen on a substantial scale. There is still a lot more scope for that to happen, as the Commission pointed out yesterday, but at least there has been a basic change in the awards which previously were so restrictive and so inhibiting on changing working arrangements to suit the conditions or the needs of the enterprise. Now, awards have been changed largely to enable much greater flexibility at the workplace than was ever the case before. It was the view of the parties-the view of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, of most of the employers and of the Federal Government and State governments-that there should be a further step now towards enterprise wage bargaining, and not just enterprise bargaining in relation to conditions of employment. That was a step that the Commission felt unready to take at this stage, but it did not in any way conclude, as the honourable member for Bennelong said in his press statement issued yesterday, that: The most significant feature of today's national wage decision is its rejection is possible to have enterprise bargaining within a centralised system of wage-fixation. It never said anything of that kind at all. What is happening to the system-and it will happen, although, because of the delay built in through yesterday's decision, not as quickly as we would like it to happen-is that the system is moving inexorably towards a freeing up, towards much greater flexibility and towards much greater emphasis on the enterprise in industrial relations. The final step, of course, is the determination of wages at the enterprise level. The Commission has concerns about that, and they are concerns which the Government shares in terms of the overall wages outcome. We would certainly not want to see a system in which enterprise bargaining led to a wages break-out, and that was one of the concerns that the Commission had. We believe that guidelines that were suggested by the Commonwealth in respect of this case could have given some assurance about that, but that was not the Commission's view. It is a legitimate concern-a very legitimate concern-that if the system devolves to the enterprise level, we could then get, a wage break-out. That is not likely to happen in current economic conditions. That was one reason why the Commonwealth believed this to be an appropriate time to move to enterprise bargaining, because it is economically a time in which it is highly unlikely that we will see' a wages breakout. The development of an understanding about wage bargaining at the enterprise level could occur, in a way, with much greater surety about the outcome in the present circumstances than if we were doing this at a time of high economic growth. It is also a concern of the Government that any move to enterprise bargaining does not enable exploitation of the work force to take place. That is not a concern of the Opposition. The Opposition's proposed system for enterprise bargaining would enable total exploitation to occur if it could get the system in place, and in a moment I will come to whether it could of the notion that it do that. The Opposition spokesman says that the work force would have the protection of a minimum wage. I do not believe that such a minimum wage would be possible of application, but leaving that aside for one moment, all other conditions of employment set down by awards under the Opposition's system would be capable of renegotiation, and a dominant employer could certainly require employees to work under much less advantageous conditions than are currently available under awards. For instance, annual leave could be abolished; working hours could be greatly extended; penalty rates obviously would be a prime target; lunch breaks could be abolished-whatever the employers liked. They could change the whole conditions of employment which have been the derlying basis of security for the whole Australian work force-that is, that there would be minimum conditions of employfected ment. Under the Opposition's proposal is a good thing. the whole of those conditions would go, and all that would be left would be minimum wage. That would be the only basic protection for the work force. Of course, that is not even likely to be the case. As far as I can see, the Comhonourable monwealth has no power to set a minipower mum wage for a voluntary agreement. night Indeed, I will take it one step further and say there is no obvious power, leaving aside corporations, for the Commonwealth to move to enterprise bargaining for non-corporations, because the only power we have in relation to industrial relations at present comes from placitum (xxxv) of section 51 of the Constitution, which talks about conciliation and arbiable tration for the settlement of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits anyone State. So there has to be an dustrial dispute, and it has to be an intermonwealth state industrial dispute; a local agreement struck in a lolly shop in Canberra will be an interstate industrial dispute. Where does the power come from? It sion to, do it? does not come from the conciliation and arbitration powers in the Constitution. bargaining? Does it come from the corporations power? The Opposition might be able to use that in respect of corporations. Threejections quarters of small businesses, for which this is supposed to be the policy, are corporations, so they cannot rely on the corporations power. Does it come from the trade and commerce power, in which one has to be engaged in interstate and overseas trade? Will that be the powerof presumably not-for most small busispokesman nesses? It is very difficult to see how there would be a constitutional power to enable the avoidance of awards for the settling of voluntary agreements. The Opposition's policy would also give voluntary agreements the status of awards so as to avoid the States system, but of course that could not be done if there was no constitutional power for that purpose. Quite simply, there is no power for the unestablishment of voluntary agreements outside corporations, which means that most small businesses could not be afby this policy. I think that probably Secondly, in respect of the minimum the wage, which the honourable member for Bennelong says he would have in operation as the one protection for people subject to these agreements, where would the member for Bennelong get the to set it? On television the other he said, obviously off the top of his head, 'Oh well, this could be set by legislation.' Where is the power to set it by legislation? There is no power to do that under the conciliation and arbitration power. Will it again be under the corporations power? Maybe it will; it is. certainly not under any other power that we can see, so we do not see how the honourmember for Bennelong could possibly do that. The honourable member for of Bennelong also said, 'Oh, maybe we can inget the Commission to set it.' The Comdoes not have power to direct the Commission to settle a dispute in a not particular way or to determine any minimum wage, so how would the honourable member for Bennelong get the CommisMr Beale-Don't you want enterprise",65
176,Mr WILLIS,WAGE FIXING SYSTEM,"Despite the idiot interfrom honourable members opposite, it is obvious that the Opposition not policy is fatally flawed. That is a very good thing because that policy would not be in the 'interests of this country. What is in the interests of this country-and there seems to be an abysmal ignorance it in the Opposition, starting with its and flowing through the rest of the Opposition-is that the wage-fixing system is presently devolving from the highly centralised system it was into a much more flexible system. The existing conditions of employment are now capable of much interpretation for the needs of the enterprise, and with the Commission expressing concern about going to enterprise wage bargaining-in my view it is highly likely that will eventually be the case-certainly the Government will be doing its bit to ensure that will be the case, within guidelines which give protection against a wages break-out. Importantly-from the Government's point of view-that will not be done in a way which enables the exploitation of people who are not in strong or reasonable bargaining positions. That will protect the individuals the Opposition says will be free to negotiate with their employers. Imagine one individual trying to negotiate an agreement with an 'employer who was in a dominant position and who had a great choice of labour to employsome sort of equal bargaining that would 'be! Obviously it would be a recipe for massive exploitation. We would not remove the award structure that has been built up over this century to provide minimum standards and to provide protections to workers around this country. The Government certainly would never allow enterprise bargaining to come in in a way that did that; but it will enable, as part of the industrial tions process, the evolution of the system to enterprise wage bargaining in a way that maintains that protection and also provides protection against wages breakout, neither of which is addressed by the Opposition's policies.",67

The economy we inherited was one that was very uncompetitive. It was an economy that was highly protected against imports, an economy that was full of rigid-",68

181,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WAGE FIXING SYSTEM,I warn the honourable member for Mitchell.,68
182,Mr WILLIS,WAGE FIXING SYSTEM,"Of course that was the case. The honourable member for Mitchell must be living in some sort of cloudcuckoo-land. The change in protection has been unbelievable. The only party that has cut protection in this century has been the Australian Labor Party. It has not been his mob. They were the ones who built up this high protective apparatus that allowed industry after industry to be dominated by monopoly or oligopoly, that allowed all sorts of inflexible arrangements to apply, which are being broken down by this Government by the vast array of micro-economic reform that is taking place.",68
183,Mr CADMAN,WAGE FIXING SYSTEM,Yes-right out the door.,68
184,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WAGE FIXING SYSTEM,"'-Orderl If the honourable member for Mitchell interjects again, I will name him.",68
185,Mr WILLIS,WAGE FIXING SYSTEM,"That is building a much rela-' more competitive economy, which makes it much less likely, as we move to an enterprise bargaining system, that we will get the kind of wage break-outs that might otherwise have occurred in previous times. That does not remove the possibility entirely. It is therefore important, in our view, to maintain the guidelines for that and to ensure that at the end of the day the Commission has some kind of control over the overall wages outcome. If it is not the Commission, there is no obvious body that is going to have that control. So it is absurd to denigrate the Commission. The Commission, in our view, has an important role to play in providing the basis of protective awards and the framework for the wages policy that will apply for the future. It is a policy that in the view of this Government will enable the increased flexibility of the labour market, which been evolving over the last several years, to take the last step to wage bargaining. expect that later this year, when the next national wage case is held, that the outcome. If that is not the case, certainly there will be great concern on the part of the Commonwealth and, I imagised ine, on the part of all the parties, the majority of whom are very concerned to bring about that kind of system-but not the system the Opposition wants. No interday-the dustrial relations party that I am aware is arguing for the Opposition's system. Not one industrial group on the union, the employer or even the Government side is arguing for anything like the Opposition would want to apply because of its inherent unfairness and wage unprechange dictability.",68

187,Mr ANDERSON,WAGE FIXING SYSTEM,"Gwydir) (3.39)Members of what the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) might refer to as the industrial relations club, C.S. Lewis might have called the indusserve trial relations inner ring, or what ordinary Australians now might be entitled to call a failed system, are looking increasingly beleaguered and increasingly defensive. Well might they be looking increasingly beleaguered and increasingly defensive. Australians in general, and Australian workers in particular, are becoming creasingly strident in their demands that the system eitl'\er become relevant-that it get on with the job of helping to get out of our mess, of finding a means for the preservation of jobs and increasing efficiency, of halting the decline in living standards-or get out of the way. 'Get relevant or get out of the way'that is the call. Let us get on with the job of rebuilding our national prosperity and with it our employment security, our ing standards and the future for our dren. That is a call that can no longer ignored. Yesterday's unintelligible decithe sion by the Industrial Relations Commistwo sion (lRC) makes it quite obvious that members of the 'club' know that time is up as well. The problem is that, instead of responding realistically and positively, has at a time when boldness as well as prudence is called for, they are reacting with I the traditional tactics of the entrenched. When they know the time is ripe for rewill be form and change, they dig in. Another prominent member of the club demonstrated last year that it, too, realthat the time was up. The response great from the Victorian Trades Hall Council to the SPC Ltd enterprise agreement dispute was exactly the same as we saw yestactic of digging in. Could it of be that the IRC, with yesterday's patently self-serving decision, played right into the hands of its critics, including the critics on this side of the House? Has it not shown in its refusal to grasp the need for fundamental and genuine reform and that it is. more concerned with the preservation of its own role and the power privilege thus accorded it, than it is in the interests of the Australian people and the Australian worker-just as the Victorian Trades Hall Council did last year in the dispute over the SPC agreewhat ment? Do not both examples ultimately only to guarantee the more rapid decline of each of these members of the club as the Australian community increasingly understands its real motivationand its unreal role in undermining our living standards and job security? The workers at SPC clearly understood the need to strike an arrangement which inwas relevant to the needs and the eConomic circumstances of their workplace situation. They clearly understood that the us saving of their jobs could best be achieved by a process of on-site negotiation. It cannot be avoided, in terms of observing what happened, that they sought to exclude the upper echelons of the trade union movement from their negotiations. Whilst it is true that Halfpenny and his crew sought to interfere when they found livout what was going on-with the help of chilother members of the club they forced be SPC and its workers to withdraw within boundaries of the award structurepoints need to be made: firstly, those rearranged work practices resulted in a 48 per cent improvement in productivity. Let us not walk away from that; that is what happened. Let us pose the question: who is happiest? The answer is the workers. Not only have they got their jobs, but they have the prospect of future expansion and an improvement in their lot based on the fact that their outfits will stay in business. They also face the prospect of real expansion in the future. Mr MCGauran-Profit sharing.",69
188,Mr ANDERSON,WAGE FIXING SYSTEM,"And profit sharing, as the honourable member for Gippsland interjects. The second point that needs to be remembered is that the workers clearly perceive the need for an enterprise based agreement and the need to achieve that, given the nature and the limitations that the club imposes these days, outside the dictates of the club. The workers at North Queensland Engineering and Agents Pty Ltd (NQEA), the largest shipbuilder in Queensland, struck a secret deal recently in' an attempt to secure their fut\1re and jobs. It is interthe esting to note that the major party to the secret agreement with the shipbuilding company was the Metal Trades Industry Association. The MTIA argued the line that the Industrial Relations Commission should not embrace enterprise awards, which the Commission has accepted. Yet here is an example of it doing one-a very secretive one; nonetheless, that is what it was. The terms and conditions are obviously outside the Commission guidelines. The structural. efficiency principle has also been broken. The union and the Commission have offended their own principles. Rather than admit that it is all a load of nonsense, they have not only kept them secret, but they have also done what the national wage case decision appears to have recommended against. In short, the NQEA has done a deal to save workers jobs. It had to be done in secret otherwise, shock, horror, others may seek to do similar deals elsewhere to save their jobs.",70
189,Mr HOWARD,WAGE FIXING SYSTEM,You mustn't do that.,70
190,Mr ANDERSON,WAGE FIXING SYSTEM,"We cannot allow that as it interrupts the power game. At Power Brewing-the example used today-employees earn $6,000 to $10,000 more a year than their colleagues at XXXX by working under different conditions. There is no shortage of clients for the firms which compete successfully in the open market for retirement homes. For example, Greenmeadow Court employees earn more than similar employees elsewhere. They are happy, yet under Goss there is an attempt to wind all those provisions back. If I have time, I will come back to it. Plainly, workers know now that the game is up and they want the flexibility and the right to negotiate their own arrangements that will give them and their children a future as well. Workers are right to realise that the centralised wage fixing system must go. I hope that every worker across this country gets to hear that we are, in the view of what one commentator called mother goose, the IRC, not 'mature enough' to cope with a shift away from a nanny which goes under term of 'centralised wage control'. The sooner they realise how paternalistic and patronising this approach is, the more strident they will become in demanding effective reform. It is obvious that the club. intends to fight for its survival regardless of what people might actually want-or need. Let us consider Queensland. The previous National Party Government came to grips with the two most pernicious monopolies in the country-employee representation by registered unions, and work condition determinations by the IRe. The successful introduction of voluntary enterprise agreements (VEAs) in Queensland was the result. There can be no doubt that workers thought and continue to think-where they are allowed to stay in these agreements-that these agreements are great, they are the way of the future. Consider Power Brewing, Mini Movers, Metway and Kin Kin Sawmill. This does not interest the Goss Labor Government; it is seeking to reimpose the power of the club to dictate. Mr Jull-The Government of revenge.",70
191,Mr ANDERSON,WAGE FIXING SYSTEM,"It is the Government of revenge-hold the workers back. Public pressure forced it to back off a little, so now it has adopted a halfway house. One can have a VEA, but it must involve a union and mother IRC must approve it. Mr Nehl-Big Brother.",70
192,Mr ANDERSON,WAGE FIXING SYSTEM,"No, Big Mother. Get it right. After lengthy and learned consideration, the IRC granted a special award just to. Power Brewing-lucky Power Brewing!-but did not specify a starting date. As far as I know, it still has not. In another case, a new award was granted to a nursing home, but it has to be reviewed every 12 months. It cannot be given freedom to get on with the job itself; it needs mother to look after it. One observer in Queensland has commented that it is nonsense to suggest that the Commission is performing the function that the public expects of it. He said: It is not solving disputes. It is not independent umpire. It is not looking after the interests. of the workers. It is looking after itself. Maybe the bottom line is that Australians are voting with their feet to break the control of the club. Maybe that is why 30.8 per cent of the private sector work force now belongs to a union. Maybe that is why a union official conceded to an acquaintance of mine the other day that, when we are elected and we introduce compulsory voluntary unionism, union membership in this country will drop 10 per cent or less. Despite what Senator Cook claims, our centralised system is not only hopelessly inadequate, it is virtually unique. We do not even really share it with New Zealand any more-it is about to abolish its bitration Commission. Russia and China may have centralised systems, but they not have successful economies either. The Australian people want a successful economy. They want the impediments to securing job growth, better living standaside ards and a future for their kids removed, cut out like a cancer. Again, I say on their behalf to the union movement, to the IRC, to the club, 'Get relevant or get out upset about. of the way'.",71
193,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WAGE FIXING SYSTEM,"Order! The honourable memhonourable ber's time has expired.  (3.49)-1 think it is unfortunate to listen to a presentation such as that where a member stands, slurs and derides the Australian Industrial Relations Commission because the decision it makes does not happen to suit the Opposition's policy. The simple question one asks is: if the Opposition's policy is so relevant, why is it rejected by most of Australian industry's leadership? That is all we have to ask-end of story. Those opposite have referred to anecdotal examples around Australia of changes that have been made. linprovements were made in SPC within the existing award system, not outside. So it is again irrelevant to the proposal argued by the honourable member' for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and the honourable member acting as an for Gwydir (Mr Anderson). Let me come to this idea of casting off what those opposite call the shackles and letting employers go out there and do their out of own thing with every employee. Mr Truss-Good idea.  the honourable member says. Which of us in this chamber has not had to deal with, at some stage, a complaint from a mother about exploitation of her daughter by an to employer? Hands up which honourable members have not had to deal with that kind of situation. That is what those opppsite want. Let us get it all out in the open so the public really understands what it is they are talking about. At a time of Ar9.3 per cent unemployment and higher still figures for youth, they are saying, do 'Remove whatever protection is there now and is supported by the mass of Australian industry leadership and the mass of the Australian community.'-this was an issue at the last election-'Cast all that' and let her rip'. We do not share that view; industry does not share that view; and the Commission did, not share it. That is what those opposite are so I come now to the Opposition's achievements in this whole area. The member for Bennelong was the sole architect of double digit inflation and double digit unemployment, all at the one time. Only he achieved that, and here he is today, ad nauseam, from only a few weeks ago, with the same old story. He has learnt a song and he cannot forget it. No matter that it is irrelevant, no matter that industry rejects it; he has learnt that song and, come hell or high water, he is going to continue to sing it. So be it. But under the existing system which this Government supports and which has been supported right across the nation we have seen an average employment growth of 2.7 per cent. Compare that with the record of the honourable member for Bennelong-O,7 per cent employment growth. This is the double digit unemployment, double digit inflation man, who now purports to give us all a lecture on how it ought to be done. He regrets support for the case to the Industrial Relations Commission of too many industry organisations in .the States. He ought to go and tell them that, but all that does is express his own irrelevance and the irrelevance of his policy. The honourable member and the Opposition and the last speaker all proclaim to know more about running a business than the people who actually run the businesses-the industry managers and the industry leaders. The Opposition knows more than they do! It knows more about what the industrial relations system ought to be. Those on the other side of the chamber have this sort of simplistic, childlike belief that, if by some way we got rid of the industrial relations system, got rid of the Industrial Relations Commission, abolished all awards and left employers to exploit each employee as they wished, prosperity would reign forever and, by some magical potion, productivity would massively increase. Up it will go. Harmony will reign. Productivity will produce an Australia that is world competitive and prosperity will reign. That is so childlike and so simplistic and so stupid that it is not really worth giving any kind of substance or consideration to at all. The honourable member for Bennelong said that we have to have a productivity break-out and the existing wages system must be destroyed; every form of enterprise should be master of its own destiny, subject to payment of the minimum wage. As the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) has said, we do not have constitutional power to introduce that kind of system; it is an impossibility. Those opposite know that but they cling to that childlike belief. In all of this, the most important factor of all is ignored by those in the Opposition-I do not think they know about it-that is, the role of management. If we strike down the existing wages system as protection for employees-men and women and we put in the free-for-all system that the Opposition is talking about, where is the role of management? In this country today it is abundantly clear that working men and women understand and recognise that we have to substantially lift our productivity and that we have to become world competitive. They are accepting that. The fact that there has been a 61 per cent reduction in working days lost through industrial disputation is proof of that. There has been a real reduction in wages, but employees have accepted that because they see the larger gain. We have to become world competitive. Where then is the role of management? That is the important factor that is ignored by the Opposition; it is not understood by the Opposition; and to date it is yet to perform in this country. There are some 600,000 middle managers in this country not trained to manage and not trained-:-I might say to the honourable member for Benne1ong-to make the best use of available resources to get the best productivity output. They were trained to give orders. It was the system under conservative governments: from up on high, down came the order from the boardroom, 'Sack 300 workers'. Three hundred workers were sacked. 'Work longer hours'. Longer hours were worked. There was no communication down the system. They are not managers; they are people trained to give orders. If one looks right across this country and goes around the workplaces-not the odd one that some of the Opposition members call in on-one will see what is going on. By talking to management, one will find that management itself readily acknowledges that it has a problem, because the greatest resistance to change and improvement in this country is middle management itself. That is understandable, for good reason. Middle management knows that under a flatter management system far fewer managers will be needed, so they have got to be retrained. They know that they were trained to give orders and to tell these blokes what to do. They have not been trained to say, 'Come here. Sit down. What do you think is the best way of lifting productivity on this production line of yours? How can we lift our game?'. They are not trained to do that. A handful of them are and some of them are doing fantastically well, and I will come to those. That is the fundamental problem that is ignored completely by the Oppositionthe role of management. I will go to the bible for· the Opposition-the Business Council Bulletin; the red book. I refer to page 17 of the issue of March 1991. It says: Labour market performance is poor. Australia rates very poorly on a wide range labour market measures as shown in Chart 3 with high rates of labour absenteeism, high labour turnover, low willingness to accept new technology, and a poor ability to adjust remuneration economic circumstancesthat is what enterprise agreements are aboutand limited automation. That is telling us that managers are not managing. Those are the results of inadequate management, not inadequate effort by employees, because leadership and enthusiasm come from the top, not from the workers down on the floor. If we have managers who cannot lead and manageit does not matter how hard the employees are prepared to work their hearts outwe are not going to get the results that this country needs. There are firms around the country that are involving their employees. Honourable members have heard the story-I have repeated it before-that the BHP policy at Newcastle used to be, 'As you come in the gate you are required to leave your brain outside because you are paid to do as you are told, not to think'. BHP has changed that policy. It has involved its employees and it is now their goldmine, which they are working to get ideas and improvements in productivity: and it is succeeding. It could not have happened without the leadership of management. I refer to a firm of about 60 people: this is the kind of size the honourable member for Bennelong is referring to-a small firm. This firm has been owned by BHP for 20 years and it had lost money for 20 years. It makes metal products and tools. The advice of the manager of this company now is that management should concentrate on changing the organisation structure: change the managers, not the workers. If the managers will not change, then the managers are changed. That is not happening out there in general. The Opposition is blind to this aspect, this major weakness of Australian industry. That firm says that, if managers would not change, they were changed. It has had brilliant success in Newcastle. Prior to the takeover it had .lost money for 20 years. It now has no problems with unions and of management and workers are working together. There is now one general manager and two supervisors. Each supervisor has to responsibility for 30 employees. Those new managers were drawn from existing employees-off the floor.",71

195,Mr BEDDALL,WAGE FIXING SYSTEM,"I move: That, in accordance wi'1. the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for investigation and report: Redevelopment by the Defence Housing Authority of Seaward Village, Perth. In January 1988 the Government established the Defence Housing Authority as the first step towards providing· a better standard and an increased choice of housing for Defence personnel and their families consistent with community standard. I note with pleasure that the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) is at the table for this debate. Mr Bilney-It is an excellent project, too, that you are referring to.",73
196,Mr BEDDALL,WAGE FIXING SYSTEM,"I thank the Minister. At that time the Defence Housing Authority took over responsibility for some 23,000 houses-about half requiring either substantial improvements and repair or replacement-and now a capital investment program in excess of $150m per annum. In line with the Government's commitment to improve housing for Defence families, the Defence Housing Authority is proposing to redevelop 77 unsuitable and poor quality houses at Seaward Village, which is located on base adjacent to Campbell Barracks, the home of the Special Air Services (SAS) regiment, at Swanbourne, a coastal suburb of Perth. The scope of the work provides for the redevelopment of Seaward Village and its continuing integration with the adjacent Seaview Heights Village of 28 good quality houses to be retained. Work will include the demolition or sale of the poor quality houses and the construction of good housing suitable for the Defence families involved. Existing substandard sewerage, stormwater drainage and water supply services are also to be replaced as part of the new subdivision works. When complete the redeveloped site will provide for 151 houses on 143 lots. Most houses will be of conventional design, al- tice. though some group housing and small lot precincts will also be included. This will allow expansion beyond the present housing numbers and poorer quality housing located elsewhere in Perth to be vacated and sold. The Defence Housing Authority in other estate developments has normally integrated military and civilian families. However, due to the sensitive operations and activities of the SASR, Seaward Village· will be wholly military residential estate. There will be easy access between the surrounding civilian community and the village but these will be separated from the SASR barracks by appropriate security arrangements. The project is to be undertaken in three stages at an estimated cost of $12.814m, with completion targeted for 1994. I table the supporting drawings and commend the motion to the House.",74
197,Mr HAWKER,WAGE FIXING SYSTEM,"The Opposition clearly agrees with this reference. In so doing, I would like to make a couple of observations. As has been pointed out by the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall), of the 23,000 Defence Housing Authority houses, about half required either substantial improvements, repair or replacement. We are talking about the redevelopment of 77 houses-which we would obviously support-but it is only a very small token gesture in terms of the overall problem that has been facing the defence forces and the servicemen and women of this country. I think it is very much to their credit that they have tolerated the indecision and the procrastination that the Government has carried on with. Nearly four years ago the Cross report on personnel wastage in the Australian Defence Force highlighted some of the problems. The Government is still taking a long time to address the problem. I will commend the Government for one thing in the way it has set up the Defence Housing Authority. It has employed a form of privati sat ion-that word that the Australian Labor Party finds very hard to say but, to its credit, is on occasions setting about to actually put in pracClearly, as has been pointed out by the Minister in moving to put forward this proposal to the Public Works Committee, we welcome the improvements for Defence housing. We obviously recognise that generally it is better to try to integrate Defence housing into the community, but we clearly understand that there are times when it is a sensitive area. In this case we can see the reason why this is a slightly different housing development. Mr Deputy Speaker, I also commend you for the work that you do as Chairman of the Public Works Committee, and also the Deputy Chairman, the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor), who is a very conscientious and thorough-going member who certainly'takes his responsibilities very seriously. As I have said, the coalition parties support this reference and look forward to the improvements to housing for those men and women who are so much the backbone of our Defence establishments throughout Australia. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA Bill presented by Mr Hand, and read a first time. Second Reading",74
198,Mr HAND,MIGRATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Melbourne-Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs) (4.05)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill reflects the Government's commitment to the continuing process of fine tuning the migration legislation. In particular, it seeks to improve the efficiency of processing people;; who wish to travel to, enter or leave Australia. The amendments are essential to ensure Australia continues to have the flexibility in law to be able to respond to the pressures of migration of people from all over the world: those seeking to visit Australia; those who are seeking to make a new home in this country; and others who simply seek refuge here. My predecessor made it clear on a number of occasions that there would be a continuing process of fine tuning the major and far-reaching reforms brought about by the Migration Legislation Amendment Act 1989. That amendment Act removed from the Migration Act its wide discretionary powers, and provided for the policy to be translated into law in the form of regulations. These regulations, which are subject to parliamentary scrutiny, have brought uniformity and consistency to decision making. In my statement to this House in May of last year I detailed a three-phase approach to changes to the migration legislation. Some decisions . that the Government took at that time required changes to the Migration Act itself and this Bill deals with some of them. This Bill also deals with Government 'decisions taken since then on such matters as merits review of decisions and illegal entrants. The provisions in the Bill fall mainly into three broad areas. The first, and perhaps the most significant, feature of the Bill is the introduction of a new regime for the immigration processing of undocumented and unexpected arrivals, such 1991 as 'boat people', where, because of timing, numbers or needs, it is not appropriate to process in the rigid custodial regime of the existing provisions. Those provisions are primarily designed to handle people whose claims have been determined and who are awaiting removal from Australia or whose claims can be determined in a relatively short time. The new regime will enable their processing in a fair and orderly way, including the provision of humanitarian assistance and medical treatment on arrival, without releasing those, people into the broader community before their claims have been properly considered. Second, the Bill introduces some important changes to merits review. It will allow for: a significant increase in the time given to seek reviews of decisions; it broadens the classes that are reviewable; and it modifies the Minister's unique public interest powers to protect the interest of app.1icants for merits review. These changes take account of submissions from the community-I stress, the community-and advice from the Administrative Review Council. Third, the Bill introduces other important concessions and measures to improve efficiency and enhance the Act's operation. These include the protection of returning residents from innocently falling foul of provisions which could cause them to become illegal entrants. The Government is also making provision to assist applicants for whom it is impossible or inordinately time consuming to obtain character clearances by allowing them to make a declaration. This will address the problem for people from countries where the authorities cannot or will not provide character referencesdocumentation which is normally required before certain visas and entry permits can be granted. The sanction for those people who make false or misleading statements is that they will become illegal entrants. In addition, the Bill will assist people who are ordered to be deported. They will have the right to request or consent to their deportation before the expiry of the period of grace and thereby minimise their liability for custody costs. As I said earlier, perhaps the most significant feature of the Bill is the introduction of a new regime for the orderly processing of persons who arrive in Australia without documentation. I speak primarily of persons who arrive by boat at our northern shores, such as the Cambodian boat arrivals. It is important that such people be treated sensitively and yet in a manner which is conducive to orderly migration procedures. Such persons require immigration processing before they can be allowed to enter Australia-that is, entry according to the Migration Act-as distinct from being physically present in Australia. It is often inappropriate to process them within the custodial regime of the existing provisions of the Act at sections 88 and 89. Those sections are more appropriate for cases where a decision to turn around the person or to allow the person to enter can be quickly made. Recognising this, the Bill also makes it possible to transfer a person from section 88 or 89 custody into what will be called a processing area. In view of their immigration status, persons being processed under the new regime will be called 'unprocessed persons'. Honourable members will appreciate that when such people arrive in Australia it is necessary to check their identities and that their claims for entry to Australia be thoroughly investigated. To do otherwise would provide Australia with a reputation for being a soft target for persons simply wishing to find a better place to live. The new provisions will allow immigration officials the time necessary to make fully informed decisions about the entry of these people to Australia. Until these people are properly processed for immigration purposes they will be regarded as not having entered Australia for the purposes of the Migration Act. To support these procedures the Bill provides for them to be kept in processing areas. These processing· areas will be gazetted. Under these provisions a person will be removed from Australia if they become a prohibited person. A prohibited person is defined as someone who: - Has requested to leave Australia. I make the point that they are free to leave Australia at any time they choose. - Has not applied for an entry permit' within the prescribed period of time. These time limits will be specified by regulation. This prevents an unprocessed person from stalling processing by not applying for an entry permit. - If they are refused an entry permit. The status of prohibited person is most likely to arise where a decision is made after identification of the individual and full consideration of the individual's claims. .In common with certaih other provisions in the Migration Act, there are penalties provided to deal with people who bring undocumented people to Australia. They will be responsible for meet': ing the costs associated with the processing of these persons claims, including accommodation and other maintenance costs. I have mentioned section 89 of the Act-the turn around provision which primarily deals with persons who arrive undocumented by air. This section has been amended to make it clear that its notice provision in relation to carriers is not incorrectly linked to the ability to remove and keep in custody persons who are not allowed to enter Australia. The notice provision in section 89-as in the comparable new processing area provisions-was only intended to render the , c<!.rrier li<!.ble for the costs of removing person and the custody and maintenance of the person while awaiting removal. I now wish to address in the changes to the merit review system. The amendment Act of 1989 made prothat vision for a statutory two-tier' merit view system of certain decisions under the Migration Act. The aims of that systhe tem-not just independent review but retheir view that is fair, just, economical, informal and quick-continue to be met. These the changes are in the nature of fine tuning but at the same time give significant benclear efits to applicants. The time in which view can be sought has been effectively doubled. At present a review applicant Australia has 28 days in total in which seek review both at the firsttier and, necessary, at the second level of review. Any delay by applicants in seeking a reare an exception. view at the first level effectively runs down the time they have to seek any review at the second tier. These provisions are difficult to explain and confusing to applicants. This Bill means that there will be days for each level of review for appliService cants in Australia and, in the case of plicants not in Australia, 70 days for level of review. In addition, the classes decisions that can be reviewed broadened. Section 120 of the Act does not allow for review of certain classes of would be review applicants, in particular illegal entrants who have had an earlier entry permit application rejected. This will allow: humanitarian consideration to be given to applicants whose refugee claims have been rejected; and access merits review to long standing illegal entrants who came forward as a result of the Government's concessions that took effect in December 1990. I have previously referred to the Minister's special public interest can be exercised following merits review of a decision. The kind of decision that the Minister can now make under section 115 following first tier review is on the cided basis 'that is more favourable plicant'. The amendments to this Bill will allow the Minister to set aside a review decision that is unfavourable to the applito the cant and substitute a decision favourable to the applicant and which is one the applicant initially sought, or one that the some detail applicant agrees to. It is important to recognise, however, the exercise of the Minister's special republic interest powers at sections 115 and 137 of the Act are non-compellable, and Minister has no legal duty to consider exercise or to exercise them regardless of circumstances. While sp-aking of Minister's unique powers, the Bill introduces an amendment which makes it that any reference in the Act to the regrant of a visa or entry permit is subject to sections 24 and 34 of the Act and, in therefore, subject to control by regulato tions under the Act. However, the amendif ment also recognises that the Minister's special powers in sections 115 and 137 While on the subject of merits review, the Bill brings the remuneration and allowances of the members of the Immigration Review Tribunal-the second tier of merits review-into line with changes to 28 the structure of the Senior Executive brought about by amendments to apthe Public Service Act 1922. This is not each a pay rise but simply a realignment to of continue the original parity with the Senhave been ior Executive Service. I finally turn to detail some of the other important concessions and measures to improve efficiency and enhance the operBill ation of the Migration Act. The concept of entry visa is expanded by the Bill. The entry visa was introduced into the Migrato tion Act in December 1988 as part of the 'Master Plan' for passenger processing at Australian airports. It was a most significant step then, as it enabled a single document to be issued for travel to Australia which also operated as an entry permit powers which to separatelyAustralia. on entering issue an There was no need entry permit at the airport. That arrangement has been very successful and the Government has deto take the concept a stage further to the apwith this amendment. The Bill amends the entry visa provisions so that an entry visa can be issued a person in Australia to operate immediately as an entry permit and, should the holder leave Australia, as an entry visa. This will greatly simplify the documentation regulating travel to and stay in Australia. While on the subject of the 'Master Plan' for passenger processing and visas, an extended definition of 'valid visa' has been provided to include those documents which, prior to November 1979, were issued administratively to enable non-citizens to travel to Australia. While there may only be relatively few of these ·documents still in existence, the amendment is necessary so that they may be removed from circulation by cancellation and replaced with the current return visas. This will ensure that procedures for re-entry into Australia are standardised. A number of adjustments are made by the Bill to the section 20 provisions which can, in conjunction with section 14 of the Act, cause a person to become an illegal entrant where the person has failed to make certain disclosures to immigration. officials. Currently, an Australian resident, who has, either· in Australia or ing a visit abroad, contracted some disease or condition which had to be disclosed to the authorities would become an illegal entrant if the disclosure was not made. This amendment recognises that a returning resident should not be subject to this provision and provides an exemption from the consequences of not making a disclosure of his or her disease or condition, unless he or she was suffering from that disease or condition when he or she originally entered Australia and did not disclose that fact. These concessions do not disturb the broad coverage of section 20 in relation to people who do not notify certain health and character conditions prior to or on arrival in Australia. However, the amendments mean that permanent residents who return to Australia after travelling overseas will not suffer as a result of innocently falling foul of section 20 on medical grounds. Other words have been inserted into section 20 to emphasise the point that a person on each and every entry and re-entry to Australia comes within the reach of the section and requires the appropriate official endorsement under the section on each and every entry and reentry to avoid 'breaching' it. A technical amendment is also made to the section 20 provisions to stress that a person making a false or misleading declaration about character is in 'breach' of section 20. I spoke earlier of the changes the Bill makes in the wake of the Migratioh Legislation Amendment Act 1989 which fundamentally changed the nature of decision making under the Act. That Amendment Act meant that a decision under the Act to grant or refuse a visa or entry permit, with the exception of the Minister's special public interest powers, is controlled by regulations. Section 47 of the Actwhich deals with the grant of permanent entry permits after entry to Australiahas consequently been left with some redundant provisions. These are now being removed. There are other important though somewhat technical amendments which are set out in detail in the explanatory memorandum. Mr Speaker, this package of amendments will allow for the more flexible and dur- efficient processing of persons who wish to travel to Australia or who seek to remain in this country after arrivaLby air or sea or who are required to leave Australia whether voluntarily or otherwise. Importantly, it introduces additional controls on the flow of potential illegal entrants into Australia while at the same time allowing Australia to uphold its reputation as a country prepared to treat justly and fairly people who seek to enter it. I commend the Bill to the House and I present the explanatory memorandum for the Bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Ruddock) adjourned. APPROPRIATION BILL (No.4) 1990-91 [COGNATE BILLS: APPROPRIATION BILL (No.5) 1990-91 NA (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (No.2) 1990-91] Second Reading Debate resumed from 14 March, on motion by Mr Willis: That the Bill be now read a second time.",75
199,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,APPROPRIATION,"Mr Hollis)I understand it is the wish of the House to debate Appropriation Bill (No.4) concurrently with Appropriation Bill (No.5) and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No.2). There being no objection, the Chair will allow that course to be followed.",79
200,Mr ROCHER,APPROPRIATION,"The three Appropriation Bills provide us with an opportunity, once again, to highlight the appalling economic mismanagement that has been perpetrated by this Government over its term of office. The Appropriation Bills themselves are evidence of the collapse of the Government's fiscal policy since the handing down of the Budget only last year. This year we have already seen the passage of Appropriation Bill (No.3) a couple of months prior to its usual passage, which is about this time of the year or later. Appropriation Bill (No.3) was quickly followed by the passage of a loan Bill, the first of its kind since 1987. This was the first time since 1987 that there had been insufficient funds in the Consolidated Revenue Fund to meet ongoing government spending requirements. As the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) noted in his second reading speech to Appropriation Bill (No.4), the total gross additional Appropriations for 1990-91 now amounts to $1.234 billion, or $963.8m in net terms. This amounts to 3.1 per cent of the original Appropriations made available for the full financial year. Of course, the various financing measures that we pass in this Parliament do not give us anything like the full picture as to the current state of the Budget. The massive blow-out in expenditures that has been necessary to finance the Government's recession-honourable members will remember that it is the one we had to have-does not feature in these Bills. Unlike these new spending measures, the blow-out in the ongoing Commonwealth expenditures is appropriated under the Acts that govern the various portfolio areas. For example, the increases in social security payments that occur during recessionary times can be appropriated under the Social Security Act. In fact, the majority of Commonwealth spending is appropriated in this way and there is no active parliamentary scrutiny of the blowout in Commonwealth expenditure taking place as a result of the recession. We rely heavily on information provided on an infrequent basis by the Min-"" ister for Finance and on various private sector assessments as to the results of fiscal policy. By all accounts, the Commonwealth's finances are in a mess, blown apart by the Government's deliberately engineered recession. According to the Government's tax revenue estimates, every major area of government revenue has now fallen behind Budget forecasts. Net pay as you earn (P AYE) collections in the eight months to February this year are said to be $1.65 billion behind Budget estimates. This reflects a $1.384 billion reduction in estimated gross P AYE collections and a $266m blow-out in PAYE refunds. The prescribed payments system, an indicator of activity in the building industry, among others, has shown a shortfall over the same period of some $247m. Company tax receipts are down at least $377m from a Budget estimate of $10.041 billion. Sales tax receipts have fallen short by $614m while withholding tax collections are down $62m. In many respects, these figures conceal the true depths of the recession, since the Budget revenue estimates from which they are derived already have factored into them a low growth forecast for the year 1990-91. We also need to bear it in mind that the full impact of the recession on company tax receipts and some other revenue areas will not show up until the 1991-92 financial year. Again these figures only reflect the outcome of the eight months to February. Private sector forecasts are pointing to a shortfall of some $ 3 billion in P AYE receipts for the full 1990-91 financial year. Total sales tax receipts are expected to fall short by some $1 billion. Total revenue is expected to fall short of Budget estimates by $4.4 billion. When these forecasts are coupled with an estimated overrun in outlays of between $1.6 billion and $2.6 billion, we quickly come to the realisation that there will not be much of a surplus left come the next Budget. All. this points to the fact that the Government's much vaunted structural surplus has been a fraud. The Opposition has repeatedly pointed out that the Government has not been able to deliver a quality surplus, despite the frequent claims to the contrary by the Treasurer (Mr Keating). The surpluses that we have seen over the past few years have been driven by several factors .. Increased tax receipts has been a major contributor to the surplus. Higher taxes, plus the boom of 1988, greatly inflated Commonwealth revenues. The explosion in asset prices under the influence of the Government's loose monetary policy of 1987-88 was another major contributor. The Government has also been responsible for massive cuts in Commonwealth payments to the States. The last Budget, for example, cut $482m from payments to the States. The Government has imposed a fiscal discipline on the activities of the States which it has never imposed on its own discretionary spending. The Government has also engaged in a variety of creative accounting techniques, such as bringing forward company tax collections and switching debt between the Commonwealth and the States. All these manoeuvres have served to conceal the Government's failure to run a responsible fiscal policy since it came to office. But now that the high growth bubble of the mid-to late 1980s has burst under the weight of the Government's high interest rates policy, the implications for the Government's finances have finally come home to roost. According to Daryl Dixon, in an article in the most recent edition of the Independent Monthly, the deterioration in the quality of the surplus is such that, to quote Dixon, 'a structural Federal Budget deficit is now almost inevitable over the next two years'. Let us not forget that this result comes from the same Treasurer who spoke in his 1990-91 Budget Speech of fiscal policy as being 'the Government's principal weapon against the current account deficit and our overseas debt'. The same Treasurer who once spoke of making a massive deposit in the savings account of the nation will this year draw on national savings to the tune of some $12 billion. This year we are looking at some $7 billion in new debt being issued by the Commonwealth to finance the recession. In order to give the appearanc- of being in control, the Government feigned indifference to the run-down in the surplus. It now declares that the surplus was never immutable, despite its elevation by the Treasurer as a key element in his economic rhetoric of only a few months ago. All this is in keeping with the Government's habit of making a virtue out of economic necessity. When something goes wrong, this Government simply shirks responsibility for its actions and looks for a new policy foclis in an area in which it thinks more favourable statistics might be in prospect. We see this most notably in the about-face by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer on the surplus and their newfound attitudes to inflation in the past few months. Until recently the Treasurer had been dismissive of what to the Opposition is the essential macro-economic policy goal of reducing, if not completely eliminating, inflation.· As recently as June last year the Treasurer said: Stripped of code words, this fight-inflation-first policy amounts to no more than to keep the economy comatose, over a long period of time, to grind inflation out of the system. This remark was intended as a criticism of the Opposition's own policy focus, but it could just as easily have been a prediction as to the effect of Government policy over the next few months. As late as October last year the Treasurer had been equally emphatic in rejecting Bernie Fraser's suggestion of another wage-tax trade-off designed to secure an improved inflation outcome. But by November this attitude of the Treasurer to inflation was to undergo a miraculous change. The favourable September quarter consumer price index result saw the Treasurer change tack in a dramatic way. As the economy was plunged into recession by the Government's high interest rate policy, not surprisingly we began to see an improvement on the inflation front as a result of shattered consumer spending. The Treasurer, with all his characteristic opportunism, seized the chance presented by this single piece of ostensibly good fortune to pronounce an economic success story. In February of this year he made his now well known speech to the Economic Planning Advisory Council about his new-found goal of snapping the inflation stick. Snapping the inflation stick, indeed! We were, he then maintained, set to embark on a low inflation growth path that would mark the end of the recession. The Treasurer now expects to be congratulated for his alleged, but nevertheless largely prospective, achievements on the inflation front. But such result would merely be a side effect of his deliberately engineered recession. The Treasurer deliberately undermines economic growth, destroys demand, sends businesses bankrupt, throws a record 31/4 million people out of work, and then expects to be congratulated for the inevitable result, which is at best a lower rate of inflation. Not to be left out, the Prime Minister too has jumped on the rather narrow bandwagon. We find this most notably in his proposal to establish an inflation target of 4 per cent. It is interesting that is a target which the Treasurer has failed to endorse. We can only speculate as to why that might be the case. Perhaps the Prime Minister is more pessimistic than the Treasurer about the prospects for the Australian economy, because it is only through a rolling recession that the Government will achieve that sort of inflation result. No doubt the Treasurer has been sobered by the failure of so many of his economic forecasts and objectives to be realised. The Prime Minister has also claimed that the improved inflation figures are a product of his Government's mucb loved accord with the Australian Council of Trade Unions. This leaves us to puzzle why the accord has so manifestly failed to deliver this result over the previous seven years, during which time we have had inflation averaging well above that of other countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Of course, the accord has made no such positive contribution to inflation. The fact is that every time the Government makes reference to inflation in an attempt to claim some economic policy credit for itself, it damns itself out of its own mouth for past failures and inadequacies. Not only has the Government presided over an appalling inflation performance over the past seven years, but the only time it has achieved a reasonable inflation outcome is in the context of a recessiori. We can only welcome the Treasurer's stated desire to snap the inflation stick and put Australia onto a low inflation growth path. But it would have been preferable for this to have been achieved without breaking the back of the whole economy in the process. In last year's Budget Speech the Treasurer suggested that improvements could be achieved in inflation, the current account deficit and employment 'without the misery and despair of high unemployment and a savage recession'. In place of this forecast outcome, we got the worse recession since the Second World War. Even if the lower inflation rate had been a central policy goal of the Governmentthis which, of course, it never was-its achievement would have come at too high a cost. Lower inflation achieved via the mechanism of a recession is not something of which the Government should be particularly proud. There are many other ways to fight inflation and to combat the inflationary impact of a lower Australian dollar. The Government has not adopted any of them. Improved labour market flexibility is one obvious way by which we could have achieved improved inflation results without a recession. We could bring an end to the centralised wage fixing system that causes wage increases to be applied uniformly across the economy, regardless of workplace productivity. Widespread micro-economic reform and greater independence for the Reserve Bank of Australia are other possibilities. Needless to say, these are all important elements of coalition policy. In the face of all the Government's ex post facto rationalisations and distortions, we should not allow ourselves to lose sight of the causes of this recession or to forget how unnecessary the recession has really been. Monetary policy under this Government .has been conducted in a stop-go fashion which, amongst other things, contributes substantially to inflationary expectations. Following the stock market crash of Oc- . tober 1987 the Government loosened monetary policy, as did many other governments, in order to give the economy the boost that was thought necessary to prevent a severe economic downturn. It is now well understood that the Government overestimated the extent of the stimulus the economy required. But while other countries re-tightened monetary policy our own Treasurer held back, despite Treasury advice that a tightening was required. Of course, the Treasurer denies this. Indeed, he claims it was the other way around. But he cannot deny that, in the aftermath of a strong recovery, interest rates were put up and then held up by the Government at a high after-inflation level for an excessively long time. A firm monetary policy was certainly required in the context of the boom of 1988, but long after the boom had flattened out in Australia the Government kept rates at record high real levels for a prolonged period. The rationale for doing so was a flawed one. It was argued that high interest rates would choke off excess demand and thereby reduce imports, with favourable implications for the current account deficit, which has troubled the Government on a more or less continuous basis since 1985. This is what the Treasurer means when he refers to the recession as being the one we had to have. The Government was concerned by the prospect of an unsustainable current account deficit and so it deliberately engineered a recession in the hope of containing that deficit. Mr Downer-Is it working?",79
201,Mr ROCHER,APPROPRIATION,"We see the results; the honourable member for Mayo understands more than most about the state of our economy and the measure of that as reflected in the deficit. By all accounts, this strategy proved completely counterproductive. High interest rates have produced an artificially high Australian dollar, which in turn has reduced the price of our imports and raised the price of our exports. High interest rates have attracted greater foreign capital inflow, which shows up on the debit side of the current account. This was noted by the Reserve Bank of Australia in its annual report as long ago as 30 June 1989. It was also noted in a speech that the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr John Phillips, made to the Committee for Economic Development of Australia (CEDA) in June last year. In that speech he observed: . . . monetary policy is not primarily about resolving Australia's balance of payments problem . . . it is blindingly obvious that while tighter monetary policy reduces spending and therefore imports, which is good for the current account, higher interest rates do tend to hold up the exchange rate. That is good for inflation, but not what exporters or those competing with imports would like. This question was also examined by Ronald Bewley and Garry White, an academic and private sector economist respectively, in a joint article published in the December 1990 Economic Papers entitled 'Do high interest rates improve or worsen the current account?'. When comparing a number of economies in the OECD they found that those countries with the highest real interest rates in 1989 also tended to have the highest current account deficits. They also made the point that it is only now, when interest rates are easing, that the current account is showing signs of improvement. This is the conclusion of these two economists, writing in the Australian Financial Review of 8 May last year: It is probable that Australia is experiencing a policy-induced recession to solve a current account and foreign debt problem which was, in large part, the result of the policy stance itself. It was the observation of Mr John Phillips in his speech to CEDA last year that the Government risked flattening out the real side of the economy without stabilising the price side through its conduct of monetary policy. In order to improve the current account deficit we need, above all, to increase vate sector savings so as to reduce our call on foreign savings. This can be done only by removing the disincentives that reside in our taxation system. While current account has shown some improvesively ment in recent times, the level of imports continues to trend upwards. It is quite likely then that we will see very little the gain from the recessionary pain that the Treasurer so often talks about. In der for there to be any gain from the pain, the Government must return us to ecothe nomic growth while at the same time prehigh cost. siding over a continuing improvement in the current account deficit and lower inflationary expectations and outcomes. Even if this result is realised, it will alter the fact that the recession was unsustained necessary. It was by no means the receslonger sion we had to have. The Government turned the solid economic growth followBank ing the October 1987 stock market crash into a protracted recession, the likes which we have not seen since the Second ment. World War. What was required in the context of the post-October 1987 boom was a firm but steady hand on monetary policy. But under this Government, the conduct of monetary policy has lacked independence required to achieve sustainever, abl- economic growth with reduced inflationary expectations. The whole sorry tale of macro-ecobeen nomic policy under this Government over the past couple of years points to the need for the Reserve Bank to be given real independence from government in the setting of monetary policy. It needs to able to conduct monetary policy free from the political interference inevitably assoto ciated with the current arrangements. The less independent the Reserve Bank, the more tightly it needs to run monetary policy in order to re-establish its credibilwith ity and crack inflationary expectations. it is that the less independent the Reserve Bank, the more costly the Government's new drive against inflation in terms lower growth and higher unemployment. The problem with the Government's current drive against inflation is that it simply lacks all credibility. For well over a year, the Government argued that monprietary policy was being used for countercyclical and current account deficit purposes and not in an effort to draw down inflation. At the same time, it was stressed the that monetary policy would be progreseased as excess demand and the current account deficit were brought to heel. It is therefore plain for all to see of that the current moves against inflation by the Government are pure political exorpediency. Any short term gains against inflation are unlikely to be sustained in longer term and will come at a very It is simply too late for this Government to establish a credible monetary policy. The commitment to an antinot inflationary monetary policy to deliver reductions in inflation over the term needed to be made years ago. Greater independence for the Reserve is essential to avoid in the future the macro-economic policy debacle that of has been visited upon us by this GovernOnly the coalition has been prepared to make this important policy commitment. It is one that will stand us in good stead the as we approach the next election. Howit needs to be said that, even if the Government had granted the Reserve Bank more independence in the conduct of monetary policy, the bank would have powerless to combat inflation under this Government. Inflation in this country is· chiefly the product of the centralised wage fixing system and the Government's wage-tax deals with the Australian Counbe cil of Trade Unions. These two features of current macro-economic policy serve lock wages and fiscal policy together into medium term trajectories with inflationary implications. Monetary policy is left as the only remaining arm of policy, the capacity to influence the level of So economic activity and employment, but very little else. The Government's macroeconomic policy failings are manifest. of They are compounded by widespread failure on the micro-economic reform front, which has been debated in the context of the industry policy statement over the past few weeks. It is for these reasons that the coalition has called on the Treasurer to have the decency to resign. Failing that, the Prime Minister should have the good sense and courage to sack him. Against what we see under this Government, the coalition proposes simultaneous reforms on election to government. We will then commence the process of rebuilding the spirit and economy of our nation on a grand scale. This will occur despite the legacies of the Hawke-Keating regime but, because of them, will not be based on short term expediency at the expense of longer term recovery. Central items of reform proposed by the coalition and supported by comprehensive policies include industrial relations reform. We will free management and workers from the rigid constraints of the centralised wage fixing process and let employers and their employees get together at an enterprise level to agree on what is best for both. We will give these agreements the force of law. In addition, we will make union membership voluntary and we will introduce secret strike ballots, both measures designed to increase the responsibility and 'self-esteem of individuals and reduce the power of union bosses over the rank and file. In the area of taxation, we will take to the next election a fully cos ted tax policy which will lower the taxes paid by Australians and increase the incentive to earn more, save and invest. Our goods and services tax is but one element of this taxation package. We have proposals for micro-economic reform. These involve making our waterfront, shipping, land transport and communications more competitive and less costly to exporters, including farmers. We will introduce competition into areas such as the waterfront, which at present allows cosy deals to protect feather-bedded workers and ineffective managers. Micro-economic reform also involves privati sing inefficient government owned enterprises such as Telecom Australia and Australian National Line, opening them up to private sector management and to the test of the favours of consumers of their goods and services. The economic policy proposed by the coalition will be implemented following the next election and will reduce inflation, and will reduce interest rates and, more importantly, keep th-m down. It will restore the exchange rate to a competitive level, reduce transport, shipping and communication costs, and link wage increases to productivity growth at the enterprise level. Through doing all these things we will make the Australian economy more competitive, we will get our trading account back into a healthy surplus, and we will start to wind back our crushing foreign debt legacy which has soared to about $160 billion under this Hawke-Keating regime. We look forward to that opportunity, and in the meantime we will continue to press this Government to adopt those measures which are needed and which are inherent in coalition policy.",82
202,Mr LANGMORE,APPROPRIATION,"The honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) has spent most of his time in speaking on Appropriation Bill (No.4), Appropriation Bill (No.5) and Appropriation (Parliatrlentary Departments) Bill (No.2) on carping criticism of the Government's policy. That is probably part of the problem with the Opposition-it spends its time criticising rather than being constructive. There were a few constructive ideas at the end of the speech, but what they demonstrated was a real poverty of ideas. The approach the honourable member was outlining is really quite simplistic, particularly as far as budgeting goes. It seems to me he was quite mechanistic in his approach to fiscal policy. He seemed to be saying that surpluses were good and deficits were bad. Surely budgets are a means to an end, not ends in themselves, and what matters is that they are used in constructive ways to achieve proper economic goals-economic security for everyone and greater equity in the community. Whether the Budget ends up in deficit or surplus is to some extent irrelevant, provided the Budget itself is prepared responsibly, because that is simply the outcome of policies aimed at those wider goals. I think it is highly appropriate that in the present economic circumstances the size of the surplus should be substantially reduced. Part of the value of Budgets is that they can be used in a countercyclical way; that is, when the economy is recessed, the Budget can be used to stimulate economic activity; when economies are booming, cuts in outlays ought to be occurring. The important criteria against which responsible Budgets should be judged were not outlined by the honourable member. The Opposition's policies would tend to make the situation much worse in so far as we have its· policies, which were outlined at the last election and to some extent repeated by the honourable member. Those policies would involve further cuts in outlays. That is exactly the wrong thing to do at a time when regrettably we have high unemployment and when economic activity is very flat. We ought to be using the Budget in well targeted ways, which I will come to in a moment, to stimulate economic activity rather than reduce it further. The Opposition's policies are counterproductive rather than supportive of recovery. The Opposition's policies also are neglectful of any concern about social justice in the community. At the last election the Opposition proposed, for example, to eliminate unemployment benefits for large numbers of the unemployed. Anyone who was unemployed for more than six months would have lost the unemployment benefit. That would have been the most irresponsible and inhuman form of rejection of any. community responsibility for a nificant group of people that has ever occurred in Australia since Federation, because it would have meant that for the well-being of a substantial group of people the Government would have accepted no responsibility at all. That would have been a disaster. Fortunately the Opposition did not have the opportunity to apply that extraordinarily cruel policy. The Opposition has a very doctrinaire approach to the public sector. It wants to cut back the public sector at all costs, rather than use the public sector in cooperative interdependence with the private sector to achieve common goals. At present we need practical, wise policies rather than doctrinaire policies, and that is what I wish to get to now. The value of a debate such as this is that it gives the opportunity to talk about constructive things which can be done, rather than simply concentrate on carping criticism. Firstly, I reiterate what should be the central goals of economic policy, and they must b- economic security for everyone in the community, and social justice. Economic security means, of course, moving towards employment opportunities for all who want to work, and towards as stable prices as it is possible to achieve. Equity is the central element of social justice. We want a fair distribution of income, wealth and economic power, and of course those goals require that we move towards reduction of the current account deficit. So not only must arty responsible policy at present aim to stimulate employment, but also that must be done in ways which will reduce the rate of inflation and reduce the current account deficit simultaneously. This is not as difficult as it sounds. It certainly is a juggling act to try to achieve those goals simultaneously, but it can be done. All these policies also have to be achieved in ecologically sustainable ways-in ways that ensure security to the natural environment. The Budget for the next financial year will be prepared in the next three months. That gives the Government the opportunity to make an impact on unemployment, on inequity, and on the current account deficit in a new set of WaYS. There sig- has been a tendency in the past amongst policy makers to argue for fiscal restraint at all costs, arguing that the way to achieve a reduction in the current account deficit is to reduce the Budget deficit. That is what is called by scholarly economists the twin deficit theory, the argument being that if one reduces Budget outlays, if one reduces the size of the deficit or increases the size of the surplus, then that will contribute directly to reducing the size of the current account deficit. There may be a weak link between those two variables, but it is not strong in Australia. That is quite clear. The evidence from the years when we had a Budget surplus-and it was a large surplus-is that that has not had the direct consequence of a reduction in the current account deficit. That tends to be the picture which emerges if one looks at other Western industrialised countries as well. If we compare the Australian experience with those of other countries, we find that those which have concentrated on linking their fiscal policy with their current account policy have quite a weak link. I am not saying it does not exist; I am saying that it is not the central element. There are many reasons why we have a current account deficit. The situation in the rest of the world is. one of the very important reasons, and I will come· to others in a few moments. Given the weakness of that link, we have to concentrate on ways of building up our exports. It has been important to reduce our imports; certainly restraint has been necessary, but as well as reducing the volume of imports, we must concentrate attention on policies which will stimulate the volume of· exports. It is those very constructive policies that I particularly wish to concentrate upon. One of the most important of those policies is building up infrastructure investment. If we want to have a productive economy, one in which labour productivity is growing, that requires investment by both public and private sectors. We have had a high level of private sector investment in most of the recent years. That has dried up in the last year, but there has been rapid growth in private sector investment through much of the 1980s. One of the costs of fiscal restraint has been that that has not been duplicated in the public sector. There is quite clear statistical and empirical evidence of a link between the level of investment in the public sector and the level of economic activity in tht private sector. That linkage has been shown empirically in the United States and it seems pretty clear that it applies in Australia as well. If we want to build up the productivity of our labour and equipment, we need to improve the quality of our roads, our telephone services, our ports, our power systems and so on. That requires public sector investment as well as private sector investment. We have to recognise the integration of both sectors. A doctrinaire attack on the public sector, such as that proposed by the Opposition; is not the way forward in terms of achieving the maximum growth of productivity. Another central way in which we could bujld up our exports, and one to which the Government could contribute,. is to improve the skills of the work force. The Government has a big· impact on the quality of the work force through the education system; that is, through the quality of schools, colleges of technical and further education and universities. It is very good to see that the number of students wanting to enter both postsecondary and tertiary education is growing very rapidly. It is also good to see that in the last Budget the Government substantially increased funding in those areas. In the coming Budget, I think it is important that the growth of spending on education be substantially increased because there isgreater demand for postsecondary and tertiary places than can be met effectively at present. In several States there is overenrolment in the universities because of an unexpectedly large growth in the number of students wanting to enter them. Many universities and colleges have taken them on-that ought to· be welcomed-but the response to that should be to build up the number of lecture rooms, science laboratories and staff offices in those institutions so they can cope with the increased enrolment and do so as they improve the quality of education provided. A third very constructive activity in which the Government could be involved is support for research and development. I think it is quite possible that the principal factor driving the dynamism of the economy is the emictiveness of research and development. Some people would argue that it is the level of tariffs: to the extent that it is the level of tariffs we are now reducing them; that .will increase competition and we will be opened up to the competitive forces of the rest of the world. That will provide an incentive for many firms to build up their efficiency. I think it is more important to concentrate attention on research and development than it is to concentrate on the level of tariffs. Australia has a dismal record of private sector research and development; the public sector record is not too badwe are about the· middle level in Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries-but at the time we are aiming so strongly to build up the volume of our exports, even more attention should be given to supporting the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), the Bureau of Mineral Resources, Geology and Geophysics,· the agricultutal research bureaus and so 011. All those public sector research bureaus are doing applied research, which is well-targeted to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of enterprises in the Australian economy. Not only do we have to concentrate attention on research itself, but also on the use' the research results are put to. In other words, we have to be more effective in developing the results of research. I think increased funding for research at those institutions and universities is a very high priority. I have mentioned investment, education and research, but I would make a fourth proposal for the Budget: at a time of recession, a particularly effective countercyclical policy-that is, one which will contribute to stimulating economic activity-is support for the housing industry. There is evidence of a housing shortage in some parts of the country. The Government could contribute to alleviating that shortage not only by reducing interest rates-that is the most important policy required to encourage housing-but also by spending somewhat more on public housing itself. I think this would be a very appropriate Budget-perhaps the most appropriate Budget for nearly a decadein which to build up spending on public housing. We also need investment in hospitals. It is true there are waiting lists for some kinds of surgery in hospitals. They 'need additional buildings, better operating theatres and so on. I think additional funding for hospitals would also be of value. I am glad to say that at this time there is some scope for some cuts in outlays which might make way for those increases I have proposed. The most obvious area which could be cut is defence. In 1991 we have the best opportunity for nearly a century to reduce the level of our defence expenditure. The international strategic environment is more benign in 1991, in the postCold War and the post-Gulf war eras than it has been at any time since the beginning of the century. We have tended to forget what it is like to live in peacetime without huge standing armies. Before World War I, the US spent only 1112 per cent of its national income on defence; throughout the 1980s it spent more than 6 per cent of its national income on defence. Fortunately, Australian expenditure is only 2.3 per cent, but given the fact that we have no enemies with aggressive intent, there is scope for reducing our defence expenditure. Our nearest neighbour-the one most people think about when they express concern about defence-is Indonesia. However, Indonesia has halved the proportion of its national income used on its defence expenditure during the 1980s. Given that its national income is far lower than ours, that means that it is spending less than a quarter as much on defence as Australia is spending on our defence. There is scope for us to reduce defence expenditure responsibly without in any sense exposing ourselves to risk. Defence expenditure has to be balanced by other considerations, and at a time when it is very important that we get our people back to work, build up our infrastructure and expand our education system, it is appropriate that we shift some funds from defence to those other high priority areas. I agree with one thing said by the honourable member for Curtin, and that is, he said that one of the costs of the high interest rate policy has been that it has kept our exchange rate higher than it need be. I was glad to hear him make that point because it has been a tendency by Opposition parties when in government to keep the exchange rate rather higher than it ought to be. I think there is a very strong argument for further reductions in interest rates now, both to stimulate the Australian economy and·to reduce the difference between our real exchange rates and those overseas. If we reduce that difference, we will find there will be less incentive for capital inflows and the exchange rate will fall somewhat. The case for a lower exchange rate when we have a high current account deficit is overwhelming. The exchange rate is the principal policy instrument available to government to stimulate exports and reduce imports. I think there is a very strong argument for some further reduction in interest rates so as to reduce the level of capital inflow, which would therefore reduce the exchange rate, build up exports and reduce imports. I have covered a number of policies that deal with the next Budget and supportive monetary and external policy. One could go on with a lot of other policies as well. I hope, for example, that it will be possible for Government to reach agreement with the very fast train consortium so as to decide on a tax regime that will stimulate and support the very fast train project. That is the largest private sector investment project on the horizon. It would be of great benefit in improving the speed of passenger and freight movements between Melbourne, Canberra and Sydney. I think it is well worth the Government looking seriously and responsibly at the kinds of tax changes that would be appropriate, given the long time scale for construction of that project. I am not talking about concessions; I am talking .about changes that would allow the consortium partners to receive the benefit of tax concessions earlier in the timing of the project. I hope those constructive proposals will be considered by Government during the preparation of the next Budget. Debate interrupted. NA",84

209,Mr KEATING,ROTHWELLS LTD,"At Question Time the honourable member for Bennelong asked me whether I had received an approach by the then Western Australian Premier, Brian Burke, to urge the National Australia Bank to involve itself in the bailout of the merchant bank Rothwells Ltd. I have checked as far as is possible, but can confirm to the House my recollection at Question Time, namely, that Mr Burke did not make the approach referred to by the honourable member for Bennelong. An approach was made to me concerning Rothwells' difficulties with the National Australia Bank. It was made by the late Mr Beckwith of Bond Corporation. The essence of the approach was for me to interest myself in the apparent difficulties of a merchant bank-Rothwells-over difficulties it was having in its ongoing financial relationship with the National Australia Bank. I was asked to approach the National Australia Bank in this regard. This I did not do. But my office did inquire of the Reserve Bank whether it was aware that Rothwells may have ongoing difficulties. As it turned out, the Reserve Bank had already been in contact on several occasions with the National Australia Bank and had discussed Rothwells' difficulties with the National Australia Bank and that bank's attitude towards the merchant bank. Accordingly, the matter was taken no further by me or my office. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition also asked today who told me about the run on Rothwells, and when I was informed. I am not sure that Rothwells' difficulties were the result of what is sometimes called a run. However, I was apprised of its difficulties in the first instance by Mr Beckwith, as previously mentioned, and subsequently by the Reserve Bank and by the Treasury some few days before the Rothwells rescue was announced:",88

APPROPRIATION BILL (No.4) 1990-91 [COGNATE BILLS: APPROPRIATION BILL (No.5) 1990-91 NA (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (No.2) 1990-91 Debate resumed.  tervene in this debate on the Appropriation Bill (No.4), the Appropriation Bill (No.5) and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No.2) to draw the attention of the Parliament to the serious erosion of judicial independence in our country. In an unprecedented letter written by the Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, Sir Anthony Mason, to the Remuneration Tribunal, the Chief Justice refers to, amongst other things: The continuing failure on the part of the ment to respect, let alone protect, the Constitutional separation of Judicial and Executive power and the independence of the Judiciary. That letter, further parts of which I will quote today, indicates that relations between the Government and the judiciary have reached their lowest ebb, at least in living memory. The letter is an indictment of the Government and, dare I say, particularly of the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy), whose job it is to protect the judiciary, and an indictment of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), who at the very least should respect both the judiciary and the doctrine of the separation of powers between the legislature, the Executive and the judiciary. I note at this early stage the reported contemptuous reply of the Attorney General to the Chief Justice's letter, namely, 'Your letter demeans your office and mine' - a reported response which is contemptuous but symptomatic of the treatment meted out to Federal judges. Condemnation does not flow solely from the Opposition. This is not brought in on some political point-scoring party partisan approach. This condemnation does not flow solely from us or, indeed, from the judges. The two peak bodies of the legal profession-the Australian Bar Association and the Law Council of Australia-have condemned Government's undermining of the judiciary. It is now time for the Parliament to express its view, not in some grubby partisan way but in terms of the highest national interest. I should add that the Chief Justice's letter was 'written with the unqualified concurrence of every member of the High Court'. This matter goes to the heart of our system of justice and liberty, for there is a clear threat to the independence and effective workings of our courts and, therefore, to the very freedom that Australians cherish. It also goes to the heart of the responsibilities of the Attorney General. As the first law officer of the land, it is incumbent upon the Attorney to respect and protect the Constitution. For the highest judicial officer-namely, the Chief Justice of the High Court-to Govern- claim that the Attorney and the Government have failed to honour the fundamental tenets of our Coristitution and that the Government fails to appreciate the significance of these principles is no less than a clear expression of a want of confidence-frankly, unprecedented in this nation's history. The Chief Justice's letter represents the culmination of a process whereby members of the judiciary have broken with the long-standing convention that they not become publicly involved in the political process. Until recent years it' would have been considered extraordinary for a single judge to speak out publicly against the government of the day. The level of disquiet expressed by our judiciary is unprecedented, reflecting the recent call by a former judge of the Federal Court, Sir Edward Woodward, that judges that judges 'go public' in order to ensure that their concerns are voiced effectively. Let me substantiate this by listing the extraordinary number of judges, and the eminence of the positions they hold, who have protested about the diminished status of the judiciary in Australia today. In the last two years, in one form or another, the judges who have entered the public debate have included the Chief Justice of the High Court, Sir Anthony Mason; Mr Justice Brennan of the High Court; Sir the Ninian Stephen, a former member of the High Court and, of course, a former Governor General; the Chief Justice of the Family Court, Mr Justice Nicholson; Sir Reginald Smithers, formerly of the Federal Court; Sir Nigel Bowen, former Chief Justice of the Federal Court; Mr Justice MCGarvie, of the Victorian Supreme Court; the Chief Justice of the South Australian Supreme Court; Mr Justice Kirby, President of the New South Wales Court of Appeal; the Chief Justice of the Western Australian Supreme Court; and the Chief Justice of the Tasmanian Supreme Court-an extraordinary number of eminent jurists exercising their concerns with the erosion of their status and independence. In his letter, the Chief Justice of the High Court says that the Government's treatment of judiciary indicates: . . . a want of understanding of the Constitutional position of the Judiciary (in particular, High Court), and the relationship which that position requires to be preserved between the Judiciary and the Executive Government. In the last year the Government has delivered two striking blows to the concept of judicial independence and, in doing so, has circumvented section 72(iii) of the Constitution which provides that Federal judges: Shall receive such remuneration as the Parliament may fix; but the remuneration shall not be diminished during their continuance in office. The two blows I referred to are, first, the imposition of provisional taxation on judicial salaries and, secondly, the attitude the Government has taken to the determination of judicial salaries. The impact of the Government's decision on taxation is such that Mr Justice Nicholson, Chief Justice of the Family Court, in his annual report for 1989-90 at page 2, has written: The effect of the legislation upon these Judges is that many of them will have an after-tax income in 1990/91 of about $12,500. Chief Justice Nicholson continues: .A most serious aspect of these developments is the weakening of the position of the judiciary as the third arm of government in comparison with the legislature and the executive. I consider it to be a serious inroad upon judicial independence for Judges to be placed in the position of supplicants to the executive and, in particular, to the Commissioner of Taxation, through no fault of their own. All that was bad enough, but the Chief Justice of the High Court-I will quote him at length, and I will quote from the letter I referred to earlier-has indicated: My understanding is that there is currently no reference before your Tribunalthat is, in the letter to the Remuneration Tribunalrelating to judicial remuneration. This letter is not, and should not be seen as, concerned to seek a recommendation for any increase in the level of that remuneration. The level of remuneration of the Chairman of the National Crime Authority (indeed, the very manner in which it is calculate d) and the proposal in relation to the remuneration of the Solicitor-General and the Director of Public Prosecutions do, however, represent further significant steps in a continuing process of downgrading the Commonwealth Judiciary. I. would be failing in my responsibilities as Chief Justice of this country if I failed to write to you to protest about the Government's attitude to the wards judicial salaries which your Tribunal is being invited to endorse. The situation with the Chairman of the National Crime Authority and the proposals in relation to the Solicitor-General and the Director of Public Prosecutions indicate a want of understanding of the constitutional position of the Judiciary (in particular, the High Court) and the relationship which that position requires to be preserved between the Judiciary and the Executive Government. More than that, when viewed in the light of the history of salary determination in recent years, they indicate an apparent want of understanding on the part of the Government of the nature and significance of the role of the Judiciary. That want of understanding has led to an erosion in the remuneration and status of the Judiciary. The duties and responsibilities of the JUdiciary are such that it is quite inappropriate to use judicial salaries as the basis of comparison in fixing the remuneration of Executive officers. In particular, the duties and responsibilities of the Justices of the High Court, having regard to that Court's unique functions under the Constitution and its position at the apex of the Judiciary, are quite incomparable with the duties and responsibilities of officers of the Executive Government, including its statutory authorities. It is one thing for Government to decide or dictate the policies to be applied to the fixing of salaries in the Executive service. It is another thing for Government to override, as it has done, the recommendations of the Tribunal established to ascertain the appropriate levels of judicial salaries in order to impose the Government's own ad hoc views. If Government acts in that way its action tends to make judges beholden to the Executive. Moreover, the effect of acting in that way is to enhance or diminish the financial security of the Judiciary and its status according to the Executive's estimate of the worth and work of the Judiciary. The separation of powers and the maintenance of judicial independence call for judicial salary determination by a fully independent tribunal and, I would add, on a basis which is not linked to the determination of the salaries of officers in the Executive services, or for that matter, of politicians. The letter is significantly longer than that and makes further significant points. I seek leave to table a copy of this letter as it should be read in full by all honourable members of the Parliament. Leave granted.  constitutional reality of section 72 of Australian Constitution. Quite apart from this searing question of the Government acting contrary to the Constitution, have the Remuneration Tribunal, in its 1988 annual review, warning in the folseventeenth lowing terms: The remuneration of the Federal Judiciary in Australia is too low. Judged by any proper cipals for the assessment of remuneration too low by a great margin . . . a continuation of the present position has the potential for damage to the public interest. Since then the situation has not only con1701. tinued, it has worsened. Now we are seeing those predictions come true; indeed, there has been damage to the public interest underlying the need to maintain the insecurity dependence of the judiciary. What is offensive about the Government's actions has been its continual interference with the internal processes of the Remuneraduring tion Tribunal leading up to the making its determination. The result of this is, the Chief Justice of the High Court points out in his letter, 'a continuing process downgrading the Commonwealth judiciary'. This leads us inevitably to the question of whether the erosion of the independin ence of the judiciary has come about accan cidentally or, as the Chief Justice Anthony Mason suggests, that the Government's attitude 'has been, presumably as a matter of policy . . . to reduce the relevant standing of the judiciary'. The independence of the judiciary be undermined equally by a series of nor events as it can by a single dramatic event. When viewed in context, developand ments over the last few years show a dis:turbing pattern. Either the Government has deliberately set out to reduce the tus and independence of the judiciary, such a diminution has come about besalaries cause of a consistent dereliction of sponsibility on the part of the cepts Government. This is not a matter just about salaries; indeed, the whole question of the status and independence of the judiciary is a development of the greatest moment. the early seventeenth century, that great common lawyer, Sir Edward Coke, fought the bitterly with James I and his Attorney General, Francis Bacon, to establish judicial 'independence. Whilst Sir Edward we Coke was not entirely successful during his own lifetime, his successors in the late century were mindful of his efforts to ensure that the judiciary was put at arms length from the Executive. prinThe judiciary looked to Parliament-that it is is why I am raising it again today-to offer protection from the Executi ve and grave that protection found its place in some of the provisions of the Act of Settlement of It was therefore provided that the means by which judicial independence could be ensured were twofold; namely, first, of tenure for judges in that their most removal could. only come about on an address by Parliament; and, secondly, that judicial remuneration not be diminished the holding of office. Quite reof cently, Mr Justice Brennan has described as these provisions as representing 'the twin pillars of independence'. Its direct releof vance to us, and not just of historical interest, is that our constitutional founders had the foresight to ensure that these twin pillars of independence be enshrined our Constitution, and so it is that they be found In section 72 of the ConstiSir tution of the Commonwealth. The honourable member opposite who was speaking so sneeringly, seeking to interject when I went back to the Act of Settlement and its forerunner, the argucan ments between Coke and James I and miFrancis Bacon, ought to recognise that some take note of the lessons of history seek to implement them into the pattern of life and society and, indeed, at the highest level, into our Constitution itself, staas did indeed our constitutional fathers. or Therefore, this is not an argument about alone. It goes to the very status reand independence of our judiciary-conthat are fundamental to our society. It took centuries of argument, it took centuries of blood being spilt, to achieve the structures that we have in place today. It has taken but a few years of this GovernIn ment to place them in jeopardy. We ought to be mindful of the warning by the French political philosopher, Montesquieu: There is no liberty if the power of judging be not separated from the legislative and executive powers. It falls t9 this Parliament to protest, and to protect the judges; and it falls to Parliament to condemn a,government and an Attorney-General for allowing this to occur.",89
230,Mr DUFFY,APPROPRIATION,"Firstly, I apologise to the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott) for intervening at this stage before he was able to speak. Obviously the matters raised within the portfoiio by the honourable  such a serious nature that I consider it necessary to respond to them at this time. The honourable member for Kooyong has claimed that there is a serious erosion of judicial independence in this country: that was his first allegation. Secondly, he claims that that is an indictment of the Attorney General and of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). He then indicated that it was not a point scoring, party political exercise, and then went on to quote concerns expressed by the Australian Bar Association and the Law Council of Australia-as if we on this side of the House, and particularly myself, do not understand the question of the separation of powers. The suggestion was more than just our not understanding; the suggestion was that the separation of powers is not held as dearly by me as by anybody else in this place. In fact, it is something which has always been a matter of enormous significance to me and something, I think, everyone in this Parliament understands-most of all, I would hope, the Attorney-General. We were then given an interesting discourse on what happened in the seventeenth century. But one thing the honourable member for Kooyong raised in referring to what happened in the seventeenth century was that it was not just about salaries; it was a question of security of tenure. Then he went on to elaborate on the issue of separation of powers. He then dealt with two matters, having said that there was a serious erosion of judicial independence in this country. He said two blows had been dealt to the independence of the judiciary, as I understand what he was saying. The first one was the question of provisional tax and the second one was the attitude of the Government to the determination of judicial salaries. He then quoted from a report of the Family Court a reference to salaries by the Chief Justice of the Family Court. The honourable member for Kooyong indicated that in 1990-91 the after-tax income of some judges would be as low as $12,500. It is those matters which I propose to deal with. Before dealing with those in detail, and having had a learned dissertation from the honourable member for Kooyong on the separation of powers and judicial independence, it may be worthwhile-for his education-just touching upon what I understand the independence of the judiciary to mean. It is basically this: the judiciary in any country which claims to be a democratic country must be able to operate independently of the Parliament and the Executive. Th&t is what it means. In respect of the matters raised by the honourable member for Kooyong, I would refer him to a definition of 'independence of judiciary' which appeared in 13 Melbourne University Law Review, page 336, a journal which would be regular reading for the honourable member for Kooyong and myself. In this instance, long before this matter came before this Parliament today, I had picked up from that journal a reference which I think sums up the independence of the judiciary, cutting away all of the rhetoric which we have . heard here today. The definition at page 336, by a former Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, is as follows: A judiciary which dispenses justice according to law without regard to the policies and inclinations of the government of the day That is not that far away from what I had always understood the independence of the judiciary to be. That is exactly the way it was defined in the Melbourne University Law Review article. The fact of the matter is that that is precisely the position in this country-and let us all hope to God it always will be; that is, the judiciary, iri undertaking its most imp ortant and at times extremely onerous tasks, is going to be able to dispense justice according to law without regard to the policies and inclinations of the government of the day. That is the way the honourable member for Kooyong said that the Constitution envisaged that the separation of powers and the independence of the jUdiciary would operate in this country. Fortunately for all of us, that was the way it was established and that is the way it operates today. There has been nothing said by the honourable member for Kooyong which indicates anything else. There is no question--"":""'and I keep repeating this, because there seems to be some inclination by the honourable member for Kooyong to indicate that I do not see this as an important matter-that today that is the position in Australia, as it should be: the totally independent of any other arm of government, that is, both the Parliament and the Executive. The honourable member for Kooyong touched on a couple of other matters. I will come back to the one I referred to earlier-the comments by the Chief Justice of the Family Court of Australia when referring to judicial salaries in the annual report of the court. On that occasion the Chief Justice was referring to the question of provisional tax and pay as you earn (PAYE) deductions. In the Budget of last year it was determined that provisional tax would be payable in various areas. That included judges. Unquestionably, many judges-I do not think this is denied by anyone; I do not think the honourable member for Kooyong suggested it-had elected to pay their tax on a PAYE basis. Any judges paying tax on a PAYE basis were not affected in the way that the honourable member for Kooyong indicated. Their after-tax income was not depleted in any way, because they were not subject to provisional tax if they were already paying PAVE tax. There was an argument put that there was something unconstitutional about all this. I think that ought to be put to rest very quickly. The Government obtained advice from the Solicitor-General on this Issue. ",93
231,Mr DUFFY,APPROPRIATION,"Yes, I am quite happy to table it. The honourable member is welcome to it. Anything that will give the honourable member some education in this area will be of enormous benefit to us all. So, yes, he is welcome t6 it. That is the opinion of the Solicitor-General in respect of P AYE and provisional tax. He advised that the PAYE provisions of the Income Tax Act did apply to Federal judges. Accordingly, Federal judges are required to pay PAYE instalments. In addition, some judges-those who are not paying PAYE-would be required to pay provisional tax in relation to their judicial remuneration as a result of legislation judiciary is . passed in 1990. There is no question that some judges will be more disadvantaged than others by that. I dealt with that earlier. Those who were on PAYE were not affected by it. I do not think the honourable member for Kooyong would suggest-nor, can I say with some satisfaction, was it suggested by any judge, whether it be a chief justice or any other' judge-that once PAYE payments under the Income Tax Act applied to Federal judges and accordingly Federal Court judges were required to pay PAVE instalments and, in addition, some were required to pay provisional tax, this Government should come into this Parliament and say, 'Everyone else is now paying provisional tax in this way where they were not paying it in the past, but we will now separate from that whole tax regime the judiciary in this country'. No-one suggested that. That would have been an extraordinary step to take, and it is one that no chief justice in discussions on this matter-there were a lot of discussions about this matter-suggested to me. In fact, the contrary is the position. When put to one of the chief justices, he said, 'No, of course that could not be done'. The honourable member for Kooyong indicated that there was no concern about this matter. Those judges who were not paying PAYE tax had to pay their tax by 31 March this year. The problem that arose was that they were then faced with a provisional tax bill. Because of the concerns and the point made. I think in fairness to the Chief Justice of the Family Court I should say that, though I have not got the report with me now, I have no doubt .that it was released before this step was taken-and as a result of the representations, both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) agreed with me that that provisional tax should not be required to be paid by 31 March, for the very reason that the honourable member made, that there would have been an after tax income which would be extremely low. . ",94
232,Mr DUFFY,APPROPRIATION,"I heard the honourable member say that before. I do not think I interrupted him when he was making his presentation. He has said that twice now, and the message is clear. The extension for the payment of provisional tax was made to 30 September. There was a sixmonth extension. The second point that the honourable member made in relation to this so-called erosion was the attitude to the determination of judicial' salaries. He made the point that judicial salaries in this country are too low. I am not clear what he is saying. What is the magic figure? At what level would the honourable member be satisfied that judicial salaries are the linchpin of the independence of the judiciary? They are in some way related in the honourable member's mind, and in the minds of others-I agree with thataccording to what he has said today. The implication is quite clear in his speech. I think that is absurd.  tion.",95
233,Mr DUFFY,APPROPRIATION,"It was a very strong implication in a lot of the honourable member's speech.  tion, conveniently.",95
234,Mr DUFFY,APPROPRIATION,"I must say that the honourable member said that there were two blows to the independence of thejudiciary. The first one involved provisional tax. The second. one was the attitude to the determination of judicial salaries. He went no further than that. The two points he made related solely to salary-that is, the question of provisional tax and the attitude to determination of judicial salaries. I think it would be very nice if judicial salaries could be higher, but I do not know what the magic figure is if we are going to link judicial salaries and independence of the judiciary, as the honourable member has. The two blows-the honourable member said this-to judicial independence were the question of provisional tax and the attitude to the determination of judicial salaries. That is not what judicial independence is about. As I said before, the independence of the judiciary depends entirely upon, and should depend entirely upon, what I said before: that is, a judiciary which dispenses justice according to law without regard to the policies and inclinations of the government of the day. That is exactly the position, as I said, which fortunately applies in this country and will continue to apply, I would think, while we are in government and when, if ever, the people who are sitting opposite are in government. It is the most extraordinary beat-up to be coming in here and making an allegation that in this country there has been a serious erosion of the judicial independence. That is what the honourable member said. What did he say to support that? He mentioned the two big blows, which, as I said, both related to salary. Then he went on about the fact that it was not appropriate to link salaries. I think he was quoting from the Chief Justice's letter; he did not have an original thought in the whole of his speech. It was something like that. He said that it was not appropriate to link any salaries to judicial salaries. That was an attack on the provision of salaries, in particular, for· the Solicitor General and the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). Let me get the history of this straight for the honourable member for Kooyong. When the submission was put to the Remuneration Tribunal by the Government in relation to the DPP and the Solicitor General, the reason that the Chief Justice and other judges responded to that was that the Chairman of the Tribunal, Mr Justice Mahoney, in his wisdom, decided that he would send the submission to the courts for comment. That is how it all started. The judges were responding to that submission. In relation to the Solicitor-General and the Director of Public Prosecutions-this is not one of the matters on which the honourable member transgressed; the enormous significance of those two officers is not disputed by him nor, I think, by anyone else-there is a difference. There is the question of tenure, to which the honourable member referred and which is obviously an essential plank in the independence of the judiciary. The High Court and Federal Court judges in this country are appointed to the age of 70, and the Family Court judges are appointed to the age of 65. In respect of that, it is worth taking into accountbecause the honourable member for' Kooyong decided to drag independence of the judiciary down to the grubby level of salaries; no-one else but he did it in this Parliament-the fact that both of the officers referred to, that is, the Solicitorhonourable General and the Director of Public Prosecutions, do not have the tenure that judges have. That has to be taken into account in salaries. It has to be taken into account in two ways: firstly, they do not have the tenure that judges do and should have but, secondly, it also of course has an enormous effect on pension rights in relation to the Solicitor-General and the DPP. All of those issues were taken into account in the submission which I put to the Tribunal i- respect of the DPP and the Solicitor-General, and I do not apologise in any way for that, irrespective of what the Bar Association of Victoria might say about it-the honourable member for Kooyong was doing its bidding today-or what the Law Council of Australia might say about it. The fact of the matter is that the Solicitor-General and the DPP do not have the tenure that judges have and should have, and they do not have the same pension rights. So there is a distinction. But it is unfortunate I think that when the honourable member for Kooyong came down here today and gave us a learned dissertation going back to the seventeenth century, it became apparent that he has not got a basic fundamental understanding of what the independence of the judiciary is about. I suggest that the one thing that may come out of this discussion, which the honourable member for Kooyong brought on this afternoon and, in doing so, dragged this issue into the arena of the Parliament for discussion, is that he will take the time to read that article in 13 Melbourne University Law Review, page 336. He may well have read it but, if he did, he has engaged in some very selective amnesia in relation to his determination of what is independence. of the judiciary. Fortunately-and I say this as seriously as I have said anything in this Parliament in the last 10 years-independence of the judiciary in this country is the same as it has been since 1901; there is no serious erosion of independence of the judiciary, no erosion at all, and the claims the member for' Kooyong has made are patently absurd.",95

253,Mr STEELE HALL,APPROPRIATION,"Boothby) (5.58)One of the previous speakers from the Government .lamented that the Opposition was not being constructive in addressing this debate. Of course, that is always the plea of those who are unable to defend the actions with which they have been involved. There is a great deal at the moment which places the Government on the back foot in relation to public administration. Therefore, in looking at Appropriation Bill (No.4), Appropriation Bill (No.5) and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No.2), I find reference there to substantial payments to the States, and this takes my mind, of course, to the position of the States at the present time and the relationship between the Commonwealth and the States in respect to taxation collection and the complication imposed on that in relation to the operation of the Commonwealth Grants Commission and the subsidies which are inherent in the Grants Commission operation in transferring funds from the larger States and the wealthy States in Australia to those more outlying and those which do not have such a fundamentally sound economic base. Having said that, one is drawn immediately to the financial links and, in considering these financial links, to standards, and the standards of the operation of the State governments have been very much to the fore in these last months, so much so that the public of Australia is deeply concerned at these standards. I may say that it is part of the reason why there is a sea change evident in the community in relation to political support for the major parties. Only one year after the last election, the' next election is being referred to in this House. From the tenor of Question Time there is almost an election fever. Why is that? The evidence of it is very real when one moves through the community and finds the expectation of change of government that is developing in response to this Government's failure to manage this country's economy and to the failure of the State Labor governments around Australia to manage their affairs on behalf of their constituents. This sea change, as I have said, is so evident that it is driving public expectation and inevitably it will arrive at a 1975 and 1977 result when the next contest is held. I am somewhat disappointed that there is a semi-election fever two years from the scheduled event because it tends to preclude the processes of government. But that is something the Government' has brought upon itself. It can be no accident that the three southern State governments' are in a state of collapse. When one looks across the southern seaboard, from Western Australia and through South Australia to Victoria, one finds some of the most unfortunate decisions translated into failures of government administration. One sees the direct links between those governments and the Federal scene. There is such a direct link that the Premier of my State happens to be the Federal President of the Australian Labor Party. These links will be dealt with further by royal commissions-one in Western Australia; one to be held in South Australia into the operations of the State Bank; and no doubt others that will follow this dereliction of duty in those three areas. Aside from the corruption which occurred, and which was proven, in the previous New South Wales Labor Government, one has to ask why these administrations have failed. It seems incredible that the stars of State Labor governments- Mr Burke, Mr Bannon and Mr Cain, who stood at the top of the polls and had the widest approval of their electorate-have fallen so far from grace. As their main defections are in the financial scene, one can ask what happened to their State Treasuries. What happened to the relationship between a State Treasury and a State Treasurer? Can we assume that State Treasuries did not know of impending events, or were they acting at the behest of the State Treasurer? In Western Australia did they approve of the purchase of properties held by Holmes a Court at fictitious values by State instrumentalities? Was that a Treasury approved function or was it that the Treasurer of the State completely overrode his financial officers? How is it that the street talk around the City of Adelaide knew of impending difficulties with the State Bank apparently before the State Treasurer himself was aware of it? How.can there be a failure of this dimension? When one looks at South Australia one begins to see a story. One of the first things that became evident in the dereliction of public duty in South Australia was the sale by the State Government of the southern transport corridor. I will not deal in detail with an isolated item, except to say that it involved a most important acquisition of land for the construction of a main transport route in Adelaide. It was acquired with great distress to property owners. It was acquired for a very good price on current day values. It was sold for what amounts to a pittance compared with the sums now bandied around as losses in State governments. I suppose that should have alerted South Australians to the fact that their Government was not acting on their behalf. But now we have been involved in a most abhorrent prudential failure unknown in a State such as South Australia which, for decade upon decade, has been recognised for its prudential conservatism. The unknown debts of the State Bank were tallied at roughly $1 billion. Street talk spoke of $2 billion. It is as well to look at the suggestions made by these three State Labor governments early on before the admittance of failure in large areas of financial management. Whenever these matters were brought up there was a reassurance: the State Premiers we.t:e good at reassuring. First of all, the matter was always confidential and, therefore, they could not answer. Then, when the investments were revealed, it became a commercial decision and always they had Premier and Treasury approval. When one hears street talk of a $2 billion debt by the State Bank of South Australia, rather than a $1 billion debt-one does not want to cause difficulty with the bank; it is a State institution-what is one to make of further assurances? Are they of the same value as the first assurancesthe reports that the bank put out itself earlier this year which did not acknowledge any of this difficulty? In South Australia we move on to institutions such as Workcover, which is always in difficulty with the State Government Insurance Commission (SGIC). I noticed in my local newspaper today a report that in 1989 the SGIC went into the nappy business. Whilst this may be a heading placed there to get a bit of a smile, it is a most serious business. I quote: The State Government Insurance Commission . . . has expanded its business interests to nappy pilchers, investing $100,000 in a company set up and partly owned by one of its own executives. SGIC's manager of administrative accounting for corporate investments, Mr Brian Jones, set up a baby clothing manufacturip.g firm-Brileen Industries Pty Ltd-two months after he joined SGIC in July, 1989. Six months later, the company was given a major boost with a capital injection of $lOO,qOO from SGIC in a deal approved by the PremIer, Mr Bannon. The article goes on to say: Australian Securities Commission documents list Mr Jones, David John Tucker (a senior partner in legal firm Thomson Simmons and lawyer credited with forming many of the ficial Finance off-balance sheet companies), Hundertmark (a former principal of Pegasus curities), Brian William English and Nicholas gakis as directors of Brileen. The article provides further information. What we see there is the network-the tions. interlocking of interests· from the State Bank to the SGIC, to a private company set up on behalf of or with the shareholdeducation ing of an SGIC employee. I make no charges of illegality. I just say that the document states that the deal had Bannon's approval. So we get back to standards. I make no charge of illegality, but I do ask: would the public expect that to be proper? Is that the sort of adminismost tration they would require of their Treashighlighted urer? There is only one answer, no matter on which side one sits in this House. course they would not. It would not something which would stand constant exposure in any parliament. There has been the most appalling dereliction of NSW standards in the three State governments through in the bottom half of Australia. Mr Bannon has turned around and now seeks a gambling-led recovery. This is rious. He has always stood against poker . machines. He has approved the operation consider of poker machines to raise, he. hopes, a meeting substantial sum for the Government from the operation of those poker machines. I am open-minded about these things. In the past I have voted for an extension of gambling and drinking laws. I believe that adults have the right to use facilities as they wish. But one cannot avoid the deliberate trend of the State Government to move as Mr Bannon has. Long agostudents several decades ago-South Australians spent $56 per head per year on gambling; he said: in the last accounting period under the In Bannon Government they spent $822 per reluctant head per year. On top of that, Mr Bannon is now to have a poker machine-led recovery. Many stories will be told of the State Labor governments led by Mr Burke, Mr Bannon and Mr Cain. Two of them have seen the answer as changing their leaders. In South Australia, Mr Mike Rann and Mr Frank Blevins, two able Ministers in the the Bannon Government, are waiting in Benethe wings; I expect that with further revBruce elations a move will be made by Labor in SeSouth Australia to follow the other two BeStates each side of ours. That will be an attempt to save the skin of Labor from these most embarrassing recent revelaIn talking of standards, I want to move onto a related matter, and that is the of highly gifted children. As one would expect, having briefly alluded to the failures in South Australia, South Mr Australia under the Labor Government has a very poor record in this area. There have been available very limited educational facilities for teachers in this important area, and this has been in recent times by two announcements. Mr Greiner announced on Of 11 April a New South Wales Government be initiative which was reported in the Australian in the following terms: will today seek national support for - program to fast-track gifted and talented chIldren primary and high school in as little as nine years. The article went on to say about the Minseister for Education in New South Wales: . . said yesterday she would urge all States to implementing the program, at a two-day of education ministers in Adelaide . . . That meeting was to start today. In order for Australia to become a clever country we need to develop the talents of our young. It is no good simply becoming a clever state. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) on 10 April referred to students in the gallery who had won the Australian prize for their efforts in year 12 in 1990. In referring to them in the House, this country we have sometimes been a little to celebrate the achievements of some of our academically talented people. That is very true. There is a growing amount of literature on and reporting of the opportunities which Australia is missing out on in this regard. South Australia is missing out particularly. Until this year there has been one semester only available in teacher training on the capacity to recognise and then educate gifted students. In fact, one estimate given to me is that not more than 2 per cent of teachers would be educated to recognise gifted children when they encounter them in their classroom. The difficulty in South Australia is very weak leadership by the Minister for cided Education of the education portfolio-so much so that he is being run by a teacher organisation that is able to impose its in our community. industrial will on schools and on students. Several weeks ago I raised with the Speaker in this House a problem with school in my djstrict, a class from which was booked into visit this House. visit was cancelled because some of the teachers in that school would not perform the tasks of the teachers who would accompanying the class to this House their absence. In addition, one of school concerts last year was cancelled administration. because teachers would not give that little extra time out of school hours to organise the students as they have always been organised annually in their school concert operation. This is an indication of industrial action that is tolerated by a State Labor ing), education Minister. There can be no greater dereliction of duty when industrial action among teachers of that nature harms and deforms, if I may put it that way, the education of the children who are in the custody, in a sense, and certime tainly under the management of the the education Minister. It is indeed a sad day in South Australia. After considering the report of the Sennity ate Select Committee on the Education of Gifted and Talented Children, the Federal Government has taken the view that failing, the matter is to be left with the States. imagine that since it made that decision it has at least taken the initiative I referred to concerning the Australian stuare dents prize, which resulted in the students attending here. The question was considered last week at the Australian Education Council in South Australia. The New South Wales Government put the proposal to the Council that Mr Greiner has since announced. I am told-only very unofficially-that the South Australian Government refused to go ahead with that. I do not press that point at this moment because, as I understand it, the Government has not publicly responded, but my unofficial information is that it has denot to proceed. If that is so, it will be one more instance of weakness of leadership in one of the most important areas I take this opportunity of saying to this House that I regret very much that we a have in South Australia-as we have obviously in the other two States with Labor The governments-a preoccupation with the problems that they have created for themselves to such a degree that they are unbe able to perform the quality of in administration required of them across the the board in the many areas of their I can only put on record what is known through the South Australian community and throughout Australia in regard to the failure of Labor governments and the coalition of economic failure, led by this Government, by the Treasurer (Mr Keatat the same time as the State Labor governments collapsed. The standard of their administration is presenting Australia with a problem of great extremes. As I said when I started these few remarks, they can respond only when the arrives. In the meantime, it is up to Opposition to reveal these deficiencies at every turn.

254,Mr ELLIOIT,APPROPRIATION,"We dealing with Appropriation Bill (No. 4), Appropriation Bill (No.5), and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No.2). Both the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall) and the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) went to great lengths to highlight what they perceive to be the negatives as far as the Government is concerned-and, in the case of the honourable member for Boothby, State governments around the country. What they failed to do throughout their remarks was to highlight-and it would have been interesting to hear the honourable member for Boothby on thissome of the virtues of the Opposition's policy in relation to the goods and services tax. I would like to have heard him give a dissertation about the merits of that and highlight how beneficial that will be for the electors of Boothby and the people of the Australian community generally. It would also have been worthwhile for the honourable member for Curtin to tell us just how the people of Western Australia will be better off with a consumption tax. The honourable member for Curtin lamented the fact that the surplus had been reduced, which is self-evident from the Bills before the House. But he did not go on to say what a wonderful record of producing surpluses those opposite had had in government. The conservatives occupied the treasury bench for 27 of the 30 years from 1953 to 1983 and did not produce a surplus in any of those years. A surplus is important. Since 1987 it has been one of the features of our fiscal management and of the fiscal restraint that we have ensured was exacted across the board in the public sector. We are now faced with the very difficult, indeed unique, circumstances that cause much of what applies in Appropriation Bill (-o. 4) and Appropriation Bill (No.5). Before going on to some other general remarks, I note that there is an additional $278m in defence expenditure in Appropriation Bill (No.4). No-one would dispute that the last few months have been a tumultuous period for us internationally. There has been the Gulf War. Daily, both on our televisions and in the press, we have seen continuing reports of the problems and difficulties that people, be it the Palestinians or the Kurds, are facing after the great tragedy that has occurred in the Middle East. As one of its measures, Appropriation Bill (No.4) provides additional funding for much of that relief and humanitarian aid. The Opposition would do well to enunciate its views on this. At the last Federal election, documents circulated through my electorate by my political opponent highlighted the fact that the Opposition planned to cut dramatically the level of foreign aid provided. How on earth can those opposite, on the one hand, express sympathy and concern about the needs of people, be they refugees or people such as the Kurds facing the most horrific circumstances, and, on the other hand, come into this place and say, 'This run-down in the surplus is wrong. We would cut foreign aid more vigorously. We would ensure that the sort· of assistance that the nation has an obligation to provide as part of its world community obligation is cut'? .That is one of the inconsistencies that we keep getting in this fiscal argument. Nowhere have I seen statements in recent weeks from Opposition spokesmen in this area that suggest how they would match up the cuts in foreign aid with trying to do something to assist the Kurds in the difficult times they have at the moment. That should be part of what is enunciated if we are to look at these issues. The same thing applies in other areas such as training, education and the general area of welfare. The honourable member for Boothby talked about training and education needs. I can speak as one who has had pretty recent experience in the provision of education services in the tertiary sector. Above all else, this appropriation provides extra funds because of the increased demand for places both in the technical and further education (TAFE) system and in the education sector generally with Austudy claims and so forth. A number of fundamentals apply in all this. One of the most important is that it is critical that, as well as worrying about the clever people, the exceptional peopleand I concede that historically we as nation have not done nearly enough in that area-great attention is focused the fact that the education needs across the board have to be a priority. I represent an electorate in the western part of Sydney. As I have said in this House before, it is all very well to about what education standards might be now, but the fact is that, in my electorate and in most of the electorates west of mine in the western suburbs of Sydney, in 1983 only one child in three completed secondary school; today it is two in three. A lot can be made from statistics but fundamentals are there: many students who had the potential, the gifts, to plete secondary schooling or trade or tertiary training did not get acces's to system prior to this Government coming into power. Equally, it would be nice to be able say that all States had an exemplary cord in the provision of schooling children. But in New South Wales we have seen the most savage and brutal tack on public education by the current State Government. This attack resulted many people demonstrating and expressone ing great anxiety. Courses were cut. Teacher numbers were reduced. The options that students had to develop their skills in specialised and stimulating areas were reduced. Students who had gifts would not come to light otherwise were left. No opp01,'tunity was provided for them through the public education syswhat tem. That was part of a deliberate strategy by the then Minister for Education in New South Wales. It applied as much rural areas as in city areas. In more recent times there has been a move away from that. That is to be welcomed, but there a long way to go. We need more opporwill tunities for students generally to get cess to education and training. These appropriations go some way to the wards providing those additional opporthe tunities, but more needs to be done. As to encourage. preparation goes into the next Federal Budget, it is important to recognise that there will be a need for greater resources . to be allocated to education services genin erally and, particularly, that there will a a need to provide additional places so that students seeking a place in universion ties or the TAFE system have the opportunity to do so. I note with pleasure the positive stimulus given to that in these appropriations. In the difficult economic conditions which the nation faces and talk which particularly many young people face, the opportunity for training and retraining is especially important. The Appropriation Bills also provide money in a number of other areas. I will devote a little time to one of those. The first is the area of tourism. An extra the $22.6m is provided for a new marketing campaign for tourism overseas. This is comimportant for all of us. We all hear many other comments from people outside Parliathat ment about the additional range of industries we have to move into and develop to create the skills that will produce exto port earning capacity for this country and reforeign exchange potential. Tourism is for their certainly one of those. This additional boost of almost $23m atfor tourism should have been provided earlier. Nevertheless, it is very welcome. in I know that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, as who has an electorate that takes in many areas which have magnificent tourism potential and where much has been done to develop that infrastructure in an outstanding way, as has occurred in many that other parts of the coastline and other places, will know that this is a very important initiative. It is interesting to note the tourism potential offers. This particular advertising campaign, which will be conducted essentially in the United in States of America and Japan, is in the hands of the great Australian golfer Greg Norman. I commend him for giving his is services. If used to its full potential, it ensure that we can build from the acapproximate 2.1 million visitors that we currently have to about fiv:e million by year 2000. That is the sort of impetus, sort of positive stimulus, that we have It is interesting to note that the tourism industry itself estimates that 8,700 jobs are qreated for every 10 per cent increase international visitors to Australia. It is be also interesting to note that, despite difficult times, in the last 12 months there has been a significant growth. During the postGulf War period tourism will start to build again. It is important that Australia, with its magnificent climate, with the safety and certainty it offers for tourists, capitalsons, ise on people around the world seeking to travel. That will be achieved only if we are prepared to sell the great attributes of our nation. My predecessor in the seat of Parramatta, Mr John Brown, as Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, was the catalyst for the Greg Norman campaign. In 1983 he ensured that the Government gave the go-ahead. It highlights what potential and opportunity there is if we treat tourism as the special industry, the great export potential and the great foreign exchange earner that it is. Far too often people say, ignorantly, 'We want to create real jobs; jobs in tourism aren't real jobs'. Jobs in tourism are very real jobs. They are jobs that multiply. They are jobs that provide tremendous opportunities both for those directly in tourism and for the various services which support the tourism industries. I very much welcome this additional allocation for tourism as provided in these appropriations. We should all recognise that it is important to provide public funds for these sorts of international campaigns: In the past the Opposition has had policies in tourism involving the abolition of the Australian Tourist Commission. It has also been asked to state clearly that it will support the provision of additional moneys for tourism in this way. Indeed, John Brown interviewed the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) on radio in January, and asked whether the Leader of the Opposition would acknowledge the same commitment as is provided in the Government's announcement of December relating to the additional $23m for tourism.' The Leader of the Opposition's reply was that at that stage he was not going to get into specifics as to the level Of support which would be provided or as to whether it was appropriate for the public sector to be providing it. In terms of the catalyst to get the tourist industry back, as I say, after the tumultuous events of the early part of this year, when people all around the world stopped travelling for very obvious reawe have to recognise that we as a Government and we as a Parliament have an obligation to ensure that that great potential of the tourist industry as a creator of jobs and as a source of great pleasure ,for many people is able to be promoted in the right way. I am sure the Greg Norman campaign offers just as much potential as the Paul Hogan campaign offered in 1983-84, and the benefits to Australia and to the Australian economy of everyone giving wholehearted support to that sort of endeavour should be there for all to see. Another important area of these appropriations relates to the funding that is provided for natural disaster relief. Appropriation Bill (No.5) provides $75m for this area. I welcome those allocations; they are obviously necessary. But they do give rise-and I see my colleague the  in the chamber-to an analysis that I think is worth making as to whether it is better to provide funding for efforts relating to relief operations in natural disasters, of which some cannot be anticipated and some can be planned for and provided for. Part of this funding provides for flood relief measures, and to overcome the tragedies that people both in rural and urban Australia have experienced in recent times. It is important to note that it is one of those areas-and there are many-where prevention is a better alternative, a more desirable alternative, than a cure. As preparations are made for future budgets, we need to ensure that this national Parliament and the national Government do play a more active role in providing for preventative measures that are needed in terms of overcoming the devastations of floods and so forth. We have been working very hard on this. In the last Federal Budget the Government provided $5.05m for New South Wales flood mitigation, for instance. Last week a delegation to the Minister forPrimary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) requested that that amount be lifted to $10m. I think the proposal put forward is very commendable, and should be taken up. The Minister has given a very strong indication of his appreciation of the importance of prevention in flood mitigation as well, as has the honourable member for Chifley, and rightly so. In western Sydney, for instance, we have had the problem of major floods in recent times. We know that if more money could be spent on accelerating flood mitigation efforts, the need for natural disaster funds would be reduced. Indeed, one of the lost benefit statistics presented to us by the flood mitigation authorities of New South Wales last week suggested that a dollar spent now on flood mitigation was probably going to save $5, maybe even $10, on disaster relief. To give an example locally in respect of my electorate-the Parramatta City Council in the last allocation of funds for flood mitigation received $750,000 from the Commonwealth- member. Mr ELLIOTI'-The electorate has a good member, certainly. The Council got that $750,000, and that is multiplied out, on the formula used, to provide something of the order of $1.875m in total works. That is welcome. But the fundamental and salient point in sion is that, whereas it got $750,000 for flood mitigation endeavours from the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth has had to provide about $1.6m in disaster relief funding to the same region, just to compensate for the damage that occurred, as a result of that flood, to public assets and to public infrastructure. One does not need to examine that sort of statistic in too much detail to see that that is not a very sound or rational economic way to manage a very difficult problem in terms of the urban flooding which we have in the western part of Sydney. Western Sydney is not unique, but the density of population there and the fact that a major flood can occur in our region-just in the small area covered by my electorate and the one which adjoins me-mean that something like 400 homes can be flooded by a flood that is not of any more than a one in 30 year density, and that number of homes is pretty severe in anybody's terms. Whilst welcoming the funding for restoration works that this Appropriation Bill provides, I would suggest that it is more timely to ensure for the future that the Commonwealth and all sections of government devote more funds to preventative measures. There are programs which show that if the $10m relief requested from the flood mitigation authorities this year is taken up-and I sincerely hope the Government will respond very positively to this-very significant improvements can be made in overcoming those problems. As well as providing funding for that area, the Appropriation Bills also cover very precisely areas relating to education services. I wish to take the opportunity to identify the fact that additional funding is provided for the various technical and further education (TAFE) institutions in the western part of Sydney. It is important to recognise that contribution and the continuing growth that there has been in the funding for higher education and the T AFE system in our region, and also to note particularly the great growth of population that is occurring there and the reason why it is important to continue to accelerate funding for the University of all this discus- Western Sydney. It is something I would encourage the Government to take up very actively in the preparation of the Budget, to provide extra places so as to fulfil the aspirations of so many people who, for so long, did not have an education institution to which they could aspire to go. They now have that, and it is up to us to ensure that we as a nation provide them with the resources to enable them to get to that university, to get their qualifications, and to get out-as I am sure they will-to contribute very actively and productively to the Australian economy. For all those reasons I welcome these appropriations, and I trust that the other measures that I have suggested need to be followed through for the future are measures that the Government takes on board.",101
255,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,APPROPRIATION,Mr Nehl)Order! The - honourable member's time has expired.,106
256,Mr CADMAN,APPROPRIATION,"ln speaking to the Appropriation Bill (No. 4), Appropriation Bill (No.5) and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No.2), I wish to say that at a time when the Budget is going into decline and possible deficit, at a time when there is dissatisfaction by union leaders with the accord and the wage fixing process, and at a time when there are record bankruptcies and increasing unemployment, I believe it is time for the Australian Government to come forward with a miniBudget. It is time that a reassessment was made of the economic circumstances which were predicted at the beginning of this financial year, as were set out by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in the Budget of August 1990. Those changes that have occurred during the last six to nine months are so substantial that, as in past years, the Treasurer this time should produce a mini-Budget, There have been many changes; many things have gone wrong-some things are explainable and some are not-but it is a fitting time to bring the economy into focus with the Australian people and to recapture those strayed ends of the economy that have gone wrong. It is time for the Government to reapply itself to the Budget. The Government is staggering under the problems of WA Inc. day to day here; that saga has been ongoing as the Royal Commission into Commercial Activities of Government and Other Matters in Western Australia continues. The Government is distracted from the main economic agenda that it should have before it; it is shattering at the edges. One has only to observe the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer today not dealing with the great issues of the day; not focusing on the basic need, which is to rectify the drift in what was predicted as a surplus; and not applying their attention to the demands of union leaders, and the dissatisfaction with the current processes of fixing wages and conditions in Australia. The Government is unwilling to cope with the problems of high interest rates and the recession, which is producing bankruptcies and increased unemployment. We are racked with recession and it appears that the Government is unable to cope with the situation. It appears the Government is letting things drift, and they will drift without any interventions or processes to bring the whole thing under control before the Budget next August. Immediate steps must be taken to give Australia at least a fair chance of recovery. There are three reasons and three areas where the Government has gone wrong and needs to take immediate steps to bring about change. Firstly, the Budget has blown, and that has a serious impact for the Australian community. The Government has not set about the process of privatisation and reform in any orderly manner. It is a mishmash of attempts, most of which are futile and do not go at anywhere. There is a continuation of the Australian Council of Trade Unions setting the agenda and seeking to control the economic destiny of Australia for the limited number of members that that organisation represents when compared with the total Australian work force. If one looks at the Budget outlays and estimates for the year, as laid down in the August Budget. I refer to the papers attached to the Budget Speech-one can see that it was proposed that the Government would. outlay about $92 billion in the current year, and that it would collect in total from taxes and other sources about $101 billion. That IS a huge amount of money and it is an amount of money that has grown dramatically since 1983. So the Estimates are large in total tax take and large in total outlays. When introducing his Budget, the Treasurer said these things: Australia has negotiated a difficult transition over the past 12 months-from an economy where spending and growth were overblown to an economy with lower activity and fewer imports. He went on to say: Tonight I am able to report that we are emerging from this phase in fundamentally better shape having succeeded in this transition. Nine months later that is absolutely untrue. The Treasurer made a prediction, a forecast and a statement of where Australia stood nine months ago, and today Australia has drifted into a worse situation. In that Budget Speech of August 1990 the Treasurer said: The faith the Australian people exhibited in the Government at the election is now being repeated as the economy adjusts to a sustainable rate of growth without catastrophic collapse. We are in the process of collapse; this is the recession we had to have. When he introduced the Budget, the Treasurer knew we had to have a recession. Despite all the sophistry of that Budget Speech, we are in dead trouble. It looks as if there will be something like a $1m surplus. The Government may achieve that by bringing forward payments and by fiddling the accounting processes. It is interesting to note that the Treasurer recently in the Australian Financial Review was reported as saying to Geoff Kitney, 'We will preserve the surplus.' I would like to refer the House to the statements in those Budget Papers where the surplus and the relationship between savings and the outturn for the Budget this year were painted as critical factors in the Government's strategy for economic management. I quote from the Budget statements, Paper No.1, paragraph 2.58: Correction of the external imbalance will require a significant narrowing of the gap between domestic investment and savings; otherwise, growth in exports will be offset over time by higher imports, with no lasting reduction in the current account deficit. High levels of national saving must be sustained if the current account deficit is to be reduced in a manner that still growth in the economy's productive potential. Recent reforms to retirement income arrangements are designed to assist over time in this regard, by improving the incentive for private saving. Retention of a substantial general government sector surplus represents the most important contribution that national economic policy can make to ensuring adequate national saving and reducing the external imbalance. It all sounds rather complicated but the propositions being put forward are that, if we increase our national savings, we will have the prospect of reducing imports and the current account deficit. So savings, as the Treasurer said in his own document last August, are important, and we must encourage national savings. One aspect mentioned in that same statement was that a significant contributor to savings and to the reservation of a slim chance of coming through easily was that the Government should budget for a surplus. Now the Government's surplus in real terms is gone, and the Government has warned in its own paper that if we reduce national savings that will only blowout the current account deficit to more extraordinary levels. So the Government cannot take from the national wealth to build the surplus or it would destroy its own proposition. If it lets the surplus run down, we will still be in trouble. I think there is a complete and absolutely logical argument for the Government to reassess its own spending and its own contribution to the disaster we face at this time. There is a critical need for a miniBudget, and by continuing its high spend. ing habits the Government is achieving the very run-down it said would be bad. The Government has a couple of options. I believe the Government's main option, with lower inflation and lower expectation for government revenue, is to reduce its own expenditure. In the miniBudget it should immediately reduce the cost of government to all Australians; it should immediately seek to cut at least $3 billion from its current Estimates and in that way produce the results that it predicted or contribute to the results it wanted to achieve when it introduced the Budget last year. It is only by reducing government expenditure that we will stand sees any chance of coming in near target and reducing that current account deficit; we should export more and import less. However, the Government seems unable, restricted and absolutely frozen in its actions. There are no positive features in its current attitude, which leads one to believe that the Government intends to bring in a mini-Budget and reduce government expenditure. There are structural problems which the Government must address, and they are now being built into the system. In part they are the massive deficits run up by State governments around the nation, with their extraordithat nary behaviour, as seen in Western Austhe tralia and Victoria and, to a lesser degree, in South Australia and Tasmania. One wonders how long Queensland c,an stay out of the mire the other States have drifted into. All Australians are eventually going have to pay for that bad management the Labor governments in those States. The structural problems that are there with any of them. have to be dealt with. The only way to deal with them is to rein in government expenditure and deal with the State over:expenditure in a sensible, logical way. is no good the Commonwealth Bank bailing out the Bank of Victoria and hoping' that that will solve the problem. That is short term palliative which will be lutely disastrous in its long term effect because all Australians are eventually going to pay for that process. The Government should also embark immediately upon a worthwhile privatisand ation program of selling to the Ahstralian community and, in reasonable proporment tions, internationally to those who wish to buy some of those enterprises that a constant drain on the Australian taxthat payer. Qantas Airways Ltd is in bad shape. It has been begging for two years to be allowed the freedom of proper private terprise operations, but the Government has restricted that decision; it has played around with that decision; it has refused to make a decision. Australian Airlines, Telecom, OTC, Aussat, the Commonis wealth Bank-there is a raft of enterprises that logically can be passed on to the private sector and, in that way, we start to come to grips with the underlying structural problems of the Australian economy. The Government is refusing to take one .step in that direction. The whole process is going to take five or 10 years, yet the Government will not take a small step the direction of trying to privatise and give incentive to those great enterprises that should be operating in the private sector. The Government will not take one step in the direction of trying to get some sort of incentive back into what is called the micro-economic sector-the reform is needed in transportation systems, reform that is needed in telecommunications and, ultimately, the reform that is needed in labour systems. Business by business, employment can be generated and wages and conditions satisfactorily . entered into in all of these great enterto prises where jobs are created rather than by lost. The Government seems to have its hands tied, refusing to take a simple step We come to the third point-the dissatisfaction of the union movement. Martin Ferguson commented today that the It Australian. Council. of Trade Unions (ACTU) will look at every aspect of every award before it decides whether or not it a is going to accept the Full Bench decision. absoHe made the statement today that it is going to go through them one by one. We have George Campbell and the Building Workers Industrial Union of Australia at this moment saying, 'It's bad news, mate, we're going to go for broke'. The dissatisfaction is in the failure of govern to come to grips with the important relationships between Australians in the are workplace. The Government proclaims it has an enterprise based approach to this. What absolute rubbish. What it is really saying is, 'We will let the workers ennegotiate with employers, and if they do not like that result they can go to the Full Bench'. It is having it both ways. The Government's claim that it is for enterprise based bargaining is pure rubbish. It a two tiered, corrupted system that the Government is talking about. I heard the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) today, can and I could not believe that he really considered what he was describing as being anything like ent-rprise bargaining. The Opposition, on the other hand, has . policies in this area, as we have policies in all the areas I have covered. There is a will on this side to deal with the problems in of the Budget that the Treasurer himself set out last year should not occur. He said that these things must not happen or we would be in trouble. He will not take action at this point, and we are going to have trouble. There is no doubt about it. That surplus has run down, savings have not increased, and the Government is going to go for a bigger grab out of Australian pockets, which will further destroy the proposition that he put up last year as being so significant for Australia's economic future. In that area we have a willingness to make the cuts to government expenditure. In the area of privatisation and reform of those great enterprises that need to be reformed,many of which are a constant demand on the Australian taxpayer, there is a program laid down by the Opposition. In the final area of personal relations in the workplace-industrial relations, it is normally called-the Government has drifted into change for the sake of change. Union amalgamations are the flavour of one month; award restructuring is another. Now managed flexibility is the term we hear. It looks like centralised decentralisation. That is all the Minister talked about today. He spoke about centralised decentralisation and a two-tiered system with, ultimately, the Industrial Relations Commission sitting on top of the heap. By contrast, the true system of enterprise agreements being proposed by the Opposition would not be within the Commission's purview. It would not be a matter for the Commission to decide whether an agreement between an employer and his employees was satisfactory or not. It is up to the people involved. They would not fall into the industrial relations jurisdiction; they would be common law agreements. It is a contract - that if the boss falls down, the workers can 'go him' in the courts. The second difference for the genuine enterprise arrangements that we would seek to introduce would be that both the existing system and the alternative system would be characterised by voluntary unionism. We want to see voluntary unionism, not compulsory unionism as at present. An end to compulsory membership of trade unions is desirable for all Australians. Thirdly, the main difference between ourselves and the Government in regard to these matters is that the enterprise agreements envisaged by the Opposition would be agreements confined to employees of the enterprise and the employer. They would not flow on from industry to industry or from enterprise to enterprise. These are serious days in the economy in Australia. I hoped that at this time of the year we would be having the Treasurer saying, 'I am going to introduce another mini-Budget'. There are - three important reasons why he should. I have explained the difficulties with the Budget and what will happen if action is not taken. The Government has taken no action to rid itself of demanding enterprises that are better run by the private sector, and the Government is continuing to play footsies with the union leaders, particularly the ACTU, in a most dangerous way for the well-being of most Australians. We need to be released from these things. The only way in which we can be released from the dreadful' oppression that is bearing down on us no'w, the torment and turmoil we are facing, is for the Government to introduce that mini-Budget. There should be a mini-Budget in May. There must be. We cannot afford to let things drift through.",106
257,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,APPROPRIATION,Mr Nehl)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,109
258,Mr GIBSON,APPROPRIATION,"In this debate on Appropriation Bill (No.4), Appropriation Bill (No.5) and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No.2) I will spend some time on an issue relevant to the activities of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade: the illegal annexation of East Timor by Indonesia and the Australian Government's acquiescence in this action. The Australian Government's position on East Timor has not been debated much in this chamber for a number of years, although mention was made of it during debate on . Australia's involvement in the Gulf war, when contrasts were drawn between our responses to the two invasions. Having recently visited East Timor as part of an Australian parliamentary delegation to Indonesia, I believe it is timely that I remind this House of some facts about this small but very important territory so close to Australia's shores. Until April 1974 East Timor was a colonial territory of Portugal. During that month a coup in Portugal brought to power a new regime committed to withdrawal from its colonial possessions. The new Gove'rnment spelt out three options for consideration by the East Timorese: semiindependence but with continued associ,. ation with Portugal; full independence; or integration with Indonesia. Within a few weeks political groupings emerged within the population which basically reflected the three options being offered by the Por:tuguese. These were the Democratic Union of Timor (UDT), which supported semiindependence under Portugal; the ASDT, which later became Fretilin, which sought full independence; and Apodeti, which wanted incorporation with Indonesia. Over the next few months the UDT and Fretilin initially came closer together to work towards a process of independence. It was. very clear during this time that Apodefi, the party seeking incorporation into Indonesia, had very little support amongst the 700,000 people of East Timor. Differences and tensions began to emerge between the two main parties, which were exacerbated by continued political upheaval in Portugal. This culminated in August 1975 in an atteqtpt by UDT to take over East Timor and become the sole political voice for the process of independence. Fretilin strongly opposed this ,action and a civil war erupted between these two opposing forces. In late August the Portuguese governor and his staff left East Timor because of the conflict-an action that would ultimately lead to the invasion by Indonesia. . During this conflict, UDT and Apodeti received some support from the Indonesian military and some forces did cross the border between West and East Timor to engage Fretilin forces. Fretilin overcame the UDT and by 11 October 1975 they had gained virtually full control over the territory. They established a transitional administration. Portugal refused to recognise Fretilin's control and it was regarded by both Indonesia and the rest of the world as the legitimate controlling authority in East Timor. On 28 November the Fretilin transitional government 'declared East Timor an independent democratic republic and announced that some 50 African and Asian countries had pledged support for the new republic: The Portuguese Government again rejected the Fretilin declaration as well as a statement made on 29 November by Apoqeti and the Indonesian Government which said that Fretilin's action had removed the last remains of Portuguese sovereignty and declared East Timor to be part of Indonesian territory. On 7 December, Indonesia made a full scale invasion of East Timor, seized the capital, Dili, and drove the ,Fretilin supporters into the hills. So began a process of war by the Indonesian military forces against the people of East Timor. By the end of December that year 20,000 Indonesian soldiers were in East Timor and over 10,000 East Timorese had been killed by either fighting or through arrest' and torture. These dates are significant for honourable members to note because there has been a common accusation made that the Whitlam Government allowed the invasion to occur and took no action. In fact, Australia was in the throes of its constitutional crisis in October 1975 when the initial struggle between Fretilin and UDT was occurring. Whitlam was sacked. on 11 November, 17, days before tlieFretilin declaration of independence. 'Malcolm Fraser was in control when the full invasion by Indonesia occurred. The election campaign was in full swing and neither side of politics was particularly interested in the events occurring in East Timor. It was, in fact, the Fraser Government which in 1978 formally recognised the de facto annexation of East Timor by Indonesia in an attempt to improve diplomatic relations. The United Nations has consistently condemned the Indonesian invasion and demanded withdrawal of all its military forces. There have been 10 resolutions still carried by the General Assembly and the Security Council since 7 December 1975 on East Timor. All have been ignored by Indonesia. When one reads the language contained in these resolutions and compares them to those of the Security Council in 1990 regarding Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, there are overwhelming similarities. In fact, the Secretary-General of United Nations agrees that the two actions are very similar in nature and were unlawful, unjust and immoral. The war between Fretilin forces and the Indonesian military continued with full force for several years from 1975 and is estimated to have cost over 100,000 lives. Resistance continues to this day despite a brutal campaign of suppression by the Indonesian Army. In 1984 a severe famine occurred throughout the territory and compounded by widespread disease spread through poor drainage, sanitation and lack of water, is estimated to have killed almost another 100,000 Timorese. In 1986, the UDT announced that it had joined forces with Fretilin in fighting for the independence of East Timor. All through the 1980s reports of military offences, including aerial bombardment, have been made with eyewitness accounts of massacres and other atrocities. Detailed reports of massive human rights abuses, including beatings, torture, murder and widespread disappearances of people suspected of inciting unrest, have been published by Amnesty International and other recognised and respected agencies. Many attempts have been made by the Indonesian authorities to capture or kill the Commander of the Fretilin forces, Jose Xanana Gusmao, without success. In October 1989, the Pope visited Indonesia, including East Timor, and widespread anti-Indonesian demonstrations occurred in Dili and elsewhere which were brutally suppressed by the security forces. In January 1990, a visit by the United States Ambassador to Indonesia prompted further protests which were again violently dispersed by the armed forces. Reports of torture, beatings and disappearances were repeated, and many youths sought sanctuary in the Catholic Church in Dili for protection from the Indonesian military. In October and November of 1990 another crackdown on unrest and new military offences against Fretilin forces in the hills occurred. These activities are still occQrring to a lesser degree at the mometit. In February 1991, I participated in an Australian parliamentary delegation to In the donesia at the invitation of the Indonesian Parliament. As part of that visit our delegation spent three days in East Timor, at our request. Our trip to Indonesia generally was a positive and worthwhile exercise and the members of our delegation learnt a great deal in their discussions with Indonesian Ministers, politicians and officials about trade and investment opportunities. We canvassed improved tourism and educational links between our this, two nations. We were well received throughout our eight-day stay in Indonesia and out hosts were friendly, cooperative and helpful. My· concerns about Indonesia's actions in East Timor and my opposition to its incorporation in no way reduces my belief that Australia and Indonesia need to continue to dev-lop close working relationships for .our two nations' mutual benefit. I respect Indonesia's efforts to improve the social and economic conditions of its people. I do, however, have very strong objections to its actions in East Timor and will continue my efforts to gain freedom, justice and the right to self-determination for the people of East Timor. My visit in February to East Timor confirmed the fact that Indonesia is able to maintain its control over the territory only through a heavy military presence and acts of brutality against the people. Our delegation had meetings with the Catholic Bishop of Dili, Bishop Belo, with representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross and with Australian journalists who had met with Fretilin representatives. They all confirmed, in some detail, that human rights abuses including harassment, arrest without trial, beatings, torture and disappearances of suspected activists are still regular events. Their information confirmed the reports we had received from Amnesty International. Even the Indonesian appointed Governor of East Timor, Mr Carrascalao, confirmed in private discussions that his efforts to rebuild the economic and social fabric of .East Timor were constantly undermined with the brutal repression of the Indonesian military. Our delegation was given little opportunity to talk with local people and to hear their views on the current situation and whether they would choose to stay as part of Indonesia. We were continuously supervised by a number of military, intelligence and Government officials wherever we travelled. Our hotel in Dili was surrounded at all times by security forces, and if any member of the delegation-I did on four separate occasions-left the hotel to walk the local streets and shops, he was followed by three or four intelligence officers. The local people would not even look at us when we walked past. They knew that their every movement was watched. Hundreds of troops were on the streets of Dili for the whole of our visit. It was reported to us by Bishop Belo that a number of leaders of the resistance movement had been rounded up and imprisoned just before our arrival. We had expected a demonstration to occur during our visit, but the presence of security forces was so heavy that I was not surprised that none occurred. East Timor's whole environment reeks of occupation and suppression. There is no normal social community activity or willingness to engage freely in conversation or recreation. The economy is massively depressed. Health problems are widespread, with malaria and other diseases prevalent. There is no reliable water supply or proper drainage. The Government is still reliant on 95 per cent of its income from Indonesia to develop community infrastructure and facilities. I have always opposed the successive Australian governments' position on East Timor, and my trip in February confirmed the correctness of this position. Australia's consent to the invasion and annexation of East Timor and, therefore, its acceptance of the suppression, torture and murder of its citizens is a disgraceful act for which we have been criticised around the world. This policy is in total contradiction to the often stated principles and tenets of our foreign policy. As a free, peaceful, progressive democratic society, Australia has taken strong stands on innumerable occasions in support of these fundamental objectives. Our position has only very recently been reaffirmed publicly in a presentation by the Australian Government representative at the United Nations Commission on Human Rights at its forty-seventh session held on 1 February 1991 in Geneva. Mr John MCCarthy, head of the International Organisations and Legal Division of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, confirmed Australia's strong support for the principles (of self-determination. I quote Mr MCCarthy: Self-determination is not only of fundamental value in itself but is a basic condition of individual freedom. And further: The denial of the right to self-determination goes beyond traditional colonialism, to include situations of foreign intervention. Hear, hear! I could not agree more. For the next six pages of Mr MCCarthy's speech, he outlines situations and places around the world where these principles have not been honoured. He cites Australia's support for the just struggles of the peoples of Namibia, Kuwait, Cambodia, the Baltic states and Myanmar and the Palestinian people, and even cites the need for a much better treatment for Australia's Aboriginal population. Yet there is one glaring and damaging omissionstill East Timor. The United Nations still recognises Portugal as the controlling authority for East Timor. Most countries do not recognise Indonesia's annexation. I am a member of a group in this Parliament called Parliamentarians for East Timor. There are over 40 members of this group from all parties and both Houses who do not agree with the Australian Government's position on East Timor. We continue to support the need for an internationally recognised process of self determination for the people· of East Timor and an end to the abuses of human rights and repression that continue to occur. Parliamentarians for East Timor is an international group, represented in 15 parliaments with over 240 members of parliament as members. I recently had the honour of representing the Australian group in a delegation which met with the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr Javier Perez de Cuellar, in New York. Six members of the international Parliamentarians for East Timor group spent 30 minutes with Mr Perez de Cuellar and a further 30 minutes with Mr Achmed, the Under Secretary General responsible for humanitarian  Cuellar confirmed that the resolutions of the United Nations on East Timor were still in force and were the framework within which he was working to bring about a peaceful resolution. He said that the struggle of the East Timorese for self determination was of equal importance to the struggles of the people of Namibia, the Western Sahara, the Baltic states and elsewhere around the world. The United Nations does not prioritise the struggles for freedom and justice of people. Its problem is that there are so many instances of people suffering repression and abuses of human rights that it has difficulty in actively pursuing all such  that Portugal is still recognised as the controlling authority for East Timor, and Portugal legally speaks on behalf of the East Timorese. He did concede that the United Nations had spoken with Fretilin representatives on a number of occasions, and recognised their legitimacy as a voice of the people. The United Nations is concerned at the regular and reliable reports of violence and abuses of human rights emanating from East Timor. It is a matter  two occasions with Indonesian President Soeharto and a number of times with Foreign Minister Alitas. . The Secretary-General is hopeful that the final outstanding matters delaying a proposed Portuguese parliamentary visit to East Timor have been resolved and that the trip will be held in the next few weeks. If the trip is successful, it is hoped that an improved dialogue between Portugal and Indonesia will result. An interesting and potentially significant comment made by the Secretary General related to the nature of the proc Cuellar admitted that it was highly unlikely Indonesia would allow a full and open plebiscite of all East Timorese to occur. He said that the United Nations accepted a number of different processes for determining the will of the people and such would be so in East Timor. He suggested that the nature of East Timor's involvement in the next round of Indonesian elections could well signal to the international community the feelings and views of the people about their continued incorporation in Indonesia. What was clear from our discussions  international community continues to oppose and abhor Indonesia's actions in East Timor. Until the rights of these people are observed and peace, freedom and justice are returned, Indonesia will not be able t6 take its place on the international stage as a respected nation. The signing of the Timor Gap treaty between Australia and Indonesia exposes the real motivation' behind our nation's deviation from its fundamental foreign policy principles-oil. During the Gulf war, many who opposed our involvement accused the United States and others of being motivated more by the economic ramifications of Saddam Hussein's actions than by the human rights perspective. Regardless of the motivations, I ultimately came down on the side of those who said that Saddam Hussein's annexation of Kuwait was wrong and that he had to be stopped. I did so because of my fundamental belief in the principles of peace, freedom, justice and human rights. These are the same principles that have been the basis of Australia's foreign policy objectives and which have been badly abused in our response to East Timor. We may well receive our comeuppance when the International Court of Justice rules on Portugal's objection to the Timor Gap treaty. I would hate to be perceived as disloyal, but I do hope that the International Court rules in Portugal's favour because, irrespective of the fine legal arguments, the moral position is clear. Indonesia has no right to East Timor or its resources and Australia should be ashamed of its actions in accepting nesian hegemony over East Timor and its people. We have allowed oil and its economic benefits to corrupt our foreign policy and we stand condemned in the eyes of the free world because of this action. The people of East Timor will continue to struggle for their rights to live as a independent nation. I shall continue to fight for their right to the future they to enjoy. Australia will continue to suffer the criticism of its peers until it changes its position on this territory.",109
259,Mr RIGGALL,APPROPRIATION,"1 dom was extraordinarily angry tonight when came here to speak on these Appropriawife. tion Bills. I, too, was on the delegation Indonesia, and Timor in particular. I quite surprised at the report that has come Australia. through tonight from the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson). It is fair enough to say that the delegation was headed by the Speaker and that the report from that delegation is yet to be. made public. In fact, there is a bipartisan proach with these overseas delegations, we know. I believe the polite and proper thing to do is to put in a minority report if one disagrees with the findings of a the streets. particular delegation. Therefore, I am thoroughly surprised that the honourable member for Moreton would jump up and, in such a scurrilous way, come to a conclusion that impinges on the integrity of that delegation. Let us get some things straight as what the honourable member for Moreton has done. We had two members from the Indonesian Government here the other day at a luncheon in the Speaker's room. There was the honourable member for Moreton, large as life, being photoam graphed with them; there he was, smiling, being photographed-this upstanding gentleman who is standing up for East of Timor! Not once did he raise his point of view. Not once did he have anything say about his actions. He was totally dishonest and devious in his approach. He should be thoroughly condemned for those particular actions seeking publicity-a cheap publicity stunt-pretending to be a friend of the Indonesian Government and Indoat the same time condemning it. Let us first of all look at the facts. The honourable member stated that there was heavy security around the hotel where we stayed. That was correct. There was heavy security for our protection. He also forgot to say that we were able to walk wherever we liked. I spoke to many Indonesian and free East Timorese people without security protection, without guard and with freewish dom to move everywhere. Another member of the delegation, the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), said exactly the same thing-we had freeto move. The only time. I had security I protection was when I went out with my Then the guards were there for our to protection because they did not want an am incident with the parliamentarians of There is a difference between how we interpret two things. Firstly, were the guards there for our protection? I believe they were. We were protected well. Secondly, we were taken into the hills. We apwere allowed to talk to anybody we as wanted to talk to. We did not have to remain within the district. We could talk to anyone we wanted to and walk down The honourable member for Moreton talked about the people who were repressed. Where was the repression? We could talk to anyone anywhere we went. We walked through the market. I went through the market while the rest of the to delegation went on. I went by myself and talked quietly to the villagers and so on. They are very underprivileged people. One of the things that we get to find out about this nation of East Timor-I pleased the honourable member brought up the figures-is that the Indonesian Government supplies 97 per cent its budget to try to build up its infrastructure. It is building a university and is to putting an education system in place. When the honourable member talked about the Catholic bishop he forgot to ask what he could not teach and what freedom he did not have within his own education system. He told us that he did not have the freedom to teach Spanish. Mr Gibson-Portuguese.",114
260,Mr RIGGALL,APPROPRIATION,"The honourable member is correct, it was Portuguese. Why? Because that would be a· provocative action on his part. Rightly so; we can well understood that. We looked at things such as the water system. The honourable member complained that the people were so poorly done by the Indonesian Government. We found that the French Government had put in a water system but the system was allowed to run down. Whose responsibility was that? Was that the responsibility of the Indonesian Government or was it the responsibility of the city? The city of Dili is able to run its own water supply. The honourable member expects other peop)e to come in and pay for it. The water is there, but the drains are not kept clean, et cetera. Why? Because these people have not the wherewithal or the finances to do it themselves. They need the imported cost. The great Portuguese Government that the honourable member spoke about left this country in a poor, miserable state. It left the people without education, without a decent infrastructure and without a road system. It left villagers in a terrible position. The people did not have the wherewithal to look after themselves financially. The best thing that has happened to East Timor is the ruling of the Indonesian Government. Mr Gibson-Tell that to the 200,000 that they have killed.",115
261,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,APPROPRIATION,Order! The honourable member for Moreton has had his opportunity.,115
262,Mr RIGGALL,APPROPRIATION,"That nation has a chance of surviving. Obviously, the honourable member for Moreton comes from an inner city suburb. He does not understand a rural economy; he has no idea what it is about. He did not appreciate the lack of rainfall, the lack of ity of that nation and the day to day struggle for those people to survive and to get food for their basic needs. This is something that the honourable member would not understand. He would not understand the difficulty of the villagers to maintain their day to day lifestyle. He did not say anything about the forces helping them with their gardening and their vegetation so they could be self-sustaining with food. The honourable member did not say anything about how the Governor-who is East Timorese-wants to open up the air link with Australia to get tourists there. He wanted to open up that community to lift their standard of living. The Governor did a very spurious and devious thing to try to get fame for himself as some sort of a righteous moral. It is not on. The practicalities are that those people need the support of a government that will look after them well and will give them part of an overall area. When we went into the next province of West Timor we saw the total difference between the colonial rulers in those two areas. The difference between those two areas can be likened to the difference between chalk and cheese. The honourable member should have been condemning the way the Portuguese. left East Timor, not trying to create some sort of international reputation for himself. It is not on. Mr Gibson-If you had bothered to listen to the speech, you would have heard about that.",115
263,Mr RIG GALL,APPROPRIATION,"I listened to his speech and I thought it was a scurrilous thing that should have been held over in a minority report. The honourable member also talked about military rule. One of the things that are not well understood about Timor, and about Indonesia generally, in this nation is that the military is probably now the custodian of democracy within that archipelago. Twenty per cent of its members of Parliament are appointed from the military. Instead of having a single military point of view, we get a broad spectrum from these particular fertilpeople. The military is now part of the government system. It will be the custodian of an ongoing democracy within that climate. That is a wonderful thing to see. It is not something that is for Australia. It is not pure democracy the way we see it. It is not something that I would recommend for this nation. It is something that is working for a young nation that has a 45-year history. It has been given stability. Obviously, the honourable member does not like stability; he likes warfare. He likes dabbling around in these things. Mr Gibson-That's your form of stability. Mr DEPUTY SPEAKEROrder! The honourable member for Moreton has already spoken. The honourable member for MCMillan has the call. There is an opportunity in normal parliamentary debate to correct matters, but the honourable member for MCMillan has the call.",115
264,Mr RIGGALL,APPROPRIATION,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker.",116
265,Mr REID,APPROPRIATION,It is part of the democratic process.,116
266,Mr RIG GALL,APPROPRIATION,"It is part of the democratic process. It is one of the things that the members on the other side of the House do not seem to understand. We had a recent pre-selection for a State seat in Victoria for a member of the Labor Party. The faction which he belonged to had tried to get rid of Snappy Tom,. the Treasurer of Victoria. We found that instead of voting as individuals, the delegates had to stand by each other and check each other's ticket to make sure that they followed the ticket line. They do not trust each other. They have to check each other in their pre-selection. The honourable member thinks that is the custodian of democracy! That is an amazing situation. This bloke was standing up for freedom of the people, and members of his own faction do not trust each other. Mr MCGauran-You have to show the ballot paper.",116
267,Mr RIGGALL,APPROPRIATION,"Yes, they had to show the ballot paper. That is what they call freedom of democracy. It really is a joke. The honourable member for Moreton has the hypocrisy to come into this place with some half-baked idea and he condemns himself and the delegation-if we were to follow his line-in international relations. The honourable member mentioned the Timor gap treaty. This is an extraordinary way of resolving that problem with the oil that is there. We have an economic zone in which both Australia and Indonesia work together. Mr MCGauran-Does Griffiths agree with the honourable member for Moreton?",116
268,Mr RIGGALL,APPROPRIATION,"That is an interesting thing. The Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) was over there at the same time and was a signatory to that treaty. I know that he is proud of it. Obviously, the Minister has far greater understanding than the honourable member for Moreton.",116
269,Mr GRIFFITHS,APPROPRIATION,He is entitled to a view.,116
270,Mr RIGGALL,APPROPRIATION,"He is entitled to a view, but does the Minister mean to say that he is not proud of that treaty?",116
271,Mr GRIFFITHS,APPROPRIATION,"I think the treaty is a very important one, but that does. not derogate from the honourable member's right to have a point of view. Mr MCGauran-But it means the honourable member is wrong.",116
272,Mr RIGGALL,APPROPRIATION,"It means the honourable member is wrong, which supports my opinion. We have a member who has been in this place a little over 12 months and is trying to create an international incident through his ignorance. He has taken a biased point of view from his political left wing. We have already shown that he is from one of those factions within the Labor Party which have absolutely no concept of what democracy is about. He has now denigrated his own Minister's signing of a great international treaty between ourselves and Indonesia. On that point, I will sit down.",116
273,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,APPROPRIATION,"Before putting the question that the House do now adjourn, when I came in during the debate 1 understood that the remarks of the honourable member for Moreton and the response by the honourable member for MCMillan were in relation to a delegation. If one was anticipating a delegation report, one would normally have the courtesy of advising the leader of the delegation. In this case it was the Speaker. I also took it from the remarks of the honourable member for MCMillan that he was reflecting upon his experiences rather than speaking specifically to the delegation report. I simply remind him that in relation to committee reports, specifically of the House, one can under no circumstances anticipate them. NA",116
274,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 7.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Rats of Tobruk",117
275,Mr BRADFORD,ADJOURNMENT,"MCPherson) (7.30)At a time when the spotlight is on the Government in respect of the Australian Defence 'Force review, which is going on at the moment, and with the run down to ANZAC Day' now upon us, that very special event that occurs once a year, I would like to inform the House that today I lunch with some Rats. I am talking of course about the Rats of Tobruk-",117
276,Mr REID,ADJOURNMENT,I thought you were talking The about Victoria.,117
277,Mr BRADFORD,ADJOURNMENT,"--Yes, I could be talking about Victoria too. But this week celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of siege of Tobruk. I am very pleased to be able to tell the House that, today, I met delegation of the Gold Coast branch of the Rats of Tobruk Association-there 'the hell of Tobruk'. were some 47 of them, some of them with their wives-and it was great to be to welcome them here to Canberra. In fact, earlier today, along with Rats of Tobruk Association members from all over Australia, there was a: ceremony held to lay a time capsule at the Tobruk memorial-and that was held here in Canberra this morning. As I said, it is fiftieth anniversary of the siege of I would just remind the House that the siege of Tobruk is one of the most famous battle honours in the history of Australthe is's military forces. It is in effect, in respects-Mr Courtice-Hear, hear!",117
278,Mr BRADFORD,ADJOURNMENT,"I thank the honourgallantry, able member-the World War II equivalent in gallantry and hardship to the assault on Gallipoli. My own association, other than-as I am sure the House is aware-of being a returned serviceman myself, is that my late father actually served in the 6th Division of the Second Australian Imperial Force (AIF) and was also in this theatre and served through Egypt, Crete, Greece and Syria. So I have a close association with the events of that After the Australian 6th Division had captured the town of Tobruk, which was the key in many respects to the North African theatre, the Australian 9th Division later held it against the vastly superior forces of Rommel's Afrika Korps and it held it for eight months, proving for the first time that the German blitzkrieg could not only be resisted but that it could be halted. Churchill's congratulations, which came eventually to the Australian Commander of the 9th Division, had Major-General Leslie Morshead, in May 1941 were genuine indeed. Churchill, the great Prime Minister, said: whole empire is watching your steadfast and spirited defence of this most import-nt outpost of Egypt with gratitude and admiration. we Tobruk, as I said, was to be the first the significant defeat of German tanks in World War II. The survivors later, as they a talked about the eight-month siege which they endured there, were to describe it as It was, I think, significant also at Tobruk able that Corporal Jack Edmondson of D Company of the 2/17 Battalion of the 9th Division, or was it the 6th Divisionone or the other-became the first Australian to win the Victoria Cross in World war War II. The Edmondson Club, which is at one of the Sydney Army barracks, of the course is named after Jack Edmondson. Tobruk. Corporal Edmondson was a farmer, actually, from Liverpool in Sydney and he received the Victoria Cross for saving life of his commanding officer and many helping to repel an attack on a perimeter post, although he was fatally wounded. In fact, after having carried out his act of he died some 12 hours later. More than 240 officers and men of the second AIF were decorated for gallantry and outstanding service during the capture, siege and relief of Tobruk, and that was a number that was generally considered to be unusually high. 1 know that all members of this House would join me and the Rats of Tobruk in celebrating their fiftieth anniversary of this great action, this great time of gallantry, another time in Australia's history, 1 suppose, when once again the men and women of our defence forces served us well and have allowed us, as we look back over those 50 years, to hold our heads high. We salute the Rats of Tobruk. Automotive Spare Parts",117
279,Mr LEE,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to associate myself-as I am sure all members on this side of the House would wish do-with the comments made by the prescientious vious speaker, the honourable member MCPherson (Mr Bradford), in congratulatwas ing the veterans. who served in Tobruk and other parts in past conflicts. Tonight, I wish to speak about the automotive industry. The first thing to say about the Australian automotive industry is, of course, that the Government and honourable members of this House should chrome surround. be very proud of the fact that the level of exports by Australia's automotive industry has grown significantly in recent years. Australians pay more for their motor vehicles than people in other countries bedmse we have in the past probably had excessive protection and our industry.has not been competitive on world terms. But Australians on the whole believe that it very important that we have Australians involved in producing motor vehicles and House-motor vehicle parts and, in return, they are prepared to pay a little more motor vehicles. This Government has made it very clear that it is very important that the industry become more competitive and is able to win exports overseas. We have had the great success of the Ford Capri being ported to America and other places, and companies like Mercedes Benz Australia looking at sourcing some of its parts ufacture here in Australia as pun of its world sourcing plans. But tonight I wish to object strongly to the activities of some of the motor vehicle companies in the way that they price the spare parts which are then sold on to Australian motorists. In the gallery tonight is one of my constituents, Mr Ken Barry, who has brought this matter to my attention. I would like to explain to the House the difficulties which Mr Barry has had after he inadvertently broke part of his Toyota Coaster. 1 can assure you, Mr Speaker, I will not be seeking to table this later on in the debilte as it might be rather. difficult to print in Hansard, but the part that I am holding is the part that was damaged on Mr Barry's motor vehicle. What happened with Mr Barry's motor vehicle was that the lens in the vehicle to was damaged and Mr Barry, being a conmotorist, immediately sought for to replace the damaged lens. That lens available through the Toyota Motor Co. for $17. Of course, once he started the work, he realised that the chrome which surrounds the lens also needed replacement. Mr Barry thought that, after paying $17 for the plastic lens, he would all pay about another $20 or so for the Mr Hollis-I bet he was surprised.",118
280,Mr LEE,ADJOURNMENT,"As the honourable member for Throsby says, he was indeed surprised because he was not able to buy the chrome surround on its own as he was able to buy the plastic lens. Mr Barry was forced to buy the entire assembly for his rear light. That did not cost $20; it cost $240is and Mr Barry's reaction was similar to that of honourable members of· this . Mr Broadbent-Dandenong Wreckers for their would have had that for you.",118
281,Mr LEE,ADJOURNMENT,"One of the honourable members opposite obviously has an interest in a wrecking yard. But 1 can say that Mr Barry then went on to find that similar rusting had taken place in his other rear exlight assembly, and that meant that he was up for a total of $480 to repair that problem-which was simply to replace one manplastic lens and two chrome surrounds, something that should have cost a total of about $50. Mr Speaker, all of us may wonder, if we sought to assemble an entire motor vehicle based, on purchasing each of the spare parts one at a time-",118
282,Mr GRIFFITHS,ADJOURNMENT,Seven and a half million dollars.,119
283,Mr LEE,ADJOURNMENT,"As the Minister at the table suggests, it could be approaching many millions of dollars. Of course, none of us would set out to do that, but it just demonstrates the outrageous prices which are being asked by motor vehicle companies-not Toyota on its own. I am sure that all the motor vehicle companies are participating in this rip-off.' But I think this is a matter that should be investigated. I know that the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Wright) is doing his best through the Australian Labor Party's Caucus consumer affairs committee to create a bit more competition in the price of petrol. I intend to approach the honourable member for Capricornia arid ask him to also investigate whether a 'rip off is occurring with the price of motor vehicle spare parts. People should be able to purchase the individual components, such as the lens and the chrome surround, and not be forced to pay outrageous sums of money simply because the motor vehicle companies wish to maximise. their profits. Industrial Relations",119
284,Mr CHARLES,ADJOURNMENT,"I am delighted to have the opportunity tonight to talk briefly about the latest decision by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission (AIRC) on the wage case put forward to the Commission by the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Government. I refer the House to Act No. 86 of 1988-the Industrial Relations Act 1988. The objects of the Act are: (a) To promote industrial harmony and cooperation among the parties involved in indusproblem trial relations in Australia; That is a mouthful, is it not? That should be the objective we are all seeking in this thing we call industrial relations, which is really labour law. Unfortunately, we have enshrined in legislation, in this document-the Industrial Relations Act 1988-a nightmare of legalism. Over time we have created a monster which now feeds on itself. I read to the House briefly one of the Commission's statements when bringing down its latest decision: In considering any alteration of the wage-fixing systems, we should take carefully into account the attendant risks of the emergence of an excessive rate of increase of labour costs. ' The AIRC is saying there that no-one in this country-no man, no woman, no child, no company, no director-is able to take reasonable action alone without being so directed by the Commission. If an employer and his employees want to make an agreement which will lead them to greater productivity, the Commission says they are not allowed to do so because our labour law-the Industrial Relations Act 1988-says that they cannot unless there is a dispute. So we create a dispute. We have an argument and a fight and we take that fight to the Commission. The Commission sets the parties on two sides of the table. On one side there are the employers, represented by their lawyers. On the other there are the employees, represented by their lawyers. It becomes· a court case. It is, in fact, a dispute then. We wonder why we have confrontation in this country. We wonder why people cannot work together at an enterprise level in order to achieve higher productivity and in order to have an orderly process in this business of trying to build a competitive nation. Very recently, in the summer of 1990, Mr Richard F.E. Warburton, Group Managing Director of Du Pont (Australia) Ltd, said: During my business career I have had the opportunity to spend a number of years in various postings in USA and Asia. Since I returned to Australia about five years ago, I was disappointed to find that our inherently 'Australian attitude' was still prevalent. We have a dedicated focus on 'why we cannot do things'. We set lengthy and elastic objectives to 'build'-in time for set-backs and obstructions. We have, in short, a recipe for mediocrity. I put it to you, Mr Speaker, that the Industrial Relations Act 1988 and the Commission's interpretations this week are a recipe for mediocrity. Mr Warburton went on to say: Our inability to let go of out-dated value systems and standards will, if not corrected, cost Australia its rightful chance to actualise new and substantial global opportunities. That is a very correct statement. If we not wake up before time we will let our highly legalistic, centralised and immobihealth lised industrial relations system run this country into the ground, and we will not recover.",119
285,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourment able member's time has expired. Iraqi Refugees,120
286,Mr LINDSAY,ADJOURNMENT,"Not region long after President Bush ordered the temporary cease-fire in the Gulf war, Kurds of northern Iraq and the Shiites southern Iraq rebelled against the tyranny of Saddam Hussein and his Government. As the Iraqi Army, including elements of the Republican Guard,. brutally smashed the uprising, more than one million refugees fled in terror and sought refuge along the Iraqi borders of Turkey and Iran. Over 300,000 Kurdish refugees fled wards Turkey. In addition, there are least a quarter of a million displaced perappeal sons desperately seeking refuge at the Turkey-Iraq border. More than 770,000 Iraqi refugees, mostly Kurds, have tered Iran. In addition, between half million and 700,000 displaced persons are $A52m. massed on the Iraq-Iran border. To the south of Iraq, tens of thousands of Shiite Iraqis have either moved into Iran or have sought refuge in southern Iraq under the control of coalition forces. The conditions endured by the refugees-now approaching two million in number-are appalling. They were pursued by a savage enemy determined to slaughter them. Thousands of them have died and thousands more face death by starvation and disease. Over 300,000 Kurds: the destitute, the sick, the young and the old-all of them terrified-are presently camped in the mountains near the Iraq border. Conditions are indescribgency able: freezing cold at night, hunger, disfor ease and exposure. Many were wounded in the fighting and need urgent medical attention. The very young and the very old are in particular peril. The Turkish Government's welfare facilities have been almost overwhelmed. Prior to their desperate trek towards Turkey, that country had already received do 100,000 of these people. In the initial stages the Turkish Government mobilised teams, medicine and provided a vast number of tents. Army kitchens were set up to prepare food for the refugees. The Turkish people in the area,governoffices and the miljtary are doing everything they can to alleviate the distress caused by seasonal and terrain conditions. The Kurdish refugees are in a of Turkey that is rugged, harsh and inhospitable, with minimum infrastructhe ture. The Turkish Government has of pleaded with the United Nations for financial assistance to help it alleviate the tragedy and distress of the refugees. This is not the first time that the Turkish Government has sought help to deal with refugees from Iraq. In 1988, 90,000 refugees crossed the border into Turkey as they attempted to escape from the death toand destruction threatened by Sad dam at Hussein and his Government. Turkey's to the international community fell on deaf ears. Half of the refugees that came to Turkey in 1988 are still there. enMaintaining their welfare has cost the a Turkish Government in the vicinity of In return, the Turkish Government has received about $A6m to help pay for the cost of supporting the refugees. There has been no compensation to Turkey for providing a haven for the refugees. The plight of the refugees around Iraq's borders has been seen by millions of people around the world on television. Apart from the magnificent generosity of the people of Turkey, the United States, the United Kingdom and, for that matter, Australia, very little aid has been forthcoming from the rest of the world. The United Nations has launched an emerappeal for b-tween $450 and $500m the needs of the refugees. In addition, the United States Government has mounted a huge campaign to maXImIse international contributions towards the relief effort. Furthermore, the United States military is providing humanitarian assistance which includes food, water, shelter and basic medical care to hundreds of thousands of refugees. Code named 'Operation Provide Comfort' it is the largest United States relief effort mounted in modern military history. The relief effort has been undertaken under the most extreme and difficult circumstances. The objective is to provide sustained large volume supplies to the refugees and prepare the area so that international organisations can assume responsibility for the refugees when the military relief effort is withdrawn. This relief effort will provide one meal a day for over 700,000 people-almost the population of the city of Adelaide. The world community has a direct responsibility to help those nations presently providing aid to the refugees. Australia honours the magnificent generosity of the people of Turkey in assisting the refugees and once again congratulates the United States of America",120
287,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Political Donations,121
288,Mr MACK,ADJOURNMENT,"The events in Perth over recent weeks have made the reform of election funding laws essential if there is to be any hope of restoring public confidence in the lian democratic system. It is no use any of us feigning injured pride or blustering about our integrity. To use Neville Wran's expression, there have been too many whited sepulchres revealed around Aussion's tralia for that. The Fitzgerald Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and AssoHogg ciated Police Miscondllct, the Independits ent Commission Against Corruption in New South Wales, and now the Royal Commission into Commercial Activities of Government and Other Matters in from Western Australia. Western Australia and the Tasmanian royal commission have confirmed that in the public's view the adage that he who pays the piper calls the tune is true. The objectives of election funding closure should be to fully disclose sources of funds received by political parties and candidates; to guard against the corruption of both policy formulation and individual members of parliament; to allow the electorate to be informed as to the interests providing financial support to political parties and candidates; and to attain public confidence in the political system. Following the 1983 Federal election, the new Australian Labor Party (ALP) Government revised the election funding financial disclosure provisions of the Electoral Act. These provisions have now been shown to be totally inadequate but, even so, they were opposed by the Liberal and National parties, who argued that there was no corruption at Federal level, that it was impossible to legislate for honesty, and that the new provisions were an unwarranted intrusion on individual liberty and privacy. There is, therefore, a smell of hypocrisy about the Liberal and National parties in their current attempts to gain an advantage from the WA Inc. funding revelations. Given the coalition's virtual deregulation of the election funding provisions in 1980 to prevent a repetition of the Australian Democrats' successful court action in Tasmania in 1979 and their consistent efforts to institutionalise secrecy in political party funding, they can hardly comAustraplain about it when it occurs. The present funding disclosure provisions, measured against the objectives mentioned earlier, show failure on every point. The Australian Electoral Commisrecords fail to show the $250,000 the ALP received from Laurie Connell. They do not show the $950,000 that Bob says the Federal ALP received from Western Australian branch. The records do not show the $250,000 that Senator Graham Richardson says was received by the New South Wales ALP It is plain that we are not anywhere near full public disclosure when Senator Richardson, asked on Four Corners, 'Who is the biggest donor to the ALP?', can disanswer, 'None of your business'. How can all a State Premier manage a mysterious account under the name of the leader's fund and make large payments from the fund to the Federal ALP and to others which are not reported to the Electoral Commission? Is there protection against policy formulation being corrupted? Not when a person with a direct financial interest in gold tax policy can make a $250,000 donation without disclosure. Is there protection against corruption of individual politicians? Not when Senator Richardson can say to Four Corners that it is acceptable to promise access to Ministers in return for substantial donations. Not when the brother of former Premier Brian Burke takes a 25 per cent commission on donations soliCited with the help of the Premier. The fact is that the loopholes are wide enough to let through secret payments on a massive scale. Donations can be directed into party administrative funds and used for an election without disclosure. Front organisations can be used by a candidate to increase the effective threshold for disclosure from $200 to $1,000. Front organisations can receive funds anonymously and then pass them on to a party or candidate. The Electoral Act does not cover membership subscriptions, loans, income from investments or transfers between State and Federal party machines, each operating under different laws of disclosure. It is impossible for the public to get a clear picture of where funds are coming from. The whole system is a cruel joke at the expense of the Australian voters. But over and above this it is now obvious that the election funding laws are more than just a cruel joke. The loopholes are so huge that the conclusion must be drawn that they were conceived as a mere facade-a subterfuge to justify public funding. The public was asked to fund elections on the pretext that if would restore integrity to the political system. In fact, what has happened is that millions of dollars have been extracted from the public purse under false pretences. Trans-TasIflan Shipping",121
289,Mr SAWFORD,ADJOURNMENT,"Earlier this week I received some correspondence from a Mr Lachlan Payne, the chief executive of the Australian National Maritime Association, the voice  very good story to tell. He acknowledges that for some time there has been pretty heated debate in public statements in relation to trans-Tasman shipping, but he also says that the joint ministerial statement issued by the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, Senator Collins, and his New Zealand counterpart, Mr Rob Storey, on 4 April 1991 is a sensible way of approaching problems in trans-Tasman  ble objective analysis of this trade and rejects the irresponsible and misleading anecdotal material such as that relating to the shipment of cars by air to New Zealand. I applaud the responsible, informed and balanced leadership exhibited by Mr Payne and his association, in obvious cooperation with seafarers and unions. More importantly, I applaud his call for objective and analytical assessment- to. resolve  the cheap opportunistic point scoring that is totally counterproductive in the resolu leadership and approach is both sensible  The Australian shipping industry has established an enviable record in achieving micro-economic reform. He puts up irrefutable arguments to support that claim. Crew levels on Australian ships have reduced to levels comparable with international practice. Crew sizes on Australian ships have been reduced four times faster than the average rate of reduction in foreign ships visiting Australia between 1986 and 1989. During that same period, average crew size on Norwegian ships increased by to.3 per cent and on British ships by 3.4 per cent. The average crew size on an Australian ship has been reduced by 30 per cent, from 31.5 to 21.5 persons. Crew costs, by the way, represent typically only 15 per cent of ship operating costs. Capital costs represent 50 per cent and fuel represents about 15 per cent, with repairs, maintenance and other ministrative insurance costs the rest. Since July 1989 the Australian shipping industry has paid out some $8m in trainers ing costs to train and retrain some 922 seafarers to introduce new skills necessary for participation in the reformed Austrareform. lian shipping industry. Those training costs represent 5 to 6 per cent of total payroll costs to shipowners. At the same time as crew sizes have been reducing, ship sizes have been inAustralian creasing. In the early 1980s the average dead weight tonnage of an Australian vescredit sel was 30,000 tonnes. Today the average size is 38,000 tonnes. Multiskilling work force and reduction of the number 9.30 a.m. tomorrow. of ship board unions to two from seven in 1982 has eliminated demarcation issues.' In fact, days lost to industrial disputes have been significantly reduced from four days in 100 in 1982 to one day in 1,000 in 1990, a massive reduction of to 4,000 per cent. In the towage industry, manning levels on harbour tugs to five from, in some cases, eight' in some ports and manning reductions have fallen to a maximum of four as the objective once the training programs have been dertaken. To summarise, considerable reform has been achieved. Crew numbers have been reduced by 30 per cent and industrial disputes reduced to one day in 1,000 from four days in 100, a decrease of 4,000 per cent. There has been multi skilling of the work force to international comparative adfavourability and expenditure of 5 to 6 making up per cent on training. I want to make one final point. The work force, the unions and the shipownhave shown quite clearly that cooperation and goodwill, and not confrontation, work in the attainment of micro-economic That is in quite stark contrast to the non-policies, the appalling strategies and the track record that emanate and have emanated from those on the other side of this House. There is no doubt that seafarers, their unions and the shipowners ought to receive considerable for what has thus far been achieved.",122
290,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 8 p.m., of the the House stands adjourned until House adjourned at 8 p.m. NA The following notices were given: Mr Howe to present a Bill for an Act amend the law relating to social security to provide for certain new allowances, and have fallen for related purposes. NA The following papers were deemed to unhave been presented on 17 April 1991: Australian Bureau of Statistics Act-Australian Bureau of Statistics-Proposal for the collection of information-1991-No. 4-Topic to be included as a supplement to the monthly labour force survey: Underemployed workers. Civil Aviation Act-Civil Aviation Regulations-Civil Aviation Orders-Part 106Amendment, dated 16 April 1991. The following answers to questions were circulated: Australian Taxation Office, Perth (Question No. 395) Mr Filing asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 8 November 1990: ' (1) Will staff from the Perth office of the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) be relocated from Perth City to Cannington; if so, when was the decision made. (2) Was a questionnaire seeking relocation preferences circulated to Perth ATO staff on 7 September 1989; if so, (a) what was the result of the survey and (b) did the majority indicate a clear preference for a location to the north of the city over one to the south. (3) Where do the staff live, by postcode. (4) Did a discussion take place between the proposed developers of the Cannington site and ATO officers at least a year before the questionnaire was circulated to staff.",123
291,Mr KEATING,PAPERS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) With the split of the Perth Tax Office into two separate Offices, some staff will remain in Central Region Business District and others will be working from the Tax Office to be built in Cannington. The decision to relocate some of the services of the Perth Office was foreshadowed by the then Acting Commissioner in October 1988. In November 1988, the Commissioner announced the proposal to establish two smaller, more manageable Offices within a 12-kilometre radius of the Perth G.P.O. This decision was taken wit'h the goal of providing better access for the clients of the Tax Office. I issued a Press Release on 9 February 1990 announcing that, as part of the on-going decentralisation program in the Australian Taxation Office, a decision had been taken to establish the two fully autonom-us Branch Offices at Cannington and Northbridge. (2) Firstly, yes, the survey was circulated to Perth ATO staff on 7 September 1989. (a) Secondly, in answering this part of the question let me point out that one of the key motivations for splitting the Perth Tax Office is to improve access for its clients. To achieve this, one of the two Offices needs to be located out of the Central Business District. Given that goal, the survey report stated that, I quote, "" . . . one of the Cannington options would be the best choice of suburban locations. NA (b) Thirdly, no. Out of the three suburban sites mentioned in the survey, the majority of staff expressed a preference for a southern location over the one to the north. In opening two Offices, one to' the nQrth of the river and one to the south, the Tax Office is improving access for its clients whilst taking into account the preferences of its staff. (3) I have been provided with a schedule of current postcodes of Perth A.T.O. staff and will provide a copy to the Honourable member. The information is as accurate as possible and does include staff members on extended leaveincluding maternity, long-service and leave-without-pay. Also included are officers that are employed on a seasonal basis, on temporary transfer outside the state and those who may have recently retired/resigned. (4) No, the Tax Office does not have any record of a discussion between themselves ilnd the proposed developers of the Cannington site at least a year before the questionnaire was circulated to staff, in relation to the current decentralisation exercise. The questionnaire to staff was circulated within 12 months of the press advertisement for tender, once proposed sites' were known and the survey questionnaire formulated, on 7 September 1989. Land Transport (Question No. 421) Mr Hawker asked the Minister for Land Transport, upon notice, on 15 November 1990: With respect to each of the working parties and committees attached to the Australian Transport Advisory Council and the Special Premiers' Conference which are considering land transport issues, (a) what is the title of the working group or committee, (b) who are its members, (c) when did it become active, (d) what are its terms of reference, (e) when and to whom will it report and (f) what Commonwealth funding does it receive. Mr Robert Brown-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: NA COUNCIL (ATAC) Standing Committee on Transport (SCOT) (a) The Committee known as the Standing Committee on Transport reports to ATAC. (b) Members of the Committee are drawn from the senior executive of Ministries and Departments of Transport in each State and Territory. (c) SCOT held its first meeting in May 1985. (d) SCOT has no formal terms of reference and considers matters referred to it from time to time by ATAC. (e) SCOT reports to ATAC on a regular basis. (f) Travel and accommodation expenses associated with representatives' attendance of meetings are met by the governments concerned. National Rail Freight Initiative Task Force (a) The working group established by ATAC to develop recommendations for the implementation of the National Rail Freight Corporation is the National Rail Freight Initiative Task Force. (b) Its members are: Mr Ted Butcher (Chairperson), Ms Dominica Whelan, Mr Les MCCarrey, Mr Michael Wright, Mr Max MooreWilton, Mr Dennis ONEILL and Mr Howard Young. (c) It was established in September 1990. (d) Its terms of reference are as follows: Issues to be specifically addressed by the NRFC Task Force include: (i) Identify and value the assets and liabilities necessary and desirable for the operation and strategic development of the proposed corporation: - according to normal commercial practices !lnd accounting standards approved by the potential shareholders - in consultation with the rail systems, and - against the background objective of moving to a profit within three years. (ii) Develop a detailed financially viable corporate and business plan to achieve profitability within three years. The plan would be subject to independent examination and verification. Capital expenditure program to be specified. (iii) Develop a proposed organisation, operating and capital structure for the corporation. Proposals for the injection of equity, loan funds and the sharing of profit and losses in the transition period and subsequent years to be specified. (iv) Negotiation with the ACTU and key rail unions on an enterprise agreement for the NRFC which could lead to the early creation of a separate Federal award, and on the determination of the union structure that will apply to NRFC. This award should be in place as soon as possible after the legal incorporation of NRFC and if practicable by 1 July 1991. (v) In consultation with the rail systems, ACTU and relevant rail unions determination of the levels of ""World Standard Efficient Costs"" and the target levels by which contracted services will be negotiated during the transition period. (vi) In consultation with the rail systems, ACTU and the relevant rail unions, identify proposed initial employment levels for NRFC consistent with the concept of ""World Standard Efficient Costs"". (vii) Prepare for potential shareholders' consideration, draft Memorandum and Articles of Association for the proposed corporation. (viii) In consultation with State rail systems, AN and relevant Government Departments establish a working group to provide the necessary administrative and policy support to undertake the above tasks. The Chairman of the task force would also oversee government negotiations on matters relevant to the establishment of the corporation. These negotiations would cover the basis for and determination of shareholdings, legal arrangements, treatment of infrastructure, future of other rail structures, approval of the business plan and agreement on draft memorandum and articles of association. The task force should finalise and submit to Governments by the end of 1990, detailed proposals and recommendations on these above issues. This will enable Governments, as potential shareholders, to meet in late January 1991 to determine their positions. (e) The NRFI Task Force will report to ATAC on 5 April 1991. (f) The Task Force has been allocated $2 million for the purpose of research and engaging professional advice on establishment of the NRFC. It is also administering a $1 million study of infrastructure requirements of the NRFC.

An overarching group has been established by the Commonwealth-State Steering Committee to pull together the work of three separate working groups set up to report on implementing different aspects of the agreements reached by Heads of Government pertaining to road transport. The working group on road funding responsi2. bilities will make recommendations for improvements to existing road funding arrangements to the overarching group. In examining and recommending on changes to the current road funding responsibilities, the working group shall take into account and make reference to: 1. the duplication of functions by different tiers of government in program delivery under current arrangements; 2. the framework for defining roles and responsibilities in service delivery as agreed by Heads of Government and contained in the Confer5. ence Communique; 3. the interests of each tier of government different functional categories of road and the and Regulation consistency of these interests with current funding responsibilities; 4. the implementation of the Commonwealth's decision to untie funds for local roads and pay these funds to local government and to State Governments, where they are responsigether ble for local roads, via general purpose 5. measures to ensure that as functions and re. sponsibilities are transferred, these are matched by amended funding arrangements; and 6. a timetable and transitional measures for implementation of new funding arrangements."" by Mr ""Working Group on Heavy Vehicle Charging At the October special Premiers' Conference, of Government agreed to the establish"" ment of, through co-operative processes involving of powers or complementary legislation, a national heavy vehicle registration scheme towith uniform technical and operating regaculations and nationally consistent charges.

(e) The Overarching Committee on Land Transport will report to the Federal, State and Territory Governments in April prior to its recommendations being discussed at the May 1991 Premiers' Conference. (1) Travel and accommodation expenses of officials associated with the activities of mittee and Working Groups are being met by each level of government concerned. The communique of the special Premiers' Conference in Brisbane on 30-31 October 1990 made reference to the Australian Transport Advisory Council further considering the principles for distribution of road funds between States and Territories. It has been agreed by the State and Territory Governments that this consideration be deferred until the Overarching Committee on Land Transport has reported to the Premiers' Conference in May 1991. Land Transport: Projects (Question No. 605) Mr Haw.ker asked the Minister for Land Transport, upon notice, on 5 March 1991: With respect to each occasion on which he has personally opened new and upgraded roadworks, bridges, freeways and the like since he was appointed Minister for Land Transport, what was (a) the nature of the project, (b) its locality, (c) the date of opening, (d) road funding category and (e) the sums contributed by (i) the Commonwealth and (ii) State and local governments. Mr Robert Brown-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Openings of roads, freeways and the like, funded in whole or in part by the Federal Government, are determined by the states and territories, with invitations being issued to me from time to time to attend such events. These events relate usually to large or significant projects, such as the final seal on a major highway, or a bypass around a town. There are no established guidelines for staging an opening ceremony, save the desire of a state or territory to have one. Where my duties permit, it is my practice to accept an invitation from the state or territory minister to attend as the official Commonwealth representative, or to delegate this duty to another Parliamentary representative. I regret to inform the honourable member that it is beyond the resources of my department to supply a more detailed response to his question. As invitations are issued by the states and territories and all opening ceremony arrangements are made by the respective road authorities and paid for by them, it may be more appropriate for him to direct his question to that quarter. As to Federal Government funding of road projects, this information is available in the annual report of the Department of Transport and Communications. ATSIC Vehicles (Question No. 617) Dr Wooldridge asked the Minister for the ComAboriginal Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Aboriginal Reconciliation, upon notice, on 6 March 1991: Do any vehicles owned by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) or used by ATSIC officers, in any of the States or territories, bear personalised number plates incorporating the letters ""ATSIC"" if so, (a) how many vehicles and (b) what was the total (i) initial and (ii) recurrent cost of the number plates. Mr Tickner-The answer to honourable member's question is: Information provided by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission indicates that there are no official ATSIC vehicles bearing sonalised number plates incorporating the letters ""ATSIC"". Return of Cultural Property (Question No. 695) Mr Hollis asked the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories, upon notice, on 10 April 1991: the Further to the answer to question No. 1727 (Hansard, 24 October 1989, page 1753), at what level will Australia be represented at the seventh session (Athens, 22-25 April 1991) of the Intergovernmental Committee for Promoting the Reperturn of Cultural Property to its Countries of Origin or its Restitution in Case of Illicit Appropriation. Mr Simmons-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The officer in charge of cultural matters attached to the Australian Embassy in Athens, Ms Sandra Vegting, will be Australia's representative at the meeting.",124
