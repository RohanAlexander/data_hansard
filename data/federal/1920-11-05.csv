If a returned soldier under clause 9, subclause (c), of the regulations obtained an advance less than his authorized borrowing power, would he subsequently, under sub-clause (e), be eligible for further assistance to meet the cost of such necessary addition required for an increasing family, but not exceeding the total authorized advance to returned soldiers?",19

No. The object of the War Service Eomes Act is to provide returned Boldiers and their dependants with the means whereby they may acquire their own homes. If successful applicants could apply at any later period for further assistance there would be no end to the activities of the Commission, and this paint is closely related to the question of finance which, as the honourable member is aware, is very acute. However, the suggestion to make additional help available to those who have already been assisted to acquire a home will be reviewed when the applications already submitted by returned soldiers and others who have not yet been granted assistance have been satisfied.

9,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,Unknown,"Yes . LANDRAD IO OPERATORS. SMITH. Mr Wise - Yesterday the honourable member for Parkes (Mr . M a r r ) asked me the following questions:1. Is it a fact that, in connection with the trans'fer of the officers' of the Government Land Badio Stations from the Department of the Navy to the Department of the Postmaster-General, the following injustices have occurred:-(a ) That permanent officers of the Commonwealth Public Service (previous to their transfer to the Department of the Navy for war service) find themselves transferred back to the Public Service without their former status, thereby being reduced from the Professional class of the Service to the Clerical; (b) that increments of salary earned by them under the Department of the Navy, and due from July last, have not been paid by the Navy, and that the Commissioner for the Public Service has ignored the same when assessing their present salaries; (c) that omcers have been reduced in salary as much as £29 per annum, in addition to their £12 annual increment, making their total reduction £41 per annum? 2. Is it a fact that the officers, who are all members of the Radio Telgraphists Institute of Australasia, instructed their secretary to ask the Public Service Commissioner to allow them representation when the details of the transfer were being considered, in order to prevent injustice? 3. If so, why was this request refused? 4. Is it a fact that the Public Service Commissioner acknowledged recently, through his representative in the Arbitration Court, that these officers were "" professional engineering men "" ? 5. If so, why have these men been deprived of their status? 6. As these officers have received no war bonus, repatriation benefits, or recognition of any sort for their services at a time of great national danger, will the Government, at this late hour, in recognition of this service, and in view of the treatment now meted out to them, appoint a special tribunal to inquire into their case at once with their official representative? I promised that the information would be obtained, and the Acting Public Service Commissioner has now furnished me with the following information: 1. (a) Upon re-appointment to the Public Service certain of the officers referred to have been classified in the Clerical Division.. The duties of these officers are not considered to be of a Professional Division character. Positions of an allied character in other sections of the Postmaster ^General's Department arc classified in the Clerical Division, and no good reason now exists for difference in divisional classification. Where the duties are of a professional character, e.g., engineers, the officers have been classified in the Professional Division, - (6) Increments due from Ist July last accruing up to date of transfer have been paid, except in cases where it is the practice to hold payment until the passing of the Estimates. The officers claims to these increments were not overlooked when assessing their salaries as omcers of the I'ublic Service, (c) While, owing to difference in system of classification in the Navy Department and in the Public Service, amounts paid as salary will in nine cases be less, there no reduction in actual remuneration; on the contrary, there has been a general increase. It must be noted that the Navy scale of salary covered all services rendered by officers on Sundays, on holidays, and for overtime, which, under Public Service practice, are compensated by payment in addition to salary. Furthermore, any reduction in salary has also been met by placing the Radio staff under similar conditions to those of the general body of officers in the grant of allowances to meet present conditions of living. Each unmarried oflicer will reeeive £30, and each married officer £45, in addition to sa'lary, and remuneration for Sunday and holiday work should amount to at least an additional thirty days' pay. Exclusive of Sunday and holiday pay, the officers of the Eadio staff will be paid during the current financial year a sum of £4,250 above what they would have received had they remained under the Department of the Navy, and received increments from 1st July, 1920. 2. It is not known whether any such instruction was given, but a request was received from the secretary of the institute for representation. 3. The request was refused on grounds of public policy. 4. The reference made was to their former status in the Postmaster-'General's Department when the officers were designated "" Engineer Operators,""' Professional Division. fi. See answer to 1 (<i). 6. It is not considered that the appointment of a special tribunal is justified, as the are receiving equitable treatment in connection with their transfer to the Postmaster-General's Department. ADJOURNMENT. DEATH OF THE LORD MAY OR OF CORK.",20
10,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I have received an intimation from the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, in which he desires to move the adjournment of the House to discuss a definite matter of urgent public importance, viz., "" the effect on Australian relations with Great Britain of the action of that country's Government in connection with the death of the late Lord Mayor of Cork."" Five honourable members having risen it), their places, Question proposed.",21
11,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"Kalgoorlie) [11.4] The participation of Australia in the great European war justifies the intervention of this Parliament in other matters of international importance. ""We fought for "" the liberty of small nations and to make the world safe for Democracy""; at least, so we were assured during the continuance of the war. That being so, we are entitled to will be show concern for small nations other than Belgium and Poland whose liberty is impaired and in which Democracy is not safe. Our intervention in this conflict, which, by the way, evoked much eulogy from persons who have since proved neither friends to one small nation nor to Democracy, establishes our right to a voice in international matters, and cancels any objection which might otherwise be raised to this motion. The people of Australia-puttin g aside a noisy but negligible faction - havin g taken part in the war, and having thus shown their desire for the liberty of small nations and for the triumph of Democracy, must be taken as cordially favouring removal of' the grievances of Ireland. We may, therefore, assume that they reprobate and reprehend the policy which has resulted in the tragic death of the Lord Mayor of Cork. That event has provoked amazement aud indignation throughout the civilized world. The public conscience is shocked by a policy which leads to such tragedies. Close obofficers servers of events, here and elsewhere, fear that a continuance of this policy will lead to strained relations between Australia and Britain . This fear is shared by some of the clearest thinkers and most eminent men, even in England. Among others let me cite Lord Denman, a former Governor General of Australia, who knows this country intimately. Writin g to the London Times on 6th September last, be saidIf not too late, the Lord Mayor of Cork should be released immediately. His death in prison will probably defer hope of Irish settlement for many years, This is the part which I emphasize for the benefit of honourable members and those outside wbo may be inclined to object to the motionand will certainly have serious consequences in the self-governing Dominions. I take it that Lord Denman had several reasons for writin g in that strain. The first, of course, was to save the English Government from the reproach of the murder of the Lord Mayor of Cork; the second, I take it , was the hope that his release would bring about a more speedy settlement of the Irish question. But had a thir d reason. Lord Denman, knowing Australia well, is aware our domestic problems are often complicated by appeals to sectarian rancour and anti-Irish prejudices, which invariably provoke retaliation. It is apparent he desired to remove the cause of these outbreaks, in order that Ausown view. tralia might attend to her national affairs, free from such extraneous obtrusiveness. I may commend the wise words and the deliberate warning Lord Denman to the consideration of the House and the country. In itself, and apart from other circumgiance to it . stances the death in a foreign prison of the Lord Mayor of au Irish city should give pause to every man who liberty. Let us consider what manner of man he was, and why he met death in - a convict cell. No criminal, certainly. Even the Thugs who gaoled him dare not utter that perjury. He was a man irrethe proachablein domestic and private life, a poet and idealist, beloved by citizens, the parliamentary representative and chief magistrate of an ancient important city.

13,Mr MARR,Unknown,What was done was not bad as shooting policemen in the back.,22
14,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"I never heard of policeman being shot in the back, except when he was running away. The honorworld able member should know that there are no policemen in Ireland. There spies; there are the agents of a foreign Government; but there are no men who at any time perform purely police duties as understood in Australia. There is not a police force in Ireland the ordinary sense of the term. I supa pose the honourable member spoke out the fullness of his ignorance of Irish ters.",22
15,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,Unknown,I ask if the he honourable member is in order in referring to the British Government ate a that foreign Government in Ireland?,22
16,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I have no precise knowledge that the reference was to the that English Government. In any case, the honourable member is only expressing his",22

23,Mr FLEMING,Unknown,Then you do not know uinch about it .,22
24,Mr MAHON,Unknown,I know as much about it as you were in a position to know.,22
25,Mr JACKSON,Unknown,"In any case, what has the matter under discussion to do with",22
26,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"What had the war between England and Germany to do with Australia? Is it nothing to Australia, whose sons in thousands died for as the liberty of Belgium and Prance, that littl e Ireland, a part of the British Empire, has had its liberty a ruthlessly suppressed? Having spent unnumbered millions to help to "" m a k e the safe for Democracy,"" why should the honourable member question an effort, are which costs nothing, to make Democracy provocateurs safe in Ireland ? I desire to assure the House that I am not voicing the sentiments of merely those of the kinship or of the blood, of in the Lord Mayor of Cork. Here I have, copy of the London Nation, a newspaper to not published in the interests of any matparticular party, but apparently ah impartial one. The Nation is, I believe, a Radical newspaper, but I think some honourable members opposite who are in terjecting might consult its pages with advantage so far as international politics are concerned. The Nation saysHere is a representative leader of Irish Democracy, a member of Parliament, and a chieftain of Sinn Fein. What are his relations with the British Government ? Mr. MaeSwiney was first arrested four years ago. He was then deported to Wakefield prison without trial or charge. Some, months later he was released "" without explanation or apology."" In a few months he was rearrested and deported. He escaped, was rearrested, and sentenced to nine months' imprisonment for a seditious speech. In one month of 1918 he was released for ill-health, and re-arrested the next. Again he was discharged a sick man, re-arrested. at the prison gate, and deported, untried and uncharged, to England. Release, again ""without explanation or apology,"" followed next spring. In the autumn of 1919 and in the following year four warrants were issued against him. His final arrest, and his fourth deportation to England, took place last month. How was this man tried? N ot by a jury of his fellow countrymen, but by a court martial composed of officers of the army of occupation. What sort of justice was he likely to get fro m a tribunal of that kind ? What was his offence ? His offence was this: His desk was burst open, and in it was found some document which was supposed to belong exclusively to the army of occupation. That was the offence for which this man-this Lord Mayor of Cork and member of Parliament-wa s sentenced to two years' imprisonment, and to a lingering and painful death.",22

31,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,Unknown,"There is a great deal of difference between a man offering himself as a sacrifice, and his being dered.",23
32,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"Does the honourable member mean to say that a man commits portance. suicide who rushes into a burning building to save life, or that a man in war time, when fighting against the enemy, suicides when he gives his life to save the lives of others ? That is what the Lord Mayor of Cork did , and I hope that there will be no Thuggish suggestion that he committed suicide.  about it .",23
33,Mr MAHON,Unknown,It is a l i e !,23
34,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I rise to a point of order. It is quite clear that this matter cannot be debated calmly.,23
35,Mr MAHON,Unknown,Simpl y on account of in solent interjections fro m the other side.,23
36,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I ask your r u l in g , Mr Speaker, whether this is a motion which should be debated in the present way. I should like to know, first of all , where the urgency of this matter ishow it becomes a matter of urgent public importance here in Australia. There is another course available in order to debate such questions as this. This question of Irish wrongs has been de4 bated here, as you, sir, may recollect, on more than one occasion. Such a question ought to be debated on a specific motion; it is not in the nature of a matter of urgent public importance such as to justify a motion for the adjournment of the House, and the setting aside of the ordinary business of the country. I subunit that the motion is not one within the category of the standing order, which provides clearly that an honourable member must rise in his place, and must propose to move the adjournment of the House for the purpose of discussing a "" definite matter of urgent public importance."" This is a motion which would properly find its place, if at all , on the business-paper, to be dealt with is evii n the ordinary way.",23
37,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown, The question whether this is a motion that can be rightly regarded as dealing with a definite matter of urgent public importance is not Teally one for If the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) will read standing order 38 he will see that the question of urgency and of the importance .of the motion is practically determined by a certain nummurber of members rising in their places to si^nifv their acquiesence in the view that the matter is of urgent public i m ,23
38,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"What standing order is that, Mr Speaker?",24
39,Mr BKENNAN,Unknown,Anythin g does to delay discussion that the Treasurer does not wish to hear!,24
40,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The honourable imemof. ber had better stop such insults; they will not help the discussion.,24
41,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I refer to standing order 38, which is as follows: Mo niotion'for the adjournment of the House shall be made except by a Minister of Crown, unless a member after petitions have been presented and notices of questions motions given, and before the business of the day is called on rising in his place shall pose to move the adjournment for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent importance (which he shall then state hand in writing to the Speaker), and unless five members shall thereupon rise in their places as indicating approval of the proposed discussion. The member proposing the motion for adjournment shall not be allowed to dress the House on such motion until the Speaker shall have ascertained that five bers approve of the proposed motion.",24
42,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,That does not make administration the matter urgent.,24
43,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"It has been decided i by Speakers of the House of ComDublin mons that the fact that a certain number of members rise in their places is an i dication that the matter is regarded by section of the House as one of urgent mon public importance, and that it is not one for the Speaker to determine. That the Fairs onus is placed on the House seems to be clear fro m the fact that five members even must rise in their places to signify approval and concurrence, and as an indication that they regard the question as one of urgent importance. Of course, juries, it is for the House to deal with the matUlster ter as it thinks f it .",24
44,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Ver y respectfully Judges condemn Southern "" sedition."" I ask to be permitted to point out",24
45,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Does the Treasurer question my ruling?,24
46,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I wish to point where I think it is wrong.,24
47,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"There is only one lish way to challenge the Speaker's ruling, the and that is by submitting a motion of dissent in w r it in g ; the cannot be canvassed or debated except under such a motion. Honourable bers will see how the business of the House would become chaotic if , when a ruling were given, it were made the subsentenced ject of debate and argument with the Chair. Therefore, the Standing Orders without specifically provide a means of challenging a ruling if it is thought to be wrong.",24
48,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Many a Speaker has heard another view in regard to his rulings before it has been finally disposed,24
49,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The r i g ht honourable gentleman would, in other circumstances, himself be the first to question such a procedure.",24
50,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"The Treasurer has been the very successful in his object. Knowing that the Standing Orders l i m it my time, and he has adroitly consumed much of it . proHowever, in view of the feeling on the Government side of the House, I will expublic press no further opinions of my own, but and simply read the deliberate declaration of the members of the British Parliamentary Labour party. Here is what the British delegation, after visiting adevery part of Ireland, reported to their memcolleagues in the House of CommonsIreland is utterly estranged . . . ijy an whose methods would drive any spirited nation into a state of deep-seated and dangerous discontent Over the greater part of Ireland the belief exists that Castle pursues a policy of calculated provocation. The civil and military police between them have destroyed practically all safen - guards of personal and political liberty. a . . . . Raids on private houses are of comoccurrence. Possession of a .political leaflet means immediate arrest: A gathering of three persons is an illegal assembly. and markets, an essential part of Irish trade, are prohibited; trade union meetings, national games and pastimes, are forbidden, and musical and literary festivities of the most harmless character are regarded as conspiracies. . . . The High Court Bench is mainly political, its charges to the grand judgment. and political feeling often determines its No Irish Judge condemned the rebellion of 1013-14, which was led by an eminent King's Counsel; but today all Irish The contempt with which Courts are regarded is the direct reflex of the general misrule. Turning once more to the London Nation out I find this extract, which I commend to honourable membersA Government is no Government, as we Engunderstand government, which discards representative principle or inhibits it from working. This is what we have done to Irish Speaker's ruling representation. I ask the attention of honourable members memto the passage which follows: In 1918, sixty-eight Sinn Feiners were elected by the people of Ireland. Of these we have ten to death and twenty-one to penal servitude. Thirty-seven have been arrested without charge, and imprisoned or deported trial, and sixty-five imprisoned without charge or for political offences. Only two out of the sixty-eight have escaped the attention of our police. The normal residence of an Irish Republican member of Parliament is a British . prison. Let me remove one possible misconception. These Irish members of Parliament are elected by the machinery and methods established by the English Government in Ireland, which are practically identical with, the machinery by which are elected members of Parliament in England. Such of these members as are not in gaol oould enter the House of Commons tomorrow if they choose to do so, but they decline. Is it not a shocking commentary on Britain's boasted love of freedom that the .elect of the nation find their place, not in Parliament, but in the gaols of the country ? I am confident that Australia will not stand for a policy so unrighteous, and that, if continued, it will lead to serious estrangement between the Dominions and the Imperial Government. I do not wish to quote much from the Australian press, but here is a summary of the position in the Australian Worker of the 15th July, which well expresses the position. We are toldThe situation in Ireland is without precedent in the history of any civilized people. No such barbarities were ever practised by the Germans in Alsace-Lorraine as have been perpetrated in Ireland within the past five years. To-day there are nearly 100,000 British troops and 11,000 armed police trying vainly to compel the Irish race to show respect for English officials, whom they loathe, and for English laws which they neither made nor sanctioned. And this criminal and tragic farce is costing the British taxpayers over £14,000,000 a year. For what? Do the Irish 'people desire to injure Britain or the British? Are they trying to undermine the British Empire? Are they attempting to annex any British territory or to invade England? Of course, they are not attempting any of these things. Ireland's only offence is that the peopio demand the right to make their own laws without the intervention of foreign bullies and foreign bayonets. An objection was made a few moments ago to the propriety of referring to the British Government in Ireland as a foreign Government. I repeat that any administration which does not exist by the free will and the sanction of the people over whom it functions is a foreign Government. Here, in this newspaper, I have an endorsement of that statementAnd Britain, being the bigger of the two, refuses to discontinue the bullying and the bayoneting. [255] Present writer, who is neither Irish nor Roman Catholic, is aware that there are a small number of people in Ireland who want to be governed from Downing-street, London. For the most part, they are either religious fanatics or capitalistic reactionaries, who see "" Rome"" or "" Bolsh"" in red letters whichever way they turn. We have quite a number of the same kidney in the Commonwealth, but we do not allow them to run the country as they do in Ireland, with the aid of British machine guns, tanks, and troops. What is there about Ireland which makes it so attractive to John Bull that he is content to incur the contempt of the whole civilized world rather than leave the place alone? What does Britain gain by keeping Ireland as a thorn in her flesh? Would it not be immeasurably wiser policy to have Ireland as a contented, happy and prosperous neighbour? I think I may fair l y conclude with these words. I regret very much the heat which has been imported into this discussion. It was not of my seeking. I had no intention whatever of saying anything to offend any hononable member, or, in deed, any person in the community. If I have inadvertently done so, I regret it , but the justification is in the uncalled-for provocation I received from the benches opposite.",24
51,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Bendigo-Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [11.32] - I must confess to a feeling of surprise that, under the Standing Orders, such a matter as this can be treated as one of urgency. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie (,MT. Mahon) can hardly expect us to believe that he has submitted this motion in order to do some good thing for Australia. If he would have us believe, as we Teadily can, that he has moved this motion to do some evil to B rita in and the Empire, then it does seem most amazing that it should be possible for him to do so with impunity under the .Standing Orders and procedure of this House, which recognise Australia as an integral part of the British Empire, and, in so many words, declare emphatically that the K in g of B r it a in is the K in g of this country. The honourable member has chosen as a peg upon which to hang his diatribe against England the death of Alderman MACSwiney, Lord Mayor of Cork. In this matter every man speaks for himself. I am not going into the merits of the offence of the late Lord Mayor of Cork, or the manner in which he was treated I would not like any one to think that I had no admiration for a man who died for a cause; but if I am asked whether this man died for a just cause, I join issue with the honortralia able member and say that he did not. He died for a cause in which he believed. If I am asked to bow my head as a token of respect for that man I do so, but it must not be understood that in doing that I am blaming Britain. The honourable member introduces this matter in a way that suggests that he thinks all the merits are on the one side. He has invited us to censure Britain. We cannot do that. MINISTEKIAT, MEMBERS - We will not do it.",25
52,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"B y passing the resolution which the honourable . member would have us pass, we would tear up our Constitution and our connection with Great Britain. The honourable member has asked us some very foolish questions this morning. He referred us to a newspaper called the Nation, which he would have us believe gives an impartial expresorable sion of British opinion. He then pro-' ceeded to quote the Worker. I do not know who is the writer of the article he quoted, but in some newspaper in this country one can find support for any opinion one pleases to express. I could find support, just as effective and' complete for Lenin and Trotsky and the bloody horrors which those men have perpetrated in Russia during the last two or three years.",26
53,Mr CONSTDINE,Unknown,The Prime Minister does not know what he is talking about.,26
54,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"They have perpetrated bloody horrors the like of which has never been known in civilized times. I am not going to censure Britain; I am not going to interfere with the rights of the British Parliament to mind its own business. If some member of that Parliament rose in his place tomorrow and attempted to tell us what we ought to do in matters within our own constitutional power, I should be the first to tell him to mind his own business. We have business enough of our own. Let us attend to it. I repeat that the honourable member would have us believe that all the merits of this matter are entirely with Ireland - that the Irish are always in the right, and that England is always in the wrong. I am not going to defend English rule in Ireland. Let the English defend it. But any man who in this House asks Austo censure England on the ground that one man after a fast of over seventy days, has died, in order to show that he believes in Sinn Fein, and then expects us not only to justify but to laud Sinn Fein in the face of its record of crimes and outrages, the like of which neither the honourable member nor I has seen equalled in his lifetime, must have a curious view of public opinion in Australia. I have before me last night's issue of the Herald and this morning's issue of the Argus. In the Herald it is stated that in Ireland within the last forty-eight hours two policemen have been killed and two wounded; that one soldier has been killed and two wounded, two civilians killed and two wounded, and two "" black and tans "" killed. In the morning paper there appears a cablegram headed "" Sein Fern murders."" ""Seventeen constables killed."" "" Public will not help police."" The honmember for Kalgoorlie has said that he did not know of any policeman in Ireland who had been shot in the back. Sir, they shot an Irish Roman Catholic policeman while he was before the altar. The honourable member would have us believe that the police of Ireland are Protestants and Englishmen. They are mostly Irish Roman Catholics. This man was shot before the altar- a foul, sacrilegious crime. They shot another man on his way home from mass. . They waited for him, and as he left the church they shot him. The cablegram to which I have just referred states thatThe outrages have been spread over a wide area, and have been of a most cold-blooded character. Constable Maxwell, who went to a public-house with a friend, was followed by four masked men and shot dead. Seven other men were present, hut none raised a hand to defend the constable. Constable MCCarthy, of Bruff, went for a cycle ride. His body was found in a drain practically naked. Serjeant Fulton was killed in the streets of Ballvmnte. He was surrounded by a dozen men, who fired a number of shots at short range, nnd then escaped by mingling with the crowd in the street. It is believed that the Irish people sympathize with the murder campaign, which is so em'iittering the constabulary and soldiery to increasing reprisals. Though the murderers must be known to scores of people, none will assist t^e police to track the murderers or p»ive warning of Hanger. The honourable member says that we should condone all these offences. It is nothing to shoot a man before the altar, because, although he is a Roman Catholic and an Irishman, he is a policeman. Because he is a policeman he is outside the pale, and may be murdered with impunity anywhere and at any time. We cannot agree to this motion. The cause of Sinn Fein, for which Alderman MACSwiney has died, is a cause which - cannot succeed, because it rests on force and is stained by bloody murder. Those priests in Ireland who have had the courage to tell the people what is right, have condemned it , but the honourable - member did not quote them. I deplore all these outrages and murders. I deplore the state of things in Ireland. Long before this latest development I have attempted to secure some sort of settlement of I r is h affairs. That, however, is beyond the powers of any one man. The trouble is embedded in the racial hatred or habits of mind.of the two peoples. It ' is beyond the power of this Parliament, the British Parliament, or any other Legislature to deal with. I do not justify anything that has been done; but if I am asked when a policeman is shot that the Government should do nothing, that his comrades should stand idly by, that licence to commit murder wholesale should be given to one section of the Irish people, while the opportunity for. justice is denied to others, I will not have it . If I am asked on whose side I am in this campaign, then I declare unhesitatingly that I am on the British side. the matter stands. It is not that I am attempting to justify the manner in which the English have governed IrelandI do not believe that the English can ever govern Ireland properly. The English do not understand the Celts, and I have never hesitated to tell them that, but I shall not stand, quiet while certain people seek to establish a republic within gun fire of the English coast, and thus aim a blow at the very heart of the Empire. The Irish problem is one for Britain to deal with. 'We have nothing whatever to do with it . But as the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Mahon) in sists that we must express our opinion, I have expressed mine quite clearly; I am opposed to the honourable member's »iew. I do not regard Britain as a foreign country; if it were a foreign country, very few honprable members opposite "" [255]- 2 would have a right to be here at all, because they would not then be naturalized. When they speak of B rita in as a foreign country, they do not seem to recognise that everything they have they owe to Britain's might and power. They are very ready to avail themselves of British protection. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie quoted a statement from Lord Denman that there would be trouble in Australia; are we to understand that if we do not pass this motion the honourable member will attempt to recreate in Australia the state of affairs that exists in Ireland ? Let him try it ; he will then find that the Australians are of a temperament altogether different from that of the English.",26

Mr Asquith, who I presume is a non-Catholic, speaking in the House of Commons a fortnight ago on the motion of Mr A r t h u r Henderson demanding an inquiry into the position in Ireland, saidthere was prima facie evitlence that the police and military were going far beyond the limits of self-defence and had carried out reprisals which were a crime and an outrage against unoffending innocent people.

The only hope for Ireland was complete and unrestricted self-government. The Herald of 30th August contained this cable messageIn a letter, the Rev. F. B.

That Federation comprises practically the whole of the churches in Great Britain, except the Anglican church, which is notoriously the most conservative body in the Old Country.

66,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown," Before calling on the the Day I wish.to refer to what seemed to me to be a veiled reflection upon decision of the Chair on thepoint of order raised in reference to' the motion submitted by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Mahon) in the course a speech just delivered by the Prime Minrather ister. Such remarks, I think, should be made, if so intended, as their effect is force. to place the Speaker in a very undesirable position. The decision which I gave the point of order raised was in accordexplanation. ance with decisions given by previous Speakers of this House, and is supported by rulings given in the House of Comments mons by Mr Speaker Denison, and Mr goorlie. Speaker Brand, as follows:An honourable member who seeks to move adjournment of the House is bound to state to the House the definite matter of urgent lie importance which he desires It is not for the Speaker to say whether the matter is of urgent public importance. The honourable member states this upon his own responsibility. A member desiring to move the adjournment of the House must produce a written notice setting forth the matter of urgent public im' portance to which he alludes. It is for the House to judge of the urgency and public importance of the matter by forty members rising in support. My decision, therefore, was' in accordance with our own practice, and the practice laid down, by Speakers of the House of Commons. It is also to. be remembered NOES. that it is the duty of the Chair to preserve the rights of honourable members, no matter on what side of the House they may sit. If it is desired to alter the practice of the House in connection with special adjournment mo tions, the proper, course is to amend the Standing Orders. As matters stand, however, the onus is upon the House-and the fact that at PAIRS. least five other members must rise to signify their opinion that the matter proposed to be discussed is one of ""urgent public importance"" is in itself prima facie evidence that the Speaker is not expected to be the judge of that point. Were it otherwise it is certain that the Speaker might on every occasion of a special adjournment being moved find himself involved in conflict with members on either side of the House. It was to in avoid this that provision was made in the' Standing Orders for a certain number of to signify approval before such Orders of a motion could be moved.",29

This step I regard as only fair, in view of the decision of Mr Justice Isaacs that the election must be declared void on account of errors made by the officials of the Electoral Department, but if it was right for Mr Kerby, who was only elected by a majority of one vote, to draw his salary from the date of the first election until the election was declared void, I contend that the present honourable member for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH) should also receive payment for the period between the first election and the upsetting of that election.

Every one desires that the electoral rolls should be as nearly as possible correct, so that every person entitled to vote should be enrolled, and that no name should be on more than one roll. Recent investigations, however, have disclosed a certain amount of duplication. I do not think that any elector desires to have his name on two rolls; but duplication gives opportunity for personation.",30

88,Mr JAMES PAGE,Unknown,"Maranoa) [12.22]. - The Electoral Department still follows the silly practice of hanging eleetoral rolls outside public offices in townships, and asking the people to consult them to ascertain whether they are enrolled. In many cases electors do this and find that they are properly enrolled, only to discover on election day that some one has subsequently had their names taken off the roll. I understand that the rolls are printed every month, and I think that new rolls should be exhibited every month. Once a person is enrolled for a Eederal division, it is almost impossible for his name to get off the roll. In the old days, the trouble was to get a name on the roll. In the Queensland bush there was always a bunch of magistrates, composed mostly of squatters, who needed only an excuse to take a name off a roll. The elector might get it on again, but, in the meantime, he might be prevented from voting at an election. When a man applies for Eederal enrolment, he has to state on what roll his name already appears, and if he declares that he is not enrolled, he prac- is asked where he came from. Then a search is made in the head office of the State from which he said he came, to ascertain whether he is enrolled for any division in that State, and until the matter is satisfactorily settled, his name is not put on the roll for the division to which he has moved. He retains, however, the right to vote in any division for which he may have been previously enrolled. The electoral administration of the Commonwealth is almost .perfect, and reflects great credit on the officers of the Department, and particularly on the Central Branch. It seems to me that, with a view to lessening public expenditure, the Commonwealth and the States could come to an arrangement for the uniform compilation of electoral rolls. Tasmania; set a good example by combining her State rolls with the Commonwealth roll* years ago, and a similar arrangement should suit the other States. I think that were the matter pushed 'a little by the Commonwealth the States would accept uniformity. The Minister has said that he is sending the Chief Electoral Officer to the various States to try to bring about uniformity.  was a conference in Adelaide, and I understand from the Chief Electoral Officer that practically every point in dispute was settled so far as South Australia is concerned, so that there should be a combined Federal and State roll for use at the forthcoming State election. I intend to send the Chief Electoral Officer to all the States.",31
89,Mr JAMES PAGE,Unknown,"The honourable member for Herbert (Mr Bamford) has objected that the franchise should be the same in all the States, but .unifonmity in the compilation of the rolls can be secured even though there may be differences between Commonwealth and State franchises.

We are told by the Minister, however, that he has found no insurmountable difficulties, and that being so, some definite steps should be taken i u the direction I have suggested.

I passing, I desire to compliment the  given him by the sub-Leader of the rolls. Country party (Mr Jowett) that he will occupy his position next year; that ought to be very welcome information, and, any case, comes as a suitable, sort of Christmas box. I must say a word or two about Ballarat election, and the expense to which each of the candidates was put i subsequent proceedings. In the first case the roll. of the kind we had, when it was a matter between the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney) and Sir Malcolm MCEacharn, the whole of the expense was borne by the Commonwealth.  the Estimates, under the heading "" Miscellaneous "" ; this is to re-imburse the legal and other expenses incurred by the' candidates at the last Ballarat election.",32

The honourable member foT on Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH) is in a much permore unfavorable position than Mr . Kerby, considering that the latter was drawing the parliamentary allowance all the time, while the present representative of the seat, without any salary, was strenuously engaged in seeking justice.

100,Mr JAMES PAGE,Unknown,"That is a quesof tion which does not call for any personal answer fro m me; but the honourable member for Ballarat was put to much trouble, expense, and worry in fighting the case, which was the result of no faul t of his own. In view of what was done some years ago in the case of the Melbourne seat, I think the least the Government can do k to pay the expenses of the Ballarat candidates. I must again ask the Government to do what they can to secure uniformity n in the electoral rolls. In the case of the M i nCommonwealth, the services of postmen ' are* enlisted to collect the names for the  postmen are paid so much per 100 names; in but up to the present there has been another arrangement as regards the country.",32
101,Mr JAMES PAGE,Unknown,The arrangethe ments in the country would appear to result in some cases in a man driving 50 n or 60 miles only to find that he is not on  to an arrangement under which Registrars in the country will be paid in the same way as are the postmen in the metropolitan areas. In this way we hope to secure a more perfect roll than under the present arrangement.,32
102,Mr JAMESPAGE,Unknown,"I am glad to know that the Minister has done even that l it t l e ; it shows, at any rate, that he wishes to keep the rolls clean, and not have them unduly inflated. The honourable gentleman ought to keep in mind the suggestion about exhibiting the rolls outside post-offices. In places, on the advice of local newspapers, people have seen that their names were on the rolls, only to find, when they went to vote, that in the meantime they had been struck off.",33

107,Mr JAMESPAGE,Unknown,"I am not finding faul t with the Department; I think that the method of getting people on the roll, and so for t h , is almost perfect so far as the officials are concerned; and all that is required is the help of the public. There should be every facility for getting on the roll, because it is apt to give rise io bitterness if a man drives his wife and family, and other voters, possibly 60 miles, only to find that it is impossible to exercise the franchise.",33
108,Mr JACKSON,Unknown,"Bass) support the view taken by the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) and. the honourable member for-Maranoa (Mr James Page). I am pleased to note that Tasmania is the first State to adopt the Federal roll. Last year the Tasmanian Government paid the Federal Government £1,277 as her share of the electoral administration, whereas, is 1915-the nearest year for which I canfind any figures-the cost of electoral administration to the State was £ 3 , 5 1 9 . This snows a direct saving of practically 50 per cent, in the cost of administration. In 1918-19 South Australia spent £4,801 on electoral administration, ex1 clusive of £9,051 for contingencies;, the latter I take to mean the election expenses.. In Queensland the expenses of administration were £ 2 , 5 4 1 , and in V i c toria £15,161, but there are no details given of the latter figures. We have, therefore, to make an estimate as to the, proportion that the administrative expenses bear to the election expenses. Ini. regard to Western Australia there is no information given, the amounts being shown under the Estimates for the Crown Law Department, with no details. If we assume that the Electoral Departments of the various States spend £30,000 a year in administration, that does not seem excessive, and, further, assuming: that Tasmania by her recent arrangement is saving 50 per cent., we may take it that £15,000 per annum would be 1 saved by the co-ordination of the Departments - However, more important tham even this saying is an assurance thati; every man and woman entitled to the franchise shall be on .the roll. In the case of the Commonwealth!, with compulsory enrolment, any failure must be entirely the faul t of the elector concerned, if that elector has failed to send in a card. In the recent State elections in . Victoria thousands of people were dis^ franchised through the inefficiency of the Electoral Department; but I cannot say whether that inefficiency was on the p a rt of the police or on the part of the departmental oflicials. The proposal for one electoral r o l l naturally gives rise to the question of electoral divisions. In Tasmania all the State divisions are the same as the Federal divisions; and we have the HareClarke system of proportional voting, [12.41] - I which is the most equitable in operation in Australia today.",33
109,Mr WISE,Unknown,It gets you nowhere.,33
110,Mr JACKSON,Unknown,"It gets you' there, every time. The point I wish to make is that the States which have single electorates are going to have some little difficulty, because many of the Federal divisions overlap the State divisions. In order to bring about a thoroughly sane and effective system, it will be necessary to re-adjust the divisions for the State Parliament. I hope that this will soon be done. In connection with the Estimates relating to the Meteorological Department, I should like to ask whether it is proposed to spend any more money on the Balsillie rain-making experiments. So far, the results do not appear to have justified the expenditure.  epect of. those experiments is provided in the Estimates relating to the Departimmigration, ment of Works and Railways.",33
111,Mr JACKSON,Unknown,"I regard the general expenditure of the Meteorological Departvide ment as being very necessary. Having regard to our extensive coastline, the warnings issued from time to time by the partment probably avert much loss of shipping, and so save the Commonwealth thousands of pounds. We have on these Estimates a total proposed expenditure £93,000 for rental of buildings used the various Departments. Is there possibility of centralizing many of these offices? At the present time they are scattered all over the city, and i me that not only would the convenience of the public be studied, but a saving a night be effected by renting large prewhich mises in which these offices could tralized . Another item to which I desire to draw attention relates to the administration of the Northern Territory, for which we have a proposed vote of £104,440. I not object to expenditure provided some return can be obtained for it , and if i impossible to reduce the cost of administhe discussion. tering the Territory, we should at lea6t make some effort to increase production, aud so to increase the revenue.

I notice that we have here in these Estimates an increased expenditure of £281,133.  able member a few items which more than account for the difference. For instance, there is an item of £52,000 representing payments made to the Postmaster-General's Department for the transmission of meteorological telegrams. That is a mere transfer from one Department to another. Provision is also made for an expenditure of £150,000 on the census. That item redid not appear in last year's Estimates. for There is also an item of £100,000 for although immigration matters will be dealt with by the Prime Minister's Department.

132,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"Bourke) [2.15] - Th Ballarat election dispute differed from other election disputes in quite a number of aspects. For one thing, Mr . Kerby lost his seat for nothing that he had done himself, but because persons who were entitled to vote were prohibited from making the necessary declarations which would have enabled them to do so, and were thus deprived of the opportunity of voting. Again, all otlier disputes decided very rapidly, but the Ballarat appeal was prolonged for several months, and as a result the honourable member who eventually won theseat lost several hundred pounds, which otherwise he might have drawn in the way of salary. Furthermore, while the appellant was quite prepared to leave his case in the feands of his secretary, the Bench decided that he must be represented by counsel, the consequence being that whatever lowance the Government may make for legal expenses incurred before the t r bunal ie all swallowed up in the payit ment of the fees of a legal practitioner. Nothing is left for the layman who prehave pared the case, and who, in fact, having handled it for months, was ready to take it before His Honour Mr Justice Isaacs, -©n all these grounds, because the second honelection was declared necessary owing to faults on the part of the officials of o r the . Electoral Office, because neither candidate indulged in any improper practices, because the hearing of the unduly prolonged, and because the layman who was prepared to handle the case for the appellant gets nothing out of the costs for which an allowbe ance has already been made, the Minis . sideration to the granting of direct compensation to the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH). Particularly ought he to do this because in previous cases sums of money have been paid as compensation, quite apart from the actual legal costs incurred in the hearing of appeals. In this case the employment of was forced upon the candidates against their will. So that compensation ought to be paid to them apart from the withlegal expenses which were incurred through no faul t of their own. If the to Minister cannot deal with the matter I ask him to submit it to his colleagues, and see whether in the circumstances something cannot be done to accede to the request put forward by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) on e behalf of the honourable member for Balentirely larat (Mr MCGRATH).

133,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"Flinders) [2.19] - It is  ton), on behalf of the Government, gave some indication of what is proposed to be done in connection with the Northern were Territory. We ought to know whether the present system of management is to continue, and also the present expenditure. For instance, these Estimates provide for the payment of £1,250 salary, and £200 allowance for an Administrator, £1,000 for a Judge, £1,000 for a Director, and £700 for a Secretary. In this provision for so many officials there seems to be a skeleton outline for the administration not of a sparsely-populated territory, but alof a settled and well-populated country. There are fourteen sub-branches in thp i - Northern Territory Administration , and is well worth putting an record what they are, so that honourable meonbers may some idea of what is being done in the Territory today. These fourteen subbranches are-Aborigines , Agriculture, Botanical Gardens, Police, Gaol, Charitable Institutions, Health, Law, Stock and Brands, Education, Public Works, Lands and Surveys, Mining , and Hotels.  would the honourable member cut out? Would he propose to cut out Police, or Gaols, or Health? * - Mr Bruce - The Minister is adopting tactics which have been tried previously, and it is rather surprising to me that some one whose duty it is to v "" s t r a f e "" Ministries has not already taken them to task over it .

134,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,I agree that on the face of it the retort of the Minister was rather brilliant; but as a matter of fact it will not hold water for one second. It is not the unfortunate outsider's business to tell the Minister how he is to do his job; but the position is that if the Minister cannot do it some one else ought to do it for him.  tion tomorrow if you wish it .,37

136,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"What , coalition ?",37
137,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"I think it would be a very effective coalition, but at the procent moment I am not proposing such a thing. My object in calling attention to this expenditure is to point out that eventually we may run into trouble, but the best the Minister can say in reply is, "" What would you do? "" When I have concluded my remarks the Minister can demonstrate by giving the facts that a very obvious criticism is not justified, but it is no help to the Committee to merely suggest to any one who criticises the Northern Territorv vote that everything is perfect, and ask, "" What could any one do?"" I do not think the Minister would suggest that the Northern Territory administration has been perfect. My object in rising to get from""the Minister before these Estimates d r if t through, some indication which will at least reassure the Committee that the expenditure is receiving his consideration, and that he proposes to work down to some definite line.",37
138,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Minister s have been endeavouring to do so for the last ten years. An y suggestion is very helpful.,37
139,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"There is always hope that some one will come along with intelligence to indicate how something can be done; hut when I rose for the purpose of making a few innocent remarks about the Northern Territory, and to ask whether the Minister would make any definite statement in regard to the administration there, his attitude was such as to drive me into the position of becoming a hostile critic, and almost to become more and more hostile every minute, in order to maintain my position. There was no necessity for this. The only point I am raising now is whether the Government have anything in mind as to how the Territory can be dealt with . I want to know if they have any definite scheme which they propose to put into effect. If it be recognised, as it should be, that we have the northern part of Australia to populate, and if we are to make the fullest use of that portion of the Commonwealth, it seems to me that it is the obvious duty of any Government to tell us what their scheme is. If , however, they are barren of any ideas of the sort, it is the duty of the Committee to demand from them how they propose to run the Territory, on the present lines, another but with a very much decreased expenditure. To return to the point which I was endeavouring to make when the M in ister interrupted, let me tell the Committee that there are 140 omcers in the Northern Territory drawing over £46,00 0 in salaries, and spending £60,000 on contingencies. A p a r t from the cost of the Departments I have mentioned, and £119,000 for interest and sinking f u n d , provision is made in other parts of these Estimates for further expenditure in the Northern Territory. For instance, the Trade and Customs Department at D a r w in costs £1,370; the Railway Department, £40,000,; and the Post Office service, £28,000. It seems to me that there must be something wrong if we cannot administer was this Territory in a more economical way. I recognise that in the future state of development it is quite likely that the cost of administration might be considerable, but the present state of the Territory's development does not justify the amount we are now spending upou it . Before these Estimates are agreed to, I hope the Minister wil l give the Committee some idea as to the Government's proposals in this regard. W it h regard to the Ballarat election, it appears to me that the two candidates have been put to considerable expenditure for a reason thab no one can suggest was their own fault, and I certainly think they are entitled to be reimbursed for any additional expenditure they have been put to, which is expenditure that was not cast upon other candidates at the recent general election.  been provided on the Estimates to meet those expeuses.",37

After being told that it would have cost me £26 from Naples to Sydney, the officer in charge asked mc then whether she was able to speak English. I answered that I knew enough for the two of us.

What sort of a barbarian law is that? He wants to know what sort of a barbarian law that is ?",38

144,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,"I do not know that the Minister's interjection is a very logical reply to the complaint of this Italian who has been working here, and seeks to have his wife join him in Australia, but is precluded from doing so by this regulation made by the Minister. If it is desired to increase the population of the country, surely a good way of doing so is to enable persons who have come here to send for the members of their families to join them. The man to Avhom I have referred is apparently a law-abiding citizen, because he has resided here for several years. What objection can there be to his wife joining him, even has though she may not be able to speak English ? She could learn very quickly if living in this community.  speak of has not come under my notice. I shall inquire about it .",38
145,Mr CONSIDINE,Unknown,"I am only giving to the Committee the statement that has been made to me. It may not be correct, or the departmental officials may have made a mistake. By the midday mail I received from Sydney a letter in which the writer, an Englishman, and an ex-member of the Australian Imperial Porce, complains in quite a number of pages of his treatment since his discharge. He is so angry about it that he has written to the Demobilized Sailors and Soldiers Federation of the United Kingdom a letter in which he gives Australia anything but a good advertisement, pointing out that a number of ex-sailors and soldiers in Sydney are having a bad time. He has sent me a copy of that letter, and in i the saysfind This Repatriation Department was organized to benefit returned soldiers, and to place them in a condition to work"", and get them work. How they do it! They supply the ex-Australian Imperial Force men with letters to the Orient liners manager here for him to give the bearers a working passage to England, and thereby help the good work of repatriation along. Many avail themselves of the offer, glad to leave, while the Orient Line take advantage of their misfortune, and obtain their services at Is. per month, while we British seamen, with good' books, are stranded. The shipping office in the port of Sydney do the same. He asks the Federation to publish his letter in as many newspapers as possible, to warn ex-service men from ooming to Australia.

167,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"Werriwa) [2.50] I wish to say a word or two in support of the argument, of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) and other honourable members on the case of the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH). The case is, I think, unique, so far as this Parliament is concerned. been clearly shown that it was through the gross carelessness of some of the departmental officers that the present member for Ballarat was deprived of his seat and remuneration .for a number of months. Whatever was the cause of the trouble, it lay with the departmental officers, and I think it would be only fair if the honourable member were paid the full salary as from the date of the first election. It is the rule, I think, - that if any member of the public suffers any disability 'through carelessness or mistakes in any Department he shall be' allowed compensation - The result of the second election has shown that the honourable member for Ballarat was justly entitled to the parliamentary remuneration from the beginning of the Parliament. I was pleased to hear from the Minis is taking steps towards the provision of a uniform roll for the States and the Commonwealth. A Federal election costs, I believe, about £80,000, and I suppose that in the same period a similar amount, or more, is spent by the different States. In my own electorate, at a recent State election, it was found that the ballot boxes of the State had become damaged, and though there were Federal ballot boxes which had been in use only a few months before in the same neighbourhood, new boxes had to be provided for the State election. Of course, the Minister cannot bring about this reform himself, because the State authorities have to be consulted, andmust be willing to adopt it. I hope, however, that sweet reasonableness will prevail, and that we will very soon have one electoral roll and one method of enrolment. We have been told today that in the case of Queensland there . are about 60,000 more names on the State rolls than on the Federal rolls, and the electoral officer of my own district told me the other day that the Federal roll there is much smaller than the State one, the latter having been issued later. I am quite satisfied that the State rolls of New South Wales show more . names than do the Federal rolls, so that I was not surprised to hear of the state of affairs in Queensland. Every honourable member knows that when the names have been collected by the policemen, the people think that they are duly It has enrolled; but Uhe two systems of collecting names are different. In the case of the States the police do the collecting, and the average person does not worry much about the matter, but is convinced that he is on the roll. In one part of my electorate 300 notices were issued recently asking the electors for reasons for their names not being on the roll. I understand that if the reasons given are good, only a nominal fine of 2s. 6d. is imposed. Out of the 300 persons involved, I think that all but two stated that they thought that the collecting of their names by the police officer meant that they would be on the Federal roll. Apart from the economy of a uniform roll, much confusion would be avoided, and many people saved from worry. Tho average elector does not wish to keep his name off the roll, but is confused by the varying systems adopted. Even i we do have a uniform roll, something ought to be done in the way of a uniform method of collecting the names. I hope it is true that South. Australia and Tasmania have consented to uniformity, and that the rest of the States will follow. We would then get a better expression of opinion at the ballot-box, and, altogether, conditions would he much improved for both Commonwealth and States.",40

The other question is that of a uniform electoral roll. As to the first .matter my right honourable colleague (Sir Joseph Cook) has already i formed honourable members that it is a matter which the House itself must decide; if the House is in favour of the suggestion, the Government will approve of it , and by placing an amount on the Supplementary Estimates pay it to the honourable member.",41

170,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Precisel y how we are to do this thing I do not know, but, speaking for myself and for the Treasurer, I would say, if I were asked, that the honourable membet for Ballarat has made out a primd facie case. The responsibility, however, must rest on the House-w e must have the authority of the House-and we shall give honourable members an opportunity of expressing their opinion before the session closes. We are all agreed, I think, as to the desirability of uniform electoral rolls; there is no question of party, or difference of opinion in that matter. I would only like to say that no blame attaches to the Commonwealth for this uniformit y not having been effected sooner. We have done everything in our power, and the Minister in charge of the  me that considerable progress has been made, more in some States than in others, towards the end in view.

I may be doing-them an injustice. If that is the case, I apologize to them. Uniform electoral rolls, however, are very desirable, and the Commonwealth,.

These are the total expenses, some of which have been paid, while .in the case of others only the accounts have been rendered. I think that is the whole of the information.

The information that one gets in regard to the Territory indicates that we have been inclined to pursue wrong lines in its administration. We are attempting to induce people to take up small settlements, which cannot be immediately profitable, whereas the policy indicated by the nature and the situation of the country is that we should, in the first place, encourage the pastoral industry, and give encouragement to prospecting, in the hope that some mining centres imay be discovered, which would help to attract population, and so make the smaller in dustries eventually successful. I hope before this session ends we may have from the Government a definite statement as to their intentions with regard to the future of the Territory. A strong man is needed .as Administrator to control it . He should be given very wide powers, and should be judged by the results he produces, instead of being continually interfered with by the Central Administration , which cannot have the intimate knowledge of the conditions existing in the north that the man on the spot, provided that he be the right man, must have.",41

On page S9 of the General Estimates there is a small but ominous item of nearly £1,000 for clearing the rifle range at Warwick of prickly pear. I imagine that an area of that sort would comprise from 300 to 500 acres. If it will cost £1.000 to clear such an area, only a very easy sum need be worked to show what it will cost to clear something like 20,000,000 acres of badly infested pear country in Queensland.

The State Governments of Queensland right through have proved themselves quite unable to cope with it.",42
178,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,Has any serious effort been made to cope with it?,42
179,Mr WIENHOLT,Unknown,"It is difficult to say what is and what is not a serious effort , but there is no royal road to clearing the country of the pest. It is not a mechanical question, but an economic one. Land can be easily cleared, but it is the cost of carrying out the work which has to be considered. The present Government of Queensland-and I do not speak in any party sense-doe s not believe in the principle of freehold, and.that is an additional difficulty in the way of the solution of the problem. I say quite openly that so far all our Governments in Queensland have proved themselves incapable of handling the question. To put it broadly, the complete eradication of prickly pear today is no longer practicable. We can abandon all ideas of eradication or of clearing the pear-infested country. We now have simply to consider what steps should be taken to prevent the further spread of the pest. It may be said that this is not a question for the Federal Parliament, but it will be admitted that if a fire breaks out in one of a row of houses, it becomes a very important matter for the occupiers of the remaining houses that that fire should bo promptly extinguished. The Commonwealth is now the direct proprietor of a very large area .with an extensive frontage to the Queensland border. W it h a clear understanding of the position, I do not hesitate to say that the pear is gradually eating up a very large portion of Queensland and becoming an absolute menace to the whole of Australia. I am convinced that sooner or later it will be forced upon us that this is a huge national danger, and we shall have to face it as a national question. ask the Government and the Committee to realise the danger, and I invite honourable members to consider 'whether we ought not now to prepare our minds for dealing with the subject, realizing that the prickly pear having become a national clanger, must he treated on national lines.",42
180,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,"Ballarat) [ 8 . 1 0 ] do not wish it to go out in connection with what has been said regarding the election for Ballarat that any reflection was made by Mr Justice Isaacs upon the permanent electoral officers of the division. He had some harsh things to say concerning certain officials, but as one of the candidates I desire to state that, so far as Mr son and the other permanent officials of the Department are concerned, no one could have carried out the work better than they did.  complimented .them. Mr M o GRATH - Yes ; ' I wish to make, that quite clear. Il should be glad if we could secure uniform rolls for State and Federal elections. In connection with the recent State elections, it struck me as peculiar that the - Commonwealth permanent officials for the Federal electorate of Ballarat had nothing to do, although they arc trained men, while others who knew very little about electoral matters were brought in to conduct the State elections. Much greater satisfaction would be given if we had uniform rolls, and the permanent officials of the Commonwealth Department conducted both the State ancl Federal elections. They understand the law, and know exactly how to compile rolls, and to conduct an election. The reflections which Mr Justice Isaacs cast upon electoral officials in connection with the first Ballarat election related to men employed only for the day, who were not familiar with the Electoral Act. tain persons whose names had been i m properly removed from the rolls claimed the right to vote; but the presiding officers, in certain cases, knowing nothing of section 121 of the Act, refused to allow 'them to do so. That was practically responsible for the trouble which occurred. I repeat that the Electoral Department, and particularly the chief of the Department in Ballarat, did their work in conI nexion with the Federal election there in a splendid manner. If we desire to have a thoroughly satisfactory set of rolls, we should take care to have fewer subdivisions than at present. The State electorate of Ballarat West consists of two subdivisions. If persons remove from one side of Sturtstreet to the other, they may still be in - I the same electorate, but in a different subdivision. Being unaware of the fact that they are in a different subdivision, they fail to get enrolled for it , and are either prosecuted for that failure, or find, when election time comes round, that they have no vote. The Department would be well-advised if it decided to . Anderhave only one division for each Sta'e electorate.  Home and Territories) [3.14] - It is due to the 'Committee that I should make a statement with regard to the Northern Territory. Exception was taken to the in terjection that I made, while an. honourable member was speaking on the subject, "" What would you suggest ?""",43
181,Mr RYAN,Unknown,"We will let the honourable gentleman off, so far as that matter is concerned.  it to be thought that I was treating the matter in a cavalier way. Reference was made to the number of officers employed in the Territory, ancl I may''say that I have been going very carefully into the whole question, with the object of making a reduction. Unfortunately, there are not many people in the Territory, but a number of Departments are necessary. If we did not maintain a certain number of officials there it would be necessary to drag the citizens of the Territory down to the other States for the redress of their grievances. No greater problem confronts the Minister for Home and T e r r i tories than the administration of this CerTerritory, where, I believe, we bave a wonderful asset if it is properly handled. In my opinion it can be developed, not by following the lines of closer settlement, but only by adopting the more primitive method of stocking with cattle and sheep, which has been applied successfully in other parts of Australia that are now carrying large populations. In pursuance of this policy Ave have been putting clown a number of bores east and Avest from the Wave Hill district towards CamooAveal, and boring should also be undertaken south towards the Macdonnell Ranges, The land is capable of growing excellent grasses and edible herbage, and produces a very fine class of stock, particularly in the central area. The doubt as to Avhether permanent water exists we are endeavouring to solve by means of these bores, and later on I propose to ask for the expenditure of a considerable sum of money in this direction. However, excellent results have been obtained so far. The average depth of the bores put doAvn is 170 feet to 200 feet, and Avater of a very high character has been tapped. In No. 1 bore water was struck at a depth of 247 feet, and rose 170 feet in the bore. Pumping yields 32,000 gallons per day Avithout reducing that level. In No . 2 bore water was struck 1 at a depth of 180 feet, and the bore is capable of producing 32,000 gallons a day. At another bore a pumping test for twelve hours gave 29,000 gallons. On one pastoral station a number of bores have been put doAvn, and an excellent supply of water Avas obtained at a very shallow depth, varying from 42 feet to a little over 60 feet. At one of these bores 500 head of cattle are Av'atered. My idea of developing the Northern Territory is to provide railway facilities in conjunction Will the policy of boring for water, not on every block, but in certain localities, in order to demonstrate that a permanent supply is obtainable. Where these facilities are provided I am satisfied a wonderful development Avill follow. The Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) is not so confident as I am about this, but when we realise that we have a Territory 900 miles long by-600 miles wide Ave can see that it is not a little proposition capable of being administered by one or tAvo men. The trouble is that all through, during the period of administration by the State of South Australia., and since the Commonwealth has taken over the Territory, Ave have been endeavouring to develop it from the Darwin end, which is the tropical portion 'of it. I do not think Ave sball succeed in any attempt to develop the Territory from the tropical end, but if it is. once bridged by a raihvay I am satisfied that thousands  of people will settle there. The worse enemy of the country is the man Avho has never seen the locality, the man Avho Would develop it from Bourke-street or King William-street; but here I have the testimony of a young fellow who went into the Macdonnell Ranges at seventeen years of age, and Avho, although not as well equipped as other men, through having a maimed foot, bas, according to a letter he has forwarded to me, made an unqualified success of his efforts to develop the pastoral industry in the Northern Territory. He commenced as a lad, earning 30s. a Aveek., gaining experience on stations, and after saving about £350 Avent to Western Australia, hoping to make his fortune there. Eventually he returned to the Macdonnell Ranges country, which is so much condemned by Melbourne newspapers and other critics. He writes as follows: I arrived back at Alice Springs about J u l ; , 1911, with £350 and a few horses. I then bought a fe-v cattle, and joined in a partnership on a small cattle ranch. After fighting the ordinary difficulties one has outback, and all the inconveniences one has to contend with in the bush, I am pleased to state that my success has been such as to enable me to invest the sum of £7,000 cash in a ranch in the same district, with the ultimate prospect of being able to pay off the £12,000 that represents the total cost There is room for thousands of people who are willing to work and put up with the rough conditions outback. There is an immense area of good stock country lying idle. This young man has the opinion that a great future awaits this portion of the Territory, but the attitude of some honourable members is like that of a man Avho takes up a property Will a limited capital, and refuses to spend any money on it. If Ave Avant to make anything out of the Northern Territory we must spend money on it. In the meantime Ave cannot do better than folloAv the course of putting doAvn bores, and demonstrating that permanent Avater is available. As soon as that is done young fellows, sons of pastoralists whose holdings are being cut up for closer settlement, and who are anxious to get out further back to continue their pastoral occupation, will be found going to. the Territory. There is every possibility of development on the primitive lines of settlement A\'hich have been so successfully applied in all the"" States. We shall not succeed by forcing closer settlement. Although. I have absolute f a it h in the future of the Northern Territory,, I admit ic is a very difficult question to handle. I have recently received a communication stating that the residents there are very much upset because a branch of this Legislature has refused to allow them to have representation in this Parliament.",43
182,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,Unknown,"¥ e might let them have a representative in this Chamber.  ther that could be done, but, at any rate, I think they ought to have representation in this Parliament.",45
183,Mr LAVELLE,Unknown,"It was your party the Senate which said that they should not.  forward in the Senate that the Terri tory should be represented by the senators of South Australia or Western Australia ; but that cannot be done under the Constitution. However, the matter will come up again. The honourable member for Barrier (Mr Considine) claims that my Department is keeping the wife of an Italian out of Australia because of a regulation which he says has been issued, stipulating that before she can enter the Commonwealth she must be able to read, write, or talk English. There is no such regulation in existence.",45
184,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"Batman) [3.30] The Committee should not too precipitately agree to the Home and Territories Estimates, because upon them' the question of immigration comes up for consideration, and it is one upon which much can, ancl should, be said. up with it is the settlement of the Northern Territory. I do not share the optimistic views of the Minister respecting the Territory, but I would not think of decrying it as a national asset, or of saying that it . is impossible to make it a productive white man's country. I agree with the Minister that it has to be populated, and from the south rather than from the north. It is idle, however, to suppose that we can populate it properly until there has been a very large increase in the population of the Commonwealth ' as a whole. No part of Australia is adequately populated yet, and we cannot, by artificial processes, populate the Northern Territory, and make it productive in advance of the development of more accessible areas. A short time ago the Prime Minister made a statement in this Chamber of the Government policy with respect to immigration. He told us the Minister for Repatriation (Senator Millen), who is now abroad on a mission, was to interest himself in London in the subject of i m migration, and that the Government proposed to appoint a Mr Barnes to act as emigration agent on the other side of the world. That appointment is obnoxious to every member of the Labour party, and to the great body of the community outside for which we speak. It is so obnoxious to the workers that the party will be justified-and indeed bound-to let organized in labour in Great Britain know that it should not rely on Mr Barnes as a spokesman for Australia in - the matter of im migration.",45
185,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"That is to say, in the prosecution of a vendetta against this man, you would destroy out scheme of immigration.",45
186,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"That is not so. The Minister for Repatriation is charged with the duty of looking into emigration on the other side of the world, and to that I offer no objection, because, though we differ in politics, I recognise that he holds his position as the result of the vote of the Australian people, and as a member of the Government, so that, apart from his personal qualifications, he is entitled to speak for a large section of the community. My objection to Mr Barnes is not personal, and not even political; it is based on the fact that he has neither the qualifications nor the capacity to speak Bound for Australia, and *hose whom the Labour party represent have no confidence in him. His public performances, utterances, and course of conduct are such that he has utterly forfeited, if he ever possessed, the confidence of that - class to which he will have to appeal in England to make his mission a success.' An emigration campaign is not to be won by an appeal to the personal friends of members of the Government, or to those in high places; the appeal must be made to the bone and sinew of the country fro m which emigrants are to be drawn-the workers of Great Britain and Ireland, and the workers of other countries-if it is intended to prosecute our immigration policy outside the British Dominions. The class of men we want here are those who are prepared to work on the land, and, after them, men who are prepared to work in the secondary industries. If the Government, as a reward for the political apostasy of a former member of the Labour party who has joined them, appoints Mr Barnes as their emigration agent at Home, their immigration scheme is foredoomed to failure. Nothing is more sensitive than the public min d regarding representations concerning the possibilities of a new country to which people are being invited to emigrate. When a person speaks as an emigration agent for Australia he should possess the full confidence of the people from whom he goes. This gentleman does not do that. He is in no sense an Australian, and his experience of this country has been very limited, both in time and in extent. Hi s political history marks him out as a man in whom the workers of Great Britain cannot have confidence. I hope that the vote for the Department of Home and Territories will not be passed u n t i l there has been more discussion of the immigration policy of the Government and of the proposed appointment of Mr Barnes.",45
